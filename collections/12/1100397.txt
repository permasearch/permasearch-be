The total number of sperm whales in the world is unknown, but is thought to be in the hundreds of thousands.[3]  The conservation outlook is brighter than for many other whales.  Commercial whaling has ceased,[3] and the species is protected almost worldwide, though records indicate that in the eleven-year period starting from 2000, Japan has caught 51 sperm whales. Fishermen do not target the creatures sperm whales eat,[3] but long-line fishing operations in the Gulf of Alaska have complained about sperm whales stealing fish from their lines.[146]
