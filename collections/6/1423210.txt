Constantine was a ruler of major importance, and he has always been a controversial figure.[9] The fluctuations in Constantine's reputation reflect the nature of the ancient sources for his reign. These are abundant and detailed,[10] but have been strongly influenced by the official propaganda of the period,[11] and are often one-sided.[12] There are no surviving histories or biographies dealing with Constantine's life and rule.[13] The nearest replacement is Eusebius's Vita Constantini, a work that is a mixture of eulogy and hagiography.[14] Written between 335 AD and circa 339 AD,[15] the Vita extols Constantine's moral and religious virtues.[16] The Vita creates a contentiously positive image of Constantine,[17] and modern historians have frequently challenged its reliability.[18] The fullest secular life of Constantine is the anonymous Origo Constantini.[19] A work of uncertain date,[20] the Origo focuses on military and political events, to the neglect of cultural and religious matters.[21]
