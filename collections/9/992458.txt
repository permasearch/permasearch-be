While Captain Jack Sparrow and Barbossa were held captive by the Spaniards, Lieutenant Commander Groves snuck through the Spanish picket lines (aided by a distraction Jack Sparrow made in a daring escape) and freed Barbossa from his bonds, although he lost his wig during the venture. He reached the Fountain of Youth with Barbossa and fought off Blackbeard's crew seeing his fellow officers and sailors being rapidly killed. The fight is stopped by the sudden arrival of the Spanish. Groves stood defiantly on top of the fountain claiming the Fountain to be property of the British Empire while holding a British flag. But at the same moment, the Spaniard shot Groves, although Groves's bravery was noted. When the Spanish began destroying the Fountain of Youth, Groves' body was being carried away by two British officers. Presumably, Groves's corps was laid to rest at sea or at tortuga by Barbossa's crew.
