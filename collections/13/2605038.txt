The first move was the Boston Braves, who relocated (for 1953) to Milwaukee, home of their top farm team, the Milwaukee Brewers. The City of Milwaukee fell in love with the Braves, with fan support of the team high making the move highly profitable. The Milwaukee Braves would remain popular until the team relocated to Atlanta in 1966.
