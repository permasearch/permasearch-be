Rats are known to burrow extensively, both in the wild and in captivity, if given access to a suitable substrate.[46] Rats generally begin a new burrow adjacent to an object or structure, as this provides a sturdy "roof" for the section of the burrow nearest to the ground's surface.[47] Burrows usually develop to eventually include multiple levels of tunnels, as well as a secondary entrance.[46] Older male rats will generally not burrow, while young males and females will burrow vigorously.[46][48]
