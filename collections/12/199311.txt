This season, the Have-Nots for the week were offered a temptation. On the wall of the Have-Not room, there were two available spikes. Inside one spike is a Have-Not Escape which would allow its holder to leave the Have-Not Room and become a Have for the week. However, the other held a Have-Not Extension, making the holder a Have-Not for an extra week. One Have-Not per week could go to the Diary Room to claim the key to unlock a spike.
