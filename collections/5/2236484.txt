The idea for the film came to Harrelson following a night out in Chinawhite, a club in Soho, in 2002.[4] He broke an ashtray in a London taxicab, which led to him being chased by police in a different taxicab, and spending a night in jail.[1][5] In the film, Harrelson, Wilson and Nelson play themselves in a story based on the real event, where Harrelson struggles to get home, while running into friends and members of a royal family.[6]
