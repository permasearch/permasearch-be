Chance was one of the 17 contestants in the VH1 reality show I Love Money, which features returning contestants from past VH1 reality shows such as Flavor of Love, I Love New York, and Rock of Love with Bret Michaels. The 17 competed in physical and mental challenges en route to a grand prize of $250,000. Chance was eliminated around the middle of the show, after failing at being a "team player" in several challenges and generally being high maintenance.[citation needed] Hoopz (Nicole Alexander) ultimately won I Love Money.[citation needed]
