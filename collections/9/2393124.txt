King Pandukabhaya, the founder and first ruler of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, fixed village boundaries in the country and established an administration system by appointing village headmen. He constructed hermitages, houses for the poor, cemeteries, and irrigation tanks.[10] He brought a large portion of the country under the control of the Anuradhapura Kingdom. However, it was not until the reign of Dutthagamani (161â€“137 BC) that the whole country was unified under the Anuradhapura Kingdom.[11] He defeated 32 rulers in different parts of the country before he killed Ellalan, the South Indian ruler who was occupying Anuradhapura, and ascended to the throne.[12] The chronicle Mahavamsa describes his reign with much praise, and devotes 11 chapters out of 37 for his reign.[13] He is described as both a warrior king and a devout Buddhist.[14] After unifying the country, he helped establish Buddhism on a firm and secure base, and built several monasteries and shrines including the Ruwanweli Seya[15] and Lovamahapaya.[16]
