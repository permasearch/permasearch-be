Near the end of the first season, it is referenced that after the events of the films, Ash would spend the next 33 years traveling down the country in his "Oldsmobile" and a mobile home (an "Airstream"), never staying long, going from stock-boy job to stock-boy job at different branches of the same hardware store. It is also mentioned that Ash tried numerous methods to destroy the Necronomicon.
