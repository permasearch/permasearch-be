Disruptive innovation is a term in the field of business administration which refers to an innovation that creates a new market and value network and eventually disrupts an existing market and value network, displacing established market leading firms, products, and alliances. [2] The term was defined and first analyzed by the American scholar Clayton M. Christensen and his collaborators beginning in 1995,[3] and has been called the most influential business idea of the early 21st century.[4]
