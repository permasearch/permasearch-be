Let      x  1   ,  x  2   , … ,  x  n     {\displaystyle x_{1},x_{2},\ldots ,x_{n}}   be orthogonal vectors in ℝn. Consider the n-dimensional simplex S with vertices     0 ,  x  1   , … ,  x  n     {\displaystyle 0,x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}}  . (Think of the (n − 1)-dimensional simplex with vertices      x  1   , … ,  x  n     {\displaystyle x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}}   not including the origin as the "hypotenuse" of S and the remaining (n − 1)-dimensional faces of S as its "legs".) Then the square of the volume of the hypotenuse of S is the sum of the squares of the volumes of the n legs.
