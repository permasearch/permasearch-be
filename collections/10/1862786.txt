Currently, the majority of UniMás' programming consists of telenovelas and series produced by Televisa (the majority of which originated on the company's flagship network in Mexico, Canal de las Estrellas), Caracol Televisión and RTI Colombia; several of the network's Televisa-sourced programs (including Casos de Família ("Family Cases") and El Chavo del 8) have also previously aired on parent network Univision, many having aired on that network years prior to being broadcast on UniMás. It also carries a moderate amount of first-run original programming produced by sister production unit Univision Studios, including the reality courtroom show Veredicto Final and sports magazine program Zona NBA.
