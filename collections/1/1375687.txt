HAZID performed a risk assessment calculation of the likelihood of a LNG spill. Taking into account precautions, training, regulations and technology changes over time HAZID calculates that the likelihood of an LNG spill is much less than 1 and 100,000 visits. Hazard Identification team members included marine classification engineers, naval architects, structural specialists, marine officers, risk analysts, and process, mechanical and safety engineers.[14] (Pitblado, 2004)
