Grand Prix motorcycle racing refers to the premier class of motorcycle racing events held on road circuits. Independent motorcycle racing events have been held since the start of the twentieth century[1] and large national events were often given the title Grand Prix,[2] The foundation of a recognised international governing body for motorcycle sport, the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme in 1949 provided the opportunity to coordinate rules and regulations in order that selected events could count towards official World Championship's as FIM Road Racing World Championship Grand Prix. It is the oldest established motorsport world championship.[3]
