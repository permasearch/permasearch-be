Indirect consumption includes the manufacture of fertilizers, pesticides, and farm machinery.[183] In particular, the production of nitrogen fertilizer can account for over half of agricultural energy usage.[187] Together, direct and indirect consumption by US farms accounts for about 2% of the nation's energy use. Direct and indirect energy consumption by U.S. farms peaked in 1979, and has since gradually declined.[183] Food systems encompass not just agriculture but off-farm processing, packaging, transporting, marketing, consumption, and disposal of food and food-related items. Agriculture accounts for less than one-fifth of food system energy use in the US.[188][185]
