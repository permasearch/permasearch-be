From late 19th century through early 20th century, under British colonial rule, poverty in India intensified, peaking in the 1920s.[13][14] Famines and diseases killed millions each time.[15][16] After India gained its independence in 1947, mass deaths from famines were prevented. Rapid economic growth since 1991, has led to sharp reductions in extreme poverties in India.[17][18] However, those above poverty line live a fragile economic life.[19]
