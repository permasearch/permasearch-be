Critics have sometimes struggled to define the immense public appreciation for the film.[83] In an interview, Freeman said, "About everywhere you go, people say, 'The Shawshank Redemption—greatest movie I ever saw'" and that such praise "Just comes out of them". Robbins said, "I swear to God, all over the world—all over the world—wherever I go, there are people who say, 'That movie changed my life' ".[9] In a separate interview, Stephen King said, "If that isn't the best [adaptation of my works], it's one of the two or three best, and certainly, in moviegoers' minds, it's probably the best because it generally rates at the top of these surveys they have of movies. ... I never expected anything to happen with it."[124] In a 2014 Variety article, Robbins claimed that South African politician Nelson Mandela told him about his love for the film,[9] while it has been cited as a source of inspiration by several sportsmen including Jonny Wilkinson (UK), Agustín Pichot (Argentina), Al Charron (Canada), and Dan Lyle (USA),[125] and Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York.[126] Gunton said he had encountered fans in Morocco, Australia, South America,[127] Germany, France, and Bora Bora.[36] Director Steven Spielberg said that the film was "a chewing-gum movie—if you step on it, it sticks to your shoe".[38]
