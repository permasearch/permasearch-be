McDonnell Douglas began Delta III development in the mid-90s as increasing satellite mass required more powerful launch vehicles.[5] Delta III, with its liquid hydrogen second stage and more powerful GEM 46 boosters, could bring twice as much mass as Delta II to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), but a string of two failures and one partial failure, along with the development of the much more powerful Delta IV, led to the cancellation of Delta III program.[8] The upgraded boosters would still find use on the Delta II, leading to the Delta II Heavy.
