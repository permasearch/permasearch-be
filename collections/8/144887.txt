In the US and Canada, it is the 27th highest-grossing film,[57] the highest-grossing 2003 film,[58] and the highest-grossing installment in The Lord of the Rings trilogy.[55] The film set an opening Wednesday record with $34.5 million.[59] This record was first surpassed by Spider-Man 2 and ranks as the seventh largest Wednesday opening.[60] The film opened a day earlier for a midnight showing and accounted for about $8 million. This was nearly twice the first-day total of The Fellowship of the Ring — which earned $18.2 million on its opening day in 2001 — as well as a significant increase over The Two Towers — which earned $26.1 million on its debut in 2002. Part of the grosses came from the Trilogy Tuesday event, in which the Extended Editions of the two previous films were played on 16 December before the first midnight screening. It went on to make an opening weekend of $72.6 million ($124.1 million with weekday previews).[61] Its Friday-Sunday opening weekend was a record-high for December (first surpassed by I Am Legend).[62] The film also set single-day records for Christmas Day and New Year's Day (both first surpassed by Meet the Fockers).[63][64]
