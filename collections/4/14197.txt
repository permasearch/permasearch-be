On April 13, 2010,[48] Intel Core i5 and Core i7 CPUs were introduced in the 15- and 17-inch models, while the 13-inch retained the Core 2 Duo with a speed increase.[48] The power brick was redesigned[35] and a high-resolution display (of 1,680 × 1,050) was announced as an option for the 15-inch models.[36] The 13-inch gained an integrated Nvidia GeForce 320M graphics processing unit (GPU) with 256 MB of shared memory, while the 15- and 17-inch models were upgraded to the GeForce GT 330M, with either 256 or 512 MB of dedicated memory.[48] The 15- and 17-inch models also have an integrated Intel GPU that is built into the Core i5 and i7 processors.[48] The 15-inch model also gained 0.1 pounds (0.045 kg).[36] Save for a third USB 2.0 slot, all the ports on the 17-inch MacBook Pro are the same in type and number as on the 15-inch version.[49] All models come with 4 GB of system memory that is upgradeable to 8 GB.[48] Battery life was also extended further in this update, to an estimated ten hours for the 13-inch and 8–9 hours on the 15- and 17-inch MacBook Pros.[48] This was achieved through both greater power efficiency and adding more battery capacity.[48] One reviewer reported about six hours of battery life through a continuous video battery stress test in the 15-inch[37] and another, who called the battery life "unbeatable", reported nearer to eight in the 13-inch through their "highly demanding battery drain test".[35]
