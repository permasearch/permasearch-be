"The Last Song I'll Write for You" is a mid-tempo rock ballad that draws on elements of both pop rock and alternative rock. Kevin Rutherford of Billboard described the song's style as "adult alternative."[1] Its lyrics describe a breakup and moving on from a relationship that is no longer healthy, which, given the timing of its release, has led critics to speculate that the song refers to Cook's split from his record label.[4][5] Cook, however, has dismissed this theory, explaining to Yahoo! Music that the ballad was inspired by "an ex from long, long, long ago."[5][6]
