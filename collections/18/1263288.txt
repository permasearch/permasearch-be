"Praxiteles in fact made two statues which he put up for sale together. One of them was draped, and because it was draped it was preferred by the people of Kos, who had first choice of the statues (which were offered at the same price). They thought this is the decent thing to do. But the statue they refused was taken instead by the people of Knidos, and it was this statue which became renowned. Later King Nicomedes [of Kos] tried to buy it from the Knidians, promising to discharge their enormous state debt. But the Knidians resolutely held on to their statue, and rightly so: for it was the work Praxiteles which make Knidos famous." (Natural HistoryÂ XXXVI.4.20-I)
