The first shutdown of 2018 began at midnight EST on January 20. On January 19, a bill failed to pass the Senate 50â€“49 with the majority of Democrats voting "no".[44] Five Republicans voted "no" and five Democrats voted "yes" in the Republican majority senate (60 votes were required for passage). Senate Democrats insisted that the issue of immigration, specifically the funding of DACA, be addressed in the budget. Republicans refused to include the issue, saying that the deadline for DACA and immigration was not until mid-March.[45][46] A stop-gap that would fund the government for four weeks passed the House of Representatives, and Republican Senator Mitch McConnell proposed a three-week stop-gap.[44] The government reopened on January 23.[47]
