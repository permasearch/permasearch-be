Current students and alumni at Texas A&M University, nicknamed Aggies after the school's agricultural roots,[2] are known for their loyalty and respect for their alma mater.[1] They cultivate "the Aggie Spirit" through "an almost religious devotion to the traditions" of the school, some over 100 years old.[3] As Texas Monthly noted, "Every Aggie is a self-appointed guardian of the Aggie spirit, eternally on the alert for signs of slippage."[1] To Aggies, Texas A&M is "not just a university but a...family,...defined and united by a unique culture."[4] The school song is titled The Spirit of Aggieland, and proclaims in its first verse that the "spirit can ne'er be told."[1]
