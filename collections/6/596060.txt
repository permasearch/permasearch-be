In October 2013, Snapchat introduced the "My Story" feature, which allows users to compile snaps into chronological storylines, accessible to all of their friends.[47][71] By June 2014, photo and video snaps presented to friends in the Stories functionality had surpassed person-to-person private snaps as the most frequently-used function of the service, with over one billion viewed per day â€” double the daily views tallied in April 2014.[72]
