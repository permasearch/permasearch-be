Stalin resorted to mass murder and wholesale deportation of farmers to Siberia in order to implement the plan. Millions who remained did not die of starvation, but the centuries-old system of farming was destroyed in a region so fertile it was once called "the breadbasket of Europe". The immediate effects of forced collectivization were reduced grain output and almost halved livestock numbers, thus creating major famines throughout the USSR during 1932 and 1933. In 1932–1933, an estimated 11 million people, 3–7 million in Ukraine alone,[7] died from famine after Stalin forced the peasants into collectives (Ukrainians call this famine Holodomor).[8] and thousands eyewitness accounts made by the survivors.[9] It was not until 1940 that agricultural production finally surpassed its pre-collectivization levels.[10][11]
