Maki's zanpakutō is called Nijigasumi (虹霞, literally "rainbow mist"). Its shikai form is activated by the command "shine brightly" (光華閃け, kōka hirameke) or "flash and burst" in the English Dub. When released, Nijigasumi glows with rainbow colors and has the ability to control light for various purposes. It can make Maki turn invisible or douse the area in light, playing havoc with opponents' counterattacks. It can also use light offensively, creating blades of light to cut or crush opponents. His zanpakutō later helps in Kariya's defeat, acting as a lightning rod for Kariya's attacks.
