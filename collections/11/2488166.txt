On 14 April 2015, it was revealed that EastEnders would be revisiting Vincent's backstory.[8] Following the character's permanent return to the square on 21 April, it transpired that he was the son and foster brother of established characters Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas) and Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond) respectively. Blackwood told Radio Times that the character will get darker as his time on the show progresses. "There's a lot more. Wait until you see some of the scenes coming up - they raise the hairs." He began. "The writers on EastEnders know what they're doing. They grab you and keep you watching. I've just spoken to them actually and they said, 'we've got a lot more you'. So the audience is in for some trouble!"[9] Speaking about the future of Vincent on the show, Blackwood said: "The thing about Vincent that I love is that he’s very human. He’s got a dark side, but he only acts that way with people who are in the same realm as him. So if you’re in the underworld, he’s very much like that. But if you’re an innocent person, then he won’t mess with you."[9]
