In business, "the duty of care addresses the attentiveness and prudence of managers in performing their decision-making and supervisory functions."[36] The "business judgment rule presumes that directors (and officers) carry out their functions in good faith, after sufficient investigation, and for acceptable reasons. Unless this presumption is overcome, courts abstain from second-guessing well-meaning business decisions even when they are flops. This is a risk that shareholders take when they make a corporate investment."[36]
