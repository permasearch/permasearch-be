Nikki is known for her rivalries with Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson), Jill Abbott (Jess Walton), Sharon Newman (Sharon Case) and Diane Jenkins (Maura West).[41] She fought with Diane over Victor for years as their bitter rivalry climaxed; she later killed Diane in self-defense in August 2011.[12] Scott didn't think Nikki should have been the killer in a whodunnit? storyline.[12] She stated, "Nikki has always hated Diane and because Maura is so good in the role, Nikki hates her even more now."[35] Sharon is Nikki's former daughter-in-law, having been married to her son Nicholas (Joshua Morrow) for over a decade. Nikki later became outraged when Sharon had a brief romance with Victor.[12] Luke Kerr of Zap2it said: "It’s always reassuring to know Nikki will usually jump to "blame Sharon" for just about everything. Based on their past, it’s not surprising, but it’s a comfort food type Y&R trope."[42] Nikki and Sharon even ended up in a physical fight in the Newman stables over Victor in 2012; Jillian Bowe, also of Zap2it, called it the "Newman Divas" face off, and said, "Victor's ladies go for blood. It boggles the mind these two sophisticated women are fighting over Victor's giblets and gravy."[43] Scott stated that she loved the Newman stables fight, saying: "Our director was very gracious, and was very loose and not rigid about blocking, and let us do our own choreography. So, if you look at it again, there are many elements of an I Love Lucy episode. Guess where that came from? But I couldn’t resist it. I had to do it! All the water and hair pulling and dunking in the bucket, that was all me, because that was "Lucy"!"[44]
