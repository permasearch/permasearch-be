Sister Peak (Comfortless Cove Hydrothermal Field, 4°48′S 12°22′W﻿ / ﻿4.800°S 12.367°W﻿ / -4.800; -12.367, elevation −2996 m), Shrimp Farm and Mephisto (Red Lion Hydrothermal Field, 4°48′S 12°23′W﻿ / ﻿4.800°S 12.383°W﻿ / -4.800; -12.383, elevation −3047 m), are three hydrothermal vents of the black smoker category, on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge near Ascension Island. They are presumed to have been active since an earthquake shook the region in 2002.[13][14][15][16][17] These vents have been observed to vent phase-separated, vapor-type fluids. In 2008, sustained exit temperatures of up to 407 °C were recorded at one of these vents, with a peak recorded temperature of up to 464 °C. These thermodynamic conditions exceed the critical point of seawater, and are the highest temperatures recorded to date from the seafloor. This is the first reported evidence for direct magmatic-hydrothermal interaction on a slow-spreading mid-ocean ridge.[13][14][15][16][17]
