The term "spiritual" is derived from "spiritual song", from the King James Bible's translation of Ephesians 5:19, which says, "Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord."[6] Slave Songs of the United States, the first major collection of African American spirituals, was published in 1867.[7]
