He left Newcastle for the second time on 18 August 1997 for Â£450,000, joining Bolton Wanderers, where he made 21 appearances but was unable to save them from being relegated from the Premier League just one season after promotion. He then went on loan to Manchester City, where he played six times in Division One.[1] This loan spell made Beardsley the only player to play for both top-flight teams in Liverpool and Manchester.[7][8]
