It has been recognized that the cytoarchitecture of pancreatic islets differs between species.[8][9][10] In particular, while rodent islets are characterized by a predominant proportion of insulin-producing beta cells in the core of the cluster and by scarce alpha, delta and PP cells in the periphery, human islets display alpha and beta cells in close relationship with each other throughout the cluster.[8][10]
