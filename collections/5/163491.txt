On July 19, 2014, McCole Bartusiak died in her apartment behind her parents' Houston home. Her mother told CNN and the Associated Press that Skye's boyfriend found the actress sitting up in her bed; Helen began CPR on her daughter before the arrival of paramedics, who then worked "for 45 minutes" to resuscitate. Her mother said Skye "had been healthy and did not drink or do drugs", but had recently been suffering from epileptic seizures; she believed that this fact had likely played a role in her daughter's death.[3][9] A memorial service was held in Houston six days later; her brother Stephen told mourners: "If you want to know what makes Skye happy, go out and plant a tree."[10]
