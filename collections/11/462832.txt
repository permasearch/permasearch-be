Onions may be grown from seed or from sets. Onion seeds are short-lived and fresh seeds germinate better.[46][48] The seeds are sown thinly in shallow drills, thinning the plants in stages. In suitable climates, certain cultivars can be sown in late summer and autumn to overwinter in the ground and produce early crops the following year.[16] Onion sets are produced by sowing seed thickly in early summer in poor soil and the small bulbs produced are harvested in the autumn. These bulbs are planted the following spring and grow into mature bulbs later in the year.[49] Certain cultivars are used for this purpose and these may not have such good storage characteristics as those grown directly from seed.[16]
