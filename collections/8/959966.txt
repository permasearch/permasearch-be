When both teams share Los Angeles Stadium at Hollywood Park beginning with the 2020 season, one team will either have to play in the 1:00Â p.m. ET time slot or in prime-time, while the other team plays at home, forcing the NFL to schedule both teams for multiple prime-time games, regardless of the teams' records from the previous season. (With the Raiders moving to Las Vegas in 2019, the extra night games they and the 49ers received as a result of sharing San Francisco Bay will likely go to the Rams and Chargers. However, stadium plans could affect a Raiders move still.)
