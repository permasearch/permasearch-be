The event was officially celebrated for the last time on November 25, 1916 with a march down Broadway for a flag raising ceremony by sixty members of the Old Guard.[75][76][77] The position of the flagstaff at this time was described as near Battery Park's sculptures of John Ericsson and Giovanni da Verrazzano.[78] The flagpole was included on a map of Battery Park in the WPA New York City Guide of 1939.[79] It was removed sometime in midcentrury. Later, City Council President Paul O'Dwyer expressed interest in a restored flagpole for the 1976 United States Bicentennial.[47] A bicentennial of Evacuation Day in 1983 featured the labor leader Harry Van Arsdale, Jr.[80] A commemorative plaque marking Evacuation Day was put on a flagpole at Bowling Green in 1996.[81]
