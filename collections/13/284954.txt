After the struggling in his drapery business in Ramelton, James decided to emigrate with his family to New Zealand as part of George Vesey Stewart's Katikati Special Settlement scheme.[6] In May 1878 the Gallaghers – minus the sick James Patrick who at eight weeks old was too weak to make the trip[b] – sailed from Belfast on the Lady Jocelyn for Katikati in the Bay of Plenty.[8][9] On arriving in New Zealand, the family altered their surname to "Gallaher" in an effort to reduce confusion over its spelling and pronunciation.[9]
