Retroactive Interference has also been investigated using pitch perception as the learning medium.[27] The researcher found that the presentation of subsequent stimuli in succession causes a decrease in recalled accuracy.[27] Massaro found that the presentation of successive auditory tones, confused perceptual short term memory, causing Retroactive Interference as the new tone inhibits the retrieval of previously heard tones.[27]
