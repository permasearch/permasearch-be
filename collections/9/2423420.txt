In Australia, the Big Bash League continued to be a success and led to more public interest in cricket, especially amongst families.[10] The Caribbean Premier League was created and had its first season in August 2013. Billed as the "ultimate cricket carnival", its major attraction was its unique party atmosphere and it was an immediate success with high attendance for all matches. Another attraction was the involvement of legends of West Indies cricket in coaching roles and Hollywood stars taking equity interests in the teams.[11] The Big Bash League introduced to the game the Zing wicket system, with LED lights on the stumps and bails that light up at almost the instant the wicket is broken, and the umpire cam, a camera attached to the caps worn by the umpires.[12][13] Both features were also used in the Caribbean Premier League.
