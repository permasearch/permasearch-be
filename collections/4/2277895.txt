Opened by comedians Noel Fielding and Julian Barratt of The Mighty Boosh in 2005,[36] Meet the Monkeys is a walk-through enclosure that houses a troop of 20 black-capped squirrel monkeys. The exhibit has no roof, and there are no boundaries between the monkeys and the visitors. It is the southernmost enclosure in the zoo.[37]
