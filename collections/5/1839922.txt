In the 2002 special "Gay", Serge, played by Josh Hamilton, makes his first and only appearance, when Edina and Patsy take a trip to New York City, where Edina plans to track down her son, who, she learns from her mother and Saffy, is gay; fulfilling her dream for her son from his ante-natal days when she blasted her womb with Donna Summer music. On their arrival in New York, Eddy and Patsy track down Serge to a New York bookstore and at first mistake his partner, a flamboyantly gay American named Martin, for Serge. Eddy is disappointed at first to find her son is actually a male version of Saffy; a rather reserved and bookish young man, who delights in the fact that he is gay and yet still boring, holding a job in New York's famous Strand Bookstore. However, she embraces her son, who finally reveals that he left because of his mother's overbearing attitude and because she burnt his beloved books due to a claimed allergy to books (Patsy says they did it because they were cold). After some tension, Serge agrees to accompany his mother around New York. Serge recognises Patsy as 'Pat' and has a flashback to when Patsy lived as a transsexual man, something that Saffy was never aware of until she visited Morocco. The episode ends with a flashback, showing that Eddy adopted Martin as her son in New York.
