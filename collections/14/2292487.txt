Elle, Pai Mei's last student, is responsible for his death. During a training session, Elle insults Pai Mei as a "miserable old fool". As punishment for her insolence, Pai Mei plucks out Elle's right eye, leading her to wear her signature eye patch. In retribution, Elle poisoned fish heads that Pai Mei eats. Before dying, Pai Mei calls her a treacherous dog for her actions, warning her that her day will come. His prediction comes true years later when Beatrix takes out Elle's left eye and leaves her in Budd's trailer, blind.
