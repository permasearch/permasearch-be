The Second Congo War, which began in 1998, was still raging when Kagame assumed the presidency in 2000. Namibia, Angola, Zimbabwe, and Chad had committed troops to the Congolese government side,[123] while Rwanda, Uganda, and Burundi were supporting rebel groups.[240] The rebel group Rally for Congolese Democracy (RCD) had split in 1999 into two factions: the RCD-Goma, supported by Rwanda, and the RCD-Kisangani, which was allied to Uganda.[241] Uganda also supported the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo (MLC), a rebel group from the north.[241] All these rebel groups were at war with Kabila's government in Kinshasa, but were also increasingly hostile to each other.[241] Various peace meetings had been held, culminating in the July 1999 Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement which was signed by Kabila, Kagame and all the other foreign governments.[242] The rebel groups were not party to the agreement, and fighting continued.[242] The RPA continued to be heavily involved in the Congo War during 2000, fighting battles against the Ugandan army in Kisangani and against Kabila's army in Kasai and Katanga.[243][244]
