Detroit has a long and rich history associated with rock and roll.  In 1954 Hank Ballard & the Midnighters crossed over from the R&B charts to the pop charts with "Work With Me, Annie". The song nearly broke into the elite top 20 despite being barred from airplay on many stations due to its suggestive lyrics.  In 1955, Detroit-native Bill Haley ushered in the rock and roll era with the release of "Rock Around The Clock".[20]
