In response to Microsoft's acquisition of Mojang and their Minecraft IP, various developers announced even further clone titles that were being developed specifically for Nintendo's consoles, as they were the only major platforms to not officially receive Minecraft at the time.[260] These clone titles include UCraft (Nexis Games),[261] Cube Life: Island Survival (Cypronia),[262] Discovery (noowanda),[263] Battleminer (Wobbly Tooth Games),[264] Cube Creator 3D (Big John Games),[265] and Stone Shire (Finger Gun Games).[266] Despite this the fears were unfounded with official Minecraft releases on Nintendo consoles eventually resuming.[267][155][12]
