Moreover, the subscripts and superscripts could have been left off in the third, fourth, and fifth notations, if the indexing set was understood to be the natural numbers. Note that in the second and third bullets, there is a well-defined sequence     (  a  k    )  k = 1   âˆž     {\displaystyle (a_{k})_{k=1}^{\infty }}  , but it is not the same as the sequence denoted by the expression.
