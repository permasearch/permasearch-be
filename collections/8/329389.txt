Flexibility can be simply defined as the available range of motion (ROM) provided by a specific joint or group of joints.[32] For the most part, exercises that increase flexibility are performed with intentions to boost overall muscle length, reduce the risks of injury and to potentially improve muscular performance in physical activity.[33] Stretching muscles after engagement in any physical activity can improve muscular strength, increase flexibility, and reduce muscle soreness.[34] If limited movement is present within a joint, the “insufficient extensibility” of the muscle, or muscle group, could be restricting the activity of the affected joint.[35]
