Born on 23 December 1682 in Fittysmire, Aberdeen,[3] Scotland, a younger son of a Patrick Gibbs merchant and his second wife Ann née Gordon, the family was Roman Catholic; there was a half-brother William from the first marriage to Isabel née Farquhar.[4] He was educated at Aberdeen Grammar School and Marischal College.[5] After the death of his parents he went in 1700 to stay with relatives in Holland.[5] He later travelled through Europe, visiting Flanders, France, Switzerland and Germany. Some time after he left for Rome travelling via France. On 12 October 1703 he registered as a student at The Scots College.[6] He would have been studying for the Catholic priesthood but had second thoughts.[6] By the end of 1704 he was studying architecture under Carlo Fontana;[7] he was also taught by Pietro Francesco Garroli, professor of perspective at the Accademia di San Luca.[8] While in Rome Gibbs met John Perceval, 1st Earl of Egmont who attempted to persuade him to move to Ireland.[8] He moved to London in November 1708;[8] his return to Britain was probably due to the terminal illness of his half-brother William, who died before James reached Britain.[9]
