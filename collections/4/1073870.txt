A section of an orchestral version of the Beatles song "Ticket to Ride" can be heard faintly at the very end of the recording. That was unintended: the music was playing in the background at Abbey Road when Gerry O'Driscoll was being recorded.[8] This is not included on the 1983 Japanese Black Triangle CD issue of the album or any FLAC remastered versions of the album; the sound technicians copied one of the heartbeat samples, removed the orchestral "Ticket to Ride", repeatedly pasted the sample in and faded out the new outro.
