At an art exhibition inside an unfinished drainage tunnel system off of Pogue's Run (that Pickett's company was responsible for), Aza and Daisy go exploring on their own, where they finally solve the mystery and realize that Pickett had run to the very place they were. After noticing a bad smell emanating from the area, they suspect that the billionaire had already died. Aza tells Davis of their discovery. He places an anonymous tip to the police, who find the body.
