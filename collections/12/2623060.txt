Angelou recorded two albums of poetry and songs she wrote during her career as a night club performer; the first in 1957 for Liberty Records and the second The Poetry of Maya Angelou, for GWP Records the year before the publication of her first autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969). They were later incorporated into her volumes of poetry, including Diiie, which was published the year after Caged Bird became a best-seller. Diiie also became a best-seller, and was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.[4][7] Despite thinking of herself a playwright and poet when her editor Robert Loomis challenged her to write Caged Bird,[8] she has been best known for her autobiographies.[9] Many of Angelou's readers identify her as a poet first and an autobiographer second,[9] yet like Lynn Z. Bloom, many critics consider her autobiographies more important than her poetry.[2] Critic William Sylvester agrees, and states that although her books have been best-sellers, her poetry has not been perceived as seriously her prose.[1] Bloom also believes that Angelou's poetry is more interesting when she recites them. Bloom considers her performances dynamic, and says that Angelou "moves exuberantly, vigorously to reinforce the rhythms of the lines, the tone of the words. Her singing and dancing and electrifying stage presence transcend the predictable words and phrases".[2]
