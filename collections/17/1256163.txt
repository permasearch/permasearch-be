Caribou across North America range in size. In the farthest west, Alaskan caribou females usually measure 162–205 cm (5.31–6.73 ft) in length and weigh 80–120 kg (180–260 lb).[53] The males (or "bulls") are typically larger (although the extent to which varies in the different subspecies), measuring 180–214 cm (71–84 in) in length and usually weighing 159–182 kg (351–401 lb),[53] though exceptionally large males have weighed as much as 318 kg (701 lb).[53] Shoulder height typically measure from 85 to 150 cm (2.79 to 4.92 ft), and the tail is 14 to 20 cm (0.46 to 0.66 ft) long.
