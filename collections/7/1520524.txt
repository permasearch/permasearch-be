The official music video for this single was directed by Dave Meyers and starts out with Iglesias and a bunch of friends (played by Iglesias' real life friends including Gerardo Mej√≠a) stopping at a road side store. While messing around in the store Iglesias makes eye contact with the shy girl working the counter, his love interest in the video (played by Shannon Elizabeth). When the group leaves the store, Iglesias drives their jeep while the others perform various stunts including car surfing and interacting with young women in another jeep riding beside them.
