An all-new engine designed by AUDI AGs high-performance subsidiary quattro GmbH, harking back to the original turbocharged five cylinder Audi engines in the "Ur-" Audi Quattro of the 1980s. A world first for a petrol engine, its cylinder block is constructed from compacted vermicular graphite cast iron (GJV/CGI) - first used in Audi's large displacement, high-performance Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) diesel engines.
