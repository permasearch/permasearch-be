While glial cells in the PNS frequently assist in regeneration of lost neural functioning, loss of neurons in the CNS does not result in a similar reaction from neuroglia.[13] In the CNS, regrowth will only happen if the trauma was mild, and not severe.[35] When severe trauma presents itself, the survival of the remaining neurons becomes the optimal solution. However, some studies investigating the role of glial cells in Alzheimer's Disease are beginning to contradict the usefulness of this feature, and even claim it can "exacerbate" the disease.[36] In addition to impacting the potential repair of neurons in Alzheimer's Disease, scarring and inflammation from glial cells have been further implicated in the degeneration of neurons caused by Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[37]
