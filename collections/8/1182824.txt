Originally invented for hearing aids, balanced armature drivers are nowadays used extensively in modern in-ear monitors.[3][4][5] In-ear monitors can function with as little as one armature driver but some of the top models of in-ear monitors can carry as many as 18 balanced armature drivers for faster response, higher dynamic range, and more detailed sound. Notable examples include JH Audio’s Layla  (12 balanced armature drivers), Noble Audio's K10U (10 balanced armature drivers), and 64 Audio's A18t (18 balanced armature drivers).
