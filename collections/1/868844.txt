The primate lineage is thought to go back at least 65 million years ago (mya),[35] even though the oldest known primates from the fossil record date to the Late Paleocene of Africa (Altiatlasius)[36] or the Paleocene-Eocene transition in the northern continents, c. 55 mya (Cantius, Donrussellia, Altanius, and Teilhardina).[37] Other studies, including molecular clock studies, have estimated the origin of the primate branch to have been in the mid-Cretaceous period, around 85 mya.[38][39][40]
