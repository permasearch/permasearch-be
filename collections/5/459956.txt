After almost two years of practicing and performing locally in the Los Angeles area, the band was approached by record companies,[3] and eventually signed a record deal with Zoo Entertainment.[6] In March 1992, Zoo published the band's first effort, Opiate. Described by the band as "slam and bang" heavy music[9] and the "hardest sounding" six songs they had written to that point,[10] the EP included the singles "Hush" and "Opiate". The band's first music video, "Hush", promoted their dissenting views about the then-prominent Parents Music Resource Center and its advocacy of the censorship of music. The video featured the band members naked with their genitalia covered by parental advisory stickers and their mouths covered by duct tape.[11] The band began touring with Rollins Band, Fishbone, and Rage Against the Machine[12] to positive responses, which Janiss Garza of RIP Magazine summarized in September 1992 as a "buzz" and "a strong start".[13]
