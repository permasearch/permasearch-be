Jon's annoying twin girl cousins or nieces, they themselves aren't sure, who love to dress and give makeovers to animals particularly Garfield. Garfield and Odie once used the outfits they provided in order to track down thieves who took spare ribs. When Nermal kidnaps Pooky to blackmail the orange tabby into becoming a servant, Garfield summons Drusilla and Minerva to mess with Nermal. In one of their most recent appearances, it is revealed that they can't tell each other apart. They are voiced by Laura Summer.
