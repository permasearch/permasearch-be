The Wyandot were the final tribe to leave the state in 1843, having apparently waited until the resolution of the Texas Revolution. They moved to Missouri and largely began breaking down and merging with American society, although some did eventually end up in Indian Territory, and others were granted a permanent reservation in Missouri. Those who broke away attempted to aid in the founding of the Nebraska and Kansas Territories, hoping to create more havens for displaced Native peoples. While this was not successful, there are still many descendants of these peoples today.[56]
