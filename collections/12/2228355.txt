Many cardiologists[who?] believe oral nicotine products contribute to the potentiation of sympathetic nerve tone, and may aggravate hypertension due to the effects of nicotine on cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission. At higher doses, tachycardia, reflex bradycardia, arrhythmia or even cardiac arrest can occur in some individuals.[citation needed] Further studies are needed in this regard.[20] Individual studies have indicated snus is correlated with death from heart attack and with heart failure,[21] though they have been criticized for failing to account for alcohol use which is both harmful to cardiovascular health and is higher among snus users.
