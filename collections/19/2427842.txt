The food industry has a large influence on consumerism. Organizations, such as The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), have been criticized for accepting monetary donations from companies within the food industry, such as Coca-Cola.[7] These donations have been criticized for creating a conflict of interest and favoring an interest such as financial gains.[7]
