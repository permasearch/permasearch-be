Xemnas returns as one of the main antagonists for Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance. Xemnas takes advantage of the Sleeping Worlds to mess with Sora by using the youth's many connected hearts. In a Sleeping World version of the World That Never Was, Sora defeats Xemnas. It is also revealed that Xehanort's back-up actions included Xemnas forming Organization XIII to serve as vessels for Xehanort's heart to achieve a perfect recreation of the Ï‡-blade.
