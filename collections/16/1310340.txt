Rugby union – almost universally referred to as rugby in New Zealand – was introduced to New Zealand by Charles Monro in 1870;[4] Monro discovered the sport while completing his studies at Christ's College, Finchley, England.[5] The first recorded game in New Zealand took place in May 1870 in Nelson between the Nelson club and Nelson College.[6] The first provincial union, the Canterbury Rugby Football Union, was formed in 1879,[7] and in 1882 New Zealand's first internationals were played when New South Wales (NSW) toured the country.[8] NSW did not face a New Zealand representative team but played seven provincial sides – the tourists won four games and lost three.[9] Two years later the first New Zealand team to travel overseas toured New South Wales; where New Zealand won all eight of their games.[10]
