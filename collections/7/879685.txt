Diamonds are extremely rare, with concentrations of at most parts per billion in source rock.[12] Before the 20th century, most diamonds were found in alluvial deposits. Loose diamonds are also found along existing and ancient shorelines, where they tend to accumulate because of their size and density.[13]:149 Rarely, they have been found in glacial till (notably in Wisconsin and Indiana), but these deposits are not of commercial quality.[13]:19 These types of deposit were derived from localized igneous intrusions through weathering and transport by wind or water.[14]
