Axolotls are members of the tiger salamander, or Ambystoma tigrinum species complex, along with all other Mexican species of Ambystoma. Their habitat is like that of most neotenic speciesâ€”a high altitude body of water surrounded by a risky terrestrial environment. These conditions are thought to favor neoteny. However, a terrestrial population of Mexican tiger salamanders occupies and breeds in the axolotl's habitat.[citation needed]
