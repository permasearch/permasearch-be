Pedanius Dioscorides (c. 40â€“90 CE), was a Greek botanist, pharmacologist and physician who practised in Rome during the reign of Nero. He became a famous army doctor. Dioscorides wrote a 5-volume encyclopedia, De Materia Medica, which listed over 600 herbal cures, forming an influential and long-lasting pharmacopoeia. De Materia Medica was used extensively by doctors for the following 1500 years.[12]
