Since 2014, the Texas Highway Patrol has participated in Operation Strong Safety, a program intended to increase law enforcement along the Texas-Mexico border. The patrol's role in Operation Strong Safety (OSS) is to deploy large numbers of troopers to the border in order to add an increased deterrent to drug traffickers and human smugglers. The plan calls for troopers from across the state to serve approximately one week each patrolling border counties, particularly in South Texas; deployments rotate constantly to maintain a steady presence along the border. OSS is the successor to previous similar efforts, such as Operation Border Star, and was approved by the Texas Legislature with an $800 million price tag.
