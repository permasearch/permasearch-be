The hypothesized role of a protein as an infectious agent stands in contrast to all other known infectious agents such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites, all of which contain nucleic acids (DNA, RNA, or both). Synthetic prions, created in the laboratory independent of any biological source, have little or no ability to cause infection with TSEs. However, when synthetic prions are administered in combination with cofactors, such as phosphatidylethanolamine and RNA molecules, then this can transmit TSEs.[10]
