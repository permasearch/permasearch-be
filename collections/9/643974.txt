"Cry (Just a Little)" is a song by Dutch dance duo Bingo Players. The song's only lyrics are the repetition of "I know I'm caught up in the middle; I cry just a little when I think of letting go. Oh no, gave up on the riddle; I cry just a little when I think of letting go." They were originally in "Piano in the Dark", a 1988 hit song by Brenda Russell.[1] For this song, the line was performed by Kelli-Leigh (vocals) along with Hal Ritson (back vocals).
