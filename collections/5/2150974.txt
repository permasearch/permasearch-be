Penn State's first possession was cut short as a Christian Hackenberg pass was intercepted in the end zone by MSU DB Arjen Colquhoun. Connor Cook and the Spartan offense would take advantage of the turnover, scoring on a 9 play, 80 yard drive which ended with a R.J. Shelton 29 yard touchdown reception, giving Michigan State an early touchdown lead. Michael Geiger would miss the extra point, only the 4th missed extra point attempt of his career. Neither team would score the remainder of the quarter. In the 2nd quarter, Penn State would score a field goal after being stopped at the MSU 1 yard line on 2nd and 3rd down, pulling them within 3. On the next Penn State possession, the Spartan defense would give the offense favorable field position after a Malik McDowell sack of Christian Hackenberg on 3rd and 7 with just over 10 minutes left in the half resulted in a loss of 10 yards, causing Penn State to punt from their own 5 yard line. 6 plays later, Gerald Holmes would score a touchdown on a 6-yard run, giving Michigan State a 13-6 lead with 7 minutes remaining in the half. The next Penn State possession ended in disaster for the Nittany Lions after Kyle Carter fumbled on a 10-yard reception that would have given Penn State a 1st down at the MSU 23 yard line. Instead, Demetrious Cox would scoop up the fumble and return it 77 yards for a touchdown, giving Michigan State a 20-3 lead late in the first half. Penn State would recover with a 10 play, 67 yard touchdown drive, capped off by a Chris Godwin 8 yard touchdown reception, cutting the lead to 20-10 at halftime.
