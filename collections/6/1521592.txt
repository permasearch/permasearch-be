As a side information it might be noted that, because the BIOS transfers control directly to the MBR program, and because the program runs in real mode, the MBR can - in theory - do anything, including loading other programs or data from any device, interacting with the user, reconfiguring and/or controlling peripherals, reading or writing to any disks in any amount, or even overwriting and destroying the BIOS data block. If neither the MBR nor any other program that the MBR starts calls the BIOS afterward, then even this last action is legitimate. The MBR program receives total control of the machine, without restriction.
