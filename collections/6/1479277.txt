In the strange underground work (a mix of avant-garde black militancy and pornography) by Steven Cannon, Groove, Bang and Jive Around (1969, rptd. Therion,1998), protagonist Annette "was born with a caul over her face" (p. 111). Though it remains open to interpretation in the story, there is a suggestion that this birth may have ties to her privileged status in a New Orleans voodoo lineage (she's a blood relation of Doctor John and Marie Laveau): "...you were born with a caul over your face. But lots of 'um is born that way, don't make 'um any better than the rest. But you been blessed. I saw to that myself... Blessed you are with the power to see behind the mask, the invisibles, into the future..." (215).
