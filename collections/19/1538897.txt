The A380 uses four 150Â kVA variable-frequency electrical generators,[195] eliminating constant-speed drives and improving reliability.[196] The A380 uses aluminium power cables instead of copper for weight reduction. The electrical power system is fully computerised and many contactors and breakers have been replaced by solid-state devices for better performance and increased reliability.[190]
