In the 1950s, the Bank of Scotland was involved in several mergers and acquisitions with different banks. In 1955, the Bank merged with the Union Bank of Scotland.[8] The Bank also expanded into consumer credit with the purchase of Chester based, North West Securities (now Capital Bank).[9] In 1971, the Bank agreed to merge with the British Linen Bank,[9] owned by Barclays Bank. The merger saw Barclays Bank acquire a 35% stake in the Bank of Scotland, a stake it retained until the 1990s. The merchant banking division of the Bank of Scotland was relaunched as British Linen Bank (now known as HBOS Treasury Services).
