Eidos's German branch and the KMF agency handled marketing for Lara Croft.[92] Eidos marketing manager David Burton oversaw marketing efforts, which attempted to portray the character as attractive and pleasant. However, interaction with the press, especially those in Europe, resulted in less clothing depicted in promotional images.[12] Concerned with diluting Croft's personality, Eidos avoided products it felt did not fit the character.[92] Ian Livingstone, Eidos's product acquisition director, commented that the company declines most merchandising proposals. He stated that Eidos primarily focused on game development and viewed such promotion outside video games as exposure for the character.[93] Following Square Enix's acquisition, Eidos's marketing duties were transferred to the Square Enix Europe subsidiary.[85][86] As part of the second reboot, Crystal Dynamics planned to align all products, promotions, and media ventures with its new version of the character.[89]
