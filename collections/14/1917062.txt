The character has been mostly well received by television critics. Amy Semigran of MTV commented, "Turns out their strategy, as well as Sam's crush on singing partner Quinn Fabray, worked. Despite some mixed signals and apprehension on Quinn's part, the two turned out a cute little rendition of Jason Mraz and Colbie Caillat's 'Lucky'."[1] Overstreet has said that he takes pieces of himself and puts it into his character. Glee's writers have incorporated aspects of Overstreet's personality and mannerisms into his character, such as his impersonations and Nashville background. As a member of the glee club, Sam regularly sings on the show, and has performed a number of solos and duets. In the final season, Sam is the assistant coach of the football team along with helping out with the Glee club. In the final episode, Sam becomes the director of New Directions after Will Schuester is named the principal of McKinley High.
