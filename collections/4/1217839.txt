By 1855, according to New York Police Commissioner George W. Matsell (1811â€“1877),[94] almost 17 percent of the police department's officers were Irish-born (compared to 28.2 percent of the city) in a report to the Board of Aldermen;[95] of the NYPD's 1,149 men, Irish-born officers made up 304 of 431 foreign-born policemen.[25] In the 1860s more than half of those arrested in New York City were Irish born or of Irish descent but nearly half of the city's law enforcement officers were also Irish. By the turn of the 20th century, five out of six NYPD officers were Irish born or of Irish descent. As late as the 1960s, 42% of the NYPD were Irish Americans.[96]
