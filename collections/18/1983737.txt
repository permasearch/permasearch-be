In 2018 the MS Symphony of the Seas made its maiden voyage, performing Hairspray. The show is performed in one act, restoring "(The Legend of) Miss Baltimore Crabs" but like the Las Vegas version omitting "The Big Dollhouse", "Velma's Revenge", "Good Morning Baltimore (Reprise)", and "Cooties". The second verse of "It Takes Two" was also omitted.
