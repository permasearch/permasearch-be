Initially, Fujita began posting the manga on Pixiv (a Japanese online community for artists) as a rookie author.[3] Ichijinsha then launched a digital manga magazine with Pixiv titled Comic Pool, and started serializing the manga on a regular basis.[4][5] The manga was selected for Comic Pool because it was the most popular work on Pixiv.[6] On April 30, 2015 Ichijinsha started the publishing of the manga in print.[7]
