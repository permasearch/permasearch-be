Back at camp, Elisabeth cried after feeling sick and emotionally broken down. They lost another hook thanks to a turtle. Probst showed up with a can of rice. He said he was very concerned about the lack of energy around camp, especially with Elisabeth and Nick. Probst offered them enough rice to last them for the rest of their time and 25 hooks but asked for something of substantial value in return - the tarp and Colbyâ€™s Texas flag. They agreed and tore it down and started to rebuild their camp.
