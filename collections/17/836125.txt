Several weeks before the series was to debut, the episode "The Sign Post" was made in which Tommy made his debut. Margaret, who appeared in two episodes that were made before, but aired after, also appeared along with Joey. After the pilot aired as the first episode, "The Sign Post" aired and after that "Fishing Trip", the second episode, aired. After that, newly made episodes aired mixed in with the initial batch made earlier in 1959, which explains why "Dennis Runs Away", which was the fourth or fifth episode was run later in the first run, and shows an obviously younger Dennis as in the earlier episodes. Also, the episode "Dennis and The Rare Coin" was aired before "Dennis Runs Away" but aired after. On both episodes, Dennis is at the police station. On "Dennis and The Rare Coin" where Dennis is given milk he states "last time I came here I got ice cream", referring to the episode "Dennis Runs Away" where he got an ice cream cone at the police station, which was made before but aired after. Joey was gradually phased out in season one. Dennis's friend Stewart appeared in only a few episodes in the first season and was played by Ron Howard (who soon after became Opie Taylor on The Andy Griffith Show).
