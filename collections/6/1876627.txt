Annie Lennox, lead singer of the Eurythmics claimed that the "X Factor is a specific thing for people that want to go through that process, it's a factory, you know, and it's owned and stitched-up by puppet masters. Just the year earlier, she claimed that reality shows were dangerous and cruel and said there was no chance she would be ever a judge on their panels". Whilst Paul Weller, former frontman of The Jam said that there would be no way he would ever appear as a mentor on shows like The X Factor. Pink Floyd guitarist/vocalist David Gilmour has also criticized the show, calling it "ghastly" and criticising it for its lack of hard work and creativity.[79] A similar opinion was shared by Suggs, frontman of Madness, who said that The X Factor has filled the charts with people who do not really understand what it means to be an artist and that it leaves less room for people trying to work their up organically.[citation needed]
