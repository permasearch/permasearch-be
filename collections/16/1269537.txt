Nico's suggestion that Percy take on the curse of Achilles and his work to convince Hades to fight in The Last Olympian are crucial to the Olympians' success, and earn him a short bout of fame. He was also privy to the fact that there were two camps, one Greek and one Roman, before The Lost Hero, which makes him an important liaison between the two groups in the latter series. He brings Hazel Levesque, daughter of Pluto and his half-sister, back from the dead and established her at Camp Jupiter. Between The Son of Neptune and The Mark of Athena, Nico travels through Tartarus to find the monstrous side of the Doors of Death, an experience which leaves him haunted and weak. In The Blood of Olympus, he nearly dies several times while "shadow-traveling", which involves melting into shadows and transporting himself to different places.
