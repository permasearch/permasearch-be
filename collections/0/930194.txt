Prayer services begin with the Kol Nidrei prayer, which is recited before sunset. Kol Nidre is a prayer that dates back to 9th century Palestine. It is recited in a dramatic manner, before the open ark, using a melody that dates back to the 16th century.[16] Then the service continues with the evening prayers (Ma'ariv or Arvit) and an extended Selichot service.
