As the Investigation Team and Shadow Operatives converge and prepare to leave, the true mastermind behind the events prior to the tournament takes control of Labrys to attack everyone.[47] The mastermind reveals it has been working with the entity by imitating the Persona users' shadows in order to weaken them mentally so that their Personas would revert to shadows.
