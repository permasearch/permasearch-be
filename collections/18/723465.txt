where s is the constant width. One method for deriving this area formula is to partition the Reuleaux triangle into an inner equilateral triangle and three curvilinear regions between this inner triangle and the arcs forming the Reuleaux triangle, and then add the areas of these four sets. At the other extreme, the curve of constant width that has the maximum possible area is a circular disk, which has area     π  s  2    /  4 ≈ 0.78540  s  2     {\displaystyle \pi s^{2}/4\approx 0.78540s^{2}}  .[14]
