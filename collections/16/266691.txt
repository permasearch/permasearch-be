Although the production team received requests, the show declined to use celebrity guests for cameo roles in the 2008 Christmas special.[6] However, both Noel Sullivan and John Prescott made brief cameo appearances at the end of the final series.[7] Both figures had formed the basis of long-running jokes throughout the series. Nessa occasionally refers to Sullivan as her housemate; a member of the band she initially lives with. Nessa had also claimed to have had an affair with Prescott.
