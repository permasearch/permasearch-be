There are around 14 million camels alive as of 2010[update], with 90% being dromedaries.[133] Dromedaries alive today are domesticated animals (mostly living in the Horn of Africa, the Sahel, Maghreb, Middle East and South Asia). The Horn region alone has the largest concentration of camels in the world,[21] where the dromedaries constitute an important part of local nomadic life. They provide nomadic people in Somalia (which has the largest camel herd in the world)[15] and Ethiopia with milk, food, and transportation.[108][134][135][136]
