Contestants can win prize money ranging from between 1p and £250,000, and potentially £500,000 (after changes made in 2014). The game is played using twenty-two sealed red boxes, each with an identifying number from 1 to 22 displayed on the front. Inside each box is a sum of money. All the boxes are sealed by an independent adjudicator; the value inside each box is not known to anyone except the adjudicator.
