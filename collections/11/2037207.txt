Both versions of "Right Here" have music videos. The video to the original song begins with Coko discussing a man she likes to Taj and Lelee. It features the singers having flashbacks to boys they liked as young girls, then is brought to the present day with the women and their boyfriends. In between, the girls goof off together in a large, mirrored room. "Right Here" was the first of their videos to showcase the group's dancing skills.
