Morgan also features as an immortal ruler of a fantastic Avalon, sometimes alongside the still alive Arthur, in some subsequent and otherwise non-Arthurian chivalric romances such as Tirant lo Blanch,[22] as well as the tales of Huon of Bordeaux,[23] where Oberon is a son of either Morgan by name or "the Lady of the Secret Isle",[24] and Ogier the Dane,[25] where Avalon can be a "castle".[26] In his La Faula, Guillem de Torroella claims to have visited the Enchanted Island (Illa Encantada) and met Arthur who has been brought back to life by Morgan and they both of them are now forever young, sustained by the Holy Grail.[27] In the chanson de geste La Bataille Loquifer, Morgan and her sister Marsion (Marrion) bring the hero Renoart to Avalon, where Arthur now prepares his return alongside Morgan, Gawain, Ywain, Percival and Guinevere.[28][29] Such stories take place centuries after the times of King Arthur.
