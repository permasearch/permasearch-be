The Summa is Aquinas' "most perfect work, the fruit of his mature years, in which the thought of his whole life is condensed".[2] Among non-scholars, the Summa is perhaps most famous for its five arguments for the existence of God, which are known as the "five ways" (Latin: quinque viae). The five ways, however, occupy under two pages of the Summa's approximately 3,500 pages.
