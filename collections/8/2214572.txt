Released in October 2015, the 9350 is similar to the 9343 but with the new Intel Skylake processor (6th generation I series) and a Thunderbolt 3 (with USB 3.1 Gen 2 support) in lieu of the mini-DisplayPort. There was also another model with i7-6560 CPU and Iris 540 graphics released later for better graphics performance[27]. One of the biggest improvements was increase in available integrated RAM memory to 16GB DDR3L (in highest versions).
