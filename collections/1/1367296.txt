Many of the objects and titles of the Faith draw their names from the Latin septem:[58] a temple or edifice of the faith is called a sept; and a priest of the Seven is called a septon (male) or septa (female). The Faith's hierarchy is also drawn from Catholicism,[56] being headed by the High Septon, in turn elected by a clerical high council known as the Most Devout.[citation needed] The Faith also has monks and nuns of various orders, of whom the Silent Sisters are the most prominent. In the fictional backstory, the Andals introduced the Faith of the Seven during their invasion of Westeros.[55] The High Septon and Most Devout were based in Oldtown for thousands of years, until the Targaryens conquered Westeros and moved the Faith's seat into King's Landing.[citation needed] The Seven Pointed Star is among the Faith's most important holy texts.[citation needed]
