GNS Science researchers have compiled an 8000-year timeline of 24 major quakes on the (southern end of the) fault from sediments at Hokuri Creek, near Lake McKerrow in north Fiordland. In earthquake terms, the 850 kilometres (530Â mi) long fault is remarkably consistent, rupturing on average each 330 years, at intervals ranging from 140 years to 510 years.[4]
