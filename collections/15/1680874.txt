In 1885, London found and read Ouida's long Victorian novel Signa. He credited this as the seed of his literary success.[11] In 1886, he went to the Oakland Public Library and found a sympathetic librarian, Ina Coolbrith, who encouraged his learning. (She later became California's first poet laureate and an important figure in the San Francisco literary community).[12]
