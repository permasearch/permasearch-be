A new split-flap display was installed in 1981 at the cross platform concourse. The individual platforms, except for the Holzkirchen wing station platforms, were given split-flap destination displays. These replaced panels that were once attached to the buffer stops. Some still exist at the Holzkirchen wing station, but are no longer used. An additional 37 monitors were installed at internal sites such as the ticket office. All displays are controlled by a computer, on which all changes to the basic timetable are stored. They are updated by the signal centre.[14] A washing plant was established to the south of the tracks for Intercity-Express trains in 1991 and in the following years it was expanded into an ICE depot.[39] Since 2004, the entire area of the station has video monitoring.[40] The 70 cameras are controlled by the control center of DB Security in the station.[41] Meanwhile, the split-flap displays have been replaced with more modern LCD displays. The loudspeaker systems have also been modernised.
