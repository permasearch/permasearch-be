Jamahl Epsicokhan of Jammer's Reviews summarized the episode as a "poignant and satisfying end to the final arc and the series." Like Handlen, he was "somewhat disappointed" by Damar's death, as it came in "an action scene and with very little fanfare." As a key element of the story arc, Epsicokhan stated "it's almost as if there simply wasn't time to deal with the death of the man who would've been the leader of a new Cardassia. The notion seemingly is: He's dead; on with the story." He ultimately felt that the episode made for a nice ending, writing that the "closing sense is more one of 'life goes on'", and gave the episode 3.5/4 stars.[3]
