Bacterium coli was the type species of the now invalid genus Bacterium when it was revealed that the former type species ("Bacterium triloculare") was missing.[105] Following a revision of Bacterium, it was reclassified as Bacillus coli by Migula in 1895[106] and later reclassified in the newly created genus Escherichia, named after its original discoverer.[107]
