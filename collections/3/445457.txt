The Angelicum does not provide housing primarily intended for lay students. However, assistance finding local student housing is offered by the Angelicum Office of Student Affairs (ASPUST).[280] The office is located in the Palazzo dei Decanati or Deans' Building at the West end of campus, just inside the gates to the right.
