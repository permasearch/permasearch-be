When Peter Jackson began to look for suitable locations for The Lord of the Rings film series[1] he first saw the Alexander Farm during an aerial search[5] in 1998[6] and concluded that the area was "like a slice of ancient England".[1] Set Decorator Alan Lee commented that the location's hills "looked as though Hobbits had already begun excavations".[7] Part of the site has a lake with a long arm that could double as a river.[7]
