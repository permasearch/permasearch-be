The season finale of the second season introduced the parallel universe to viewers.[28] Fringe's producers debated over how much of this universe to depict in the third season, but ultimately decided that showing the doppelgangers would "fit more into our own character’s lives and show different aspects of their personalities".[29] As a result, Fringe began its third season by alternating between episodes, with each depicting one universe.[30][31] The Fox network was initially resistant to this design, as executives were "really concerned that if the episodes didn't have ['over here'] Walter or Peter in them, it wouldn’t feel like our show anymore."[32] Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman explained that the series had to constantly evolve, "otherwise we’ll get bored, the cast will get bored, the audience will get bored"; after the first several episodes of the season, Fox agreed it was a positive change.[32]
