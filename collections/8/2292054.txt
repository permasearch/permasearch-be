An example is a hydrogen atom abstraction reaction R' + H–R ⇌ R'–H + R with equilibrium constant KH, where R' and R are organic radicals such that R' forms a stronger bond to hydrogen than does R. The decrease in zero-point energy due to deuterium substitution will then be more important for R'–H than for R–H, and R'–D will be stabilized more than R–D, so that the equilibrium constant KD for R' + D–R ⇌ R'–D + R is greater than KH. This is summarized in the rule the heavier atom favors the stronger bond.[14]
