The Normans conquest of England at first had little effect on North Wales. This was to change as the city of Chester on the River Dee became the base for successive campaigns against the country in the thirteenth century. The coastal plain of Clwyd was the main invasion route used and a number of castles were built there to facilitate these advances. The castles at Flint and Rhuddlan date from this period, and were the first to be built by Edward I of England in North Wales during his successful conquest in 1282.[3] After this, the rule of the Welsh Princes was at an end and Wales became annexed to England. The country was known as the Principality of Wales during the period 1216 to 1536. From 1301, the crown's lands in north and west Wales, including Clwyd, formed part of the appanage of England's heir apparent, who was given the title "Prince of Wales". This was a time of repression for the Welsh people and there were numerous uprisings and rebellions against English rule. Under the Act of Union of 1535, Wales became permanently incorporated under the English Crown and subject to English law.[3]
