In addition to the Bustan and Gulistan, Saadi also wrote four books of love poems (ghazals), and number of longer mono-rhyme poems (qasidas) in both Persian and Arabic. There are also quatrains and short pieces, and some lesser works in prose and poetry.[15] Together with Rumi and Hafez, he is considered one of the three greatest ghazal-writers of Persian poetry.[16]
