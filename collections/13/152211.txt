The following table derived from data mined from Electric Power Annual .[64][65] identifies those states which must import electrical energy from neighboring states to meet their consumption needs. Each state's total electric generation for 2015 is compared with the states consumption and its share of the system loss and the difference between the generated electric energy and its total consumption (including its share of the system loss) is the amount of energy it imports. For Hawaii (HI) total consumption equals generated energy. For the other states, multiplying their direct consumption by 1.084811845 (4067481441/3749481038), results in USA supply (including net imports) being equal to USA total consumption. The following chart provides the details. The graphic shows each import states situation with respect to electric energy consumption being greater than its generation.
