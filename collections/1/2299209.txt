The new DPR took office on 22 July 1959. It accepted the president's decree by acclamation and aid it was ready to work as stipulated by the 1945 Constitution. However, in March 1960 it unexpectedly rejected the government's budget. Sukarno then dissolved it as it was seen as no longer fulfilling the president's hopes that it would work with him in the spirit of the 1945 Constitution, Guided Democracy and the Political manifesto (Manipol, the political ideology of the time). The DPR session ended on 24 June.[23][24]
