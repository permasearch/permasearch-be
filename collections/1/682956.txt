The Utica Devils were the American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate team of the New Jersey Devils from 1987 to 1993, then the Albany River Rats from 1993 to 2006.[29] The affiliation was broken once the Devils bought the Lowell Lock Monsters and renamed them the Lowell Devils,[216] which in 2010 moved and became the Albany Devils.[217] The Albany Devils moved after the 2016â€“17 season and became the Binghamton Devils.[218]
