In 1839, Abraham Firkovich was appointed by the Russian government as a researcher into the origins of the Jewish sect known as the Karaites.[316] In 1846, one of his acquaintances the Russian orientalist Vasilii Vasil'evich Grigor'ev (1816â€“1881) theorised that the Crimean Karaites were of Khazar stock. Firkovich vehemently rejected the idea.[317] The allegation, though unfamiliar to the Karaites themselves at the time, was quickly taken up by outsiders.
