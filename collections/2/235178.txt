On 12 January 2015, Ronaldo won his second consecutive Ballon d'Or, garnering 37.66% of the votes, ahead of Messi with 15.76%. Both players again refused to vote for each other; Ronaldo voted for Real Madrid teammates Sergio Ramos, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema, while Messi voted for teammates from both club and country, picking Ángel Di María, Andrés Iniesta and Javier Mascherano.[192] Both players were praised for their accomplishments throughout 2014, with neither player clearly being the world's best a "tribute simply to the status of both men",[193] while Ronaldo was declared a "truly worthy recipient", having scored 61 goals to Messi's 58,[194] and it was declared that the time had come to finally give Ronaldo the respect he deserves within the confines of the rivalry.[195]
