The POSIX.1-2001 format is quite recent, so not all implementations will be able to handle it properly. It's designed so that all implementations able to read the UStar format will be able to read POSIX.1-2001 as well. The only exceptions are files that make use of extended features, such as longer file names. The additional information will be extracted as a plain text file along with the file it refers to.[7]
