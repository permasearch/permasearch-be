The AAT was established in 1975,[3] to conduct an independent merits review of administrative decisions made under Commonwealth laws. The AAT can 'stand in the shoes of the original decision maker' and reconsider the decision using whatever information is brought before it or available to it.[4] The High Court has long held that the separation of judicial power from legislative and executive powers was a fundamental principle of the Constitution.[5] This had the consequence that judicial power could only be exercised by a judge appointed to a court in accordance with section 72 of the Constitution.[6][7] The High Court also held that the separation of powers meant that a federal court could not validly be given non-judicial powers.[8]
