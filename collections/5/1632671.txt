Durk was baffled in a rivalry between Chief Keef and rival Gangster Disciple Joseph “Lil Jojo” Coleman.[84] After Glo Gang affiliate Lil Reese offended his gang set, The Brick Squad (not to be confused with rapper Gucci Mane’s label), Jojo responded with the diss track, “BDK (300K)”, calling out a vast majority of gang members, most namely Keef, Reese and Durk.[85] The feud ended in tragedy after Lil Jojo was shot and killed on September 5, 2012.[86][84][87]
