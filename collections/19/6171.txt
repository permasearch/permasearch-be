In the pre-Civil War period Society chapters frequently sponsored addresses by distinguished speakers.  Ralph Waldo Emerson's 1837 address at Harvard, "The American Scholar" is the best-known of those addresses, but there were dozens of others at schools such as Bowdoin, Brown, Harvard, Union, and Yale.[21]
