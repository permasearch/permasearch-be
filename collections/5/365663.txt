Hickok biographer Joseph Rosa wrote about the make-up of the hand: "The accepted version is that the cards were the ace of spades, the ace of clubs, two black eights, and the queen of clubs as the 'kicker'."[7] However, Rosa said that no contemporaneous source can be found for this exact hand.[8] The solidification in gamers parlance of the dead man's hand as two pairs, aces and eights, didn't come about until after the 1926 publication of Frank Wilstach's book Wild Bill Hickok: The Prince of Pistoleersâ€”50 years after Hickok's death.[1]
