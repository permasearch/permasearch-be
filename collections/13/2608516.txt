Following the success of reintroducing Spider-Man via a cinematic form of media in Captain America: Civil War (2016) and the expected reception of Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), Sony Pictures stated that they were moving forward with Venom, written by Scott Rosenberg and Jeff Pinkner, and directed by Ruben Fleischer. It will be released on October 5, 2018. Tom Hardy was cast to portray Eddie Brock / Venom. While initial reports stated that the film would be separate from the MCU - instead set within its own continuity called Sony's Marvel Universe, with no connections to the Spider-Man character - in June 2017, Amy Pascal revealed in an interview that the film will have connections to Spider-Man: Homecoming and the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as an "adjunct" film, with Tom Holland possibly reprising his role as Spider-Man in Venom as well as future spin-off films as well.[34] In the International teaser trailer, the Venom symbiote can be briefly seen in a glass capsule. Riot is confirmed to appear in Venom.[35]
