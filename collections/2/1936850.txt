During the 1990s, Wetherspoon began a policy of routinely closing its smaller or less profitable outlets, often—but not always—replacing them with larger premises close by. In 1998, Wetherspoon introduced the oversized pint glass to promote the "full pint".[10]  This initiative was withdrawn, supposedly because customers were still asking for top-ups, but arguably because other pub chains did not follow its lead.[11]
