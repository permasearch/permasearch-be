By the predynastic Naqada period in Egypt, people had fully developed a numeral system.[30] The importance of mathematics to an educated Egyptian is suggested by a New Kingdom fictional letter in which the writer proposes a scholarly competition between himself and another scribe regarding everyday calculation tasks such as accounting of land, labor and grain.[31] Texts such as the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus and the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus show that the ancient Egyptians could perform the four basic mathematical operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—use fractions,[32] knew the formula to compute the volume of a frustum, and calculate the surface areas of triangles, circles and even hemispheres.[33] They understood basic concepts of algebra and geometry, and could solve simple sets of simultaneous equations.[34]
