"Right Time of the Night" had a 4 March 1977 UK single release, garnering sufficient interest that in May 1977 "Right Time..." ranked on Record Mirror magazine's "Starbreaker" chart - the equivalent of the Bubbling Under... chart in Billboard - although the single would not advance into the official UK Top 50.[25] "Right Time..." would be reissued in the UK in February 1983: Arista, who had dropped Warnes from its roster in 1982, replaced the original B-side "Daddy Don't Go" with "I'm Restless" a track from Warnes' 1979 album release Shot Through the Heart. Warnes' duet with Joe Cocker: "Up Where We Belong" (on Island Records), was in the UK Top Ten in February 1983 but this apparently failed to afford any prestige to the re-release of "Right Time..." as the track again failed to rank in the official UK chart (despite the official chart by that time having expanded to a Top 100).[26]
