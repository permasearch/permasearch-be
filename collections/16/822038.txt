The Khvalynsk culture (4700–3800 BCE)[90] (middle Volga) and the Don-based Repin culture (ca.3950–3300 BCE)[96] preceded the Yamnaya culture (3300–2500 BCE),[97] which originated in the Don-Volga area.[97] Late pottery from these two cultures can barely be distinguished from early Yamna pottery.[98]
