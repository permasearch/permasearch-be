From the late 1990s and onward, UNC Chapel Hill expanded rapidly with a 15% increase in total student population to more than 28,000 by 2007. This was accompanied by the construction of new facilities, funded in part by the "Carolina First" fundraising campaign and an endowment that increased fourfold to more than $2Â billion in just ten years.[31][32] Professor Oliver Smithies was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2007 for his work in genetics.[33] Additionally, Aziz Sancar was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2015 for his work in understanding the molecular repair mechanisms of DNA.[34]
