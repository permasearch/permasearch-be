Twist 3:  18-year-old Mandy Hansen spends her winter high school break with her father (Sig), and tries to convince him to take her crab fishing on the Northwestern (including footage from last summer's salmon tendering from the "Legend of the Northwestern" special); Sig has her do emergency drills and prep pots with the other deckhands before sending her home to get her mother's permission to go crabbing.
