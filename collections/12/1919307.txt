Once again, a taxpayer challenged the legality of the income tax. In Pollock v. Farmers' Loan and Trust Company (1895),[2] Charles Pollock sued the corporation in which he owned stock, contending that the corporation should never have paid the income tax because the tax was unconstitutional. In this case, the tax was paid on income from land. Pollock argued that since a tax on real estate is a direct tax, a tax on the income from such property should be a direct tax as well. Because the Constitution prohibited a "direct tax" unless the tax is apportioned, Pollock argued that the unapportioned income tax should be declared unconstitutional. The "direct tax" argument had also been used by Springer in 1880, but now the Court focused more closely on the wording in the Constitution. The provisions were Article I, Section 8, Clause 1, which provides that "all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States"[13] and Article I, Section 9, Clause 4, which provides: "No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken.[14]
