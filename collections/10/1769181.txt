At this juncture, it is important to distinguish between how ownership passes in cash and credit sales respectively. In a cash sale, ownership passes once there has been (in addition to delivery) due payment of the purchase price. In a sale on credit, the fact that credit has been given is an indication that ownership merely passed on delivery. In an ordinary credit sale, the seller cannot claim that he did not intend ownership to pass until the full price had been paid. (This does not cover the situation where the sale is one subject to a pactum reservati dominii).
