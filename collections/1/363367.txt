The President appoints the Prime Minister, given the election results, and appoints the other members of the Government by proposal of the Prime Minister. He can, however, dismiss the Government when this is necessary to ensure the smooth functioning of democratic institutions. Even the government bodies of the autonomous regions may be dissolved by the President, by committing serious acts contrary to the Constitution.
