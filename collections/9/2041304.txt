The Bomb Squad, Public Enemy's production team, constructed the music for "Fight the Power," through the looping, layering, and transfiguring of numerous samples.[6] The track features only two actual instrumentalists: saxophone, played by Branford Marsalis, and scratches provided by Terminator X, the group's DJ and turntabilist[6]â€”Marsalis also played a saxophone solo for the extended soundtrack version of the song.[7]
