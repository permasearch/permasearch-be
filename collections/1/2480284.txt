The anonymous “disciple whom Jesus loved” is identified in the closing verses as the one whose testimony the Gospel bears: “This is the disciple who testifies about these things and has written these things.”[40] Ancient sources invariably identify this disciple with the Evangelist, and many modern scholars agree, though others consider that John the Evangelist fashioned the testimony of the Beloved Disciple into a Gospel, as Mark did for Peter, or hold on other grounds that the two are not identical.
