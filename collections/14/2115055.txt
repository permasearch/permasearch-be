Memories can be accurate, but they are not always accurate. For example, eyewitness testimony even of relatively recent dramatic events is notoriously unreliable.[34] Misremembering may result from confusion of memories of perceived and imagined events, as there may be overlap between features of the stored information comprising memories for perceived and imagined events.[citation needed] Memories of events are always a mix of factual traces of sensory information overlaid with emotions, mingled with interpretation and "filled in" with imaginings.[citation needed] Thus there is always skepticism about how valid a memory is as evidence of factual detail.[citation needed][clarification needed]
