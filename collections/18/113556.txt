Jefferson died deeply in debt, unable to pass on his estate freely to his heirs.[248] He gave instructions in his will for disposal of his assets,[249] including the freeing of Sally Hemings's children;[250] but his estate, possessions, and slaves were sold at public auctions starting in 1827.[251] In 1831, Monticello was sold by Martha Jefferson Randolph and the other heirs.[252]
