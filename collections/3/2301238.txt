In contrast, much larger doses of amphetamine are likely to impair cognitive function and induce rapid muscle breakdown.[45][50][59] Substance dependence (i.e., addiction) is a serious risk of amphetamine abuse, but only rarely arises from proper medical use.[45][60] Very high doses can result in a psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia), which very rarely occurs at therapeutic doses even during long-term use.[61][62] As recreational doses are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses, recreational use carries a far greater risk of serious side effects.[45][59]
