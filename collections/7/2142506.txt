"More, More, More" was covered by English group Bananarama for their album Please Yourself. It was produced by Mike Stock and Pete Waterman of Stock Aitken Waterman fame. Their version retained the disco feel of the original and also incorporated elements of ABBA-like production, as was the case with the entire Please Yourself album. Sara Dallin, Keren Woodward, Stock and Waterman added a second verse to their version of the song. The music video, directed by Saffie Ashtiany, featured them performing the song and dancing (in one of their few unchoreographed videos) in a cabaret-style club with several male dancers backing them up.
