Macbeth was first printed in the First Folio of 1623 and the Folio is the only source for the text. Some scholars contend that the Folio text was abridged and rearranged from an earlier manuscript or prompt book.[34] Often cited as interpolation are stage cues for two songs, whose lyrics are not included in the Folio but are included in Thomas Middleton's play The Witch, which was written between the accepted date for Macbeth (1606) and the printing of the Folio.[35] Many scholars believe these songs were editorially inserted into the Folio, though whether they were Middleton's songs or preexisting songs is not certain.[36] It is also widely believed that the character of Hecate, as well as some lines of the First Witch (4.1 124â€“31), were not part of Shakespeare's original play but were added by the Folio editors and possibly written by Middleton,[37] though "there is no completely objective proof" of such interpolation.[38]
