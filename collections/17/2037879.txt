Historically, and in modern times, female virginity has been regarded as more significant than male virginity; the perception that sexual prowess is fundamental to masculinity has lowered the expectation of male virginity without lowering the social status.[3][4][51] For example, in some Islamic cultures, though premarital sex is forbidden in the Quran with regard to both men and women, unmarried women who have been sexually active or raped may be subject to name-calling, shunning, or family shame, while unmarried men who have lost their virginities are not.[4] Among various countries or cultures, males are expected or encouraged to want to engage in sexual activity, and to be more sexually experienced.[3][51][52][53] Not following these standards often leads to teasing and other such ridicule from their male peers.[3][51][54] A 2003 study by the Guttmacher Institute showed that in most countries most men have experienced sexual intercourse by their 20th birthdays.[55]
