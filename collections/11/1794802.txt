On November 12, 2005 the church entered into a "Covenant of Concordat" with the Reformed Episcopal Church and the Anglican Province of America, two conservative groups of Anglican origin but outside the Anglican Communion, which do not recognize the ECUSA. In October and December 2006, several Episcopal churches in Virginia declared themselves out of communion with the ECUSA due to their opposition to their stance on homosexuality and joined the Church of Nigeria through the Convocation of Anglicans in North America, a mission originally started by the Church of Nigeria to support Nigerian Anglicans in the United States. It now mostly consists of non-Nigerian, theologically conservative American Anglicans, and initially began under the oversight of two bishops; Bishop Martyn Minns and a suffragan bishop, David Bena, who are simultaneously bishops of the Church of Nigeria.[11] The Church of Nigeria is currently in full communion with the Anglican Church in North America, founded in June 2009, of which the CANA is an affiliate jurisdiction, launched as a conservative alternative to the liberal tendencies of the Episcopal Church of the United States and the Anglican Church of Canada.[12] The first of four new American dioceses for the ACNA established by the Church of Nigeria, under the oversight of the missionary bishop of CANA, was the Missionary Diocese of the Trinity which was inaugurated on 19 August 2012 by Archbishop Nicholas Okoh.[13]  the Convocation of Anglicans in North America is currently led by The Rt. Rev. Julian Dobbs who serves and Missionary Bishop of the Convocation as well as Diocesan bishop of CANA East.  Bishop Felix Orji serves as bishop of CANA West.
