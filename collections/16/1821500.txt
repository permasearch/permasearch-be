The March 2010 announcement said that Portal 2 would be released in late 2010.[2][118] In August 2010, Valve postponed the release to February 2011, with a Steam release date of February 9,[119] to allow it to complete changes to the game's dialogue, to fill and connect about sixty test chambers, and to finish refinements to the gel gameplay mechanic.[11] Valve announced a further delay in November 2010, and gave a worldwide release date through retail and online channels of April 18, 2011.[120] Wolpaw stated that this eight-week delay was used to expand the game's content before reaching an internal milestone called a "content lock", after which no further content could be added. The remaining development work involved debugging. Newell allowed the delay considering the added benefits of the new content, because he thought the company would not lose any commercial opportunities because of it.[41] On February 18, 2011, Newell confirmed that Valve had completed the development work on Portal 2 and that they were "waiting for final approvals and to get the discs manufactured".[121] Portal 2 was the first Valve product simultaneously released for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X computers through the Steam platform.[122] Retail copies for all platforms were distributed by Electronic Arts.[123]
