Prior to production, developer Dontnod Entertainment decided that Life Is Strange 2 would feature new characters and a new location to the original.[6][7] Led by Life Is Strange directors Michel Koch and Raoul Barbet,[8] development on the sequel began in early 2016, while the predecessor shipped its retail edition.[9][10][11] Life Is Strange lead writers Christian Divine and Jean-Luc Cano and composer Jonathan Morali also reprised their roles.[3][12][13] The concept was influenced by the photography of Mike Brodie, who would freighthop across the United States and take pictures of drifters.[14] The game is structured like a road movie, inspired by the film Into the Wild and novella Of Mice and Men. Dontnod conducted field research on the West Coast of the United States, meeting people and taking pictures there.[12][15] The two primary themes of the game are education and brotherhood.[16] Using the Unreal Engine 4, they upgraded the animation system, physics, and shaders.[15] According to Dontnod, one of the biggest challenges of development was the artificial intelligence of the character Daniel.[12] The music will contain both original and licensed tracks.[12]
