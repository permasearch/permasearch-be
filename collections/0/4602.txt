Jerry Seinfeld and writer Larry David, who created Seinfeld, called the coffee shop Monkâ€™s because there was a poster of the jazz great pianist Thelonious Monk in the office in which they were writing, and they just needed a name.[2] In the original pilot "The Seinfeld Chronicles," the luncheonette was known as Pete's, and featured a waitress named Claire (played by Lee Garlington); Claire was originally conceived as a regular for the show but was written out (and Pete's replaced by Monk's) by the time the show went to series.
