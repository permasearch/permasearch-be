Thompson auditioned for the role of Cameron McIntyre in 2006, however the producers asked him to audition for the part of Ryan Connor instead.[1] His audition was successful and he was given a six-month contract, along with the option to extend it for up to a year.[1] Thompson billed his character as "mischievous" and said that he is "not a bad lad, but he's not a good lad either."[1] Series editor Garth Philips teased the Connor family, calling them "a twenty-first century Coronation Street family".[2] He said that the family are "a joy to watch on screen" and the audience would be "enthralled and excited by them".[2] Thompson made his debut appearance as Ryan on 30 August 2006.[1]
