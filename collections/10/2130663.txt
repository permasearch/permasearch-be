Palmerston North is perceived as being better for cycling than most New Zealand cities, with 2001 figures putting it a close second only to Blenheim in terms of bicycle modal share.[42] However, by 2006, cycling to work had almost halved in a decade to 5.4%[43] and the 2013 census found that, in the central city, only 6 cycled, but 690 travelled by motor vehicle.[44]
