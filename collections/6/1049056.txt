A landmark party meeting was held in December 1963, shortly after a military coup in Saigon in which Diệm was assassinated. North Vietnamese leaders debated the issue of "quick victory" vs "protracted war" (guerrilla warfare).[39] After this meeting, the communist side geared up for a maximum military effort and PAVN troop strength increased from 174,000 at the end of 1963 to 300,000 in 1964.[39] The Soviets cut aid in 1964 as an expression of annoyance with Hanoi's ties to China.[40][nb 6] Even as Hanoi embraced China's international line, it continued to follow the Soviet model of reliance on technical specialists and bureaucratic management, as opposed to mass mobilization.[40] The winter of 1964–1965 was a high-water mark for the Việt Cộng, with the Saigon government on the verge of collapse.[41] Soviet aid soared following a visit to Hanoi by Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin in February 1965.[42] Hanoi was soon receiving up-to-date surface-to-air missiles.[42] The U.S. would have 200,000 soldiers in South Vietnam by the end of the year.[43]
