The facelift model Audi A4 came in 2011. It features redesigned LED headlamps and tail lights, front air dam with fog lamps, and closely set twin exhausts. Interior changes include a three-spoke steering wheel and a redesigned ignition key. Controls for air-conditioning, infotainment, and power windows gain chrome clasps. Other detail interior changes include larger steering column stalk switches first seen in the D4-series Audi A8 and a simplified layout for the HVAC control panel – for example the temperature setting for the heated seats is now directly set by a single button and is no longer controlled using the MMI dial. The A4 includes radio with eight speakers as standard, while MMI navigation system with voice dialogue is optional. A new "Drive Select System" allows drivers to choose comfort, dynamic, individual, or efficiency modes for fuel efficiency. Power output of the 1.8 TFSI engine is 170 BHP and 320 Nm of torque – up 10 BHP and 70 Nm from the previous versions. Electro-mechanical power steering is standard.
