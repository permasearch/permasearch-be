Wind is the movement of air across the surface of the Earth, affected by areas of high pressure and of low pressure.[249] The global wind kinetic energy averaged approximately 1.50 MJ/m2 over the period from 1979 to 2010, 1.31 MJ/m2 in the Northern Hemisphere with 1.70 MJ/m2 in the Southern Hemisphere. The atmosphere acts as a thermal engine, absorbing heat at higher temperatures, releasing heat at lower temperatures. The process is responsible for production of wind kinetic energy at a rate of 2.46 W/m2 sustaining thus the circulation of the atmosphere against frictional dissipation.[250] A global 1Â km2 map of wind resources is housed at http://irena.masdar.ac.ae/?map=103, based on calculations by the Technical University of Denmark.[251][252][253] Unlike 'static' wind speed atlases which give a single average speed across multiple years, tools such as Renewables.ninja provide time-varying simulations of wind speed and power output from different wind turbine models at hourly resolution.[254]
