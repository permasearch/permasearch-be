The result was an unexpected landslide victory for Clement Attlee's Labour Party, over Winston Churchill's Conservatives.[2] It was the first time the Conservatives had lost the popular vote since the 1906 election; they would not win it again until 1955. Labour won its first majority government, and a mandate to implement its postwar reforms. The 12.0% national swing from the Conservative Party to the Labour Party remains the largest ever achieved in a British general election.
