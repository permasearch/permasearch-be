In 2014 Mumbai didn't start off well losing 5 of their matches in the UAE leg against Kolkata Knight Riders, Royal Challengers Bangalore, Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Daredevils by big margins but did well in their 5th match against Sunrisers Hyderabad but consequently lost the matches against respective opponents.
