In addition, several congressmen, including Democrats Rep. Barney Frank, Rep. Jos√© E. Serrano,[12] Rep. Howard Berman, and Sen. Harry Reid,[13] and Republicans Rep. Guy Vander Jagt,[14] Rep. David Dreier[15] and Sen. Mitch McConnell[16] have introduced legislation to repeal the Twenty-second Amendment, but each resolution died before making it out of its respective committee. Other alterations have been proposed, including replacing the absolute two term limit with a limit of no more than two consecutive terms and giving Congress the power to grant an exemption to a current or former president by way of a supermajority vote in both houses.[citation needed]
