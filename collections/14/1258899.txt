Self-propelled Gleaner combines could be fitted with special tracks instead of tires or tires with tread measuring almost 10in deep to assist in harvesting rice. Some combines, particularly the pull type, have tires with a diamond tread which prevents sinking in mud. These tracks can fit other combines by having adapter plates made.
