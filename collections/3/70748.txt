Originally, the song was recorded by Bing Crosby for the biggest-selling hit version,[1][2] while other contemporaneous hit versions included recordings by Tommy Dorsey (with vocal by Edythe Wright) and Russ Morgan.[1] It was also revived by Bobby Darin in 1961, reaching the charts again that year.[1] The song has been recorded by many other artists (see below for a partial list) and is considered a popular standard. It was used frequently in the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons, also produced by Warner Brothers, under the musical direction of Carl W. Stalling.[3]
