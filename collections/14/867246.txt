Abduction is the motion of a structure away from the midline while adduction refer to motion towards the center of the body.[13] The centre of the body is defined as the midsagittal plane.[3] These terms come from Latin words with similar meanings, ab- being the Latin prefix indicating "away," ad- indicating "toward," and ducere meaning "to draw or pull" (cf. English words "duct," "conduct," "induction").[b]
