Upon returning to England, Hector went into the studio to work on the idea with long-time songwriting partner and producer Steve Mac.[1] When the two discussed what the song was about they agreed that "this is about our wives. This is about the things that make our lives complete."[1] According to Hector the lyrics were completed in about half an hour.[1] The band's manager later revealed the song had been planned as the first solo single for Boyzone's Stephen Gately. "Stephen did the demo and he thought it was going to be his song," Walsh recalls. "I'll be quite honest, I missed it, but as soon as Simon heard it he just went bananas. It was really difficult because Westlife were on tour with Boyzone, as the support act."[2]
