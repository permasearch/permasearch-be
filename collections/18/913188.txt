Despite covering only about 6.5% of the total area of Egypt; the Nile Valley and Nile Delta are the most important regions, being the country's only cultivable regions and supporting about 99% of the population.  The Nile valley extends approximately 800Â km from Aswan to the outskirts of Cairo.  The Nile Valley is very cool and known as Upper Egypt, while the Nile Delta region is known as Lower Egypt.  Steep rocky cliffs rise along the banks of the Nile in some stretches, while other areas along the Nile are flat, with space for agricultural production.  In the past, flooding of the Nile during the summer provided silt and water to make agriculture possible on land that is otherwise very dry.  Since construction of the Aswan Dam, agriculture in the Nile valley depends on irrigation.  The Nile delta consists of flat, low-lying areas.  Some parts of the delta are marshy and water-logged, and thus not suitable for agriculture.  Other areas of the delta are used for agriculture.[1]
