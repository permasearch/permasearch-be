French chemist Bernard Courtois discovered Iodine in 1811,[88] and in 1896 Eugen Baumann documented it as the central ingredient in the thryoid gland. He did this by boiling the thyroid glands of a thousand sheep, and named the precipitate, a combination of the thyroid hormones, 'iodothyrin'.[88] David Marine in 1907 provided iodine is necessary for thyroid function.[88][87] Thyroxine itself was first isolated in 1914 and synthesized in 1927, and trirodothyroxine in 1952.[88][93] The conversion of T4 to T3 was discovered in 1970.[87] The process of discovering TSH took place over the early to mid twentieth century.[94] TRH was discovered by Polish endocrinologist Andrew Schally in 1970, contributing in part to his Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1977.[87][95]
