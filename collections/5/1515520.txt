However, a plaque unveiled in Darwin in 2001 gave the total as 292.[104][page needed] The plaque indicated 10 sailors had been killed aboard the USS William B. Preston but the US Navy said there were 13 fatalities[105] and Peter Grose, author of An Awkward Truth, said fifteen – he wrote: "With the William B. Preston total corrected to 15, a figure of 297 known dead is the best count anyone is likely to achieve...the full death toll is likely to be a little over 300, perhaps as many as 310 or 320."[106]  Lewis and Ingman have revised that to 14 in their 2013 book Carrier Attack.
