In philosophy, rationalism is the epistemological view that "regards reason as the chief source and test of knowledge"[3] or "any view appealing to reason as a source of knowledge or justification".[4] More formally, rationalism is defined as a methodology or a theory "in which the criterion of the truth is not sensory but intellectual and deductive".[5]
