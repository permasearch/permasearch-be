The music video features the band members arriving to a breakfast table and being served by butlers, beside the curb in front of Tiffany & Co. in Midtown Manhattan. At the end of the video a young woman dressed like Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn's character from the film) walks past on the sidewalk, and takes off her sunglasses.
