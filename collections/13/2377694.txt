On 5 August 2015, the European Commission submitted a recommendation authorising the opening of negotiations on a short-stay visa waiver agreement with China for holders of diplomatic passports.[130] The agreement was subsequently signed by both parties on 29 February 2016 and went into effect on 2 March 2016.[131] The agreement, however, does not apply to UK and Ireland as separate visa-waiver agreements were already in force with these two countries.[132]
