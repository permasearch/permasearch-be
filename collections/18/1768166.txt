In 2010, the American Civil Liberties Union filed the lawsuit ACLU v. Alvarez against the State's Attorney of Cook County, Anita Alvarez, to block prosecution of ACLU staff for recording police officers performing their duties in public places, one of the group's long-standing monitoring missions.[4] On 2 March 2012, Criminal Courts Judge Stanley Sacks deemed the Illinois wiretapping law unconstitutional, potentially criminalizing "wholly innocent conduct".[5] In November 2012, the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of this ruling.[4]
