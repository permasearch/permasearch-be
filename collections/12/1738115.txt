Chylothorax (fluid from lymph vessels leaking into the pleural cavity) may be identified by determining triglyceride and cholesterol levels, which are relatively high in lymph. A triglyceride level over 110Â mg/dl and the presence of chylomicrons indicate a chylous effusion. The appearance is generally milky but can be serous.
