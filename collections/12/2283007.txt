Street Fighter II was followed by a series of updated versions, each refining the play mechanics, graphics, character roster, and other aspects of the game. The first was Street Fighter II′: Champion Edition, released for the arcades in March 1992, which allowed players to control the four Grand Masters and same character matches. Following the release of Champion Edition, a wave of bootleg ROM chip upgrades for its arcade cabinets added new gameplay, prompting Capcom's official response with Street Fighter II′ Turbo: Hyper Fighting during December the same year, increasing the playing speed and giving some of the characters new special moves. Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers was released in September 1993, which marked the change to the more advanced CP System II, allowing for updated graphics and audio, while introducing four new characters. Super Street Fighter II Turbo was released in February 1994 and was the last of the Street Fighter II releases for the arcades (until Hyper Street Fighter II), which introduced powered-up special moves called Super Combos and added a new hidden character.
