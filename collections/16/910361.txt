The next day, the White Witch comes in parley and demands her right to execute Edmund for his betrayal, citing Deep Magic from the Dawn of Time that gives her power over all traitors. In private conversation with her, Aslan offers himself in Edmund's place, and she accepts his offer, though none of Aslan's followers know this. Susan and Lucy, unable to sleep, follow Aslan to the Stone Table that night. They watch from afar as the White Witch asks her evil people to tie him up. The hags do so as they are assisted by the black dwarves and evil apes. Before a bound Aslan can be loaded onto the table, the White Witch quotes "Let him first be shaved" as an ogre with scissors clipped off his mane. This led to the White Witch's army doing domestic cat taunts to him. When a bounded Aslan is loaded onto the Stone Table, the White Witch kills Aslan with her knife.
