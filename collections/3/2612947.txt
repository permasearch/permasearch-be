Buddhism flourished under the Indo-Greek kings, and their rule, especially that of Menander, has been remembered as benevolent. It has been suggested, although direct evidence is lacking, that their invasion of India was intended to show their support for the Mauryan empire which may have had a long history of marital alliances,[207] exchange of presents,[208] demonstrations of friendship,[209] exchange of ambassadors[210] and religious missions[211] with the Greeks. The historian Diodorus even wrote that the king of Pataliputra had "great love for the Greeks".[212][213]
