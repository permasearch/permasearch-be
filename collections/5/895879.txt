The Truchet point, the first modern typographic point, was 1/144 of a French inch or 1/1728 of the royal foot. It was invented by the French clergyman Sébastien Truchet. During the metrication of France amid its revolution, a 1799 law declared the meter to be exactly 443.296 French lines long. This established a length to the royal foot of 7003900000000000000♠9000/7004277060000000000♠27706 m or about 325 mm, which made the Truchet point equal to 7004156250000000000♠15625/7004831180000000000♠83118 mm or about 6996187986000000000♠0.187986 mm.
