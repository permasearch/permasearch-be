After Xiang Li Que died, Chen Ye returned to Qi Nan Palace and Aranya was arrested for killing her father. Qing Hua visited Aranya and told her that Chen Ye had requested she be executed at the shrine as well as to allow him to marry Wen Tian. Aranya asked her mother if she'd ever loved her and what she had done to cause Qing Hua to want her to die. Qing Hua said she'll repay her in their next life, but Aranya refused and sadly lamented on how much Chen Ye hated her to hand her this revenge. Later, Aranya was kidnapped by Xi Ze and asked him to take her half-brother, Xiang Li He, to a safe place so that he wouldn't be killed by Qing Hua. Aranya took Xiang Li He's place on the battlefield and, at the cost of incinerating her soul, performed the Soul Evocation Formation to defend her home.
