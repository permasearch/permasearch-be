The state of Minnesota brought a lawsuit against Jacobs Engineering Group, the successor of Sverdrup & Parcel, the firm that designed the bridge.[135] Jacobs argued too much time had passed since the 1960s design work, but in May 2012, the United States Supreme Court turned down its appeal, allowing the state of Minnesota suit to proceed.[136] Jacobs paid $8.9 million in Nov. 2012 to settle the suit without admitting wrongdoing.[137]
