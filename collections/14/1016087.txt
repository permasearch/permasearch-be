The microconsole contains 21 built-in games. These include Star Fox 2, a sequel to Star Fox that had been cancelled near the very end of its development in 1996; while Nintendo had given no official word to the cancellation, developer Dylan Cuthbert said that Nintendo feared how Star Fox 2 would look compared to similar games on the more-advanced PlayStation and Sega Saturn consoles.[34] Players can unlock Star Fox 2 on the SNES Classic upon clearing the first level of Star Fox.[9]
