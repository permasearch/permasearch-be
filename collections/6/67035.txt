The War Commission however rejected the charge that 200,000 Bengali girls were raped by the Pakistan Army, remarking: â€œIt is clear that the figures mentioned by the Dacca authorities are altogether fantastic and fanciful" and cited the evidence of a British abortion team that it carried out the termination of "only a hundred or more pregnancies".[224][212][225] The Commission also claimed that "approximately 26,000 persons (were) killed during the action by the Pakistan military"[224][226] Bina D'Costa states that the War Commission was aware of the military's brutality in East Pakistan but "chose to downplay the scale of the atrocities committed."[224]
