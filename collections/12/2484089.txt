The ATRX gene encodes the ATP-dependent helicase, ATRX (also known as XH2 and XNP) of the SNF2 subgroup family, that is thought to be responsible for functions such as chromatin remodeling, gene regulation, and DNA methylation.[30][31][32][33] These functions assist in prevention of apoptosis, resulting in cortical size regulation, as well as a contribution to the survival of hippocampal and cortical structures, affecting memory and learning.[30] This helicase is located on the X chromosome (Xq13.1-q21.1), in the pericentromeric heterochromatin and binds to heterochromatin protein 1.[30][32] Studies have shown that ATRX plays a role in rDNA methylation and is essential for embyonic development.[34] Mutations have been found throughout the ATRX protein, with over 90% of them being located in the zinc finger and helicase domains.[35] Mutations of ATRX can result in X-linked-alpha-thalassaemia-mental retardation (ATR-X syndrome).[30]
