felt: a loop of fabric or synthetic material that goes between press rolls and serves as a place to receive the pressed out water.  Felts also support the wet paper web and guide it through the press section. Felts are also used in the dryer section to keep the sheet in close contact with the dryers and increase heat transfer.
