While most smaller centres in Nova Scotia have experienced economic and population declines in the last 30 years, Bridgewater is one of the only locations in Nova Scotia outside Halifax County that showed consistent population growth over the span of the 20th century. While the population of many Nova Scotian communities is lower now than in 1951 (including Sydney, New Glasgow, Amherst and Yarmouth, among others), Bridgewater has almost doubled its population during that time.[10] There was a strong boom in population between 1961 and 1981 in particular, this reflecting the arrival of Michelin tire plant in the community.
