The term is sometimes attributed to a story in Rudolf Erich Raspe's The Surprising Adventures of Baron Munchausen, but in that story Baron Munchausen pulls himself (and his horse) out of a swamp by his hair (specifically, his pigtail), not by his bootstraps –  and no explicit reference to bootstraps has been found elsewhere in the various versions of the Munchausen tales.[4]
