Historically, water privatization has resulted in civil disputes, protests and wars. The United Nations classifies access to clean drinking water as a universal human right.[65] Water privatization does not provide water as a universal human right, but provides water based on profitability. A major concern for water privatization is a loss of control of a vital resource for the public sector.[66] Privatization limits public accountability, multinational water corporations are responsible to stakeholders, whereas the public sector is responsible to its citizens.[66] Public control of water politics allows public input and transparency. Private organization limits transparency because private organizations are not required to be open and transparent to the public.[66] In addition, private water organizations have different goals and agendas compared to the public sector; this can create water conflict and tension between the public and private sector.[66]
