When the film was completed, Hillenburg wanted to end the series "so [it] wouldn't jump the shark". However, Nickelodeon desired more episodes;[10] Hillenburg stated: "Well, there was concern when we did the movie [in 2004] that the show had peaked. There were concerns among executives at Nickelodeon."[11][12] As a result, Hillenburg resigned as the series' showrunner,[13] appointing writer, director, and storyboard artist Paul Tibbitt to succeed him.[14] Tibbitt was one of Hillenburg's favorite crew members:[15] "[I] totally trusted him."[16] Tibbitt would remain showrunner until he was succeeded in 2015 by the show's creative director Vincent Waller and staff writer Marc Ceccarelli. He has also acted as an executive producer since 2008.[14][17] Hillenburg no longer writes or runs the show on a day-to-day basis, but reviews each episode and submitted suggestions: "I figure when I'm pretty old I can still paintÂ [...] I don't know about running shows."[13][18] Tom Kenny, Bill Fagerbakke and the crew confirmed that they had completed four episodes for broadcast on Nickelodeon in early 2005,[19][20] and planned to finish a total of about 20 for the fourth season.[19][20] In 2015, Hillenburg returned to the show following the completion of the second movie as an executive producer, now having greater creative input and attending crew meetings.[21][22]
