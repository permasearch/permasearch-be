Several of the songs on Tapestry were recorded by other artists and became hit singles while the album was still on the charts: James Taylor's 1971 recording of "You've Got a Friend" hit number one in the US[24] and number four in the UK,[25] and Barbra Streisand's 1971 studio recording of "Where You Lead" reached number 40[26] while a live recording of a medley in which Streisand paired the song with the Sweet Inspirations hit "Sweet Inspiration" reached number 37 the following year.[26]
