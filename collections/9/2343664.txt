The modern University of Florida (UF) was created in 1905 when the Florida Legislature enacted the Buckman Act, which abolished all of the state's publicly-supported institutions of higher learning and consolidated the academic programs of four in the new University of the State of Florida (a land-grant university for white men).[note 1] The private Stetson College (now Stetson University) in DeLand was the first college to field a football team in the state, playing intramural games as early as 1894.[2] Stetson, West Florida Seminary (later Florida State College, now Florida State University),[3] and Florida Agricultural College (renamed the University of Florida at Lake City in 1903) had intramural football teams by the late 1890s or early 1900s.[4]
