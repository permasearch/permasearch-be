GBS-LOD is not acquired through vertical transmission during delivery; it can be acquired later from the mother from breast milk or from environmental and community sources. GBS-LOD commonly shows nonspecific signs, and diagnosis should be made obtaining blood cultures in febrile newborns. Hearing loss and mental impairment can be a long-term consequence of GBS meningitis.[5][24]
