The Nationals began their 2017 season at home against the division rival Miami Marlins. Marlins starter Edinson Vólquez pitched effectively, making heavy use of his changeup to bamboozle Nationals hitters and working out of jams in the first and fourth innings. He gave up four hits and a walk and allowed no runs while striking out six, but he left the game after five innings. Stephen Strasburg was efficient as the Opening Day starter for the Nationals, but the Marlins took the lead in the top of the fourth inning, with right fielder Giancarlo Stanton driving in catcher J.T. Realmuto with a double and then scoring on a single by Marcell Ozuna. The lead was cut in half as Nationals right fielder Bryce Harper hit his fifth career Opening Day home run to right field off Marlins reliever David Phelps in the sixth inning with no one on base, and then Phelps gave up the lead entirely in the bottom of the seventh inning, as pinch-hitter Adam Lind homered to center field after a two-out single by catcher Matt Wieters—both players new additions to the Nationals who signed late in the off-season, with Lind making his first plate appearance with Washington.[66]
