The earlier conceptions[which?] likely[original research?] had little influence on 18th-century European geological explanations for the formation of Earth. Abraham Gottlob Werner (1749â€“1817) proposed Neptunism, where strata represented deposits from shrinking seas precipitated onto primordial rocks such as granite. In 1785 James Hutton proposed an opposing, self-maintaining infinite cycle based on natural history and not on the Biblical account.[10][11]
