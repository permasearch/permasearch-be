The second issue is the amount of training data available relative to the complexity of the "true" function (classifier or regression function).  If the true function is simple, then an "inflexible" learning algorithm with high bias and low variance will be able to learn it from a small amount of data.  But if the true function is highly complex (e.g., because it involves complex interactions among many different input features and behaves differently in different parts of the input space), then the function will only be learnable from a very large amount of training data and using a "flexible" learning algorithm with low bias and high variance.
