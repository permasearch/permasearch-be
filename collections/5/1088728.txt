Although the situation was dire, the young King Araphor, son of Arveleg, defended the city of Fornost against the host of Angmar. Although he was still a youth by the reckoning of his people, Araphor proved valiant, and with the help of Círdan of Lindon he repulsed Angmar's army from the North Downs and won a great victory. It was at this time that Angmar was subdued by Elven-folk from Lindon, Rivendell, and even Lothlórien for Elrond had brought help over the passes of the Misty Mountains. At the same time, the Stoors (one of the three peoples who were named Hobbits) who had previously dwelt in the angle between the Hoarwell and the Loudwater fled south-westwards because of the wars and the dread of Angmar, and because the land and clime of eastern Eriador worsened and became unfriendly. Some of these returned to Wilderland in Rhovanion and dwelt alongside the banks of the Gladden, becoming a riverside people of fishers, but others migrated westwards to a land known by the Dúnedain as Sûza, which the Stoors named the Shire. These peoples were granted by the eleventh king of Arthedain, Argeleb II,[19] land that had become sparsely populated by war, and dwelling there as a people became the Hobbits known by the end of the Third Age for their love of peace and domesticity.
