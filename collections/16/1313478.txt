In 2009, the band founded Gentlemen of the Road, a live promotions company, record label and organiser of the global series of Stopover Festivals.[93] These festivals tend to take place in towns and villages not normally toured in by bands or singers in an effort to bring money to the place and help businesses there.[not in citation given] The band handpicks the supporting acts which play for the Stopover Festivals. These include bands such as Foo Fighters, The Flaming Lips, The Vaccines, The Maccabees and Jenny Lewis, amongst others. [94]
