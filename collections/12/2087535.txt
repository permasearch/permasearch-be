The public Binghamton City School District has 5,668 students enrolled, and is the largest school district in the metropolitan area.[86] The district consists of Binghamton High School, two middle schools, and seven elementary schools.[87] While the district maintains an International Baccalaureate program and has received several academic awards,[88] it is classified as high needs, and has had difficulty meeting several educational requirements.[86] The Catholic Schools of Broome County, a private district run by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Syracuse, operate Seton Catholic Central High School and an elementary school in the city of Binghamton.[89]
