'Dreamer' stayed on top of the chart for only a week, eventually being knocked off by the monster hit 'Unchained Melody' by Robson & Jerome. 'Dreamer' racked up an impressive run in the top 100, spending 21 non consecutive weeks in the UK chart, ending the year as the 40th biggest selling single of 1995. (Coincidentally Alex Party's "Don't Give Me Your Life" ended the year as the 28th biggest selling single of 1995)
