Common ravens can thrive in varied climates; indeed this species has the largest range of any member of the genus,[47][48] and one of the largest of any passerine.[49] They range throughout the Holarctic from Arctic and temperate habitats in North America and Eurasia to the deserts of North Africa, and to islands in the Pacific Ocean. In the British Isles, they are more common in Scotland, Wales, northern England and the west of Ireland.[41] In Tibet, they have been recorded at altitudes up to 5,000 m (16,400 ft), and as high as 6,350 m (20,600 ft) on Mount Everest.[48][50] The population sometimes known as the Punjab raven—described as Corvus corax laurencei (also spelt lawrencii or laurencii) by Allan Octavian Hume but more often considered synonymous with subcorax[17]—is restricted to the Sindh district of Pakistan and adjoining regions of northwestern India.[19][20] They are generally resident within their range for the whole year. In his 1950 work, Grønlands Fugle [Birds of Greenland], noted ornithologist Finn Salomonsen indicated that common ravens did not overwinter in the Arctic.[51] However, in Arctic Canada and Alaska, they are found year-round.[52][53][54] Young birds may disperse locally.[55]
