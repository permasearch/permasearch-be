In early episodes, he has an interest in classical music and is often hinted at as leading a vibrant private life. Although a stickler for tradition, he incorrectly tells Will it is proper to refer to a butler by his first name, although this is possibly because his surname and job title are the same.[4] He considers himself to be part of the English working-class, despite speaking the Queen's English, having been to Oxford and, in one episode, being wary of a relationship with a rich woman.
