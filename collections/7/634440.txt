Despite the loss of Ewing, the Knicks remained successful in the regular season, as they posted a 48–34 record under the direction of Houston and Sprewell.[66] In the first round of playoff contention, however, New York fell to the Toronto Raptors in five games, failing to get past the first round of the playoffs for the first time in a decade.[67] After a poor start to the season, the Knicks managed to get above .500 with a 10–9 record.[68] In spite of their recent success, Van Gundy unexpectedly resigned[69] as head coach on December 8, 2001 explaining he had "lost focus" and would no longer be able to properly coach the team.[70] The team, which named longtime assistant Don Chaney as their new head coach, ended the season with a 30–52 record, and for the first time since the 1986–87 season they did not qualify for the playoffs.[26][68]
