The processing of people seeking asylum that have arrived in Australia for status determination has undergone significant change over the past decade.[51] The process for refugee status determination is dynamic, with the government's humanitarian program mainly diverging in process between on-shore and off-shore arrivals.[51] While the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) had previously drafted to give effect to Australia's obligations under international law,[52]mainly the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its First Optional Protocol, recent legislative amendments by successive governments have uncouple the Act from giving effect to the Convention. This has resulted in a softening on the impact of the Convention in interpreting the Act, leading to the government resiling from the protocol set out in the international agreement.[53]
