Thales of Miletus, regarded by Aristotle as the first philosopher,[7] held that all things arise from a single material substance, water.[8] It is not because he gave a cosmogony that John Burnet calls him the "first man of science," but because he gave a naturalistic explanation of the cosmos and supported it with reasons.[9] According to tradition, Thales was able to predict an eclipse and taught the Egyptians how to measure the height of the pyramids.[10]
