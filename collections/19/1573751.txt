The IUPAC recommended symbol for mass and charge are m and Q, respectively,[3][4] however using a lowercase q for charge is also very common. Charge is a scalar property, meaning that it can be either positive (+) or negative (âˆ’). The Coulomb (C) is the SI unit of charge; however, other units can be used, such as expressing charge in terms of the elementary charge (e). The SI unit of the physical quantity m/Q is kilograms per coulomb.
