The character was inspired by British rock 'n' roll singer Vince Taylor, whom David Bowie met after Taylor had had a breakdown and believed himself to be a cross between a god and an alien.[27] However, Taylor was only part of the blueprint for the character.[28] Other influences included the cult musician Legendary Stardust Cowboy[29] and Kansai Yamamoto, who designed the costumes Bowie wore during the tour.[30] An alternative theory is that, during a tour, Bowie developed the concept of Ziggy as a melding of the persona of Iggy Pop with the music of Lou Reed, producing "the ultimate pop idol".[24][31] A girlfriend recalled his "scrawling notes on a cocktail napkin about a crazy rock star named Iggy or Ziggy", and on his return to England he declared his intention to create a character "who looks like he's landed from Mars".[24]
