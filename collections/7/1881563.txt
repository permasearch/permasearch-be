Soon after the formation of Composition of Sound, Clarke heard Wirral band Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), whose output inspired him to make electronic music.[11][12] Along with OMD, other early influences included the Human League, Daniel Miller and Fad Gadget.[13] Clarke and Fletcher switched to synthesisers, working odd jobs in order to buy or borrow the instruments from friends. Dave Gahan joined the band in 1980 after Clarke heard him perform at a local scout hut jam session, singing a rendition of David Bowie's "Heroes",[14] and Depeche Mode were born. Gahan's and Gore's favorite artists included Sparks, Siouxsie and the Banshees,[15] Cabaret Voltaire, Talking Heads and Iggy Pop.[16]
