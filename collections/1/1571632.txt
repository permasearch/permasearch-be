Therefore there was fierce religious opposition to enacting such laws for marriage, succession and adoption. The greatest opposition was to the provision of divorce, something which is anathema to the Hindu religion. Also resisted was the principle of equal inheritance by sons and daughters regardless of whether the daughter was married or unwed.[7] This was contrary to the Hindu view of family, where married daughters were regarded as belonging to the family of their husband, not to the family of their father.
