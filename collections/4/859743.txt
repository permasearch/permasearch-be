For example, Amalgamated Bio-Carbon (ABC) makes the M1 (Point-Detonating), M2 (Air-Burst), and M3 (Rebounding) fuzes for the 40mm Low Velocity grenade shell. They all have the 123 Interfix number but the Lot numbers are assigned in alternating blocks. The M1 Grenade shells get Lot Numbers 001, 004, and 007; the M2 shells get Lot Numbers -002, -005, and -008; and the M3 shells get Lot Numbers -003, -006, and -009. The M1 batches would be Lot Coded as ABC99L123-001 (made in November, 1999), ABC99M123-004 (made in December, 1999), and ABC00A123-007 (made in January, 2000). When those items were completed new Lot Sequence numbers in the Interfix series would be assigned.
