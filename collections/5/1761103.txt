In 1967, Ip and some of his students established the Ving Tsun Athletic Association (詠春體育會).[8][9] The main purpose of the Ving Tsun Athletic Association[10] was to help Ip tackle his financial difficulties in Hong Kong,[11] which was said to have caused his supposed regular use of opium.[12] One of his former students, Duncan Leung, claimed that Ip used tuition money to support his opium addiction.[13]
