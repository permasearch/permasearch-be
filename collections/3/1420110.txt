Most of Calvin's statements on the Jewry of his era were polemical. For example, Calvin once wrote, "I have had much conversation with many Jews: I have never seen either a drop of piety or a grain of truth or ingenuousness â€“ nay, I have never found common sense in any Jew."[39] In this respect, he differed little from other Protestant and Catholic theologians of his day.[40] Among his extant writings, Calvin only dealt explicitly with issues of contemporary Jews and Judaism in one treatise,[41] Response to Questions and Objections of a Certain Jew.[42] In it, he argued that Jews misread their own scriptures because they miss the unity of the Old and New Testaments.[43]
