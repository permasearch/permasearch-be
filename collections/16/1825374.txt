Neighbours has proved to be more popular in the United Kingdom than in Australia. It was screened on BBC One from 1986 until 2008. The series started airing on 27 October 1986, as part of BBC1's revamped daytime schedules.[74] Neighbours went out twice a day, with a morning broadcast and then a showing at lunchtime.[75] Michael Grade, the channel's then controller, was advised by his daughter to move the series to 5:35 pm, as she and her friends kept missing it due to them being at school,[75] which took place from January 1988. The show then started attracting larger audiences, peaking in 1990 at over 21 million.[76] Towards the late 2000s, Neighbours was normally attracting an average of 3 million viewers for its lunchtime showing and 2.6 million viewers for its early-evening repeat.[77] It was frequently the highest-rating daytime programme in the UK, outside of news bulletins.[15]
