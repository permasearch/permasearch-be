Clinical laboratories formerly measured HDL cholesterol by separating other lipoprotein fractions using either ultracentrifugation or chemical precipitation with divalent ions such as Mg2+, then coupling the products of a cholesterol oxidase reaction to an indicator reaction. The reference method still uses a combination of these techniques.[19] Most laboratories now use automated homogeneous analytical methods in which lipoproteins containing apo B are blocked using antibodies to apo B, then a colorimetric enzyme reaction measures cholesterol in the non-blocked HDL particles.[20] HPLC can also be used.[21] Subfractions (HDL-2C, HDL-3C) can be measured,[22] but clinical significance of these subfractions has not been determined.[23] The measurement of apo-A reactive capacity can be used to measure HDL cholesterol but is thought to be less accurate.
