Programs to prevent the vertical transmission of HIV (from mothers to children) can reduce rates of transmission by 92â€“99%.[75][131] This primarily involves the use of a combination of antiviral medications during pregnancy and after birth in the infant and potentially includes bottle feeding rather than breastfeeding.[75][137] If replacement feeding is acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable, and safe, mothers should avoid breastfeeding their infants; however exclusive breastfeeding is recommended during the first months of life if this is not the case.[138] If exclusive breastfeeding is carried out, the provision of extended antiretroviral prophylaxis to the infant decreases the risk of transmission.[139] In 2015, Cuba became the first country in the world to eradicate mother-to-child transmission of HIV.[140]
