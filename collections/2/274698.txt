Billboard ranked it as the No. 75 song for 1972.[2] In Canada, the single went to #3 on the RPM Top Singles Chart[3] following the album reaching #1.[4] In Britain, the song went to #1 on the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in August 1972. It also marked the first time that Alice Cooper became regarded as more than just a theatrical novelty act.
