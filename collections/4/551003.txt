With Mike's dead body stuffed in the trunk of Walt's car, Walt and Todd prepare a barrel of hydrofluoric acid. When Jesse arrives, Walt informs him that Mike is "gone." When asked by Jesse how they will deal with Mike's nine henchmen now that they will not be receiving their hazard payments, Walt tells Jesse that he will address the issue by himself now that Mike and Jesse have left the business.
