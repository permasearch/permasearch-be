The NTSB said the train was traveling at 80 mph (130 km/h) at a point soon before it derailed.[49] The speed limit on the curved track segment where the derailment occurred is 30 mph (48 km/h),[50] but the preceding track segment north of Mounts Road has a limit of 79 mph (127 km/h).[51] An initial review by the NTSB said that the train data recorders had been recovered from both locomotives. The recorder showed that the engineer had commented on the train's excessive speed six seconds before the derailment, and applied the brakes. The lead locomotive was traveling at 78 mph (126 km/h) when recording stopped. The NTSB said their investigation will take 12 to 24 months.[52] A preliminary report into the accident was published on January 4, 2018.[53]
