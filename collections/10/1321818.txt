Trial by Jury soon became the most desirable supporting piece for any London production, and, outside London, the major British theatrical touring companies had added it to their repertoire by about 1877.[31]  The original production was given a world tour by the Opera Comique's assistant manager Emily Soldene, which travelled as far as Australia.[31]  Unauthorised "pirate" productions quickly sprang up in America, taking advantage of the fact that American courts did not enforce foreign copyrights.[22][23]  It also became popular as part of the Victorian tradition of "benefit concerts", where the theatrical community came together to raise money for actors and actresses down on their luck or retiring. The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company continued to play the work for a century, licensing the piece to amateur and foreign professional companies, such as the J. C. Williamson Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Company.[32]  Since the copyrights to Gilbert and Sullivan works ran out in 1961,[33] the piece has been available to theatre companies around the world free of royalties.  The work's enduring popularity since 1875 makes it, according to theatrical scholar Kurt GÃ¤nzl, "probably the most successful British one-act operetta of all time".[2]
