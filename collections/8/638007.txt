Prevention includes not smoking, physical activity, and maintaining a healthy weight.[5] Treatment for cardiac arrest include immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and, if a shockable rhythm is present, defibrillation.[6] Among those who survive, targeted temperature management may improve outcomes.[10] An implantable cardiac defibrillator may be placed to reduce the chance of death from recurrence.[5]
