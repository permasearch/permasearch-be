The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by David Silverman.[1] When the episode was originally planned, it called for Albert Brooks to voice "BjÃ¶rn", a Swedish tennis instructor, but Brooks thought it would be funnier to make the character French and so the change was made. The title was originally to be "Bjorn to Be Wild",[3][4] thus accounting for the episode's alternate title "Jacques to Be Wild".[2] Brooks improvised almost all of his dialogue, producing over three hours of material.[5] Marge's laugh during her bowling lesson was an ad-libbed, natural laugh by Julie Kavner, who was laughing at something Albert Brooks had just said.[4] The line "four onion rings!" was one of the many lines that Brooks ad-libbed and when saying it, Jacques loses his French accent.[4] An extended audio clip of Albert Brooks' unused dialogue was made available on Disc Three of The Simpsons The Complete First Season DVD.[6]
