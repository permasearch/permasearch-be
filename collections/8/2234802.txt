Scott and Rawlings had also become attached to several of the musical cues they had used for the temporary score while editing the film, and re-edited some of Goldsmith's cues and re-scored several sequences to match these cues and even left the temporary score in place in some parts of the finished film.[53] Goldsmith later remarked that "you can see that I was sort of like going at opposite ends of the pole with the filmmakers."[53] Nevertheless, Scott praised Goldsmith's score as "full of dark beauty"[56] and "seriously threatening, but beautiful."[53] It was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score, a Grammy Award for Best Soundtrack Album, and a BAFTA Award for Best Film Music.[12] The score has been released as a soundtrack album in several versions with different tracks and sequences.[59]
