In 2014, Mormons Building Bridges, a group which works to improve relations between the LDS and LGBT communities, sought entry to march in the parade, but was denied because the group was deemed too controversial by the parade organizers.[2] In response, the Salt Lake City Council considered boycotting their invitation to participate in the parade, but ultimately decided against a boycott as a Council, instead opting to simply express their opposition to the exclusion of Mormons Building Bridges.[3] Council member Erin Mendenhall chose to decline her invitation to participate in the parade when after submitting the bio of her guest, a gay stay-at-home father married to a man, the organizers of the parade returned that only immediate relatives were eligible as guests of the Council. Previously, the Council had been informed they could bring "one adult guest".[4]
