As a part of an ongoing feud with Triple H, the two competed alongside Chris Benoit in the main event match at WrestleMania XX for the World Heavyweight Championship. The former DX partners both came up short in the match, however, as Benoit won the championship.[89] The night before this, Shawn Michaels inducted Tito Santana in the WWE Hall of Fame. At Bad Blood in June, Michaels lost to Triple H in a Hell in a Cell match.[89] Four months later, he lost a World Heavyweight championship match against Triple H, after Edge interfered at Taboo Tuesday, when the fans voted for him ahead of Edge and Chris Benoit to face Triple H one more time.[90] Following this, Michaels was out of action for a few months with a legit torn meniscus.[4][91]
