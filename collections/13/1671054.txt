President Quezon officially conferred the title of field marshal on MacArthur in a ceremony at Malaca√±an Palace on 24 August 1936, and presented him with a gold baton and a unique uniform.[110] The Philippine Army was formed from conscription. Training was conducted by a regular cadre, and the Philippine Military Academy was created along the lines of West Point to train officers.[111] MacArthur and Eisenhower found that few of the training camps had been constructed and the first group of 20,000 trainees did not report until early 1937.[112] Equipment and weapons were "more or less obsolete" American cast offs, and the budget of six million was completely inadequate.[111] MacArthur's requests for equipment fell on deaf ears, although MacArthur and his naval advisor, Lieutenant Colonel Sidney L. Huff, persuaded the Navy to initiate the development of the PT boat.[113] Much hope was placed in the Philippine Army Air Corps, but the first squadron was not organized until 1939.[114]
