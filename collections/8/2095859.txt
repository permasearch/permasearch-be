Flanagan maintained accounts on Facebook and Twitter, which were suspended after he was named as a suspect in the shooting. On both profiles, he repeated his claims of racial discrimination by WDBJ, specifically naming Parker and Ward. Flanagan claimed that, while working with Parker during her internship at WDBJ, she had made a coded racist remark regarding a friend who lived on Cotton Hill Road (an existing street that runs to the southwest of Starkey in southern Roanoke County), and that Ward had filed a complaint against him to WDBJ's human resources department after working with him on one occasion.[56]
