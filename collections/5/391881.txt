Under Kidd's guidance, the young Nets team prospered through the playoffs, won the Eastern Conference title and advanced to the franchise's first-ever appearance in the NBA Finals. Along the way they had some memorable moments including a double overtime victory against the Indiana Pacers in the decisive Game 5 (NBA used to have a 2-2-1 format for the playoffs first round back then). Indiana's Reggie Miller forced the first overtime with a 35-foot 3-pointer at the buzzer and the second one with a two-handed dunk, but the Nets eventually survived and beat Indiana 120-109. Kidd scored 20 of his then playoffs-best 31 points in the 4th quarter and overtimes.[13] After defeating the Charlotte Hornets 4-1 in the second round, the Nets then faced the Boston Celtics in the Conference Finals. In that series Kidd and the Nets experienced the biggest 4th quarter collapse in the playoffs history, when the Celtics came back from a 21-point deficit to win the pivotal Game 3, taking a 2-1 series lead.[14] However, the Nets then won three consecutive games, while Kidd averaged a triple double for the entire series.[15] In the NBA Finals the Nets were swept in four games by Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant's Los Angeles Lakers.
