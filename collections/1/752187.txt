At the beginning of the 1960s the major studios began to reissue older films for syndication and transformed into mainly producing telefilms and b-movies to supply TV's demand for programming.[13] Between 1969 and 1971 the industry underwent a severe recession, due in part to  big-budget flops, but soon recovered artistically with such films as The Godfather (1972) and Chinatown (1974).
