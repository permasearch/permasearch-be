After graduating summa cum laude from Berklee College of Music in 1998,[4] Djawadi garnered the attention of Hans Zimmer, who recruited him to Remote Control Productions.[5] Djawadi moved to Los Angeles and worked as an assistant to Klaus Badelt. From there on he made additional music and arrangements for Badelt and Zimmer movies, such as Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl and the Academy Award nominated film, Something's Gotta Give. In 1999, he had co-composed the music for System Shock 2, the second installment in the series. In 2003, he did the score of Beat the Drum along with Badelt.[6]
