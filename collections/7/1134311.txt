Elena, Stefan and Maria arrive at Mystic Falls but Liv and Luke (Chris Brochu) ambush them and by using magic they cause their car to crush. Maria dies and Elena and Stefan try to get away from them. Liv and Luke want to kill at least one of them so the travelers will not be able to complete the spell that will strip away all the magic from Mystic Falls. In the meantime, the travelers started the spell and Liv and Luke start losing their magic power. Elena and Stefan's rings also stop working and they start getting burned by the sun. They run and hide to avoid the sun and head to find Damon, Caroline and the rest. Maria's spirit appears to Bonnie to pass to the other side and asks Bonnie to tell Julian that she tried to save him.
