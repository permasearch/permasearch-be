As was the case in many European armies, except the Prussian Army, officers in British service could purchase commissions to ascend the ranks.[497] Despite repeated attempts by Parliament to suppress it, the practise was common in the Army.[498] Values of commissions varied, but were usually in line with social and military prestige, for example, regiments such as the Guards commanded the highest prices.[499] The lower ranks often regarded the treatment to high-ranking commissions by wealthier officers as "plums for [their] consumption".[500] Wealthy individuals lacking any formal military education, or practical experience, often found their way into positions of high responsibility, diluting the effectiveness of a regiment.[501] Though Royal authority had forbade the practise since 1711, it was still permitted for infants to hold commissions. Young boys, often orphans of deceased wealthy officers, were taken from their schooling and placed in positions of responsibility within regiments.[502]
