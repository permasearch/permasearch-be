Dylan sits forward holding his cat (named Rolling Stone)[10] and has an opened magazine featuring an advertisement on Jean Harlow's Life Story by the columnist Louella Parsons resting on his crossed leg. The cufflinks Dylan wore in the picture were a gift from Joan Baez, as she later referenced in her 1975 song "Diamonds & Rust". Daniel Kramer won a Grammy nomination for best album cover for the photograph.
