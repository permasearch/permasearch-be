Bianca Gracie of Billboard said "Minaj sounds cocky in the best way […] she resurrects her Nicki the Ninja alter-ego by assassinating the horn-driven beat with her lyrical wordplay, switching accents with ease."[14] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said, "these are sparring records–loose, pugnacious, a little uncentered […] "Chun-Li" swaggers with the authority of the mid-90s. As is the norm, Ms. Minaj aims shots at unnamed antagonists, but in the past, that bluster felt truly targetless. But now, for the first time since the beginning of her career, there's someone who might plausibly shoot back, and win."[15] John Kennedy from XXL said the song is "open enough for Nicki [Minaj] to get her bars off à la her mixtape days."[5]
