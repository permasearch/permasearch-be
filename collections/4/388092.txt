Sofonisba Anguissola's self portraits also offer evidence of what she thought her place was as a woman artist. Normally, men were seen as creative actors and woman as passive objects, but in her self portrait of 1556, Anguissola presents herself as the artist, separating herself from the role as the object to be painted.[7] Additional pieces show how she rebels against the notion that women are objects, in essence an instrument to be played by men. Her self portrait of 1561 show her playing an instrument, taking on a different role. [8]
