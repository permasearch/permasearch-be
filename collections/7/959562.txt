The Chicago Tribune gave the "weird new Broadway musical" a very positive review and said it was a "remarkable and boundlessly compassionate and humanistic piece of theater."[18] Tablet Magazine thought it was "terrific."[19] Entertainment Weekly also said very positive things, praising Katrina Lenk's portrayal of the cafe owner Dina as "dazzling." It gave the production an A-, and said it is "understated, probably better described as charming than life-altering, but its scale reinforces the moral themes of the musical itself."[20] The Washington Post observed that "producers unaffiliated with the show say they are heartened by its run," as the "almost minimalist" production was doing well despite not having what seemed to be "a lot of overt commercial potential."[21]
