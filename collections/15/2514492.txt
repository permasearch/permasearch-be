The third movement is in a rondo form. The A section begins with a cheery theme by the solo violin and crisp accompaniment underneath it. After a theme played as a double-stops by the solo violin, the B section begins in measure 35 with light solo violin and accompaniment. This soon turns to a series of scales in legato which brings in another rhythmic melody by the solo violin. The solo violin reiterates the main melody in measure 93 which indicates the return of the A section. After the condensed version of the A section, the C section begins in measure 108 with graceful arpeggios. In measure 143, the solo violin enters with the materials from the B section. Finally, the solo violin brings in the main melody from the A section in measure 187. The A section leads to a new section that starts with solo violin alone in measure 222 where the materials are worked out. This section again finishes with a small cadenza by the solo violin in measure 266. The coda begins at measure 267 with a faster tempo marking. In the coda, the melody from the A section is rhythmically reshaped with a quarter note and a triplet. The coda finishes with subito forte chords.
