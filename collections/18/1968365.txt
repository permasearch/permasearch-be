Madigan further stated, "We have given the governor six days to resign."[65] He also stated that the committee would work every day except Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Year's Eve, and New Year's Day until they had completed their report. The Illinois House would decide whether to impeach after the committee completed its review. The Illinois Senate would then have a trial to remove the Governor from office.[69] Illinois House Majority Leader Barbara Flynn Currie was the chairperson of the Special Committee on Impeachment.[76][104]
