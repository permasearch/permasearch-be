Seed of Chucky is the fifth installment, and the first film other than the original Child's Play not to be distributed by Universal Pictures. Chucky and Tiffany's child Glen finds his parents six years later and brings them back to life, but is horrified by their murders. Chucky and Tiffany force a pregnancy on actress Jennifer Tilly, which is accelerated by voodoo magic. Glen suffers a split personality disorder, having both a male and female soul in his/her body, and dismembers his father. Tiffany uses the ritual to take over Tilly's body and as Tilly bears twins, Glen's dual personality now has a body each of its own. In an epilogue set five years later, one of Chucky's severed arms is mailed to the home of his family, where it attacks the now-human Glen.
