The Japanese Garden, located on the grounds of the Tillman Water Reclamation Plant in Van Nuys, California, designed by California architect Anthony J. Lumsden, 333 miles (536Â km) south, was used to film the main academy's campus near San Francisco; images of the Golden Gate Bridge were superimposed to make the scene appear as if it were indeed on San Francisco Bay.[2]
