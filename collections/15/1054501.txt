During the original 1985 production, the set was very simple with a small amount of furniture and the set walls consisted of white-washed plywood.[1] All along these walls and even the theatre walls, there were facts, newspaper headlines, figures and names that were involved in the HIV/AIDS Epidemic painted in black.[1] For example, one of the passages written on the set read, “During the first nineteen months of the epidemic, The New York Times wrote about it a total of seven times” and another passage read, “During the three months of the Tylenol scare in 1982, The New York Times wrote about it a total of 54 times”.[1] The text that was painted onto the set was updated and revised constantly. One fact stated the latest number of AIDS cases nationally (according to the Centers for Disease Control), and if the number increased, before the next performance the set designers would cross out the old number and, below it, paint the new figure.[1]
