Disraeli's biographer Jonathan Parry writes that the financial failure and personal criticism that Disraeli suffered in 1825 and 1826 were probably the trigger for a serious nervous crisis affecting him over the next four years: 'He had always been moody, sensitive, and solitary by nature, but now became seriously depressed and lethargic.'[43] He was still living with his parents in London, but in search of the 'change of air' recommended by the family's doctors, his father took a succession of houses in the country and on the coast before Disraeli would finally seek wider horizons.[48]
