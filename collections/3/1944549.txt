Schottky defects are observed most frequently when there is a small difference in size between cations and anions. This is produced as the result of the thermal incorporation of unoccupied lattice sites from the exterior of the crystal. The lattice undergoes thermal vibration and thermal expansion when the temperature is raised above 0Â K. When it happens the pair of vacancies are incorporated in the crystal. So electrical neutrality is maintained inside the crystals.
