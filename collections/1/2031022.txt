With Phase one funding and construction underway, Metro pushed to accelerate phase 2. On January 4, 2017, the second phase of the Purple Line subway, which will connect Beverly Hills and Century City to Downtown Los Angeles by rail, received more than $1.6 billion in federal grants and loans. The federal money, in combination with $747 million in local sales tax revenue, gives the Metropolitan Transportation Authority enough funding to begin construction on the next phase of the long-awaited rail project along the route.[41] Both phases are under construction and Metro is now looking for funding on phase three (UCLA and VA Stations) and for the Federal government (Trump Administration) from keeping funding away that was previously granted by the Obama Administration.
