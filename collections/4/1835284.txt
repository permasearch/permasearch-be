The 1931 National Science Museum copy of what remains of a sequence shot in Roundhay Garden features 20 frames. The frames appear to have been printed in reverse from the negative, but this is corrected in the video. The film's damaged edge results in distortion and deformation on the right side of the stabilised digital movie. The scene was shot in Le Prince's father-in-law's garden at Oakwood Grange, Roundhay on October 14, 1888. The NMPFT animation lasts 2 seconds at 24fps (frames per second), meaning the original footage is playing at 10fps. In this version, the action is speeded up, the original footage was probably shot at 7fps.
