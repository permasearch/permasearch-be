Fluent in Spanish and English, he often lectures and leads retreats in the United States.[3] In February 2002, Ruiz suffered a near-fatal heart attack. The damage from the heart attack and subsequent coma left him with a heart functioning at only 16% of capacity and in constant pain.[4] He claims to have handed over an Eagle-Knight lineage[5] to his son Don JosÃ© Ruiz. On October 9, 2010, Ruiz underwent a heart transplant at a hospital in Los Angeles. He was at a retreat at the Lotus Ranch in Wimberley, Texas when he was notified that a heart was available, and had chartered a plane to get back to Los Angeles.[3]
