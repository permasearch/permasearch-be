Despite the excellent play of Cousins and Evans, both of whom were front-runners in Rookie of the Year voting[18][19] and received All-Rookie First Team honors,[20][21] the Kings still ranked near the bottom of the NBA, going 25–57 in Evans' rookie year, and 24–58 in Cousins' rookie year. Much of this was due to the poor fit of the roster around Evans and Cousins, and the uninspired coaching of Westphal.
