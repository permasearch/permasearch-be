When actress Tabassum spotted her, she made her sing live in her show Tabassum Hit Parade and asked her family to shift to Mumbai.[8] She then introduced Chauhan to Kalyanji Virji Shah and Anandji Virji Shah.[9] Upon meeting, Kalyanji changed her name from Nidhi to Sunidhi as he felt that it is a lucky name.[10] When she was 11, her dad quit his job and brought her to Mumbai. Initially, the family had financial difficulties in adjusting life to the city. After that she worked in Kalyanji's academy for few years and became the lead singer in his "Little Wonders" troupe.[11] She was then offered with many shows, though her father insisted on singing for films.[1]
