As the song progresses, a guitar lick in the main riff becomes more prominent.[12] During the instrumental break, the riff temporarily recofigures to a nonstandard 6/4 beat before returning to the original 4/4 beat.[5][12] Casale and Mothersbaugh sing the vocals of "Whip It" with a vocal range of A4-F#5.[11] The singers take alternate turns on vocals; Casale uses a nasal drawl while Mothersbaugh sings in a more powerful "cartoonish" voice.[12] The use of two vocalists is a call and response that Casale said is "kind of like white boys rapping".[8]
