On June 13, 1915, the first test train on the IRT Flushing Line ran between Grand Central and Vernon Boulevard–Jackson Avenue, followed by the start of revenue service on June 22. Over the next thirteen years, the line was extended piece by piece between Times Square and Flushing–Main Street, after the former opened on March 14, 1927. Shovels used to dig the subterranean portion of the end of the line from Corona to Flushing Main Street were provided by the Marion Power Shovel Company.[4]
