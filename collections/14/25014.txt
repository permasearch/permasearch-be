Following the 2004–05 NHL lock-out, the Maple Leafs experienced their longest playoff drought in the club's history. They struggled in 2005–06 and, despite a late-season surge (9–1–2 in their final 12 games), led by third-string goaltender Jean-Sebastien Aubin, Toronto was out of playoff contention for the first time since 1998.[97] This marked the first time the team had missed under Quinn, who was later relieved as head coach.[98] Quinn's dismissal was controversial since many of the young players who were key contributors to the Leafs' late-season run had been drafted by him before Ferguson's arrival, while Ferguson's signings (Jason Allison, Belfour, Alexander Khavanov, and Eric Lindros) had suffered season-ending injuries.[98][99]
