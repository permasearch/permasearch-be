The Hildesheim Cathedral School (Hildesheimer Domschule, de), which had rooms in the cloisters, was one of the most significant educational institutions of the Ottonian and Salian periods. Its library has served as the Hildesheim Cathedral library (German: Dombibliothek Hildesheim) since 815; it is the oldest library in Northern Germany.[5]
