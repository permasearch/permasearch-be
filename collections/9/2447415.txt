Like most alkaloids, tubocurarine consists of a cyclic system with a nitrogen atom in an amine group.[20] Because of this structure, tubocurarine can bind readily to the receptors for acetylcholine (ACh) at the neuromuscular junction, which blocks nerve impulses from being sent to the skeletal muscles, effectively paralyzing the muscles of the body. Since tubocurarine binds reversibly to the ACh receptors, treatment for curare poisoning involves adding an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor, which will stop the destruction of acetylcholine so that it can compete with curare.[21]
