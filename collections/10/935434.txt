In the Czech Republic, the word město (city) is used for very wide variety of municipalities, ranging from Prague, the largest and capital city with approximately 1.2 million inhabitants, to the smallest, Přebuz, with just 74 inhabitants.  Technically, a municipality must have at least 3,000 inhabitants to be granted the město title, although many smaller municipalities,  especially some former mining towns, retain the title město for historic reasons.  Currently, approximately 192 of the 592 města have less than 3,000 inhabitants.
