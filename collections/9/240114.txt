In the 1995–96 NBA season the Bucks unveiled a hunter green alternate uniform. The script "Bucks" lettering was in white fading to silver and purple and numbers were in white with green and purple trim. The uniform featured the graphic deer logo on the right side. They were retired after the 1998–99 NBA season. It would be resurrected for the 2012–13 NBA season during Hardwood Classics Nights, to updated uniform standards.
