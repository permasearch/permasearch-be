The Broadly Experienced Foreign Architect (BEFA) program has been phased out and is no longer available as a path to NCARB certification for foreign architects. According to NCARB, "Foreign architects seeking NCARB certification can complete two programs required for licensure in the United States: the Architectural Experience Program (AXP) and the Architect Registration Exam (ARE)." The Foreign Architect Path to Certification requires candidates to hold a degree from an accredited, validated, or officially recognized architecture program that leads to a license or credential for the unlimited practice of architecture in the foreign country. This path also requires that you be a registered architect in good standing in the foreign country.
