Peter Reum, a therapist who met Wilson while attending a Beach Boys fan convention in 1990, was alarmed by Wilson's demeanor, speculating that he may be suffering from tardive dyskinesia, a neurological condition brought on by prolonged usage of antipsychotic medication.[28] Reum phoned biographer David Leaf, who then reported Reum's observations to Brian's brother Carl Wilson.[29] It was then discovered that Landy had been named as a chief beneficiary in a 1989 revision of Brian's will,[29] collecting 70%, with the remainder split between his girlfriend and Brian's two daughters.[4] This discovery was made by Kay Gilmer, a publicist employed by Landy in March 1990. She phoned Gary Usher to explain why his messages weren't being returned, to which Usher warned: "If Landy knows that you're calling me, he'd kill you. He'd literally kill you."[30] Gilmer left her job two weeks later, taking expired drug bottles as well as names, phone numbers, and bank account information that she later turned over to the California Board of Medical Quality Assurance.[30]
