"Up to the Mountain" gained visibility through a live rendition by Kelly Clarkson, featuring intertwined electric guitar by Jeff Beck, on an April 25, 2007 charity episode of the sixth season of American Idol, entitled 'Idol Gives Back'.[6] The event was dedicated to poverty relief in Africa and in Hurricane Katrina-related areas in the United States. This event came in the middle of Clarkson's artistic struggle with her record company and management;[2] they wanted her to promote her new single "Never Again", while she thought to do so at a charity event would be "beyond crass".[2] Clarkson—an avowed Griffin fan[3]—instead picked "Up to the Mountain". The audience gave the song and the performance a standing ovation; Beck subsequently said, "[she has] this fully developed soul voice that I wasn't expecting. It just knocked me out. It was quite riveting to listen to. At one point, the audience started to stand up. They were so moved by her."[2] Idol judge Simon Cowell stated the performance was the best of the show.[2]
