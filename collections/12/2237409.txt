Special signature machines, called autopens, are capable of automatically reproducing an individual's signature.  These are typically used by people required to sign a lot of printed matter, such as celebrities, heads of state or CEOs.[citation needed] More recently, Members of Congress in the United States have begun having their signature made into a TrueType font file. This allows staff members in the Congressman's office to easily reproduce it on correspondence, legislation, and official documents.[citation needed]In the East Asian languages of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, people traditionally use stamp-like objects known as name-seals with the name carved in tensho script (seal script) in lieu of a handwritten signature.[citation needed]
