The geosyncline concept was first developed by the American geologists James Hall and James Dwight Dana in the mid-19th century during the classic studies of the Appalachian Mountains.[1][4] Ã‰mile Haug actualized the geosyncline concept and "reintroduced" it to Europe with a 1900 publication.[5][6] Eduard Suess, a leading geologist of his time, disapproved the concept of geosyncline and argued in 1909 against its use due to its associated theories.[6][7] This did not stop further development of the concept by Leopold Kober and Hans Stille in the first half of the 20th century,[8] both of whom worked on a contracting Earth framework.[8] Stille and Kober had rather similar views.[9]
