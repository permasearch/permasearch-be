In English usage since the early modern period the Crimean Khanate is referred to as Crim Tartary.[17] The  Italian[18] form Crimea (and "Crimean peninsula") also becomes current during the 18th century,[19] gradually replacing the classical name of Tauric Peninsula in the course of the 19th century. The omission of the definite article in English ("Crimea" rather than "the Crimea") became common during the later 20th century.[citation needed]
