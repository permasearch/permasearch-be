Ressler.[15][16] Dr. Wendy Carr is based on psychologist Dr. Ann Wolbert Burgess, a prominent Boston College professor who collaborated with the FBI agents in the Behavioral Science Unit and procured grants to conduct research on serial murderers, serial rapists, and child molesters.[17][18] Her work is based on treating survivors of sexual trauma and abuse, and studying the thought process of violent offenders.[18] The serial killer characters were modeled on the actual convicted criminals and their prison scene dialogues were taken from real interviews.[19]
