The second test was the Boxing Day Test played at Melbourne. Australia won the toss and chose to bat. The first two wickets fell quickly and Australia were 2–28, but Michael Slater and Mark Waugh took them past 120, before Waugh fell. The rest of the Australian middle order also contributed, notably Ponting and Gilchrist, and Australia reached 405. The Indian openers failed to see off even the first ten overs and India were 2–11. The rest of the batting followed suit, only Sachin Tendulkar standing amongst the ruins as India were dismissed for 238. Sachin Tendulkar scored 116.
