A second headbox may be added to a conventional fourdrinier to put a different fibre blend on top of a base layer.  A secondary headbox is normally located at a point where the base sheet is completely drained.  This is not considered a separate ply because the water action does a good job of intermixing the fibers of the top and bottom layer.  Secondary headboxes are common on linerboard.
