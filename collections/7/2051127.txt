Greenspan, because of his position as the Fed chairman, was not at liberty to accept the $10,000 honorarium, the $15,000 sculpture, nor the crystal trophy, but only accepted the "honor" of being named an Enron Prize recipient.[65] The situation was further complicated because a few days earlier, Enron had filed paperwork admitting it had falsified financial statements for five years.[66] Greenspan did not mention Enron a single time during his speech.[67] At the ceremony, Ken Lay stated, "I'm looking forward to our first woman recipient."[68] The next morning, it was reported in the Houston Chronicle that no decision had been made on whether the name of the prize would be changed.[69] 19 days after the prize was awarded to Greenspan, Enron declared bankruptcy.[70]
