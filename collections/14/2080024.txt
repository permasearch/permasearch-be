Another traditional source appears in the form of a Scots proverb, "Ye maunna tramp on the Scotch thistle, laddie", this being immortalised in marble by Glasgow monumental sculptors James Gibson & Co. for the Kelvingrove International Exhibition of 1888.[8] The phrase "Wha daur meddle wi' me?" also appears in a traditional border ballad entitled "Little Jock Elliot",[9] which recalls the exploits of a 16th-century Border Reiver ("John Elliot of the Park"), with particular reference to an infamous encounter in the summer of 1566 with James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell,[10] the third husband of Mary, Queen of Scots.
