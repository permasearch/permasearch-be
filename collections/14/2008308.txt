From the perspective of modern science, the main obstacle to the evolution of speech-like communication in nature is not a mechanistic one. Rather, it is that symbols — arbitrary associations of sounds with corresponding meanings — are unreliable and may well be false.[92] As the saying goes, "words are cheap".[93] The problem of reliability was not recognised at all by Darwin, Müller or the other early evolutionist theorists.
