These adventures are structured so that encounters do not just involve monsters to fight, although statistics are provided for combat.[1] The eponymous adventure "The Vortex of Madness" involves a powerful prisoner held in a magical prison on the plane of Limbo; this location provides a tie-in adventure to connect all of the other locations together.[1]
