On 25 September 2012, Traffic Officer John Walmsley became the first HETO killed on duty. Officer Walmsley was 59 years old. At about 14:50 Officer Walmsley was deployed to attend a single vehicle collision on the M25. Officer Walmsley and his colleague dragged the damaged vehicle onto the hard shoulder using their patrol vehicle and tow rope. The traffic was then released and normal traffic flow resumed but with speed advisory caution signs illuminated on the overhead matrix gantries. Whilst at the scene awaiting recovery for the crashed vehicle Officer Walmsley was observing passing vehicles whilst implementing traffic management to protect the scene, when an approaching car lost control and spun towards him. Officer Walmsley could not react in time, and the out of control car struck him causing fatal injuries. Over 400 people attended his funeral including 200 traffic officers from all over England. In 2013 a woman in her 40s pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving and was sentenced to 150 hours community service and a 3-year driving disqualification.
