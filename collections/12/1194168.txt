As of December 2015[update], there were around 4,000 electric cars in Denmark.[218] Denmark is the second largest European market for light-duty plug-in electric commercial vehicles or utility vans, with over 2,600 plug-in electric vans sold in 2015, representing an 8.5% market share of all vans sold in the country. Most of the van sold in the Danish market are plug-in hybrids, accounting for almost all of the plug-in hybrid van sales across the European Union.[13] As of 2014[update], the country generated about a third of its electric power from wind energy,[219] but some of it is exported to hydropower storage in Norway and elsewhere because there is currently no way for utilities to store the excess power inside Denmark.
