Explicit claims of Jesus being the messiah are found in the canonical gospels in the Confession of Peter (e.g. Matthew 16:16) and the words of Jesus before his judges at his trial before the Sanhedrin.[31][38] These incidents involve far more than a mere Messianic claim; taken in their setting, they constitute a claim to be the Son of God.[31]
