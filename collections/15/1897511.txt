On August 19, 1933, E service officially began, running between Roosevelt Avenue â€“ Jackson Heights and the Hudson Terminal (current World Trade Center station). The E would not yet run express via Queens Boulevard as the IND Crosstown Line did not yet fully open until Brooklyn, and the Queens Boulevard Line had not yet opened to Jamaica.[3][4][5]
