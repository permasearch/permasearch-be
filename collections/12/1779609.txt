"Venus and Mars" is an acoustic, folk-like song representing the perspective of a concertgoer waiting for the show to start.[6][7]  Originally when the song was released fans believed the title referred to Paul and Linda.[1][8]  Paul has denied this, stating that the song "is about an imaginary friend who's got a girlfriend who's the kind of person who asks what your sign is before they say hello. That's it: 'A good friend of mine studies the stars.'  In fact, in the first verse it's 'a good friend of mine follows the stars,' so it could be ambiguous: a groupie or an astrologer."[1]  The song is in the key of D major.[8]
