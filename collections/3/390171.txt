It is famous for Nagpur oranges and is sometimes known as the Orange City for being a major trade center of oranges cultivated in the region.[19] The city was founded in 1703 by the Gonds King Bakht Buland Shah of Deogarh[20] and later became a part of the Maratha Empire under the royal Bhonsale dynasty. The British East India Company took over Nagpur in the 19th century and made it the capital of the Central Provinces and Berar. After the first reorganisation of states, the city lost its status as the capital. Following the informal Nagpur Pact between political leaders, it was made the second capital of Maharashtra.
