As of 2016[update], the population of Vietnam as standing at approximately 94.6 million people. The population had grown significantly from the 1979 census, which showed the total population of reunified Vietnam to be 52.7 million.[125] In 2012, the country's population was estimated at approximately 90.3 million.[7] Currently, the total fertility rate of Vietnam is 1.8 (births per woman),[126] which is largely due to the government's family planning policy, the two-child policy.
