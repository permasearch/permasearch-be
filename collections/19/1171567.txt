Klaus, his father (later revealed to be his step-father), half-brothers and half-sister became the very first vampires after their mother, a witch, cast a spell on them in order to protect them from werewolves. It was later found out that his mother was adulterous, and Klaus' biological father was a werewolf, which makes Klaus the only original vampire-werewolf hybrid in existence. However, his werewolf powers were bound to the moonstone by a band of witches, which includes his mother. To release his werewolf powers a ritual, in which a werewolf, a vampire and a Petrova doppelgänger have to be sacrificed, has to take place. The first Petrova doppelgänger Klaus found was Katerina Petrova, but she escaped Klaus with the moonstone and hung herself in order to become a vampire so that she would be useless for the ritual. Klaus then wanted revenge on Katerina, causing her to spend centuries running from him.
