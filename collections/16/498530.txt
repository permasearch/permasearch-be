AFDC (originally called Aid to Dependent Children) was created during the Great Depression to alleviate the burden of poverty for families with children and allow widowed mothers to maintain their households.  The New Deal employment program such as the Works Progress Administration primarily served men.   Prior to the New Deal, anti-poverty programs were primarily operated by private charities or state or local governments; however, these programs were overwhelmed by the depth of need during the Depression.[40]   The United States has no national program of cash assistance for non-disabled poor individuals who are not raising children.
