On 6 June 2014, Benzema was named in France's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, making his debut in the tournament.[256] In the team's first match, a 3–0 win against Honduras in Porto Alegre on 15 June, he scored a goal in each half, the first from a penalty kick. He also assisted the team's second goal when his shot rebounded off the post and was fumbled over the goal-line by Honduran goalkeeper Noel Valladares for an own goal, the first World Cup goal given by goal-line technology.[257] He later added a third goal sealing France's 3–0 victory against Honduras. He was named by FIFA as man of the match for his performance.[258] In the second group fixture, he scored and had a penalty saved in a 5–2 defeat of Switzerland, as Les Bleus all but secured qualification to the knockout stage.[259] France were later knocked out by Germany in the quarter-final stage of the tournament.[260][261][262]
