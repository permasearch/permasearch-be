This property is located above the Pier Diner in Summer Bay. It was first seen in August 2015 when Charlotte King (Erika Heynatz) and her son Hunter (Scott Lee) moved in. Hunter moves out a couple of months later, while Charlotte leaves the flat after the police come to arrest her for murder. The next occupants are Roo Stewart (Georgie Parker), Maddy Osborne (Kassandra Clementi) and Matt Page (Alec Snow). In May 2016, Maddy departs the Bay.[12] Matt's sister Eloise "Elly" Page (Darcey Wilson) runs away from her aunt and Roo and Matt allow her to live with them. Matt and Elly move to Vietnam with Evelyn MacGuire. Roo moves back to the Summer bay house. Kat Chapman (Pia Miller) and Martin Ashford (George Mason) move in, after Ash wins custody of Luc Patterson. Ash's brother Patrick Stanwood (Luke McKenzie) briefly stays with them.[13] Raffy Morrison (Olivia Deeble) also stays briefly, but leaves after Kat and Ash break up and Kat moves out. Ash and Luc leave when Ash cannot afford to pay the rent himself. Kat moves back in with Scarlett Snow (Tania Nolan), until Scarlett leaves Summer Bay with her husband. Robbo (Jake Ryan) moves in with Kat. But she dies in a car crash and he goes on the run, before being arrested. Senior Constable Colby Thorne (Tim Franklin) rents the flat and allows Robbo to stay with him.[14]
