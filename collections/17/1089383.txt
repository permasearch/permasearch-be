After Miami joined the American Football League (AFL) for the 1966 season, it played against Buffalo for the first time on September 18. The host Bills posted 48 points in the first half of the game, and won 58–24.[4] In the second game between the teams, and the first to be played in Miami, the Bills shut out the Dolphins 29–0.[1] The following year, Miami defeated Buffalo for the first time; a late 31-yard Bob Griese touchdown pass to Howard Twilley gave the Dolphins a 17–14 win.[5] In 1968, the teams played to a 14–14 tie, the only one in the rivalry. After two consecutive Dolphins victories, the Bills won the teams' second game in 1969, 28–3.[1] The game, which featured two receiving touchdowns by O. J. Simpson, proved to be their last win in the series for 11 years.[4]
