Plutarch was a Platonist, but was open to the influence of the Peripatetics, and in some details even to Stoicism despite his criticism of their principles.[34] He rejected only Epicureanism absolutely.[34] He attached little importance to theoretical questions and doubted the possibility of ever solving them.[35] He was more interested in moral and religious questions.[35]
