While both Fletcher and Godber are the show's main characters, the series is supported by two major supporting characters. The first is Mr Mackay, a tough prison officer with clear dislike of Fletcher, who often comes into conflict with him, and who secretly mocks him at times. The other is Mr Barrowclough, a far more sympathetic and timid prison officer, and Mackay's subordinate, who is more prone to manipulation by his charges because of the nature of his character.
