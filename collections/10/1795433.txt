Roger's whims as a new "Master" are angering Tony and exhausting Jeannie. But Roger finds himself in serious trouble when he keeps Dr. Bellows' niece out too late on a date. Further complicating matters, he believes the couple subletting his apartment are genies! Herbie Faye (uncredited) appears as "Mr. Billings", Bernard Fox as Arnie, and Emmaline Henry as Myrt. Henry would become a regular cast member the very next season as Amanda Bellows, Dr. Bellows's wife.
