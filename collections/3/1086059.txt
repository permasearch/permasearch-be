Louis prepared for war against the Republic. His first and primary objective was to gain the support of England.[6] England felt threatened by the Dutch naval power; it had therefore fought the first (1652–54) and second (1665–67) of the Anglo-Dutch Wars. Thus, the English did not need much encouragement to leave the Triple Alliance, but to help things along, Louis agreed to send financial support in the amount of three million pounds annually.[7] Sweden agreed to indirectly support the invasion of the Republic, by threatening Brandenburg-Prussia if that state should intervene.
