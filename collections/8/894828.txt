Venusian clouds are thick and are composed mainly (75-96%) of sulfuric acid droplets.[37] These clouds obscure the surface of Venus from optical imaging, and reflect about 75%[38] of the sunlight that falls on them.[1] The geometric albedo, a common measure of reflectivity, is the highest of any planet in the Solar System. This high reflectivity potentially enables any probe exploring the cloud tops sufficient solar energy such that solar cells can be fitted anywhere on the craft.[39] The density of the clouds is highly variable with the densest layer at about 48.5Â km, reaching 0.1 g/m3 similar to the lower range of cumulonimbus storm clouds on Earth.[40]
