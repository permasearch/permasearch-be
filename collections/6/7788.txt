On June 3, 1990, after each Premier met individually with the Prime Minister at 24 Sussex Drive, the First Ministers met at the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Hull.[47] Scheduled as a one-day meeting, the premiers instead met for a week at the National Conference Centre and the Government Conference Centre. The combined media presence outside lent to an atmosphere of chaos and drama, with repeated intonations by Mulroney and other Federal officials that acceptance of the accord was necessary for the very survival of Canada.[47][48] As the process wore on, journalists noted that the secrecy and spin began to echo the original meetings that had created problems in the first place.[49] Historian Michael Bliss described the spectacle as "nauseating".[50]
