On 28 September 2017, Russian president Vladimir Putin made an official visit to Ankara to meet with his counterpart Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan. This visit should demonstrate unity between the two powers although a number of bilateral problems, such as import restrictions for consumer products, are still in place. The meeting was held in reaction to the possible break-up of Iraq and Syria due to the popular referendum by the Kurds in Northern Iraq for the foundation of a sovereign Kurdish nation. The official Turkish leadership rejects the validity of such a movement, while Russia stated that a Kurdish separatist movement can destabilise the region even further.[30]
