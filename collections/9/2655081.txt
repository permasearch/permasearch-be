The video game Life Is Strange uses a variant of the trolley problem. At the end of the game, the protagonist Max has to make a choice whether to turn back time. Changing time will kill her best friend/girlfriend Chloe but save the Arcadia Bay. On the other hand not changing time will mean that Chloe will be safe but everyone in the Arcadia Bay will die. The player can choose whether to save Chloe or Arcadia Bay, which leads to two different alternative ends.
