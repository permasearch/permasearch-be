Mouth to Mouth charted in the top 20 in Australia and the two singles lifted from it, "He's Just No Good For You" and "Don't Tell Me Now" both charted in the Top 40, as did a further single at years end, a cover of Elvis Presley's "Love Me Tender". The music video for "He's Just No Good for You" was filmed on Scarborough Street in Monterey, New South Wales.
