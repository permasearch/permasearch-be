Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that the film received positive reviews by 21% of the 84 surveyed critics.  The average rating was 4.2 out of 10, and the consensus is: "Due to obvious plot twists and foreshadowing, The Glass House fails to thrill. By the end, it degenerates into ludicrousness."[2] Roger Ebert rated the film 2 out of 4 stars and criticized the film's script.[3]  Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott called it unintentionally funny.[4]  Robert Koehler of Variety also called the film unintentionally funny and questioned why so many talented actors signed on to a poor script.[5]  Edward Guthmann, of the San Francisco Chronicle, criticized the film's violence and the timing of the release, which coincided with the September 11 attacks (in fact, for many critics it was the first film they saw after returning to work).[6][7]  In a more positive review, USA Today's Claudia Puig rated the film two out of four stars but called it "eerily engrossing."[8]
