While at Google, Sacca began investing in companies as an angel investor,[23] investing his own money in startup companies or receiving equity in exchange for advising.[citation needed] He served as a professional advisor to companies for a variety of matters, including strategy, optimizing user experience, raising money, and selling a company.[7] This included Auctomatic (sold to Live Current Media) and Omnisio (sold to Google/YouTube).[24] His first angel investment was in Photobucket,[17] which was then sold to News Corp in 2007.[25] His second investment was in Twitter.[7][17] Entrepreneur Evan Williams had started a microblogging service called Twttr in 2006, and asked Sacca if he wanted to invest.[7] Sacca invested $25,000 and began using the service,[7] registering in July 2006 as the 102nd user on the site. He related to Forbes that "I wasted months trying to get others to believe it could be a real business, not just a toy," before deciding to "to just buy it all myself."[26]  Sacca took part in a $5 million financing round for Twitter in late 2007[4] and ultimately created four separate funds[26] to surreptitiously[27] buy as many Twitter shares as possible.[26]  Sacca left Google in December 2007 after he had fully vested and sought additional opportunities to work with early stage companies.[7]
