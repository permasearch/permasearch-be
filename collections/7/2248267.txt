Banus said that Gabi: "sees Chad with Melanie and realizes she is not the girl for Chad. Gabi is the girl for Chad. So she focuses all her time and devotes her energy to making sure that is clear to him. At the point where they are at, I think she would do a lot to get that, and that is where she is at right now."[13] However, she noted that "Melanie, deep down, is really her friend. And honestly, she really does care about Melanie a whole lot and never wants to see her get hurt.[13] Gabi knew Melanie being kidnapped by her stalker, Andrew but didn't do anything because Andrew blackmailed her.[3] Chad discovered this and has since had a bitter vendetta against Gabi, despising her.[3]
