Dorothy is one of the non-playable characters that appears in the 2015 crossover video game LEGO Dimensions.[8] While on her way to the Emerald City with Toto and her three companions, they encounter Batman who thinks that the Scarecrow is the same one from his world. The interrogation is short lived, as Dorothy and her gang are sucked into a vortex where they are captured by the game's central antagonist, Lord Vortech. Lord Vortech imprisons Dorothy and uses the Ruby Slippers as one of the foundation elements needed to create his "perfect world". Whatever becomes of Dorothy after Vortech's demise is up for questioning.
