The first known use of the term "pantheism" was in Latin by the mathematician Joseph Raphson in 1697,[20] and subsequently translated to English in 1702.[21] Its primary thesis is that God and the universe are one and the same (deus sive natura).[22] Today differences exist among adherents of pantheism regarding what is meant by God, and the relationship between the universe and the divine. Several schools of metaphysics have contributed to the development of pantheism, in particular: the philosophy of the Stoics, the unification and parsimony of Baruch Spinoza, and the teleology of Friedrich Hegel.[23] Einstein stated, "My views are near those of Spinoza: admiration for the beauty of and belief in the logical simplicity of the order which we can grasp humbly and only imperfectly. I believe that we have to content ourselves with our imperfect knowledge and understanding and treat values and moral obligations as a purely human problemâ€”the most important of all human problems."[24]
