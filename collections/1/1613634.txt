Porphyry deposits represent an important resource of copper; however, they are also important sources of gold and molybdenum - with porphyry deposits being the dominant source of the latter.[6] In general, porphyry deposits are characterized by low grades of ore mineralization, a porphyritic intrusive complex that is surrounded by a vein stockwork and hydrothermal breccias.[7] Porphyry deposits are formed in arc-related settings and are associated with subduction zone magmas.[6] Interestingly, porphyry deposits are clustered in discrete mineral provinces, which implies that there is some form of geodynamic control or crustal influence affecting the location of porphyry formation.[7] Porphyry deposits tend to occur in linear, orogen-parallel belts (such as the Andes in South America).[8]
