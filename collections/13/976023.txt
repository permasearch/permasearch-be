In the spring of 2014, J Balvin released a new track entitled "6 AM", featuring Puerto Rican singer Farruko. The song exploded onto radio in the United States, Latin America, and even Europe. "6 AM" had truly put J Balvin at the forefront of reggaeton, and to many is thought as the song that re-ignited the current reggaeton revolution led by artists such as himself, Nicky Jam, Maluma, Farruko, as well as Daddy Yankee, Wisin & Yandel, and Don Omar. The song peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart, blocked by "Bailando" from hitting the top of the chart. This track gained him worldwide recognition. His album La Familia had also skyrocketed to the top of the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart.
