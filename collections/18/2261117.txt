When Prince Achmed's forces arrive the Princess calls for Aladdin's "army" to defend them, but Aladdin is nowhere to be seen. Ja'far then appears and uses his first wish on the lamp to make himself Sultan; he uses the second to make himself a powerful sorcerer. With his newfound powers, Ja'far is able to repel the majority of Achmed's army. During the battle, Aladdin tries to get the Princess to have sex with him, but she refuses. When Ja'far arrives, Aladdin takes the Princess hostage and reveals a darker, more sinister personality. This alternate persona killed Aladdin's parents when they wanted him to move out and get a job. Ja'far begs Aladdin to spare the Princess and realizes that the Princess is actually his daughter â€“- the Sultan is impotent and Scheherazade was pregnant when she was taken to the harem. Aladdin agrees to release the Princess in exchange for the lamp, but before Ja'far hands it over, he uses his final wish to free the Djinn and take its place in the lamp. The Djinn rejoices and disappears; Ja'far is now a Djinn.
