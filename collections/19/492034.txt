While it is shown that Grim does care for his scythe, he often makes the mistake of letting Billy (and in rare instances Mandy and Irwin) use it, or loses it in other ways. In Billy and Mandy's Jacked-Up Halloween, Grim let Billy use his scythe as an accessory for his costume, only to have it stolen by Jack-o-Lantern, who as it turns out is an old enemy of Grim's. Another element to the show is how characters from Grim's past often show up and often take revenge on him for what he had done to them.
