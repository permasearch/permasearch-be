They toured again in 2015, playing some shows without Larry Gott, who was taking a break from touring on these occasions. Adrian Oxaal re-joined the band for the duration of the tour, and remains in the band to date; keyboard technician Ron Yeadon, formerly of Unkle Bob, also appeared on stage, singing backing vocals; he later joined the band as a backing vocalist. In 2016, the album Girl at the End of the World was released, with an accompanying tour â€“ building up to the band's planned appearance opening 2016's Glastonbury Festival (the Other Stage) and later taking a top spot at the On Blackheath festival in September.
