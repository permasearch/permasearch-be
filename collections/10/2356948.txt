Captain Lawrence Brewing Company was founded in 2006. Its first brewery was located on Castleton Street in Pleasantville, New York[2] and had a 20-barrel system.  After five years, needing more space to operate a bottling line and a larger system to increase capacity, the brewery was relocated to Elmsford, New York,[2] approximately five miles from the original brewery.  The new facility has a 40-barrel brewing system and more fermentation capacity.  There is also a small seven-barrel system for experimental and specialty batches.  The new brewery began operation in 2011.[2]
