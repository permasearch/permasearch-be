Brown was born in Reinerton, Pennsylvania.[1] He enrolled in the Conway Military Band School (later part of Ithaca College) in 1926, studying with famous bandleader Patrick Conway for three years before receiving a music scholarship to the New York Military Academy, where he graduated in 1932. Brown attended college at Duke University from 1932â€“1936. There he led the group Les Brown and His Blue Devils,[3] who performed regularly on Duke's campus and up and down the east coast. Brown took the band on an extensive summer tour in 1936. At the end of the tour, while some of the band members returned to Duke to continue their education, others stayed on with Brown and continued to tour, becoming in 1938 the Band of Renown. The band's original drummer, Don Kramer, became the acting manager and helped define their future.  In 1942, Brown and his band concluded work on an RKO picture, "Sweet and Hot"; played at the Palladium Ballroom, Hollywood. A few years later, in 1945, this band brought Doris Day into prominence with their recording of "Sentimental Journey".[1] The song's release coincided with the end of World War II in Europe and became an unofficial homecoming theme for many veterans.[3] The band had nine other number-one hit songs, including "I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm".
