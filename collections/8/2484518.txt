Video quality can be measured with formal metrics like Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) or through subjective video quality assessment using expert observation. Many subjective video quality methods are described in the ITU-T recommendation BT.500. One of the standardized method is the Double Stimulus Impairment Scale (DSIS).  In DSIS, each expert views an unimpaired reference video followed by an impaired version of the same video.  The expert then rates the impaired video using a scale ranging from "impairments are imperceptible" to "impairments are very annoying".
