India, one of the few countries which maintains close relations with Myanmar, launched Operation Sahayata[52] under which two Indian Navy ships and two Indian Air Force (IAF) aircraft supplied the first international relief material to the cyclone-hit country.[53] The two aircraft carried 4 tonnes of relief supplies each while the Indian Navy transported more than 100 tonnes of relief material.[54] On 8 May, the IAF dispatched its third air consignment carrying over 32 tonnes of relief material including tents, blankets and medicines.[55] India planned to send more aid to Burma.[56] In a separate development, Burma denied Indian search and rescue teams and media access to critical cyclone-hit areas.[57] India released a statement saying it had requested Burma to accept international aid especially that from the United States,[58] to which Burma agreed.[59][60] According to various reports, Indian authorities had warned Burma about the danger that Cyclone Nargis posed 48 hours before it hit the country's coast.[61] As of 16 May 2008, India's offer to send a team of 50 medical personnel to set up two independent mini-hospitals in the Irrawaddy delta was accepted by the Burmese government.[62][63] An aircraft carrying the team of doctors and approximately 6 tonnes of medicines was being prepared at Delhi's Palam Air Force Base.
