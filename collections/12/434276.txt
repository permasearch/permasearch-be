In 2015, ProPublica launched Surgeon Scorecard, an interactive database that allows users to view complication rates for eight common elective procedures. The tool allows users to find surgeons and hospitals, and see their complication rates.[38] The database was controversial, drawing criticism from doctors and prompting a critique from RAND.[39][40] However, statisticians, including Andrew Gelman, stood behind their decision to attempt to shine light on an opaque aspect of the medical field,[41] and ProPublica offered specific rebuttals to RAND's claims.[42]
