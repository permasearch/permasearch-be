In 2013, the 8 territorial police forces in Scotland were merged into a single Scottish police force, named Police Scotland. Merging these forces had been first mooted in 2010, and was supported by the Scottish National Party, Scottish Labour Party and Scottish Conservative Party ahead of the 2011 Scottish Parliament election.[93] After a consultation process,[94][95] the Scottish Government confirmed on 8 September 2011 that a single police service would be created in Scotland.[96] The Scottish Government stated that "reform will safeguard frontline policing in communities by creating designated local senior officers for every council area with a statutory duty to work with councils to shape local services. Establishing a single service aims to ensure more equal access to national and specialist services and expertise such as major investigation teams and firearms teams, whenever and wherever they are needed."[97] The Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Bill was published in January 2012[98] and was approved on 27 June 2012 after scrutiny in the Scottish Parliament.[97] The Bill received Royal Assent as the Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012. This created a force of approximately 17,000 police officers, the second largest in the United Kingdom after the Metropolitan Police in London.[99][100]
