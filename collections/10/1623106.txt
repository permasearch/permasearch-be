A proclamation issued by President Trump on December 4, 2017 reduced the monument to 201,876 acres (81,696 ha)[5]—an exceptionally large reduction that is unprecedented in the history of U.S. national monuments.[6] National monuments have been reduced by previous presidents, but not since 1963 and never to such a large degree.[7] Legal scholars have argued that the reduction is not authorized by law, and several federal lawsuits have been filed challenging Trump's action.[6][8]
