As of 2018, there are two concurrent GCSE grading systems. In England, GCSEs are graded numerically from 1 (lowest) to 9 (highest), with a 4 being considered a passing grade. In Wales and Northern Ireland (and in a few remaining subjects in England), a letter grade scale is used, with grades of A* (highest), A, B, C, D, E, F and G (lowest).In Northern Ireland, from 2019, a new grade C* will be introduced, to line up with the English grade 5.
