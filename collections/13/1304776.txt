During season 9's "Dwight Christmas", Dwight is convinced by Jim to hold a traditional Christmas party in the style of his family. Jim must leave before the party is over and Dwight is noticeably emotionally upset when Jim must leave. Later, when Jim returns, Dwight embraces him in a hug. Soon after, in "Suit Warehouse", Dwight absent-mindedly says "love you" at the end of a phone conversation with Jim, much to his embarrassment and the bemusement of his coworkers.
