In 2009, AND1’s longest-tenured endorsee Rafer “Skip 2 My Lou” Alston would lead the Orlando Magic to the NBA Finals versus the Kobe Bryant led Los Angeles Lakers. Skip wore the AND1 Cubics throughout the ‘09 season, all the way through the NBA finals. After another one of his high-scoring playoff games, Magic teammate Dwight Howard said this about Skip: “He wasn’t Rafer Alston [tonight], he was the playground legend ‘Skip 2 My Lou”. When he plays like the playground legend, he’s tough to guard. The Magic ultimately lost the series in five games, but Skip’s presence in the finals brought great acclaim to AND1, as his AND1 background story was covered numerous times in the papers.[7][8]
