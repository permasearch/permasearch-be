In addition to attending the weekly three-hour church services, members are usually given "callings" or assignments in the church, and often attend various other meetings or activities throughout the week relating to that calling. Members in good standing are assigned to visit the homes of other members monthly as "home teachers" (men) or "visiting teachers" (women). Members are also expected to engage in missionary work, family history research, to conduct a Family Home Evening weekly with their family, and to attend the temple regularly. Church members are encouraged to live self-sufficiently and avoid unnecessary debt.[135][136] All male members are expected to serve a two-year mission sometime during the ages of 18â€“26 after they have finished high school or its equivalent, though there are high standards of worthiness and physical and mental health that prohibit many men from serving. Women may optionally serve an 18-month mission if they are at least 19 years old.[137] In addition to single men and women, retired married couples may also choose to serve a mission.
