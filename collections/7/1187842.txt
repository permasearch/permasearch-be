As Susan is going back to college full-time, she makes a chore bag where Greg and Rodrick pick chores to do. After finishing his chores, Greg goes to eat his giant candy corn that he won, but finds that the pig has eaten it. His and Rodrick’s attempts to make it to the vet failed as the pig threw up in the van, the smell prompting Greg to also throw up on someone’s front lawn. This makes someone call the police because she thought it was a prank, but Greg and Rodrick soon solve the matter with them.
