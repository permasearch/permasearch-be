Lieutenant Kijé was one of the earliest sound films made in the Soviet Union.[13] The origin of the story was a 1927 screenplay by the critic and novelist Yury Tynyanov, written for the Soviet film director Sergei Yutkevich. This project failed, and Tinyanov recast his script into a novella that was published in January 1928. In the early 1930s, when the Belgoskino studios announced their interest in making the film, Tynyanov produced a second script.[17] The story has been described by Prokofiev's biographer Harlow Robinson as "a satire on the stupidity of royalty and the particularly Russian terror of displeasing one's superior".[16] By his own account Prokofiev was at this time "restive, and afraid of falling into academism";[18] a later critic thought the Kijé story provided ideal material for this "so-often caustic and witty composer".[19]
