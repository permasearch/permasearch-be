Indulgent parenting, also called permissive, non-directive, lenient or libertarian,[35] is characterized as having few behavioral expectations for the child. "Indulgent parenting is a style of parenting in which parents are very involved with their children but place few demands or controls on them".[27] Parents are nurturing and accepting, and are responsive to the child's needs and wishes. Indulgent parents do not require children to regulate themselves or behave appropriately.  As adults, children of indulgent parents will pay less attention to avoiding behaviors which cause aggression in others[citation needed].
