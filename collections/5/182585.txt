According to the theory of general relativity, pressure increases the strength of a gravitational field (see stressâ€“energy tensor) and so adds to the mass-energy cause of gravity. This effect is unnoticeable at everyday pressures but is significant in neutron stars, although it has not been experimentally tested.[8]
