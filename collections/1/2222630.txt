Benefitting from constant injuries to Vicente and the ostracism to which then-manager Ronald Koeman condemned Miguel Ángel Angulo, Mata gradually carved a niche in Valencia's first eleven. On 20 March 2008, he scored twice in the Copa del Rey semi-final match against FC Barcelona to help Valencia reach the final against Getafe CF[10] where, on 16 April, he netted the opener in a 3–1 win.[11] During that first season, he was voted the team's Best Young Player by fans and players alike.
