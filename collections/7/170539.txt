Miyazaki's manga version of NausicaÃ¤ was written over a period of 12 years, with breaks taken to work on Studio Ghibli films. Serialized in Tokuma Shoten's Animage magazine, the first chapter was published in February 1982 and the last chapter in March 1994. Miyazaki adapted and altered the work for the film because only sixteen chapters of the manga were written at the time of the film's production.[47] The manga would continue to be produced until the seventh and final book was released on 15 January 1995.[48][49] The English localization was initially done by Toren Smith and Dana Lewis of Studio Proteus.[50] After Miyazaki resumed production of the manga, Viz Media chose a new team and continued to release the rest of manga.[50]
