Jack Nicklaus, age 26, earned his third Green Jacket in an 18-hole Monday playoff and became the first back-to-back champion at the Masters.[2][3] He ended regulation at even-par 288, tied with Tommy Jacobs and Gay Brewer. Nicklaus shot a 70 in the extra round on Monday to defeat Jacobs (72) and Brewer (78).[4] Nicklaus' score the previous year in 1965 was significantly lower at 271 (âˆ’17), a record which stood for 32 years.
