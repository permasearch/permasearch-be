Ultimately the Gallipoli campaign was a disastrous failure. It did not achieve any of the objectives that had been given as a justification for it, and due to the inexperience of high commanders and mismanagement there were an unacceptably high number of casualties amongst the participating troops, not only from as a result of combat, but also due to widespread disease that resulted from poor sanitation and hygiene in the front lines and a breakdown in the casualty clearance and resupply and logistics systems.[58] It has been estimated that over the course of the campaign there were 26,111 Australian casualties with 8,141 killed.[59] Other Allied casualties—killed and wounded—included: 7,571 New Zealanders, 120,000 British and 27,000 French.[59]
