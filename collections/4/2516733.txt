Zaynab bint Jahsh was Muhammad's cousin, being the daughter of one of his father's sisters.[44] In Medina Muhammad arranged the widowed Zaynab's marriage to his adopted son Zayd ibn Harithah. Caesar E. Farah states that Muhammad was determined to establish the legitimacy and right to equal treatment of the adopted.[45] Zaynab disapproved of the marriage, and her brothers rejected it, because according to Ibn Sa'd, she was of aristocratic lineage and Zayd was a former slave.[46][47] Watt states that it is not clear why Zaynab was unwilling to marry Zayd as Muhammad esteemed him highly. He theorises that Zaynab, being an ambitious woman, was already hoping to marry Muhammad; or that she might have wanted to marry someone of whom Muhammad disapproved for political reasons.[48] According to Maududi, after the Qur'anic verse 33:36 was revealed,[49] Zaynab acquiesced and married Zayd.
