Paige was named preseason ACC player of the year. Early in the season, Paige was widely regarded to have been in a shooting slump.[7] However, he recovered late in the season and helped lead the Tar Heels to the 2016 NCAA Championship Game, where they faced Villanova. In the game, Paige scored 21 points and hit a game-tying three-pointer with 4.7 seconds left in the 2nd half of regulation. However, Villanova's Kris Jenkins went on to score a buzzer beater to win the game 77â€“74.[8]
