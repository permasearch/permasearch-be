At the time the decision was made, Japan had never qualified for a World Cup finals (although the Japanese did subsequently qualify for the 1998 competition). The only other countries to have been awarded a World Cup without previously having competed in a final tournament are Italy in 1934 and Qatar in 2022.  (Uruguay hosted the first World Cup in 1930 so there was no prior tournament.  They were defending Olympic champions from 1928).
