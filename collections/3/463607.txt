Dodge introduced the 241.3 cu in (4.0 L) engine in 1953.[3] Bore was 3.4375 in (87.3 mm) and stroke was 3.25 in (82.6 mm). With a low compression ratio of 7.0:1 (in 1953 and for the 1954 Meadowbrook), the 241 produced 140 bhp (104 kW).[9] For 1954, the more senior Dodges received 150 bhp (112 kW) thanks to a higher 7.5:1 compression ratio.[10] This engine is not the same as the Plymouth 241, which had polyspherical, not hemi heads. The 241 only lasted two years, being replaced by the 270 for 1955.[10]
