Antonio's elder son by the Duchess appears in the final scene and takes his place as the heir to the Malfi fortune, which is controversial because there is reason to believe he isn't the actual eldest son of the Duchess. The play briefly mentions her previous son, who is the product of her previous marriage with her deceased husband,[12] though some scholars believe this is just a textual error. The son's decision to take the fortune is done despite his father's explicit wish that he "fly the court of princes," a corrupt and increasingly deadly environment.
