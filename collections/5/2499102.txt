In 1986, the British Broadcasting Company (BBC) commissioned the production of a six-hour documentary series on the history of the RKO studios and their films. Ed Asner was the series host and narrator. Many surviving RKO stars and technical people were interviewed and numerous extended clips from RKO movies were included. The six-episode series was aired on the PBS network in the late 1980s. No official VHS tapes or DVDs of this series have been released in the American-Canadian market.
