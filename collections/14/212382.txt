The first reference to Santa's sleigh being pulled by a reindeer appears in Old Santeclaus with Much Delight, an illustrated children's poem published in New York in 1821.[5][6] The names of the author and the illustrator are not known.[6] The poem, with eight colored lithographic illustrations, was published by William B. Gilley as a small paperback book entitled The Children's Friend: A New-Year's Present, to the Little Ones from Five to Twelve.[7]
