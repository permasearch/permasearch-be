There are two routes of ascent to the caldera. The first begins at Doro Mboha village on the southeast of the mountain and follows a paved road through a cashew plantation to an elevation of 1,150 m (3,800 ft). The road terminates at the southern part of the caldera, which at 1,950 m (6,400 ft) is reachable only by hiking.[11] This location is only one hour from the caldera, and usually serves as a base camp from which volcanic activity can be monitored. The second route starts from Pancasila village at the northwest of the mountain and is only accessible on foot.[11]
