Andean civilizations also lacked wheeled vehicles and draft animals. People on land traveled only by foot and the transport of goods was only by humans or llama, pack animals which could carry loads of up to one-fourth of their weight, a maximum of 45 kilograms (99Â lb).[6] Llamas were not big or strong enough to be used for plowing or as riding animals for adults.[3]
