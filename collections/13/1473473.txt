Giant armadillos use their large front claws to dig for prey and rip open termite mounds. The diet is mainly composed of termites, although ants, worms, spiders and other invertebrates are also eaten.[4] Little is currently known about this species' reproductive biology, and no juveniles have ever been discovered in the field.[14] The average sleep time of a captive giant armadillo is said to be 18.1 hours.[15]
