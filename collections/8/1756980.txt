Smiley suspects a link between Merlin and the botched Operation Testify. He tracks down Prideaux and other participants in the operation, whose details Control had hidden from him at the time. Control had independently concluded the existence of a mole and mounted Testify to learn his identity from an aspiring defector in Czech intelligence who claimed to be privy to the information. Polyakov and Karla, Moscow Centre's spymaster, were both present at Prideaux's interrogation which focused exclusively on the extent and status of Control's investigations. The Czech defector was a plant, contrived by Karla to engineer Control's supplantation through Testify's failure, and thus protect the mole.
