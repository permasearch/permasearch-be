South African citizenship has primarily been founded on conceptions of racial entitlement and lawful residence.[15] The development of migration restrictions attached to different racial groups in the Cape and the Boer Republics provided the precursor to South African citizenship: Union nationality. The immigration laws reacting to the influx of Asian in the early 20th century provided the unidirectional basis of South African citizenship. This identification method developed out of the Transvaal immigration bureaucracy became to standard throughout the other republics after the unification in 1909.[16] The restrictive nature of union nationality led to the establishment of a categorical citizenship that lacked any positive rights.
