After the referendum, Lukashenko convened a new parliamentary assembly from those members of the parliament who were loyal to him.[30] After between ten and twelve deputies withdrew their signature from the impeachment petition, only about forty deputies of the old parliament were left and the Supreme Soviet was dismissed by Lukashenko.[31] Nevertheless, international organizations and many Western countries do not recognize the current parliament given the way it was formed.[32][33] At the start of 1998, the Central Bank of Russia suspended trading in the Belarusian ruble, which led to a collapse in the value of the currency. Lukashenko responded by taking control of the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus, sacking the entire bank leadership and blaming the West for the free fall of the currency.[34]
