The ABO gene resides on chromosome 9 at the band 9q34.2 and contains 7 exons.[6] The ABO locus encodes three alleles. The A allele produces α-1,3-N-acetylgalactosamine transferase (A-transferase), which catalyzes the transfer of GalNAc residues from the UDP-GalNAc donor nucleotide to the Gal residues of the acceptor H antigen, converting the H antigen into A antigen in A and AB individuals. The B allele encodes α-1,3-galactosyl transferase (B-transferase), which catalyzes the transfer of Gal residues from the UDP-Gal donor nucleotide to the Gal residues of the acceptor H-antigen, converting the H antigen into B antigen in B and AB individuals. Remarkably, the difference between the A and B glycosyltransferase enzymes is only four amino acids.[9] The O allele lacks both enzymatic activities because of the frame shift caused by a deletion of guanine-258 in the gene which corresponds to a region near the N-terminus of the protein.[10]This results in a frameshift and translation of an almost entirely different protein.[9] This mutation results in a protein unable to modify oligosaccharides which end in fucose linked to galactose. Thus no A or B antigen is found in O individuals. This sugar combination is termed the H antigen. Other minor alleles have been found for this gene.[6] These antigens play an important role in the match of blood transfusion and organ transplantation.[9] Other minor alleles have been found for this gene.[6]
