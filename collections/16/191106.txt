Basing her version on the Harrison arrangement rather than Dylan's arrangement,[23] Australian singer Olivia Newton-John enjoyed considerable international success with "If Not for You". It was the title track of her debut album, and became her first hit single, reaching the Top 10 in several countries. The top 40 chart performance on WLS[24] was much earlier than, and very different from on, the Hot 100.[25] In addition, the single spent three weeks at No. 1 on the United States Easy Listening charts.[26][27]
