A timing chain, also called a sync chain, is used on tandem bicycles, to synchronize crank movement between the captain (front rider) and stoker (rear rider). As with auto engines, proper tension of the timing chain is necessary to prevent premature wear of the drivetrain components. Tension is adjusted by means of an eccentric bottom bracket.
