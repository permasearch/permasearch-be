Unlike the other Giant Inverted Boomerangs, Goliath features a newly built train by Premier Rides (different from the originals built by Vekoma). This train has seating, exactly like that on Bolliger & Mabillard's inverted roller coasters. The new train design was chosen in an attempt to make the lines in the station less complicated to navigate and also to give the ride a higher capacity.[13][14]
