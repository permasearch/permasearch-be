One of the results of the persecution in England was that some people fled Great Britain to be able to worship as they wished â€“ but they did not seek religious freedom, and early North American colonies were generally as intolerant of religious dissent as England; Puritan Massachusetts, for example, did not allow standard Church of England worship. Some of these people voluntarily sailed to the American Colonies specifically for this purpose. After the American Colonies famously revolted against George III of the United Kingdom, the Constitution of United States was specifically amended to ban the establishment of religion by Congress.
