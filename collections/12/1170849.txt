Germany has also won the European Championship three times (Spain and France are the only other multiple-time winners with three and two titles respectively), and finished as runners-up three times as well.[132] The Germans have qualified for every European Championship tournament except for the very first European Championship they entered in 1968.[132] For that tournament, Germany was in the only group of three teams and thus only played four qualifying games. The deciding game was a scoreless draw in Albania which gave Yugoslavia the edge, having won in their neighbour country. The team finished out of top eight only in two occasions, the tournaments of 2000[133] and 2004.[134] In the other ten editions Germany participated in they reached nine times at least the semi-finals, an unparalleled record in Europe.
