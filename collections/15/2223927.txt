In July 2008, the BTV reality television series titled The Disciple (simplified Chinese: 龙的传人; traditional Chinese: 龍的傳人; literally: "Disciple of the Dragon") concluded. The aim of the series, produced by and featured Chan, was to find a new star to become Chan's "successor" and student in film-making. The winner of the series was Jack Tu (Tu Sheng Cheng), who is now set to star in three modern Chinese action films, one of which was scripted by Chan, and all three to be co-produced by Chan's company JCE Movies Limited.[3][4][5]
