This article hits many points and contains numerous references and citations, but it seems disjointed. Rather than reading as an article, it reads more like the result of various debates and compromises and still carries some of the tone of the final phase of an academic discussion rather than a summary/review. It seems to be missing the "glue" and structure that would make it coherent. I think it needs a stronger summary and perhaps re-ordering to tie this all together, but I'm at a loss how to do it. Those of Southern sympathy and many others will often be inclined to search for an explanation in states rights and tariffs as the primary cause--despite modern authors' rejections of them as primary. When these folks don't find the secondary nature of such matters clearly explained in the summary, they are going to be understandably skeptical of the article's tone. The present summary section is overly long and is a general explanation of the state of the nation rather than a summary of the origins. While the explanation is valuable, it needs a real/guiding summary of the article topic before that. Has the dust settled enough that a primary author could restructure and summarize this better?
