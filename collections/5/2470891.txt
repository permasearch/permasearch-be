Macduff first speaks in the play in act 2, scene 3 to the drunken porter to report to his duty of awaking King Duncan when he is sleeping for the night at Macbeth's castle. When he discovers the corpse of King Duncan (murdered by Macbeth, but it looks like nearby guards are guilty since Macbeth—at the prodding of Lady Macbeth—put his knife by them and smeared them with Duncan's blood), he raises an alarm, informing the castle that the king has been murdered. Macduff begins to suspect Macbeth of regicide when Macbeth says, "O, yet I do repent me of my fury / That I did kill them" (2.3.124–125). Interestingly, Macduff's name does not appear in this scene; rather, Banquo refers to him as "Dear Duff" (2.3.105).
