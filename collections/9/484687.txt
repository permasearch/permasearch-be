The theme song "Nobody Does It Better" was composed by Marvin Hamlisch, written by Carole Bayer Sager, and performed by Carly Simon. It was the first theme song in the series to be titled differently from the name of the film,[16] although the title is in the lyrics. It was nominated for Best Song but lost to "You Light Up My Life".
