The SPLC's classification and listings of hate groups and extremists (organizations and people that, in its assessment, "attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics")[10] are considered authoritative by academic and media sources[11][12][13][14] but have been the subject of criticism from conservatives and others, who have argued that some of the SPLC's listings are overbroad or unwarranted.[15][16]
