During 1980s and 1990s, there was a surge in use of crack cocaine in US cities:[9] the crack epidemic. During this time fears arose throughout the country that PCE would create a generation of youth with severe behavioral and cognitive problems.[10][11] Early studies in the mid-1980s reported that cocaine use in pregnancy caused children to have severe problems including cognitive, developmental, and emotional disruption.[12] These early studies had methodological problems including small sample size, confounding factors like poor nutrition, and use of other drugs by the mothers.[12] However, the results of the studies sparked widespread media discussion in the context of the new War on Drugs.[13][14] For example, a 1985 study that showed harmful effects of cocaine use during pregnancy created a huge media buzz.[12][15] The term "crack baby" resulted from the publicity surrounding crack and PCE.[16]
