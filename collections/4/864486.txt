Most mainstream Sunni scholars agree that prophets were males only.[34] Still, some like Ibn Hazm, Qartubi, Ibn Hajir, and al Ashâ€˜ari thought that the verses that mention angels speaking to Mary are proofs of her prophet hood.[35][36] Also, Ibn Hajir interprets the Hadith "Many among men attained perfection but among women none attained the perfection except Mary, the daughter of `Imran and Asiya, the wife of Pharaoh." He said perfection is prophet hood in turn his claim that Mary and Asiya were prophets.[37]
