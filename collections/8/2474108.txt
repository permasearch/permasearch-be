One of the main effects social media has had on children is the effect of cyber bullying. A study carried out by 177 students in Canada found that “15% of the students admitted that they cyberbullied others” while “40% of the cyber victims had no idea who the bullies were”.[34] The psychological harm cyber bullying can cause is reflected in low self-esteem, depression and anxiety. It also opens up avenues for manipulation and control. Cyber bullying has ultimately led to depression, anxiety and in severe cases suicide. Suicide is the third leading cause of death for youth between the ages of 10 and 24. Cyber bullying is rapidly increasing. Some writers have suggested monitoring and educating children from a young age about the risks associated with cyber bullying. {{Cite: Adams Richar,2015, 'Fewer school bullies but cyberbullying is on the increase'}} Not only does cyberbullying effect children but a huge issue is insomnia. This is because of the amount of time spent using the internet. children use on average 27 hours of internet a week and it is on the increase. {{ cite: Jerald J.
