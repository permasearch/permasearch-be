Between the Neolithic and Roman eras, Southeastern Britain experienced significant in migration from the continent.[10] Finds of late Late Iron Age coins, such as the South Wight[11] and Shalfleet Hoards, suggest trading links both with nearby tribes and further afield. The coins and ingots from these hoards had been defaced before burial, for reasons that are unknown; this feature has only been found in coin finds from Hampshire and Wight.[12] The variety of origin of the coins found locally is more marked than elsewhere in Britain and suggests that the island may have had a degree of political separation.[13]
