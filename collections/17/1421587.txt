In 1611 Frisian/German astronomers David and Johannes Fabricius (father and son) studied sunspots with a camera obscura, after realizing looking at the sun directly with the telescope could damage their eyes.[53] They are thought to have combined the telescope and the camera obscura into camera obscura telescopy.[citation needed]
