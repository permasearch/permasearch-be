Broad antigen types are still useful, such as typing very diverse populations with many unidentified HLA alleles (Africa, Arabia,[22] Southeastern Iran[23] and Pakistan, India[24]). Africa, Southern Iran, and Arabia show the difficulty in typing areas that were settled earlier. Allelic diversity makes it necessary to use broad antigen typing followed by gene sequencing because there is an increased risk of misidentifying by serotyping techniques.
