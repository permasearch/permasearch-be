Soon after his departure from the British-Irish band One Direction, Zayn started working on his debut solo studio album; months later, on 22 July 2015, it was announced that Zayn was recording new music with record producer Malay Ho, after the producer posted a photo with the singer on his Instagram account.[1] Malik's management team reached out to him because Zayn was a fan of his work with artists such as John Legend, Alicia Keys and Frank Ocean. Later, Ho heard "Pillowtalk" and "Fool for You" before signing on to produce the record, and thought Malik's voice was "incredible" and agreed to work with him.[2] The two recorded most of the songs in the Studio Suite at the Palms Casino Resort, inside Malik’s Beverly Hills Hotel room, and in the middle of the woods. As recalled by Ho, the work had a "super creative, super free" atmosphere.[2] Zayn admitted that "He’s just an amazing person. Like from the second I met him I just knew he was kind of different. He looks into every instrument in high detail and he understands how to break it down."[3]
