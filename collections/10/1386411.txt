The music video received generally positive reviews from critics. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard compared the car scenes to the ones of Rihanna's music video for "We Found Love";[15] Ann Lee of Metro considered the music video "sexy",[22] with Rolling Stone journalist Matthew Perpetura noting that, "just like the song itself, it's bleakly romantic and majestic in its scope."[23] Becky Bain of Idolator commented that "Interscope apparently has much faith in Del Rey, as the video for her second single, 'Born to Die', looks like it has the budget of about 15 of her 'Video Games' clips."[24] Bain also noted that "besides jungle cats, Lanaâ€™s vid features a gorgeous church, a tattooed amour, and a fiery crash" and questioned,[24] "did you really think a song called 'Born to Die' would end with Lana and her sweetie walking off into the sunset together?"[24]
