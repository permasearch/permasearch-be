The song begins and we see the two meeting up at an amusement fair. As they sing, they partake in various carnival attractions, such as game booths and bumper cars. The song ends abruptly with Ja Rule's friends emerging from a black van and asking him if he's riding with them. After he hesitates and turns to Ashanti, she says she's riding if he's riding. They enter the van and after a few quick cuts they emerge and Ja Rule begins rapping "Destiny", the closing track from the album. The video ends with a crowd of men marching the streets and holding up various signs, including tributes to late rappers Tupac Shakur and DJ Jam-Master Jay from Run-D.M.C..
