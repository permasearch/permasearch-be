In September 2014, this instrumental version also appeared as a bonus track on the 2014 Apple Years 1968â€“75 reissue of All Things Must Pass.[73] Coinciding with the release, Harrison's widow and son, Olivia and Dhani, held an online competition in which filmmakers were invited to create a video clip for "What Is Life". The winner received a $5000 cash prize and their entry became the official video for the track, appearing on the Harrison YouTube channel and other media platforms.[74]
