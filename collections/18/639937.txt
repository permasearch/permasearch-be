By December 2013, Skydance Productions and Annapurna Pictures were developing a new Terminator television series. Ashley Miller and Zack Stentz, who had worked together previously on Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, were named as writers and executive producers. Under the working title Terminator: Project Skynet, the series was said to deviate from the franchise's history at a critical moment in 1984's The Terminator, and would also integrate with then-projected film series' direct sequels to Terminator Genisys.[31] With the rights reverting to James Cameron in 2019, the planned television series connected to Terminator Genisys has since been canceled.
