Prior to the 2013 season, Rollins played for Team USA in the 2013 World Baseball Classic (WBC), and was the only player from Team USA to make the event's all-star team; it was his second WBC, and second placement on the all-star team.[64] He was back to the Phillies in time for opening day, and made his 13th consecutive start on opening day. Overall, he tied for fifth in the NL in games (160), and led the team with 600 at-bats, 151 hits, 36 doubles, and 59 walks. He achieved several career milestones during the season, including his 800th RBI (April 22), his 433 double (breaking Ed Delahanty's record on May 15), and his 45th career leadoff home run (fourth most in MLB history; hit on July 20).[8] Despite the achievements, overall, the season was a decline from previous years; his isolated power (ISO) was among the worst in the major leagues, he attempted to steal the fewest amount of bases in his career, and his defense "tanked" according to fielding metrics.[65] He "struggled mightily", and ultimately posted a .252 batting average with six home runs and 39 RBIs.[8] which "could be the beginning of his decline as an effective Major League hitter".[66]
