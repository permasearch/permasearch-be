Falling in love with Jane Foster, Thor disobeys his father and refuses to return to Asgard, an act for which he is punished on several occasions.[74] Thor's natural affinity for Earth is eventually revealed to be due to the fact that he was the son of the Elder Goddess Gaea.[75] Although Thor initially regards himself as a "superhero" like his teammates in the Avengers,[75] Loki's machinations draw Thor into increasingly epic adventures, such as teaming with his father Odin and Asgardian ally Balder against the fire demon Surtur and Skagg the Storm Giant,[76] and defeating an increasingly powerful Absorbing Man and proving his innocence in the "Trial of the Gods".[77] This necessitates an extended leave of absence from the Avengers.[78]
