The study used the radiocarbon age of the Newgrange dog to calibrate the mutation rate for dogs, which was similar to that calculated for the Late Pleistocene Taimyr wolf. Comparing the sequence of the Newgrange dog using this mutation rate with two modern wolves from Russia gave a divergence time between 20,000-60,000 YBP. However, these two modern wolves may not have been closely related to the population that gave rise to the dog, which may have diverged from their ancestor at a later time.[18]
