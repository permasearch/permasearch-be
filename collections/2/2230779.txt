The stadium consists of four stands: the Main Stand, which also houses the club offices and players facilities; the Merkland Road Family Stand; the South Stand, which is opposite the main stand and holds the largest amount of spectators; and the Richard Donald stand to the east, which was completed in 1993, contains hospitality suites, and is named after former chairman Dick Donald.[84] A quarter of the South Stand is used to accommodate travelling supporters.[85] In 1978, Pittodrie became the first all covered, all-seater stadium in Britain.[6][86]
