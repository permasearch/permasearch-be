"Hello Good Morning" was promoted with several live television performances including on season nine of American Idol and Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, amongst others. An accompanying music video, filmed by Hype Williams, features Diddy–Dirty Money parting in Los Angeles, with T.I. enjoying the company of two ladies in an apartment and Diddy driving through the city at night. It was inspired by the 1995 film Heat. An edited version of the clip was made for the official remix, and a completely new street party-themed video was filmed for the grime remix. At the time of release, "Hello Good Morning" became the album and group's first single to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, reaching No. 27. Commercially, the single was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for selling in excess of 500,000 copies. Internationally, the single peaked at No. 22 in UK, and was particularly successful on the German Black Chart and UK R&B Chart, reaching number one and number eight respectively.
