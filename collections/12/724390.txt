Von Steuben was probably a homosexual.[25] His exits from the court of Hohenzollern-Hechingen and from Paris were under clouds of accusation of homosexual activity.[26] Von Steuben arrived in the United States with his 17-year-old secretary, Peter Stephen Du Ponceau, who is rumored to have been his lover.[27] At Valley Forge, he began close relationships with Benjamin Walker and William North, then both military officers in their 20s, which are assumed by many to have been romantic. [28] Because homosexuality was criminalized at the time, records of his relationships are limited to references in correspondences.
