Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered features the same core gameplay as the original version, which is a first-person shooter that has the player take control of several characters, however it includes several minor modifications.[1] While in the prone position, the player's equipped weapon is now visible, and during the act of crawling, the gamepad will give feedback as the gun makes contact with the ground. The game utilizes "dual render technology" for sniper rifle scopes when aiming, providing the player with a view of the scope and blurred surroundings, as opposed to a black screen representing the scope interior present in the original.[2] Throughout the campaign, new predetermined first-person animations are present on a few occasions, for example, when removing a non-player character's bonds during one of the levels.[3][4] Pressing down on the gamepad's D-pad in multiplayer when a weapon is equipped will initiate a brief animation to "taunt" opponents, such as allowing the player to inspect the exterior of their gun.[3][5]
