The federalism is asymmetric in that the devolved powers of the constituent units are not all the same. The state of Jammu and Kashmir was accorded a higher degree of autonomy than other States under the Article 370.[1] The Union Territories are unitary type directly governed by the Union government though Article 1 (1) of the constitution stipulates a two tier-governance with an additional local elected government by the local citizens throughout the country. However, Delhi and Puducherry have been accorded their own legislatures under Article 239AA and 239A respectively.[1]
