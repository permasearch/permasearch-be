The original route went through the towns of Saugus and Newhall, and then crossed Newhall Pass (current route of SR 14, Antelope Valley Freeway). In 1862, Beale Cut was made in the construction of a toll wagon road. The 15’ wide, 60’ deep “slot” was dug with picks and shovels. That road would become part of the Midway Route. At the turn of the century, it was the most direct automobile route between Los Angeles and the San Joaquin Valley via the Mojave Desert and Tehachapi Pass.[24]
