Guru Nanak spent his first 30 years at Talwandi and Sultanpur as a householder. The next 22 years were spent as a missionary; for his final 18 years he stayed at Kartarpur with his followers, establishing dharamshalas (spiritual retreats). Wherever he went, he urged people to perform acts of charity and serve the poor and the needy. Guru Nanak preached the equality of man, treating Hindus and Muslims alike. He visited their shrines, explaining the true way of spiritual life. He opposed the distinctions of caste, referring to himself as a member of the lowest caste. Guru Nanak insisted on Grahstha (living a householder's life), believing the path of renunciation (sannyasa) a way of escapism and defeat. People must perform their worldly duties, while keeping their spirit detached from worldly things. Knowing his end was approaching, Guru Nanak tested his disciples and passed his mantle to the most worthy, Guru Angad Dev, in 1539.
