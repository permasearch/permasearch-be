When Austria-Hungary and Germany formed an alliance in 1879, it was one of the more surprising alliances of its time. Though both realms shared the German language and a similar culture, Austria-Hungary and Germany were often driven apart, most notably in the recent Austro-Prussian War. Additionally, the Habsburg rulers of Austria believed that the promotion of nationalism, which was favored by Germany, would destroy their empire. However, their common dislike for Russia brought the two nations together for a common cause.[1]
