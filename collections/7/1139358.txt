Note: Until 1965 every constructor was licensed in the country where it was really based. In 1965 Japanese constructor Honda moved their team from Tokyo to Amsterdam, Netherlands, followed in 1966 by American constructor Eagle which was based in Rye, East Sussex, UK.[20] Since the early 2000s most constructors have been based in England, but licensed in another country.
