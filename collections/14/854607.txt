F Type Coax connectors are probably the most suitable for domestic terrestrial, cable, and satellite TV installations where the delivery of very high frequency information is required. Belling-Lee connectors (IEC 169-2) [used on European terrestrial receivers] are not well suited for long haul building delivery of frequencies above 500 MHz, because the standard was designed around tube receivers and Mediumwave (or Shortwave) antennas (but workarounds exist) [2]. Type F Connectors require slightly more care to properly install the Male connectors to the cable than the Belling-Lee type, with the exception of compression or flex type connections.
