On September 14, the NHC noted the potential for tropical cyclone development in the East Atlantic later in the week.[94] A tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa on September 16, developing into a tropical depression by 12:00 UTC on September 19, about 225 mi (360 km) west-southwest of the southernmost Cabo Verde Islands. On September 20, the depression strengthened to Tropical storm Lisa. Around 12:00 UTC on September 22, Lisa peaked with sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 999 mbar (29.5 inHg). The storm soon began weakening due increasing wind shear, but Lisa briefly restrengthened on September 24. Lisa managed to maintain tropical storm intensity while battling unfavorable conditions until early on September 25, weakening to a tropical depression at that time. Lisa became a remnant low at 06:00 UTC.[95] The remnants were monitored for potential regeneration,[96] but failed to redevelop and dissipated later that day.[95]
