Due to the controversies surrounding the Beatles during their tour, critical reaction in the United States was muted relative to the band's previous releases.[317] According to Rodriguez, in its attempts to redefine the limits of pop music, Revolver emphasised the need for genuine rock criticism, a form of journalism that would become commonplace from 1967 onwards.[318] KRLA Beat's reviewer described Revolver as "a musical creation of exceptional excellence" while lamenting that, in the wake of the acclaimed Rubber Soul, "it is receiving only a fraction of the attention and respect due".[319] Writing in the recently launched Crawdaddy!, Paul Williams gave the US version of the album a mixed review, in which he admired "Love You To" and "Eleanor Rigby" but derided "Tomorrow Never Knows" and "Yellow Submarine".[320] According to Turner, the album's combination of novel sounds and unusual subject matter "challenged all the conventions of pop"[163] and it was the upcoming generation of writers who "got it immediately".[321] Among these, Richard Goldstein of The Village Voice described Revolver as "a revolutionary record" that was "as important to the expansion of pop as was Rubber Soul".[322] He added: "it seems now that we will view this album in retrospect as a key work in the development of rock and roll into an artistic pursuitÂ ..."[323] Another writer identified by Turner, Jules Siegel, likened Revolver to works by John Donne, Milton and Shakespeare, saying that the band's lyrics would provide the basis for scholarly analysis well into the future.[324]
