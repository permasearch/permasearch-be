With regard to Qatar’s support of the Muslim Brotherhood, Qatar welcomed Brotherhood cadres since the 1950s.[16] Sheikh Hamad was one of the first foreign leaders to visit Mohamed Morsi after his electoral success in June 2012. Qatar provided a substantial financial boost to Morsi’s Freedom and Justice Party, and Brotherhood opponents argued that Morsi’s narrow election victory was achieved through Qatari funding.[48] After Morsi’s election, Qatar contributed a total of USD 5,5 billion dollars to the Muslim Brotherhood administration.[48]
