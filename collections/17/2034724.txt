Wagering money on horse races is as old as the sport itself, but in the United Kingdom the links between horse racing and nationwide wagering are very strong.  Betting shops are common sights in most towns, tending to be sited wherever a significant number of people with disposable cash can be expected.  At one point in the 1970s it was said that the ideal location was "close to a pub, the Labour Exchange and the Post Office",[by whom?] the first being a source of customers in a good mood, the other two being sources of ready cash in the form of "the dole" and state pension money, which was dispensed through Post Offices at the time.
