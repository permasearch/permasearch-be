Krampus carries chains, thought to symbolize the binding of the Devil by the Christian Church. He thrashes the chains for dramatic effect. The chains are sometimes accompanied with bells of various sizes.[14] Of more pagan origins are the ruten, bundles of birch branches that Krampus carries and with which he occasionally swats children.[5] The ruten may have had significance in pre-Christian pagan initiation rites.[5] The birch branches are replaced with a whip in some representations. Sometimes Krampus appears with a sack or a basket strapped to his back; this is to cart off evil children for drowning, eating, or transport to Hell. Some of the older versions make mention of naughty children being put in the bag and taken away.[5] This quality can be found in other Companions of Saint Nicholas such as Zwarte Piet.[15]
