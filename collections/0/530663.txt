Summerhill is noted for its philosophy that children learn best with freedom from coercion. A philosophy that was promoted by the New Ideals in Education Conferences (1914–37)[16] that helped to define the good modern primary school as child-centred.[17] All lessons are optional, and pupils are free to choose what to do with their time. Neill founded Summerhill with the belief that "the function of a child is to live his own life—–not the life that his anxious parents think he should live, not a life according to the purpose of an educator who thinks he knows best."[18][19]
