Legendary Bollywood music composer Ustad Sajjad Hussain[2] (June 15, 1917 â€“ July 21, 1995) is often regarded as the 'Wizard of mandolin'. He was the first to effectively use it in Indian Classical Hindustani music. His unique style of playing deserves much more than the reputation he has achieved as a mandolinist.
