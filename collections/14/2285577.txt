The influences of the poem, The Lady of the Lake, are both extensive and diverse, given that both the last name taken by the leading African-American abolitionist, Frederick Douglass,[3] and the Ku Klux Klan custom of cross burning derive from the influence of the poem (through the film Birth of a Nation.)  But, the Fiery cross or Crann Tara was a device for rallying people in Scotland and did not carry racist connotations.
