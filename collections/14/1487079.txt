Baseball was introduced in the 1880s by Albert Addlesberg, an American businessman living in Bluefields.[4] During this time, the area around Bluefields was known as the autonomous Mosquito Reserve and a strong British influence in the area was evidenced by the popularity of cricket. Addlesberg convinced two of the most popular cricket clubs to switch to baseball and supplied the locals with equipment he imported from New Orleans.[4] Two teams were created in 1887, the Southern and Four Roses.[3][4] They began to play in 1888 and baseball has been played on the Mosquito Coast almost continuously since that time, but the entire region has long since been incorporated into the Republic of Nicaragua. The first 'official' game took place in 1891 between Managua and Granada.[3][4] Carter Donaldson, who was the U.S. Consul in Nicaragua at the time, founded the first continuous team in 1904.[4] United States Marines stationed in Nicaragua in the early part of the 20th century were also credited for bringing the sport to the country, and popularizing it in the area.[2][3][5]
