All episodes follow a similar format. In the opening scene, DJ Lance Rock is shown walking on a plain white background while holding a gray radio with colorful buttons. He then gets to a table scenery that involves four different colored lands and a gray cloth underneath it. He then places down the radio, and then he shouts "YOOOO Gabba Gabba!" and opens the radio, and inside it are 5 toy figures: Toodee, Muno, Foofa, Plex, and Brobee. He places down the figures one-by-one, and then they become alive.
