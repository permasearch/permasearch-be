The third part is Schmid's humbling rehabilitation, in which he resents being dependent upon others. He hopes that an operation will restore his sight, but the medical procedure isn't successful. He doesn't want Ruth to know that he is almost completely blind, so he attempts to break up with her. Schmid is aided in his recovery by Diamond, hospital rehabilitation officer Virginia Pfeiffer (Rosemary DeCamp), and the other wounded veterans. He is to be awarded the Navy Cross but is dismayed that the ceremony will take place in his home town. He initially feels anger at being dependent upon family and friends as he doesn't want to be a burden to anyone. In spite of his resentment, Ruth stays by his side, helps him overcome his bitterness, and convinces him that he must learn to live with his new situation.
