Some plants have a photoperiod (photoperiodism) requirement for a certain number of hours of daylight before they will grow, flower, or produce fruit. Without this they will not complete their life-cycle and will not produce fruit and seeds. For this reason seeds brought from the temperate zones may not perform as expected, or at all in the tropics. Some plants are genetically keyed to only start producing when a certain number of hours of daylight is reached, the same number of hours as is found in their native habitat. With the shorter daylight hours experienced in the tropics, that switch never gets thrown.
