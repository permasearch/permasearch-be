McFeely said the writing process began in the middle of 2011, around the release of The First Avenger, with him and Markus "noodling on in hopes that there would be a second one and we did a lot of just throwing stuff at the wall and seeing what stuck".[63] The first few months of writing were a back and forth process with Marvel, but that after an outline was finished, the story did not change much.[64] They opted to set the story in the present day, and, after "experimenting with flashback elements for more period World War II stuff",[65] decided to abandon the flashbacks as "it became unwieldy."[63] The film would be "Cap versus the world we all live in today",[66] while averting excessive comedy regarding the hero's time displacement, as Markus considered the Captain "the most adaptive man on the planet."[63] The tone would be more grounded in reality despite the advanced technology to contrast the fantasy elements from both the first Captain America and The Avengers.[66] Despite that, the comic book origins guaranteed that the film would not have verisimilitude.[38] This still proved a challenge in the reveal of Arnim Zola, that had to be extensively rewritten to convey how "this grounded espionage paranoid thriller suddenly screeches to a halt and you switch gears really quickly with this ghost in the machine" that introduces more science fiction elements.[67]
