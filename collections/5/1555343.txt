Since Belgium became an independent nation only in 1830, defining nationhood was a special issue for the historians of the late 19th century.  The usual European solutions which defined nationhood in terms of language would not work.  The Romantic Joseph-Jean de Smet portrayed his country as a "phoenix" (a reference to the great bird that rose from the dead.)  The challenge of defining the nation's past and present in the face of Dutch, Spanish, Austrian, French, and German influences posed a central problem.  Defending the boundaries of Belgium (especially why Flanders should not be in the Netherlands) was another issue that preoccupied historical writers such as Pirenne.[140]
