Von Neumann made fundamental contributions in exploration of problems in numerical hydrodynamics. For example, with Robert D. Richtmyer he developed an algorithm defining artificial viscosity that improved the understanding of shock waves. When computers solved hydrodynamic or aerodynamic problems, they tried to put too many computational grid points at regions of sharp discontinuity (shock waves). The mathematics of artificial viscosity smoothed the shock transition without sacrificing basic physics.[109] Von Neumann's other contributions to fluid dynamics included the discovery of the classic flow solution to blast waves,[110] and the co-discovery of the ZND detonation model of explosives.[111] During the 1930s, Von Neumann became an authority on the mathematics of shaped charges.[112]
