Flat feet can also develop as an adult ("adult acquired flatfoot") due to injury, illness, unusual or prolonged stress to the foot, faulty biomechanics,[9] or as part of the normal aging process.  This is most common in women over 40 years of age. Known risk factors include obesity, hypertension and diabetes.[10] Flat feet can also occur in pregnant women as a result of temporary changes, due to increased elastin (elasticity) during pregnancy.  However, if developed by adulthood, flat feet generally remain flat permanently.
