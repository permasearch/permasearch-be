For uncentered data, there is a relation between the correlation coefficient and the angle φ between the two regression lines, y = gx(x) and x = gy(y), obtained by regressing y on x and x on y respectively. (Here φ is measured counterclockwise within the first quadrant formed around the lines' intersection point if r > 0, or counterclockwise from the fourth to the second quadrant if r < 0.) One can show[9] that if the standard deviations are equal, then r = sec φ − tan φ, where sec and tan are trigonometric functions.
