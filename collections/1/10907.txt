Mad Max was first released in Australia through Roadshow Film Distributors (now Village Roadshow Pictures) in 1979.[25] The movie was sold overseas for $1.8 million, with American International Pictures releasing in the United States and Warner Bros. handling the rest of the world.[8] The film was banned in New Zealand and Sweden, in the former because of the scene where Goose is burned alive inside his vehicle: it unintentionally mirrored an incident with a real gang shortly before the film's release. It was later shown in New Zealand in 1983 after the success of the sequel, with an 18 certificate.[26] The ban in Sweden was removed in 2005, and it has since been shown on television and sold on home media there.[27]
