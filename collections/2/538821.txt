Grayson nearly marries Vanessa, but she backs out on the day of the wedding. Jane has two relationships during the season that indicate she is trying to move on from Grayson.  The first, with Dr. Bill Kendall (Ben Shenkman), ends when he reveals that Jane is one of the several women he is dating and that he is not ready to get serious with any one of them.  The second, toward the end of the season, is with a fun-loving new judge named Owen French (Lex Medlin).
