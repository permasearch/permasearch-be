Harkness mentioned in her 1938 book The Baby Giant Panda that the capture took place within a day's walk from the Min River in Sichuan.[2] Su Lin, about 9 weeks old at the time of his capture,[3] was named after Su-Lin Young, the sister-in-law of Harkness's Chinese-American expedition partner Quentin Young. Harkness translated Su Lin as meaning "a little bit of something very cute".[1] (Harkness and Young were unaware that the baby panda was, in fact, a male.)[4]
