The most common cause of death is respiratory failure. Other causes of death are pneumonia (leading to sepsis),[13] high fever (leading to neurological problems), dehydration (from excessive vomiting and diarrhea), electrolyte imbalance and kidney failure.[14] Fatalities are more likely in young children and the elderly.
