After the release of his debut studio album James Arthur, he was involved in a series of controversies which led iTunes to offer refunds for the album.[5] The single release "Recovery" made to number 19, while the sales for the fourth single "Get Down" hardly made the top 100. Arthur parted ways with Simon Cowell's record label Syco in 2014. In 2015, he signed a new deal with Columbia Records to release his second studio album in 2016, titled Back from the Edge. Arthur was also re-signed to Syco in 2016.
