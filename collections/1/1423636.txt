We can identify the space of linear operators on a vector space V, defined over the field F, with the space     V ⊗  V  ∗     {\displaystyle V\otimes V^{*}}  , where     v ⊗ h =  (  w ↦ h ( w ) v  )    {\displaystyle v\otimes h=\left(w\mapsto h(w)v\right)}  . We also have a canonical bilinear function     t : V ×  V  ∗   → F   {\displaystyle t\colon V\times V^{*}\to F}   that consists of applying an element w* of V* to an element v of V to get an element of F, in symbols     t  (  v ,  w  ∗    )  :=  w  ∗   ( v ) ∈ F   {\displaystyle t\left(v,w^{*}\right):=w^{*}(v)\in F}  . This induces a linear function on the tensor product (by its universal property)     t : V ⊗  V  ∗   → F   {\displaystyle t\colon V\otimes V^{*}\to F}  , which, as it turns out, when that tensor product is viewed as the space of operators, is equal to the trace.
