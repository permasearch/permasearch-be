The cuisine of the Thirteen Colonies includes the foods, eating habits, and cooking methods of the Thirteen British colonies in North America before the American Revolution. It was derived from familiar traditions from the colonists' home countries in the British Isles, particularly England. Many agricultural items came through trade with England and the West Indies. Certain familiar items grew better in the Old World than others, and this led to a dependence on imports which drove the daily lives of the colonists. However, the colonial diet was increasingly supplemented by new animal and plant foods indigenous to the New World.
