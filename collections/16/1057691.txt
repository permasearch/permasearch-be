Prior to release of the mod tools with Afterbirth+, a fan-made mod of The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth called The Binding of Isaac: Antibirth was released in December 2016. Similar to the official expansions, Antibirth adds a number of playable-characters, bosses, power-ups, and other content, crafted by players in the game's community, while adjusting some of the gameplay aspects that had been changed in the Afterbirth expansion to work more closely with how Rebirth had been originally released.[54] Alice O'Connor of Rock Paper Shotgun considered the mod as a "more difficult than [The Binding of Isaac]" and a new challenge to work alongside with the official game expansions.[54] The group has announced it plans to rework Antibirth to work atop the Afterbirth+ expansion, and to add mod support for the game.[38]
