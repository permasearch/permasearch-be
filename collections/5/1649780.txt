The loanable funds doctrine was formulated in the 1930s by British economist Dennis Robertson[1] and Swedish economist Bertil Ohlin.[2] However, Ohlin attributed its origin to Swedish economist Knut Wicksell[3] and the so-called Stockholm school, which included economists Erik Lindahl and Gunnar Myrdal.[4]
