Competition from newly enriched companies, as well as the commencement of online ticket sales,[7] caused a severe reduction in fares by 2002.[8][13] In these "fare wars", fares were reduced fourfold in some cases,[8][9] and many bus operators advertised their $10 bus fares.[14] This led to gang violence in which rival bus operators would kill or injure each other.[8] In addition, because of the low bus fares, Chinatown bus lines often made very small profits, and some, like YO! Bus, went bankrupt and ceased all operations.[9] Still, the Chinatown bus sector made up an increasing number of trips within the Northeast United States.[5]
