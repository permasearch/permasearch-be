Tarantino teamed with The Weinstein Company to prepare what he planned to be his film for production.[52] In July 2008, Tarantino and executive producers Harvey and Bob Weinstein set up an accelerated production schedule to be completed for release at the Cannes Film Festival in 2009, where the film would compete for the Palme d'Or.[53][54] The Weinstein Company co-financed the film and distributed it in the United States, and signed a deal with Universal Pictures to finance the rest of the film and distribute it internationally.[55][56] Germany and France were scheduled as filming locations and principal photography started in October 2008 on location in Germany.[57][58][59] Filming was scheduled to begin on October 13, 2008, and shooting started that week.[60][61] Special effects were handled by KNB EFX Group with Greg Nicotero[62] and much of the film was shot and edited in the Babelsberg Studios in Potsdam, Germany[4] and in Bad Schandau, a small spa town near Germany's border with the Czech Republic.[63] Roth claimed that they "almost got incinerated", during the theater fire scene, as they projected the fire would burn at 400 °C (750 °F), but it instead burned at 1200 °C (2000 °F). He claimed the swastika was not supposed to fall either, as it was fastened with steel cables, but the steel softened and snapped.[64] On January 11, 2013, on the BBC's The Graham Norton Show, Tarantino claimed that for the scene where Kruger was strangled, he personally strangled the actress, with his own bare hands, in one take, to aid authenticity.[65]
