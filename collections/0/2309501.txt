In January 2008, San Diego International Airport entered the blogosphere with the launch of the first employee blog–the Ambassablog[101]–for a major US airport. Written by front-line employees, the blog features regular posts on airport activities, events, and initiatives; reader comments; and several multimedia and interactive features. It has been presented as a case study in employee blogging to several public agencies at the federal, state, and local levels.
