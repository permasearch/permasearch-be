A mechanical direct evaporative cooler unit uses a fan to draw air through a wetted membrane, or pad, which provides a large surface area for the evaporation of water into the air. Water is sprayed at the top of the pad so it can drip down into the membrane and continually keep the membrane saturated. Any excess water that drips out from the bottom of the membrane is collected in a pan and recirculated to the top. Single stage direct evaporative coolers are typically small in size as it only consists of the membrane, water pump, and centrifugal fan. The mineral content of the municipal water supply will cause scaling on the membrane, which will lead to clogging over the life of the membrane. Depending on this mineral content and the evaporation rate, regular cleaning and maintenance is required to ensure optimal performance. Generally, supply air from the single-stage evaporative cooler will need to be exhausted directly (one-through flow) because the high humidity of the supply air. Few design solutions have been conceived to utilize the energy in the air like directing the exhaust air through two sheets of double glazed windows, thus reducing the solar energy absorbed through the glazing.[12] Compared to energy required to achieve the equivalent cooling load with a compressor, single stage evaporative coolers consume less energy.[7]
