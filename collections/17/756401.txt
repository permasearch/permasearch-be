The 2014 TV series picks up over a year after the end of the special, after Molly has completed training as a Combat Medical Technician. She is told she is to fly out to Camp Bastion in Afghanistan alongside her new team, 2 Section, who are all males. She is uncomfortable to discover that an ex-flame, Dylan "Smurf" Smith (Iwan Rheon) is amongst her new section, and sets off on the wrong foot with haughty team leader Captain Charles James (Ben Aldridge) a hailed war hero. On arrival in Afghanistan, Molly fights to prove herself to the men around her while also offering compassion to the locals, including eleven-year-old Afghan girl Bashira (Becky Eggersglusz), giving herself an understanding of what it is like to be a civilian caught up in the Taliban's war.
