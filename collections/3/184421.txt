In humans the main gluconeogenic precursors are lactate, glycerol (which is a part of the triacylglycerol molecule), alanine and glutamine. Altogether, they account for over 90% of the overall gluconeogenesis.[7] Other glucogenic amino acids as well as all citric acid cycle intermediates, the latter through conversion to oxaloacetate, can also function as substrates for gluconeogenesis.[8]  In ruminants, propionate is the principal gluconeogenic substrate.[5][9] Generally, consumption of gluconeogenic substrates in food does not result in increased gluconeogenesis.[10]
