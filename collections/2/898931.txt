In April 1922, Kenyatta began a job working as a stores clerk and meter reader for Cook, who had been appointed water superintendent for the Nairobi municipal council.[42] In this position he earned 250 shillings a month, a particularly high wage for a native African, which brought him financial independence and a growing sense of self-confidence.[43] Kenyatta lived in Kilimani,[44] although financed the construction of a second home at Dagoretti; he referred to this latter hut as the Kinyata Stores for he used it to hold general provisions for the neighbourhood.[45] He had sufficient funds that he could lend money to European clerks in the offices,[46] and could enjoy the lifestyle offered by Nairobi, which included cinemas, football matches, and imported British fashions.[46]
