From December 1962 to March 1963, the French government lent it to the United States to be displayed in New York City and Washington, D.C.[87][88] It was shipped on the new liner SS France.[89] In New York an estimated 1.7 million people queued "in order to cast a glance at the Mona Lisa for 20 seconds or so."[85] While exhibited in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the painting was almost drenched in water because of a faulty sprinkler, but the bullet-proof glass case which encased the painting protected it.[90]
