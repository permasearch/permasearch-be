There are also other robot mining techniques that could be applied under the ocean.  Rio Tinto is using satellite links to allow workers 1500 kilometers away to operate drilling rigs, load cargo, dig out ore and dump it on conveyor belts, and place explosives to subsequently blast rock and earth.  The firm can keep workers out of danger this way, and also use fewer workers.  Such technology reduces costs and offsets declines in metal content of ore reserves.[25]  Thus a variety of minerals and metals are obtainable from unconventional sources with resources available in huge quantities.
