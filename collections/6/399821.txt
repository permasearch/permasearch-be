In Washington, D.C., the forecast arrival of Hurricane Irene caused postponement of the planned August 28 dedication ceremony for the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial.[84] In anticipation of the storm, thousands of sandbags were prepared for placement at flood-prone Washington Metro station entrances.[40] Amtrak service from Washington's Union Station southward was cancelled from August 26, until August 28.[39]
