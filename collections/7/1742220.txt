On November 12, 2013, local media reported that Freestyle Music Park is currently trying to sell off many of the rides from the venture. This was despite earlier rumors that Baker had plans to move the Freestyle rides to a park he planned to open in Orlando, Florida.[53] Dozens of the rides are now listed for sale with Ital International, a company based in Nashville. All of the park's rides were listed for sale, with the exception of the Wave Swinger and Balloon Race, which were previously sold to Seabreeze Amusement Park.[54][55]
