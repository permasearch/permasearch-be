Doakes enlisted in the U.S. Army and there earned his nickname "Sane James" for his ability to detect the mentally unhinged. Doakes went on to become an Army Ranger, serving with the elite Regimental Reconnaissance Detachment.[3] After spending many years in black operations, Doakes gave up his military career, electing instead to use his skills to help civilians as a police officer. Doakes's police career grinds to a halt when he receives excessive force citations; his volatile, angry nature proves he cannot work well with others (unless leading them). Doakes was partnered with Maria LaGuerta, which ended after she was promoted following a high-profile drug bust.
