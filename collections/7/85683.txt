A review of compositions for Cello in the Romantic era must include the talented German composer Fanny Mendelssohn (1805-1847) who wrote Fantasie in G-moll for Cello and Piano and Capriccio in A-flat for cello.  Other well-known works of the era include the Robert Schumann Concerto, the Antonín Dvořák Concerto as well as the two sonatas and the Double Concerto by Johannes Brahms.  American composer and founder of the American Music Center Marion Bauer (1882-1955) wrote a great number of chamber ensembles, symphonic orchestra and two notable trio sonatas for flute, cello and piano.
