A dedicated funny car class was tried by NHRA at one 1966 national event, and at two in 1968, before Funny Car Eliminator was created in 1969.[52] The trend to flip-top fiberglass bodies ("floppers") began with Jim Lytle's US$2000 Allison V-1710-powered chopped '34 Tudor Big Al II.[53] It would inspire "every flopper body ever formed".[54] Chrysler's dominance led Hernandez and Al Turner to try and turn things in Mercury's favor; Don Nichsolson's flip-top, tube-chassis Comet, arriving in 1966, changed everything.[55]  The “flopper”-bodied Comets were highly successful, in the hands of Chrisman, Kenz and Leslie, and Eddie Schartman; at the 1966 World Final, Schartman would become NHRA's first official Funny Car title winner.[56]
