Some UK universities now offer a DPT as a post-professional qualification, but the qualifying degree remains Bachelor or Master of Science, Physiotherapy (with honours). The Doctor of Physiotherapy in the UK differs from a US clinical doctorate in that it is a post-professional Physiotherapy specific research programme,[citation needed] which is offered at the University of Sussex in Brighton, Nottingham University and Robert Gordon University. Glasgow Caledonian University in Glasgow now offers a 3.5 year Doctor in Physiotherapy (pre-registration) programme which is the first clinical doctorate which leads to qualification as a Physiotherapist eligible to register with the CSP and HCPC in the United Kingdom. This programme provides a focus on researcher development as well as professional development within a health and social care context.
