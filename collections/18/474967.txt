The word "protoplasm" comes from the Greek protos for first, and plasma for thing formed, and was originally used in religious contexts.[8] It was used in 1839 by J. E. Purkinje for the material of the animal embryo.[9][10] Later, in 1846 Hugo von Mohl redefined the term (also named as Primordialschlauch, "primordial utricle") to refer to the "tough, slimy, granular, semi-fluid" substance within plant cells, to distinguish this from the cell wall and the cell sap (Zellsaft) within the vacuole.[11][12][13] Thomas Huxley (1869) later referred to it as the "physical basis of life" and considered that the property of life resulted from the distribution of molecules within this substance.[14] The protoplasm became an "epistemic thing".[15] Its composition, however, was mysterious and there was much controversy over what sort of substance it was.[16]
