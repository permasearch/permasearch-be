Despite being a ghost, there are many situations where Marty proves that in many ways his feelings are still human and he shows as much fear of other ghosts and paranormal activity as any human would. In the episode "The House on Haunted Hill", Marty shows a great fear of electronic equipment that produces the sounds and noises of ghosts in the attic of a house. He is far more afraid than even Jeff, and he doesn't appear to have any sense of other paranormal phenomena when he cannot physically see them. He also shows a subservience to the 1920s American gangster ghost of Bugsy in episode 8, "Murder Ain't What it Used to Be".
