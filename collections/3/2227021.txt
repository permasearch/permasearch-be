Some dictionaries suggest a derivation from Welsh pen, "head" and gwyn, "white",[6] including the Oxford English Dictionary, the American Heritage Dictionary,[7] the Century Dictionary[7] and Merriam-Webster,[8] on the basis that the name was originally applied to the great auk, either because it was found on White Head Island (Welsh Pen Gwyn) in Newfoundland, or because it had white circles around its eyes (though the head was black).
