Foyle has been in "retirement" after his resignation a year earlier at the end of Casualties of War. Stewart has been removed as a police driver (in the Mechanised Transport Corps) by Foyle's replacement, Meredith, and has been working as a librarian in the Air Ministry's cartography facility at Beverley Lodge for last six months. She is also "assisting" Foyle as his typist in writing his book on the Hastings Constabulary (even though she does not appear to be that capable). In addition, her uncle Aubrey Stewart (Brian Poyser), a priest, returns from the episode "The French Drop", when he visits Hastings for the bishop's conference. Milner, unhappy since Foyle's departure, seeks his counsel after finding Meredith difficult to work with and considers leaving Hasting. However, by the end of the episode, the original team is reunited when Foyle and Milner both decide to stay, and Stewart quits to rejoin them.
