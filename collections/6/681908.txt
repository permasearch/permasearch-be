Initially, different server software would use different ways to exchange this information with scripts. As a result, it wasn't possible to write scripts that would work unmodified for different server software, even though the information being exchanged was the same.  Therefore, it was decided to establish a standard way for exchanging this information: CGI (the Common Gateway Interface, as it defines a common way for server software to interface with scripts). Webpage generating programs invoked by server software that operate according to the CGI standard are known as CGI scripts.
