Deborah Evans Price, of Billboard magazine reviewed the song favorably, calling the song "unique, with an infectious, swampy beat and intriguing lyric about a "sidewalk soapbox preacher" on an unusual path to salvation." She goes on to say that lead vocalist Marty Roe "tackles the lyric with a funky energy."[1]
