Celebrity Family Feud, which is created by Mark Goodson and Bill Todman, is a spin-off of the American game show Family Feud. Similarly to the primetime All-Star Specials featured during the late 1970s and early 1980s, the episodes feature teams of celebrities playing for charity rather than normal contestants.
