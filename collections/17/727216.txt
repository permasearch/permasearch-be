Elaine is Jane's mother. Her parents divorced after Elaine's bipolar disorder caused her to behave erratically. She has also shown to be helpful at times in important cases, evident in Season 4's Crushed when she asked Jane to help out with a case involving a former babysitting charge being accused of murder. When Jane learned there was more than meets the eye, she asked Elaine for help in what happened to Chloe's dad that led to Peg barring her from seeing both her daughters again. When she told Jane about it, Elaine learns the truth of Mr. Surnow's real fate when she notified the police to search the backyard of the Surnow's home. In the season five finale, Elaine comes to Los Angeles, falling ill and it turns out she has a terminal brain tumor. On her hospital bed, she reveals she's always known Deb wasn't really Jane but is still proud of her as her daughter before dying.
