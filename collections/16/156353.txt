Cooper approached Lukas Nelson (son of country music singer Willie Nelson) after seeing him perform at Desert Trip in October 2016 and asked him to work on the film as a music consultant.[9] Nelson said he began "writing songs for the movie, just for the heck of it, and sending them over to the producer, and they started liking them. Then Lady Gaga came by and I met her and we clicked. We became good friends, and we started writing together."[10] Gaga, in turn, provided backing vocals on two tracks on Nelson's self-titled album released in 2017.[11] Nelson and his band, Lukas Nelson & Promise of the Real, appear in the film as Cooper's backing band.[6]
