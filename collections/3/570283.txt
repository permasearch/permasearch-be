United Kingdom source income is generally subject to United Kingdom taxation no matter the citizenship nor the place of residence of the individual nor the place of registration of the company. For individuals, this means the United Kingdom income tax liability of one who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom is limited to any tax deducted at source on UK income, together with tax on income from a trade or profession carried on through a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom and tax on rental income from United Kingdom real estate.
