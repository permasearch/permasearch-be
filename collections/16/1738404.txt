Featuring the voices of Bob Newhart, Eva Gabor (in her final film role), John Candy, and George C. Scott, The Rescuers Down Under was the first animated theatrical film sequel produced by Disney.[2] The film was the second released during the Disney Renaissance (1989â€“1999) era, which had begun the year prior with The Little Mermaid, but was an underperformer at the box office compared to the other films of the era.
