In a press conference on November 13, 2007, MLS announced the award of an MLS expansion team franchise to Seattle.[3] In 2008, Sounders FC developed the Starfire Sports Complex in Tukwila and the USL team played most of the 2008 season at the updated facility. At the time, the USL team's management thought that practicing and playing at Starfire could provide more continuity and a smoother transition for those hoping to play for the new MLS franchise.[4]
