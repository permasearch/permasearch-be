A 15 M☉ star would take between 11.5 and 15 million years to reach the red supergiant stage, with more rapidly rotating stars taking the longest.[127] Rapidly-rotating 20 M☉ stars take only 9.3 million years to reach the red supergiant stage, while 20 M☉ stars with slow rotation take only 8.1 million years.[57] These form the best estimates of Betelgeuse's current age, with a preferred age since the zero age main sequence of 8.0–8.5 million years for a 20 M☉ star with no rotation.[12]
