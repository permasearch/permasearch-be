Synchronous motors use DC-voltage-fed rotor windings, which lets the excitation of the machine be controlledâ€”and induction motors use short-circuited rotors (instead of a magnet) following the rotating magnetic field of a multicoiled stator. The short-circuited turns of the rotor develop eddy currents in the rotating field of the stator, and these currents in turn move the rotor by the Lorentz force.
