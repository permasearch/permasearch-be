With this defeat, German manager Franz Beckenbauer gained the rather unwanted distinction of having lost a World Cup final as both a player and a manager. (Beckenbauer had played in West Germany's defeat in 1966.) However, four years later he led Germany to the Gold medals and then became winner of the World Cup both as player and as manager (he also won as player in 1974).
