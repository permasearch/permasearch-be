At 445 inhabitants per square kilometre (1,150/sq mi),[1] Rwanda's population density is amongst the highest in Africa.[212] Historians such as Gérard Prunier believe that the 1994 genocide can be partly attributed to the population density.[42] The population is predominantly rural, with a few large towns; dwellings are evenly spread throughout the country.[213] The only sparsely populated area of the country is the savanna land in the former province of Umutara and Akagera National Park in the east.[214] Kigali is the largest city, with a population of around one million.[215] Its rapidly increasing population challenges its infrastructural development.[59][216][217] According to the 2012 census, the second largest city is Gisenyi, which lies adjacent to Lake Kivu and the Congolese city of Goma, and has a population of 126,000.[218] Other major towns include Ruhengeri, Butare, and Gitarama, all with populations below 100,000.[218] The urban population rose from 6% of the population in 1990,[216] to 16.6% in 2006;[219] by 2011, however, the proportion had dropped slightly, to 14.8%.[219]
