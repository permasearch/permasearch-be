Goldblume is often in charge of negotiating in hostage situations. In the early years especially, he is at odds with Howard Hunter, whose distinctly right-wing view of the world contrasts with his own. He is often the confidant of Captain Furillo, to the irritation of Lieutenant Calletano. He joined the police force in 1969 and was stationed at Jefferson Heights prior to his transfer to Hill Street. Though somewhat meek early on (emphasized by his wearing of a bow tie and his reluctance to draw his gun), he becomes more self-confident as the series progresses. At the beginning of the series, he is married with three children; however, after he is shot during an undercover operation, his wife—who did not want him working undercover—divorces him. In Season Four, Goldblume acted as Fay Furillo's labor coach, and briefly became her lover. He later fell head-over-heels for the wealthy widow of a mob boss, only to witness her cold-blooded murder during a dinner date. He had aspirations to become a writer during high school, and is convinced to write his memoirs in Season Seven following the tragic death of a former high school friend, who was also an aspiring writer.
