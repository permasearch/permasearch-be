In the particular case that there are only two genotypes of interest (e.g. representing the invasion of a new mutant allele), the change in genotype frequencies is often written in a different form. Suppose that two genotypes     A   {\displaystyle A}   and     B   {\displaystyle B}   have fitnesses      w  A     {\displaystyle w_{A}}   and      w  B     {\displaystyle w_{B}}  , and frequencies     p   {\displaystyle p}   and     1 − p   {\displaystyle 1-p}  , respectively. Then       w ¯   =  w  A   p +  w  B   ( 1 − p )   {\displaystyle {\overline {w}}=w_{A}p+w_{B}(1-p)}  , and so
