A significant change to Sims's dancing style came about as a result of his interaction with Harlem's hoofers, practitioners of a variation on the tap he had learned on the west coast.[4] Sims would later define the main difference between tap and hoofing as being that tap focuses on the heel and toe whereas hoofers "use the whole foot".[14][30] As a result of the synergy between hoofing technique and his unique use of a sandbox, his routines were described as being "as rich in sounds and textures as they were in steps."[31] Sims himself put it, "The feet are a set of drums."[1]
