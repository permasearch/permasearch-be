RBS uses branding developed for the Bank on its merger with the National Commercial Bank of Scotland in 1969.[71] The banks logo takes the form of an abstract symbol of four inward-pointing arrows known as the "Daisy Wheel" and is based on an arrangement of 36 piles of coins in a 6 by 6 square,[71] representing "the accumulation and concentration of wealth by the Group".[71]
