In late-2016, a website was set up for the "Baltimore-Washington Superconducting Maglev Project".[14] The group reported that the U.S. Federal Railroad Administration, in cooperation with the Maryland Department of Transportation, is preparing an EIS (Environmental Impact Study) "to evaluate the potential impacts of constructing and operating a high-speed superconducting magnetic levitation (SCMAGLEV) system... between Washington, DC and Baltimore, Maryland".[15]
