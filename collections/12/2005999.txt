Prior to CD Projekt's involvement, Metropolis Software (which CD Projekt bought in 2009 and closed in 2010) had obtained an undisclosed license from Andrzej Sapkowski for his novels in The Witcher series, around 1997. However, due to several other projects that the studio was involved with at the time, and concerns from their publisher TopWare about the materials' international appeal, the project never got farther than some initial media and a playable level.[8]
