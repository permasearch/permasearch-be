Ludwig tried to institute a few minor reforms but they proved insufficient to quell the storm of protests. On March 16, 1848, Ludwig I abdicated in favor of his eldest son Maximilian II.[73]  Ludwig complained that "I could not rule any longer, and I did not want to give up my powers. In order to not become a slave, I became a lord." Ludwig was the only German ruler who abdicated in the 1848 revolutions. Although some popular reforms were introduced, the government regained full control.[74]
