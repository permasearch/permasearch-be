Ingram at some point made contact with the U.S. Government to build the Machine. Ingram acted as the public face of IFT and was the man with whom the government dealt, keeping up the facade that he alone was building the Machine, while in fact, Finch covertly began building it. While the government suspected someone other than Ingram was working on it, Finch was able to keep in hiding and they did not find proof ("Ghosts").
