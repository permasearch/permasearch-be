Thin reticular fibers of reticular connective tissue, and elastin form a supporting meshwork called a reticulin inside the node. B cells are mainly found in the outer (superficial) cortex where they are clustered  together as follicular B cells in lymphoid follicles and the T cells are mainly in the paracortex.[6] The lymph node is divided into compartments called lymph nodules (or lobules) each consisting of a cortical region of combined follicle B cells, a paracortical region of T cells, and a basal part of the nodule in the medulla.[7]
