Discovered on December 18, 1994, it is considered one of the most significant prehistoric art sites and the UNâ€™s cultural agency UNESCO granted it World Heritage status on June 22, 2014.[3] The cave was first explored by a group of three speleologists: Eliette Brunel-Deschamps, Christian Hillaire, and Jean-Marie Chauvet for whom it was named. Chauvet has a detailed account of the discovery.[4] In addition to the paintings and other human evidence, they also discovered fossilized remains, prints, and markings from a variety of animals, some of which are now extinct.
