Not all words underwent certain phases of the Great Vowel Shift.  Examples are father, which failed to become /ɛː/, and broad, which failed to become /oʊ/. The word room, which was spelled as roum in Middle English, retains its Middle English pronunciation. It is an exception to the shifting of /uː/ to /aʊ/ because it is followed by m, a labial consonant.
