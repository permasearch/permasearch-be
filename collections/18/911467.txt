Beaver joins a secret club, "The Bloody Five". The club doesn't want to admit Larry, who is so offended he shows up at Beaver's house in the costume of his own club, "The Fiends". Beaver leaves his club to join Larry's and is furious when he discovers Larry is the only member. Ward is unhappy that Beaver would join an exclusive club and tells him the worst reason to form a club is to keep people out.
