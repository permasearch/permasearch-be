Colloid solutions used in intravenous therapy belong to a major group of volume expanders, and can be used for intravenous fluid replacement. Colloids preserve a high colloid osmotic pressure in the blood,[36] and therefore, they should theoretically preferentially increase the intravascular volume, whereas other types of volume expanders called crystalloids also increase the interstitial volume and intracellular volume. However, there is still controversy to the actual difference in efficacy by this difference,[36] and much of the research related to this use of colloids is based on fraudulent research by Joachim Boldt.[37] Another difference is that crystalloids generally are much cheaper than colloids.[36]
