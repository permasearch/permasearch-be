The fingering scheme of the saxophone, which has had only minor changes since the instrument's original invention, has presented inherent acoustic problems related to closed keys below the first open tonehole that affect response of, and slightly muffle, some notes.  There is also a lack of tactile consistency moving between key centers.  Extra effort is required from the player to adjust modes of muscle memory when moving between key centers.  Two efforts to remedy the acoustic problems and awkward aspects of the original fingering system are noteworthy.
