Vibration of the tendon without vision has a major impact on postural orientation.[3] Vibration of the tendon causes movement backwards and the illusion of a forward body tilt in standing subjects.[4] This is because vibrations stimulate muscle spindles in the calf muscles. The muscle spindles alert the brain that the body is moving forward, so the central nervous system compensates by moving the body backwards.
