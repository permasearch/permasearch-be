Second-language learners are often encouraged to memorize a modifier, usually a definite article, in conjunction with each noun â€“ for example, a learner of French may learn the word for "chair" as la chaise (meaning "the chair"); this carries the information that the noun is chaise, and that it is feminine (because la is the feminine singular form of the definite article).
