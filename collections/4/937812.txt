William McGuire(1968) further broke down Hovland et al. (1953) message processing stages (attention, comprehension, acceptance)[8] into six stages: presentation, attention, comprehension, yielding, retention, and behavior.[21] In summary, McGuire proposed that a message must first be presented, drawn attention to, and then understood and comprehended by the audience. This would cause an attitude change, that must be remembered at a later time to actually influence behavioral changes.[8] McGuire emphasized the importance of reception (the attention and comprehension stages of the Yale group) and yielding (anticipation and critical-evaluation steps) in his study of individual differences in influencibility.[22] According to McGuire reception was positively related to ability and motivational attributes.[22] Individual attributes also contributed to the yielding stage(acceptance of the opinion).[22] One weakness of the approach is the nature of its steps—specifically, the yielding step. The approach assumes that the audience's attitude will change by learning a new message, yet learning does not always result in persuasion.[23] This Information processing paradigm's heritage lays in the message learning theme and theories that guided the work done on persuasion and attitude change by the Yale Communications program.[24] McGuire is best known for his inoculation theory of exploring resistance to persuasion, which was influenced by the Yale School's research on the resilience of two-sided messages on opinion acceptance.[14]
