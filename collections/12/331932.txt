Committee sizes range from 6 to 50 members per committee. In the House, one person may not serve on more than two standing committees and four subcommittees at one time, though waivers can be granted to serve on additional committees. Also in the House, the House Republican Steering Committee assigns Republican representatives to their committee(s),[1][2] while the Steering and Policy Committee is in charge of assigning Democratic representatives to committees.[3] The Senate follows similar procedures, with senators being limited to no more than three full committees and five sub-committees.
