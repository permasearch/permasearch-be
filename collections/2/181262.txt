The Three Little Pigs (voiced by Cody Cameron) are friends of Shrek and the others. In the original book and in the film, they are among the many fairytale creatures to be banished into Shrek's swamp by Lord Farquaad. One of the pigs stated that Lord Farquaad "huffed and puffed and signed an eviction notice." They all have German accents. They appear in all the Shrek films.
