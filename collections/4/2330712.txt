On 28 July 2015, 2K Games announced the sequel Mafia III.[52] The game, which was released on 7 October 2016, takes place in the city of "New Bordeaux", based on New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1968 during the Vietnam War, seventeen years after the events in Mafia II. The protagonist, Lincoln Clay, is a black Vietnam Veteran, with the game developers straying away from the traditional Italian mob characters from the first two Mafia games. Vito Scaletta, now older than in Mafia II, has a role in the game, and other references are made back to Mafia II.[53]
