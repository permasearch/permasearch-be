At the Nickelodeon upfront meeting with advertisers on March 13, 2014, Nickelodeon programming president Russell Hicks stated that Sam & Cat had been renewed for a second season,[2] and Adweek reported that an additional twenty episodes were ordered.[3] However, other Nickelodeon sources stated that an official decision was yet to be made on whether the show would be renewed, leading to cancellation rumors after Nickelodeon put the series on a production hiatus on April 3, 2014.[4] After airing 33 episodes, Nickelodeon released a promo stating two episodes remained to air.[5] On July 13, 2014, after a three-month production hiatus, Nickelodeon canceled the series, having produced only 36 episodes of the 40 episode order.[6][7] Media outlets attributed the cancellation to a salary dispute between McCurdy and Nickelodeon, a feud between McCurdy and Grande, the leak of racy photographs of McCurdy, the rising musical career of Grande, and both actresses' desires to move on to other projects.[6][8][9][10] The last episode aired on July 17, 2014, as a lead-in to the first Kids' Choice Sports Awards ceremony.
