It is possible to test whether the gravitational potential continues with the inverse square law at very small distances. Tests so far have focused on a divergence from GR in the form of a Yukawa potential     V ( r ) =  V  0   ( 1 + α  e  − r  /  λ   )   {\displaystyle V(r)=V_{0}(1+\alpha e^{-r/\lambda })}  , but no evidence for a potential of this kind has been found. The Yukawa potential with     α = 1   {\displaystyle \alpha =1}   has been ruled out down to     λ = 5.6 ×  10  − 5     {\displaystyle \lambda =5.6\times 10^{-5}}  m.[71]
