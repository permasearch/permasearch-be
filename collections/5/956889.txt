Research suggests that much more is learned perception, however. Contrary to popular belief, absolute pitch is learned at a critical age, or for a familiar timbre only.[153][154] Debate still occurs over whether Western chords are naturally consonant or dissonant, or whether that ascription is learned.[155][156] Relation of pitch to frequency is a universal phenomenon, but scale construction is culturally specific.[157] Training in a cultural scale results in melodic and harmonic expectations.[158]
