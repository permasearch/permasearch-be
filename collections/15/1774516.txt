In the first CFL playoff game ever played between two U.S.-based franchises, the Texans defeated the Birmingham Barracudas 52–9 at the Alamodome on November 5. The team then lost to the eventual champion Baltimore Stallions 21–11 in Baltimore on November 11. The Texans folded after the 1995 season; the team had respectable attendance and manageable financial losses, but widespread dysfunction among most of the rest of the league led to the team's demise. As a result, the November 11 game is the last meaningful CFL game to have been played in the United States.
