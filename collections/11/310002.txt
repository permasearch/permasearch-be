Ionizing radiation is not a particularly strong mutagen.[51] Residential exposure to radon gas, for example, has similar cancer risks as passive smoking.[51] Radiation is a more potent source of cancer when combined with other cancer-causing agents, such as radon plus tobacco smoke.[51] Radiation can cause cancer in most parts of the body, in all animals and at any age. Children and adolescents are twice as likely to develop radiation-induced leukemia as adults; radiation exposure before birth has ten times the effect.[51]
