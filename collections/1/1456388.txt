It is revealed that 'contraband' supplies have been delivered to participants. These included food, drink and a mobile phone. The participants have to decide what to do about this. There is a meeting. No one admits to having a phone, and it is decided that whoever has it can leave it in particular place. Later, a phone is found in the place decided at the meeting. One of the Valley Boys finds a pack of supplies, which he takes (he says 'Finders Keepers' to the fellow Valley Boys), even though he believes it was left by Rob for Katie. Katie realises it is gone and angrily accuses the Valley Boys. Early on the last day of the experiment, Katie's hut burns down.
