"Jingle Bells" is one of the best-known[1] and commonly sung[2] American songs in the world. It was written by James Lord Pierpont (1822â€“1893) and published under the title "One Horse Open Sleigh" in the autumn of 1857. It has been claimed that it was originally written to be sung by a Sunday school choir; however, historians dispute this, stating that it was much too "racy" (and secular) to be sung by a children's church choir in the days it was written.[3]
