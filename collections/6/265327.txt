The "topping out" of the cathedral (when the final stone was placed on the lantern) took place on 26 October 1708, performed by Wren's son Christopher Jr and the son of one of the masons.[21] The cathedral was declared officially complete by Parliament on 25 December 1711 (Christmas Day).[22] In fact, construction continued for several years after that, with the statues on the roof added in the 1720s. In 1716 the total costs amounted to £1,095,556[23] (£148 million in 2015).[24]
