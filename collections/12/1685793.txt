The "crusty"[11] character also proved unpopular with some fans, who among other things found her treatment of the lovable android Data to be mean-spirited.[12] Muldaur left the series after only one season. Show representatives denied that she had been fired, saying, "Technically, she's just not returning", while other sources said that her option had not been renewed.[13] Roddenberry described Muldaur as "a most talented actress", and said that the decision "to let her go was made solely because the hoped-for chemistry between her and the rest of the starship cast did not develop."[13][14][15] Berman added, "The thought of bringing Gates back was a good idea to us. The feeling was that we had perhaps made a mistake, and the best way to remedy it was to bring her back."[16] The "revolving door"[17] and the limited opportunities for female crew led critics to suggest that the mostly-male series still had a problem featuring women.[18][19]
