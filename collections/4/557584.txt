The following year was marked by more trouble as the team plummeted to a 27â€“55 record. The bankruptcy of the Oregon Arena corporation, which resulted in the Rose Garden being owned by a consortium of investment firms, further alienated the fanbase, as did an incident in which forward Darius Miles (himself African-American) called coach Maurice Cheeks a "nigger", following it up with more racial invective when Cheeks sought out Nash, referring to Nash as Cheeks' "daddy."[81] The latter incident was compounded by what many viewed as inadequate discipline for Miles, followed by a secret agreement between the team and Miles to refund the amount of his fine.[81] Cheeks was fired that season and replaced on an interim basis by director of player-personnel Kevin Pritchard.[82] That summer the team hired Nate McMillan, who had coached the Sonics the prior season,[83] and Pritchard returned to the front office.
