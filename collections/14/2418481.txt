Crayola also manufactures mechanical pencils with colored leads as part of its "Twistables" line, which also includes crayons and markers with a similar screw-based mechanical feed. Crayola does not currently offer refill cores for any of its Twistables products, so the pencils are intended to be discarded when empty. The external packaging of each set shows color swatches labeled by name, but the color names are not imprinted on the individual pencils themselves. They are available in 12,[13] (vibrant set) 18,[14] and 30[15] packs, an erasable 12 pack[16] and a Silly Scents 12 pack.[17] The 12 pack was released in 1998, the 18 pack was released in 2008, and the 30 pack was released in 2009.
