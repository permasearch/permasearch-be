The span of nearly five years between Splinter and Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace represented the longest gap between studio albums in the Offspring's career at the time. The band had been working on new material since the fall of 2004,[3] but showed no further signs of progress until November 2006, when they announced on their official website that they had begun recording with producer Bob Rock.[1] The album was supposed to be released in 2007, but kept getting pushed back. The writing and recording process, spanning four years and three recording studios, was finally finished in April 2008. It produced four singles: "Hammerhead", "You're Gonna Go Far, Kid", "Kristy, Are You Doing Okay?" and "Half-Truism". Although a video was made for "Stuff Is Messed Up", it was never officially released as a single, but saw regular radio play on popular stations such as Southern California's KROQ. "You're Gonna Go Far, Kid" was certified RIAA Gold for 500,000 sales, while the album has sold over 330,000 copies to date 2012.
