Courtney Vaudreuil of TV Equals also complimented the unpredictable setting that the writers have created stating "I don’t want to be prematurely optimistic, but I like the reboot in Once Upon a Time. I can’t tell what direction they’re going to go in next, which is nice. I am hopeful that all of Henry-centric stories are a thing of the past. Rebecca Mader looks fantastic as the Wicked Witch, so I’m excited to see what she does with the part."[15] Christine Orlado of TV Fanatic gave the episode 4.6 out of 5 stars, praising the relationship between Snow White and Regina saying, "I loved the changes that have occurred between Snow and Regina. It's best for the kingdom if they band together, but there are doubts as to whether Regina is really on board, until Snow finds her burying her own heart." She continued, quoting Regina's line "I don't run from monsters. They run from me.", and naming it one of her favorite quotes from the show.[16]
