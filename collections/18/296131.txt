The Ionian Revolt had begun with an unsuccessful expedition against Naxos, a joint venture between the Persian satrap Artaphernes and the Milesian tyrant Aristagoras.[21] In the aftermath, Artaphernes decided to remove Aristagoras from power, but before he could do so, Aristagoras abdicated, and declared Miletus a democracy.[21] The other Ionian cities followed suit, ejecting their Persian-appointed tyrants, and declaring themselves democracies.[21][22] Aristagoras then appealed to the states of mainland Greece for support, but only Athens and Eretria offered to send troops.[23]
