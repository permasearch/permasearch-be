The Nicene Creed, largely a response to Arianism, was formulated at the Councils of Nicaea and Constantinople in 325 and 381 respectively,[27] and ratified as the universal creed of Christendom by the Council of Ephesus in 431.[28] It sets out the main principles of Catholic Christian belief.[29] This creed is recited at Sunday Masses and is the core statement of belief in many other Christian churches as well.[29][30]
