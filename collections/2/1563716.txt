In October 2013, Mill ran into a social fight with fellow Maybach Music Group artist Wale, for not backing him up on his feud with Cassidy, hence the fact that the latter dissed Wale and several others, with whom Mill affiliated with. He also criticized Wale for not helping him support his second studio album.[125] Two years later, their dispute reignited after Wale sided with another of Mill's rivals, Drake.[126][127] However, after a long talk with mentor Rick Ross, the three later paired for "Make It Work", which was released on July 8, 2016[128]
