Skepticism about the Equinox's EPA fuel economy ratings has been raised after a number of road tests at the model's launch achieved 20 to 30% lower fuel economy than the official EPA ratings. After achieving 18.8 mpg‑US (12.5 L/100 km; 22.6 mpg‑imp) in a road test, Edmunds InsideLine stated, "...our testing didn't come close to achieving [the EPA's numbers], even though we're usually within 1 mpg of the EPA combined number. "[17] Car and Driver recorded another 18 mpg‑US (13 L/100 km; 22 mpg‑imp) figure and noted its "...fuel economy that won’t live up to the 22 mpg‑US (11 L/100 km; 26 mpg‑imp)/32 mpg‑US (7.4 L/100 km; 38 mpg‑imp) EPA ratings in real-world use...".[18] Green Car Reports recorded as much as 25.8 mpg‑US (9.1 L/100 km; 31.0 mpg‑imp) on a road trip, driving almost exclusively highway miles in "Eco" mode;[19] this is about 20% below the published highway EPA rating. AutoWeek only averaged 23 mpg‑US (10 L/100 km; 28 mpg‑imp).[20] The Truth About Cars published an editorial suggesting that GM "inflated" the Equinox's fuel economy ratings for public relations purposes and that the trip computer inaccurately reports fuel economy reported to the driver.[21]
