The British codebreakers needed to know the wiring of the special naval Enigma rotors, and the destruction of U-33 by HMSÂ Gleaner (J83) in February 1940 provided this information.[43] In early 1941, the Royal Navy made a concerted effort to assist the codebreakers, and on May 9 crew members of the destroyer Bulldog boarded U-110 and recovered her cryptologic material, including bigram tables and current Enigma keys. The captured material allowed all U-boat traffic to be read for several weeks, until the keys ran out; the familiarity codebreakers gained with the usual content of messages helped in breaking new keys.
