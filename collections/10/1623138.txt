Bears Ears has been regularly looted and vandalized for many years.[18]:1[43] In 2009, FBI and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) agents raided 16 homes in Blanding, following a two-year federal investigation and the indictment of 24 people for stealing, receiving or trying to sell Native American artifacts[44] from the hundreds of archaeological sites in the area.[39] This incident became an "early flashpoint in the struggle over control of public lands in the western United States."[44] Included among those arrested were a mathematics teacher, a brother of the county sheriff, and a prominent physician and his wife. Three people committed suicide following the raid.[44] From May 2014 to April 2015, there were reports of more than a dozen cases of "serious looting," ranging from "small-scale theft to ancestral remains being tossed around when graves are plundered."[18]:35
