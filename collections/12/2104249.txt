Non-scientific theories of attraction and symmetry abound. Symmetry of each face is evaluated by human brain via the facial recognition process. This fast and effective detection is difficult with computer programs.[17][18] For instance, the faces that were considered to possess a strong aesthetic appeal were the ones where the conjunction of similar or corresponding facial features were, to some extent, contrasting.[19] Likewise shared features echoism, proportions and similarity to people the person bonded to early in life (prima copulism) have been suggested as relevant.[20]
