The pygmy slow loris is nocturnal, although it is least active on cold, moonlit nights and is generally active on dark nights, regardless of temperature.[33] In the wild, it is normally encountered alone, or in small groups of two to four individuals.[34] Males use scent marking to defend territories and mark their boundaries. Females prefer to mate with males whose scent is familiar.[35] Males will also countermark—mark over or adjacent to another individual's mark deposited earlier—to advertise competitive ability to females.[36] Females actively prefer countermarking males to males whose odors have been countermarked.[37]
