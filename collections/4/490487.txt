Teams only averaged around 80 points per game in the years following the founding of the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1946.[2] Before the introduction of the shot clock, teams often ran out the clock by passing the ball more frequently after they established a lead in a game. If one team chose to stall, the other team (especially if behind) would often commit fouls to regain possession. This resulted in very low-scoring games with many fouls, affecting attendance by making fans irritable.[3] Starting in the 1954â€“55 season, the NBA implemented a 24-second shot clock. If the offensive team fails to hit the rim with the ball within the allotted time, they would lose possession.[4] This innovation resulted in much higher scoring games.[4] All of the highest-scoring games in the NBA have happened during the shot-clock era.
