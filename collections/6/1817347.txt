The battle system of Final Fantasy XIII received widespread praise. The increased pace of battles was appreciated, with several reviews describing it as "thrilling";[13][111] Edge's description of the battle system summarized it as "among the genre's finest".[112] 1UP.com said that "Despite the fact that two-thirds of your party is AI-controlled, FFXIII's battles may be the most involving the series has ever seen."[110] The story got a mixed reception, with Wired remarking that the plot was "a little more human and less esoteric than in previous games".[135] 1UP.com felt that the story was "hardly world-class writing", but that the writers clearly knew the medium well and had attempted to avoid clichÃ©s.[110] Reviewers felt that the characters worked well together,[110][115] and that the interactions among them as the game progressed made up for shortcomings in the story.[13]
