Henry later visits the art center, where Mr. Levine, unfazed by his village being destroyed, continues to work on the village. The ceremony date is changed. George, a man who works at the art center and translates for Henry and Mr. Levine, thinks it was just troublemakers who broke into the craft center to destroy everyone's art but had enough time to destroy only Mr. Levine's before they were scared off. Henry does not tell anyone that he was the one who really destroyed the village. Mr. Levine presents Henry with a carving of him, like the ones he made for all the people that had lived in his village.
