The Old Homestead Steakhouse is the first west-coast location of a New York institution which has been open for 140 years. Designed by San Francisco architects, EDG Interior Architecture + Design 250 to reflect its original roots in the Meatpacking District of New York City. The iconic spotted cow, Annabelle, which greets customers in New York, has also been replicated.[172] Dark woods and leather booths set the ambiance[173] of the 250-seat dining room, private dining area, lounge and bar in a space of approximately 6,000 square feet (560Â m2). Signature dishes from New York, including a 32-ounce Gotham rib steak, a dry-aged porterhouse, filet mignon and an 18-ounce empire cut of prime rib, are featured, as well as a raw bar with an assortment of seafood dishes. Just-for-Vegas entrees include Kobe meatballs and a prime short rib in wine sauce.[172] Sides feature duck fat fries, mashed potatoes with truffles or lobster meat, tater tots with Fat Boy sauce[173] (sour cream mixed with cheese and bacon bits)[172] and desserts like doughnut bread pudding,[173] chocolate cake, or a chocolate chip cookie "baked in a cast iron skillet". The restaurant also has a full wine bar with over 15,000 bottles to choose from as well as cocktails.[172]
