In the episode, the character of Sheriff Graham was killed off, something that actor Jamie Dornan had known would happen since ABC picked up the pilot.[7] It was the first major death of the series.[8] In an interview with E! reporter Kristin Dos Santos, Dornan hinted that while his counterpart in Storybrooke has died, the huntsman could return at some point, as Dornan is still a regular on the series.[1] As much of the episode involves Graham discovering his fairytale past, the writers designed the episode to mislead viewers by having them invest in the character.[9] Kitsis and Horowitz commented that while the death made them "sad,"[9] the battle between Emma and Regina requires "stakes and unfortunately, sometimes stakes are people's lives."[10] They also decided to kill the character relatively early in the series in order to show viewers that "it's real. It's not in Henry's head."[11] Kitsis continued, "It’s interesting, but part of the intent was to make you love him and we loved him very much. And the fact that the audience seems to have loved him means a lot to us, in that we feel like we succeeded on that front. If you don’t feel sad, then it was a failure of the execution of the story."[9]
