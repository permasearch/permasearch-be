The river gave its name to the former Nene College of Higher Education in Northampton, now the University of Northampton, and also to the Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet engine, Rolls-Royce's practice being to name their gas turbine designs after British rivers. The river may also be linked to the fact that Sir Henry Royce was born in Alwalton,[33] a village which is by the river, near Peterborough.
