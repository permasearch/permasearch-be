While Faith No More's music is generally considered as alternative metal,[67] experimental rock,[68][69] and funk metal,[70][71][72][73][74] as Faith No Man, their sound was described as post-punk.[75] The band's first single from 1983, "Quiet in Heaven/Song of Liberty", was labelled as a "solid post-punk/pre-goth single."[76] During their tenure with Chuck Mosley in the mid-1980s, Billy Gould stated the band were in a "weird spot", as their eclectic sound didn't fit in with the burgeoning hardcore punk and alternative rock movements of the era.[77] Upon Mike Patton's arrival in 1989, the band began to expand their sound range even further, merging disparate genres such as synthpop,[78] thrash metal[22] and carousel music[22] on The Real Thing. Rolling Stone states that during the 1990s, the band were "too heavy for the post-grunge pop hits of The Verve and Third Eye Blind [and] too arty to work comfortably with the nu metal knuckle-draggers they spawned."[67] Over the course of their career, they have experimented with heavy metal, funk, hip hop, progressive rock,[79] alternative rock, hardcore punk, polka, easy listening, jazz, samba,[80] ska,[81] bossa nova,[82] hard rock, pop,[83] soul,[84] gospel,[85] and lounge music.[86]
