As of April 2017, Black-eyed Pea has a total of 10 locations, including just one in Texas and nine in Colorado. The only Texas location is in Arlington, while the vast majority of the Colorado restaurants are in the Denver area. Many of the Texas locations had shut down by that time.  In December 2008, former corporate employees Stephen Shaw and Alan Laughlin, along with Steve's brother Jim Shaw, purchased all the rights to the Colorado locations of Black-eyed Pea. The three have begun changing menu items and pushing more advertising.
