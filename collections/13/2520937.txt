The No campaign launched with a claim that choosing AV would cost £250 million.[152] However, this figure was criticised on several grounds. For example, it included an estimated £82 million for holding the referendum, that would have applied whatever the referendum outcome, and failed to take into account costs saved from holding the referendum at the same time as other elections. The £250 million figure also included £130 million[153] for the cost of electronic voting systems, although these were not used by the largest country then using AV, Australia,[35][140][154] and there were no plans to use such machines if AV were introduced in the UK.[155] (The referendum actually cost about £75 million, below estimates made at the time, according to the Electoral Commission.[156])
