Simon the Leper is sometimes identified with Simon the Pharisee (see Shimon ben Gamliel), who is mentioned in the Gospel of Luke[5] as the host of a meal during which the feet of Jesus are anointed by a penitent woman.[6] Because of some similarities, efforts have been made to reconcile the events and characters, but some scholars have pointed out differences between the two events.[7] An alternative explanation for the similarities is that the Luke 7 anointing and the anointing at Bethany[8][9][10] happened with some of the same participants, but several years apart.[11]
