The 2006 MotoGP season started off with Rossi, once again, being the favorite to take the Championship, but he had trouble in the first half of the season, including mechanical failures at Shanghai[40] and Le Mans.[41] Rossi did however, win several races, in Qatar,[42] Italy,[43] Catalunya,[44] Germany[45]  and Malaysia.[46] Hayden held the points lead throughout most of the season, but Rossi was slowly working his way up the points ladder. It was not until Motegi when Rossi finally grabbed 2nd in the points race behind Hayden.[47] In the Portuguese Grand Prix, the penultimate race of the season, Hayden was taken out by his teammate, Dani Pedrosa, and did not finish the race. This led to Rossi taking the points lead with only one race left in the season.[48] However, Rossi crashed early in Valencia, the last race, and Hayden went on to win the championship, ahead of Rossi.[49]
