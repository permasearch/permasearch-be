Opponents such as Richard Kahlenberg have argued that right-to-work laws simply "gives employees the right to be free ridersâ€”to benefit from collective bargaining without paying for it".[27][28][6][29] Under labor laws in the United States, the union as the exclusive collective bargaining agent has a duty of fair representation for all persons in the bargaining unit, including those who choose not to be members and pay dues, and in Abood v. Detroit BoE, the Supreme Court of the United States permitted unions to charge non-members agency fees so that employees in the public sector could be required to pay for the costs of representation, even as they opted not to be a member, as long as these fees are not spent on the union's political or ideological agenda. The right to challenge the fees must include the right to have it heard by an impartial fact finder.[30]
