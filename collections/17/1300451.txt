On April 18, 2007, the Seneca Nation laid claim to a stretch of Interstate 90 that crosses the Cattaraugus Reservation. They revoked their 1954 agreement that had granted the Interstate Highway System and New York State Thruway Authority permission to build the highway through the territory. They were retaliating for move Governor Eliot Spitzer's attempts to collect state taxes from tribal businesses operating within Seneca sovereign territory.[65]
