Colour is the most obvious property of a mineral, but it is often non-diagnostic.[65] It is caused by electromagnetic radiation interacting with electrons (except in the case of incandescence, which does not apply to minerals).[66] Two broad classes of elements (idiochromatic and allochromatic) are defined with regards to their contribution to a mineral's colour: Idiochromatic elements are essential to a mineral's composition; their contribution to a mineral's colour is diagnostic.[63][67] Examples of such minerals are malachite (green) and azurite (blue). In contrast, allochromatic elements in minerals are present in trace amounts as impurities. An example of such a mineral would be the ruby and sapphire varieties of the mineral corundum.[67] The colours of pseudochromatic minerals are the result of interference of light waves. Examples include labradorite and bornite.
