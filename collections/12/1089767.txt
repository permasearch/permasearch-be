Today, according to Massimo Faggioli, the Knights of Columbus are "'an extreme version' of a postâ€“Vatican II phenomenon, the rise of discrete lay groups that have become centers of power themselves."[12] As the order and its charitable works grew, so did its prominence within the church.[36] The Supreme Board of Directors was invited to hold their April meeting at the Vatican in 1978, and the board and their wives were received by Pope Paul VI.[36] Pope John Paul I's first audience with a layman was with Supreme Knight Dechant, and Pope John Paul II met with Dechant three days after his installation.[36]
