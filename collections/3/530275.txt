Socially monogamous species are scattered throughout the animal kingdom: A few insects, a few fish, about nine-tenths of birds, and a few mammals are socially monogamous. There is even a parasitic worm, Schistosoma mansoni, that in its female-male pairings in the human body is monogamous.[106] The diversity of species with social monogamy suggests that it is not inherited from a common ancestor but instead evolved independently in many different species.
