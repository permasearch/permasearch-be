An air source heat pump requires an outdoor unit containing moving mechanical components including fans which produce noise. In 2013, the CEN started work on standards for protection from noise pollution caused by heat pump outdoor units.[25] Although the CEN/TC 113 Business Plan outset was that "consumers increasingly require a low acoustic power of these units as the users and their neighbours now reject noisy installations", no standards for noise barriers or other means of noise protection had been developed by January 2016.
