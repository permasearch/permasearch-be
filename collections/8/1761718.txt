Worcester Regional Airport in Worcester, which is also operated by Massport, also serves as an alternative to Logan, albeit known more recently as such. Currently, JetBlue Airways and Rectrix Shuttle are the only commercial airlines providing service to Worcester, though American Airlines intends to start service in October 2018. In late 2017, the airport finished construction on a Category IIIb Landing System that will allow for arrivals and departures in virtually all weather conditions. The increased reliability, which has been the main concern for airlines operating at the notoriously foggy airport over the years, is expected to draw additional service. The airport is located 47 statute miles (76Â km) due west of Logan, primarily accessed via Interstates I-90 and I-290.
