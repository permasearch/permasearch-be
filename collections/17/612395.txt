During their time in hibernation, bears' heart rate drops from 40â€“50 beats per minute to 8 beats per minute, and metabolic rate can drop to a quarter of a bear's (non-hibernating) basal metabolic rate (BMR). These reductions in metabolic rate and heart rate do not appear to decrease the bear's ability to heal injuries during hibernation.[71]
