Janmabhoomi Express is a popular train to take but can be very busy. Alternatives include the Godavari Express and the Konark Express (which stops at Visakhapatnam, but usually follows the normal route of Konark which is Mumbai to Bhubaneswar). The Secunderabad – Visakhapatnam Duronto Express is also an option as is the Visakhapatnam – Secunderabad Garib Rath Express. Duronto is faster but does not have full accommodations; Garib Rath is slower but has full accommodations.
