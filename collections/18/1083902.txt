At the 2004 North American International Auto Show, a Bronco concept vehicle was introduced. Some features of the concept vehicle, such as the box-like roof line, short wheelbase, and round headlamps are features associated with the early Bronco, but this concept vehicle also had a 2.0Â L intercooled turbodiesel I4 engine and a six-speed manual transmission. The concept also featured an Intelligent 4WD system to replace Control Trac II, which would improve stability and provide better fuel economy. The vehicle was to use the Ford CD2 platform, but the project was dropped when the newer Ford Escape was revealed, making it unlikely that this Bronco concept would see production.[23][24]
