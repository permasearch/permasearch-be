Disraeli wrote two novels in the aftermath of the tour. Contarini Fleming (1832) was avowedly a self-portrait. It is subtitled "a psychological autobiography", and depicts the conflicting elements of its hero's character: the duality of northern and Mediterranean ancestry, the dreaming artist and the bold man of action. As Parry observes, the book ends on a political note, setting out Europe's progress "from feudal to federal principles".[43] The Wondrous Tale of Alroy, the following year, portrayed the problems of a medieval Jew in deciding between a small, exclusively Jewish state and a large empire embracing all.[43]
