The original 1957 California Water Plan included provisions for dams on the Klamath, Eel, Mad and Smith Rivers of California's North Coast. Fed by prolific rainfall in the western Coast Ranges and Klamath Mountains, these rivers discharge more than 26 million acre feet (32 km3) to the Pacific each year, more than that of the entire Sacramento River system.[44] The plan was basically a variation of a contemporary Bureau of Reclamation project, the Klamath Diversion.
