In the summer of 1976 Ann Christy reached #3 on the Flemish chart for Belgium with a disco-formatted Dutch rendering of "Secret Love" entitled "Zoveel moier" which was included on Christy's album Ik mis hem zo - Zoveel mooier - ...: Christy also had a single release of the track singing "Secret Love" in its original English. Disco versions of "Secret Love" were also recorded by Liquid Gold (album Liquid Gold/ 1979) and Viola Wills (album If You Could Read My Mind/ 1980), while a dance-pop version of "Secret Love" by Jos√© Hoebee would become a #11 hit in the Netherlands in the autumn of 1982.
