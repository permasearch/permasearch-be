Ultrasonic dryers have been demonstrated. They use high frequency signals to drive piezoelectric actuators in order to mechanically shake the clothes, releasing water in the form of a mist which is then removed from the drum. They have the potential to significantly cut energy consumption while needing only one third of the time needed by a conventional electric dryer for a given load. They also don't have the same issues related with lint in most other types of dryers. [8]
