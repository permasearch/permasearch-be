In addition, a small number of British films have been re-dubbed when released in the United States, due to the usage of dialects which Americans are not familiar with (for example, Kes and Trainspotting). However, British children's shows (such as Bob the Builder) are always re-dubbed with American voice actors in order the series more understandable for American children. Conversely, British programs shown in Canada are not re-dubbed.
