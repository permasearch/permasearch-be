A candle wick is usually a braided cotton that holds the flame of an oil lamp or candle. A candle wick works by capillary action, conveying ("wicking") the fuel to the flame. When the liquid fuel, typically melted candle wax, reaches the flame it then vaporizes and combusts.  The candle wick influences how the candle burns.  Important characteristics of the wick include diameter, stiffness, fire-resistance, and tethering.
