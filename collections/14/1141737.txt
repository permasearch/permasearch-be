On  Wednesday 22 October 2008, SADC joined with the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa and the East African Community to form the African Free Trade Zone, including all members of each of the organizations.  The leaders of the three trading blocs agreed to create a single free trade zone, the African Free Trade Zone,  consisting of 26 countries with a GDP of an estimated $624bn (Â£382.9bn). It is hoped the African Free Trade Zone agreement would ease access to markets within the zone and end problems arising from the fact that several of the member countries belong to multiple groups.[20]
