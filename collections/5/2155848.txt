The priests performed "activities of ritual, sacrifice, divination, astronomical observation, chronological calculations, hieroglyphic writings, religious instruction, management of the monasteries". In addition to these responsibilities, the priest assisted the ajaw with regards to politics as well. The class of the priests was also divided into other sections. These included the nacom (would cut the heart out of a sacrificial victim), who were assisted by four chacs and the ahmen (prophet and "the inflictor as well as the healer of diseases"). This occasion also occurs in the Aztec Civilization too. [6]
