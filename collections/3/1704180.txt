In the United States, a distinction is often made between the indigenous culture of Native Americans, and a dominant culture that may be described as "Anglo", "white", "middle class", and so on. Some Native Americans are seen as being part of the culture of their own tribe, community, or family, while simultaneously participating in the dominant culture of America as a whole.[2]
