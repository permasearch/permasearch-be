The Ford Excursion is a heavy duty (Class 2), extended-length sport utility vehicle that was produced by Ford from 1999 to 2005, launched in late September 1999 for the North American market. The longest and heaviest SUV ever to enter mass production, the Excursion was based upon the Ford F-250 Super Duty pickup truck. A ¾-ton chassis vehicle, the Ford Excursion was designed as a competitor for the 2500-series (also ¾-ton) Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon XL.[2]
