John Hancock was elected to a second term in November 1785, even though he was not then in Congress, and Congress was aware that he was unlikely to attend.[18] He never took his seat, citing poor health, though he may have been uninterested in the position.[18] Two delegates, David Ramsay and Nathaniel Gorham, performed his duties with the title of "chairman".[18][19] When Hancock finally resigned the office in June 1786, Gorham was elected. After he resigned in November 1786, it was months before enough members were present in Congress to elect a new president.[18] In February 1787, General Arthur St. Clair was elected. Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance during St. Clair's presidency and elected him as the governor of the Northwest Territory.[20]
