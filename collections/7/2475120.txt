The single equality sign (=) for example is not used at all, and the double equality sign (==) is the test for equality, and even then only in expression contexts such as the expr command or the first argument to if. (Both of those commands are just part of the standard library; they have no particularly special place in the library and can be replaced, if so desired.)
