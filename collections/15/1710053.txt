In 1974, shortly after SoHo first came into existence, The New York Times described the boundaries as "stretching from Houston to Canal Streets between West Broadway and Lafayette Street"[11] – a definition it continued to hold to in 2016[12] – but The Encyclopedia of New York City reports that SoHo is bounded by Crosby Street on the east, and Sixth Avenue to the west.[13] These are the same boundaries shown by Google Maps.[14] However, the AIA Guide to New York City gives the western boundary of SoHo north of Broome Street as being West Broadway,[4] and New York magazine gives the eastern boundary as Lafayette Street and the western boundary as the Hudson River.[15] The very small-scale map at the Community Board 2 profile page on New York City's official website appears to show Sixth Avenue and Lafayette Street as the western and eastern boundaries.[16]
