The NHL operates two subscription-based services allowing access to live, out-of-market games. NHL Centre Ice in Canada[130] and NHL Center Ice in the United States[131] offer access to out-of-market feeds of games through a cable or satellite television provider. The league also offers NHL.tv (branded as Rogers NHL GameCentre Live in Canada), which allows the streaming of out-of-market games over the internet and is coordinated by MLB Advanced Media as of February 2016. In the United States, NHL.tv does not carry national games or in-market games.
