As traffic levels increased, bottlenecks at the two-lane tunnels on the Pennsylvania Turnpike became a major problem. By the late 1950s, traffic jams formed at the tunnels, especially during the summer.[223] In 1959, four Senators urged state officials to work with the turnpike commission to study ways to reduce the traffic jams.[224] That year, the commission began studies aimed at resolving the traffic jams at the Laurel Hill and Allegheny Mountain tunnels; studies for the other tunnels followed.[225] At the conclusion of the studies, the turnpike commission planned to make the entire turnpike four lanes by either adding a second tube at the tunnels or bypassing them.[88] The new and upgraded tunnel tubes would feature white tiles, fluorescent lighting, and upgraded ventilation.[161]
