Certain astronomical objects known as spiral nebulae such as M31 would later be recognized as conglomerations of stars when the true distance to these objects began to be discovered, and they would be deemed island universes. However, the word Universe was later understood to mean the entirety of existence, so this expression fell into disuse and the objects instead became known as galaxies.[16]
