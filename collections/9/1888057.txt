According to The Hollywood Reporter, Drew Barrymore will team up with Warner Bros. to produce—and probably direct—the book-to-big screen adaptation of "Heist Society". 'Barrymore joins Denise Di Novi and Di Novi Pictures' Alison Greenspan as producers on the project, which Warners won last year in a multi-studio bidding war for the novel by Ally Carter. Screenwriter Shauna Cross is set to adapt.[13]' However, the rights expired, and now Elizabeth Banks' studio Brownstone is set to produce, and Lionsgate are in talks to distribute the film.[14]
