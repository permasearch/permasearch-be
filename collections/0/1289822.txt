Ben Parish, now Private Zombie, has been assigned to squad 53. His squad sergeant, Sergeant Reznik, is a cruel, uncaring man who taunts his members about their personal lives, which he learned about via the Wonderland program. He takes a liking to a member of another squad. Another member is added to squad 53, Sammy Sullivan, whom Reznik calls "Private Nugget". Reznik taunts Nugget, Zombie blurts out, "Leave him alone!", and Reznik punches Zombie in his throat, but respects his spirit and appoints him as the new leader of squad 53.
