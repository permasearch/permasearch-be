East of Bedford the turnpike passes through the Bedford Narrows, a gap in Evitts Mountain. The turnpike, US 30 and the Raystown Branch of the Juniata River all pass through the 650-foot-wide (200 m) narrows.[13][16] The road winds through a valley south of the river, before traversing Clear Ridge Cut near Everett.[12][13][18] Further east, at Breezewood, I-70 leaves the turnpike.[12][13]
