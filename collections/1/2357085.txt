The lifetime of non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors is specified in terms of “hours per temperature", like "2,000h/105 °C". With this specification the lifetime at operational conditions can be estimated by special formulas or graphs specified in the data sheets of serious manufacturers. They use different ways for specification, some give special formulas,[87][88] others specify their e-caps lifetime calculation with graphs that consider the influence of applied voltage.[85][89][90][91] Basic principle for calculating the time under operational conditions is the so-called “10-degree-rule”.[92][93][94]
