The record for most appearances by a group on the Billboard HotÂ 100, previously set by The Beatles, was broken when six songs from the season's second episode, "Britney/Brittany", debuted on the chart the week of October 16, 2010, which put the Glee total at seventy-five. This feat also placed the cast third overall among all artists, behind James Brown and Elvis Presley.[90] Four songs debuted on November 18, 2010, which pushed the number of appearances to ninety-three and surpassed Brown for second place.[91] On February 16, 2011, it was announced that Glee had increased its Hot 100 appearances to 113 songs and moved past Elvis to hold the record for the most Hot 100 entries.[92] Glee ended the second season with a total of 156 Hot 100 songs.[93] The season's cover versions had a positive effect on some of the original recording artists. Following the broadcast of "Britney/Brittany", sales of the Spears songs covered increased by 35,000 units.[24] The episode "Rumours" had an even greater effect on the Fleetwood Mac album of the same name it featured: in Australia, five days after the episode aired, the Rumours album entered the Australian charts at number two, and was at number three the following week;[94][95] it received its thirteen-times Platinum certification in Australia at the end of that month.[96]
