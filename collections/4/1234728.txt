Along with the Citroën C3, the C2 successfully replaced the popular, but ageing Citroën Saxo. The two cars have relatively different designs, allowing Citroën to grab different sub markets of the supermini class. The C2 was designed by Donato Coco. The C3 was originally designed as a larger "family friendly vehicle", with its five doors, whereas the C2 was to project a "young driver" image with two doors and flatter styling. Unlike the Saxo, with 2 of 5 stars from Euro NCAP, the C2 achieved 4 out of 5 stars.
