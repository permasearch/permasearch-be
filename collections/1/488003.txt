Dr. Daniel Goodman (season 1) is the director of the Jeffersonian Institute who is an archaeologist and his expertise in religious and other artifacts sometimes came in handy during a case. He is a loving husband and the father to a pair of five-year-old twin girls. His way of working leads Hodgins to think of him as subjective, long-winded, and lacking the qualities of a pure scientist; however, the antagonism between the two develops into a friendly rivalry as the season progresses. Dr. Goodman has not made any appearances beyond Season 1; and, as of Episode 23, "The Titan on the Tracks", he is said to be on sabbatical. In an interview, Hart Hanson said that Camille Saroyan was added to the show because she proved to be a much better fit with the team instead of Goodman, indicating that Goodman may never return to the show. When introduced in the Season 1 episode "Pilot", he tells Dr Brennan that she has a disturbingly steep learning curve".
