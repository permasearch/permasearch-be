A bitter custody battle ensued between Lucas and Sami, who had a "love/hate" relationship over the years. Of the pairing, Sweeney said "their past is such a deep relationship and ultimately a friendship and a trust that they have with each other."[33] They ended up marrying,[34] but it was "permanently ended" when EJ DiMera (James Scott) entered the picture.[30] EJ, the son of longtime crime boss Stefano DiMera (Joseph Mascolo), developed an obsession with Sami, and ended up controversially "raping" her.[35][36] Sami became pregnant and gave birth to twins; her daughter's father is Lucas, and son's paternity belonged to EJ.[30] EJ had asked Sami for sex to save Lucas' life, while he was trapped and nearly died.[30] This led to a sham wedding between EJ and Sami, in exchange for the DiMeras ending the fifty-year family feud between the Brady family. Although she initially hated him, the couple ended up in a "night of passion" resulting in another pregnancy.[30] Of whether EJ or Lucas was Sami's "true love," Sweeney said "I personally think Sami and Lucas truly love each other, but obviously a lot has gone on between them that has pushed them apart. Right now, they are writing Sami more focusing on EJ."[27] She also said that she enjoyed working with Scott, and called him "enchanting."[27] Of working with Dattilo, Sweeney said "I am definitely a long-standing Lumi fan and I miss working with Bryan every day. He is so fun! I was in a scene the other day and looking around, like he and I have such a history together, for some inside joke and he wasn’t on the set. It’s just strange when I don’t get to work with him all the time."[33]
