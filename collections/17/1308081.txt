Enlargement has been one of the EU's most successful foreign policies,[10] yet has equally suffered from considerable opposition from the start.

A later French President Fran√ßois Mitterrand opposed Greek, Spanish and Portuguese membership fearing that the former dictatorships were not ready and it would reduce the union to a free-trade area.[11]
