There are a number of advantages of miniature horses as service animals. Miniature horses may be chosen by people whose religion considers dogs to be unclean or who have serious allergies to dogs, as well as phobias. Miniature horses have average lifespans of 30â€“40 years (longer than those of both service dogs and monkeys) and take 6 months to a year of training, done only by professional trainers.[15]
