There had been scattered settlers in the area from at least the mid-1880s, but the first documented permanent residents of the Pompano area were George Butler and Frank Sheen and their families, who arrived in 1896 as railway employees.[3] The first train arrived in the small Pompano settlement on February 22, 1896.[3] It is said that Sheen gave the community its name after jotting down on his survey of the area the name of the fish he had for dinner. The coming of the railroad led to development farther west from the coast. In 1906 Pompano became the southernmost settlement in newly created Palm Beach County.[3] That year, the Hillsboro Lighthouse was completed on the beach.[3]
