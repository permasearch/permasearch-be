Fresh water can be obtained from salt water by desalination. For example, Malta derives two thirds of its freshwater by desalination. A number of nuclear powered desalination plants exist;[173][174] however, the high costs of desalination, especially for poor countries, make impractical the transport of large amounts of desalinated seawater to interiors of large countries.[175] The cost of desalination varies; Israel is now desalinating water for a cost of 53 cents per cubic meter,[176] Singapore at 49 cents per cubic meter.[177] In the United States, the cost is 81 cents per cubic meter ($3.06 for 1,000 gallons).[178]
