Because the Fundamental Constitutions were drafted during John Locke's service to one of Province of Carolina proprietors, Anthony Ashley Cooper, it is widely alleged that Locke had a major role in the making of the Constitutions. In the view of historian David Armitage[5] and political scientist Vicki Hsueh, the Constitutions were co-authored by Locke and his patron Cooper, known also as 1st Earl of Shaftesbury.[6] However the document was a legal document written for and signed and sealed by the eight Lord proprietors to whom Charles II had granted the colony; Locke was only a paid secretary. He wrote it much as a lawyer writes a will.[4]
