Tunnell left Iowa in January 1948 in order to make some money to enable him to return and play football in the fall.[30]  He was told by school officials that, in order to be eligible to play football again in the fall, he would need to return for summer school and make up for a class he failed in the fall. Tunnell later explained: "I got a telegram on Sunday saying I had to be back in school on Monday and didn't have any money or nothing."[31]
