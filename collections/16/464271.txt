Burning Man began as a bonfire ritual on the summer solstice in 1986 when Larry Harvey, Jerry James and a few friends met on Baker Beach in San Francisco[10][11] and burned an 8 feet (2.4 m) tall wooden man as well as a smaller wooden dog.  Harvey has described his inspiration for burning these effigies as a spontaneous act of "radical self-expression".[12] Sculptor Mary Grauberger, a friend of Harvey's girlfriend Janet Lohr, held solstice bonfire gatherings on Baker Beach for several years prior to 1986, some of which Harvey attended.  When Grauberger stopped organizing it, Harvey "picked up the torch," and ran with it.[12] He and Jerry James built the first wooden effigy on the afternoon of June 21, 1986, cobbled together using scrap wood, to be torched later that evening. In 1987, the effigy grew to 15 feet (4.6 m) tall, and by 1988, it had grown to 30 feet (9.1 m).[13][14]
