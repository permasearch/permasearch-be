Although further persecutionary edicts followed, compelling the arrest of the Christian clergy and universal acts of sacrifice,[179] the persecutionary edicts were ultimately unsuccessful; most Christians escaped punishment, and pagans too were generally unsympathetic to the persecution. The martyrs' sufferings strengthened the resolve of their fellow Christians.[180] Constantius and Maximian did not apply the later persecutionary edicts, and left the Christians of the West unharmed.[181] Galerius rescinded the edict in 311, announcing that the persecution had failed to bring Christians back to traditional religion.[182] The temporary apostasy of some Christians, and the surrendering of scriptures, during the persecution played a major role in the subsequent Donatist controversy.[183] Within twenty-five years of the persecution's inauguration, the Christian Emperor Constantine would rule the empire alone. He would reverse the consequences of the edicts, and return all confiscated property to Christians.[184] Under Constantine's rule, Christianity would become the empire's preferred religion.[185] Diocletian was demonized by his Christian successors: Lactantius intimated that Diocletian's ascendancy heralded the apocalypse,[186] and in Serbian mythology, Diocletian is remembered as Dukljan, the adversary of God.[187]
