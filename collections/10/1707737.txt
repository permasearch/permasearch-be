Pi Beta Phi became the first Greek letter organization to have a Canadian philanthropy in 1967 when, at the dual centennial of Canada and of Pi Beta Phi, the fraternity officially adopted the Northern Libraries Project to provide support for library systems in the Yukon and Northwest Territories. The project was renamed Arrow in the Arctic in 1969.[11] Today, philanthropy funds provide English and Inuit resources for libraries in the Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut.[12][13]
