All of the snake oil known to be sold by Western entrepreneurs was illegitimate, and did not contain properties or attributes derived from any kind of snake. All known snake oil in the UK and US was essentially "spiced up" mineral oil. Businesspersons in all localities adopting Western culture have been indicted for falsely advertising the oil to have been obtained from vipers, and specifically pit vipers, or rattlesnakes in the US. Various parties contend that the properties of vipers, similarly to the use of the Chinese water snake in traditional Chinese medicine, may be used purposefully to create a legitimate and useful product.
