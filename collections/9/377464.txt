Additional decay modes are available (e.g.: p+ → μ+ + π0),[5] both directly and when catalyzed via interaction with GUT-predicted magnetic monopoles.[7] Though this process has not been observed experimentally, it is within the realm of experimental testability for future planned very large-scale detectors on the megaton scale. Such detectors include the Hyper-Kamiokande.
