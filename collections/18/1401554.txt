Autumn Nicole Daly (born 1972) was an aspiring singer from Irving, Texas.[4] Autumn was a single mother, and had a son named Justus. She was one of two African American HouseGuests this season.[5] Upon entering the house, Autumn quickly formed a close bond with Bunky and Nicole, and was the first HouseGuest to learn that Bunky was gay.[6] She initially had a friendship with Hardy, and was later hurt when he seemingly turned against her prior to her eviction.[7] Autumn often clashed with the members of the Chilltown alliance, and was the victim of various pranks from Shannon.[8] She was seen as flirtatious by her fellow HouseGuests, and Hardy felt she needed male attention.[9] Autumn often complained about life in the house, and struggled with being apart from her son.[7] Autumn was nominated in the second week, alongside Kent, and went on to be evicted on Day 19 as the HouseGuests felt she would much rather be home.[10][11] Autumn came in tenth place, and voted for Nicole to win the series.[12] Following the series, Autumn continued to pursue a singing career, though this failed.[13] She initially became engaged to her boyfriend, Tony, though the couple split up.[14] She returned home to Texas, and is still a single parent to Justus.[15]
