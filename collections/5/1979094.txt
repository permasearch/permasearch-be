It was 1975's Toys in the Attic, however, that established Aerosmith as international stars competing with the likes of Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones.[17] Originally derided as Rolling Stones knockoffs in part due to the physical resemblance between lead singers Steven Tyler and Mick Jagger,[10] Toys in the Attic showed that Aerosmith was a unique and talented band in their own right.[45] Toys in the Attic was an immediate success, starting with the single "Sweet Emotion", which became the band's first Top 40 hit.[46] This was followed by a successful re-release of "Dream On" which hit number 6, becoming their best charting single of the 1970s.[47] "Walk This Way", re-released in 1976, reached the Top 10 in early 1977.[10]
