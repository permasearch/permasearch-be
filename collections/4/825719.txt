Waddington was presented with a dilemma as both George Eastham and Peter Dobing retired not long after the club's League Cup win. Waddington responded by paying £240,000 to Chelsea for the services of Alan Hudson in early 1974.[53] This was followed by Geoff Salmons' arrival from Sheffield United for £160,000, in the same year.[54] Waddington later paid a world record fee for a goalkeeper, £325,000, to sign Peter Shilton from Leicester City.[55] The new personnel brought added impetus to Waddington's side, and Stoke were close to winning the League title in 1974–75, but an end of season slump led to a fifth-place finish, four points off the champions, Derby.[49]
