O'Rourke's death complicated Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's marketing for her last work, Poltergeist III, out of fear of appearing to be exploiting her death.[31] Tom Skerritt and Nancy Allen, O'Rourke's co-stars, were discouraged from giving interviews about the film to avoid questions about her death.[32] O'Rourke died four months before the theatrical release of Poltergeist III, which was dedicated to her memory.[33]
