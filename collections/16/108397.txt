"Best Thing I Never Had" is a song recorded by American singer Beyoncé for her fourth studio album, 4 (2011). It was released by Columbia Records on June 1, 2011, as the third single from the album. "Best Thing I Never Had" was composed by Patrick "J. Que" Smith, Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds, Symbolyc One, Caleb McCambpell, Antonio Dixon, Beyoncé, and Shea Taylor. The song was originally not written as a ballad, but was inspired by the drumming on Doug E. Fresh's 1985 single "The Show". Beyoncé said that both men and women should be able to relate to the song.
