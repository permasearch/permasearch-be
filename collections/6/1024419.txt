Schwartz insisted that the relationship between Marissa and Alex was not a ratings stunt, and that Marissa developed real feelings for Alex.[7] Sarah Warn of AfterEllen.com said that despite Schwartz's statements, "Marissa's predominantly heterosexual past, the huge fan support for the Marissa and Ryan (Benjamin McKenzie) pairing, and the controversy The O.C. would court by making one of its principal characters bisexual, it's likely that her 'real feelings' for Alex will only last a few episodes."[7] Within the series, Marissa refers casually to Alex as her ex-girlfriend.
