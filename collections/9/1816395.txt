Palliative care is not reserved for people in end-of-life care and can improve quality of life, decrease depressive symptoms, and increase survival time.[5] If palliative care is indicated for a person in an emergency department, then that care should begin in the emergency department immediately and with referral to additional palliative care services.[8] Emergency care physicians often are the first medical professionals to open the discussion about palliative care and hospice services with people needing care and their families.[8][9]
