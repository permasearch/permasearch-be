In 1990 Art Schneiderman participated in an unrelated research study led by Robert S. Kaplan in conjunction with US management consultancy Nolan-Norton,[10] and during this study described his work on performance measurement.[5]  Subsequently, Kaplan and David P. Norton included anonymous details of this balanced scorecard design in a 1992 article.[6] Kaplan and Norton's article wasn't the only paper on the topic published in early 1992[11] but the 1992 Kaplan and Norton paper was a popular success, and was quickly followed by a second in 1993.[12] In 1996, the two authors published a book The Balanced Scorecard.[13]  These articles and the first book spread knowledge of the concept of balanced scorecard widely, and has led to Kaplan and Norton being seen as the creators of the concept.
