Minas Tirith was besieged by troops of Mordor, the Easterlings and the Haradrim, and the land fell under the darkness generated by Mordor. Significant damage was done to the first circle of the city but the Enemy was unable to break through the wallâ€”except in one place. The gate of the city was broken by a combination of the battering ram Grond and the Witch-king's sorcery; but Gandalf halted the Witch-king at the entrance.
