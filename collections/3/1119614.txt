The Indigenous peoples of the Philippines consist of a large number of Austronesian ethnic groups, as well as Negritos. They are the bearers of the majority of intangible cultural heritage elements deemed as significant to the Filipino psyche. They are the descendants of the original Austronesian inhabitants of the Philippines, that settled in the islands thousands of years ago, and in the process have retained their Indigenous customs and traditions.[35]
