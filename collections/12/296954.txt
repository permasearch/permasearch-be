Trenet had composed "La Mer" (which means "the Sea") with French lyrics completely different and unrelated to the English-language version that Lawrence later wrote. Trenet's French version was a homage and ode to the changing moods of the sea, while Lawrence, by just adding one word "Beyond" to the title, gave him the start whereby he made the song into a love song.[1]
