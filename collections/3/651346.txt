While teaching at Penn State, Barth embarked on a cycle of 100 stories he called Dorchester Tales; he abandoned it halfway through to begin his first two published novels.  He completed both The Floating Opera and The End of the Road in 1955.[1]  After a string of publisher rejections, Appleton-Century-Crofts agreed to published The Floating Opera in 1956,[2] but stipulated it "conclude on a less 'nihilist' note"; Barth complied and altered the ending.[3]  Sales were not strong enough to encourage the publisher to pick up Barth's next offering, which was felt to be too similar to the first book. The End of the Road was published by Doubleday in 1958; it received only marginally more attention than The Floating Opera.[2]  Barth made a number of changes to the text for a revised edition from Anchor Books in 1967, including restoration of the original ending.[3]  Anchor collected Barth's first two novels in a single-volume edition in 1988.[4]
