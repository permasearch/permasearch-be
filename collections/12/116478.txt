The accompanying spoken blessing, "live long and prosper" – "dif-tor heh smusma" in the Vulcan language (as spoken in Star Trek: The Motion Picture) – also appeared for the first time in "Amok Time", scripted by Theodore Sturgeon.[8] The less-well-known reply is "peace and long life", though it is sometimes said first, with "live long and prosper" as the reply. In science fiction, the phrase 'live long' first appeared in print in 1957 in Eric Frank Russell's science fiction novel Wasp where it was used both as a greeting and as a farewell by a species of aliens called the Sirians.[citation needed] The phrase has been seen abbreviated "LLAP".[9][10][11]
