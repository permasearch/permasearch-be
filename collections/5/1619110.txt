The players all basically say Tracey pissed everyone off, and it's now "World War III". Liz told Tracey it was important for her to stay with Danny, and she was "backed into a corner". Liz tells them she's going to back-stab Tracey this week – she will be so nice to her this week and cook, etc., but that she will then send her home. Workouts start next as teams and Bob says the whole situation can be really stressful. Jillian says after all the drama she just wants to deliver a good beating. Amanda begins by stopping the treadmill while working with Jillian and says she's going to puke. Then she whines about Bob and ends up puking. Jillian actually checks to make sure she was not faking. Liz says she's killing herself this week to make sure she can send Tracey home. Then Liz faints while on a treadmill. After the commercial, they show medical staff treating Liz. Bob tells her she needs to have her head on straight and she says it is – that she's going to win immunity so she can send Tracey home.
