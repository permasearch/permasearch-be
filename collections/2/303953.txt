The ancient Han Chinese imperial title, tianzi (天子), "Son of Heaven", was later adopted by the Emperor of Japan during that country's Asuka period.[3] Japan sent diplomatic missions to China, then ruled by the Sui dynasty, and formed cultural and commercial ties with China.[4] Japan's Yamato state modeled its government after the Chinese Confucian imperial bureaucracy. A Japanese mission of 607 CE delivered a message from "the Son of Heaven in the land where the sun rises ... to the Son of Heaven in the land where the sun sets."[3] But the Japanese emperor's title was less contingent than that of his Chinese counterpart; there was no divine mandate that would punish Japan's emperor for failing to rule justly. The right to rule of the Japanese emperor, descended from the sun goddess Amaterasu, was absolute.[5]
