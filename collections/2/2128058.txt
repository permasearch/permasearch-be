After releasing a few more singles, McGear retired from the music business in the 1980s. Having proven himself artistically he reverted to using his family name and has since carved out a career as a professional photographer and author. Gorman remained in the public eye through his regular appearances on such children's television programmes as Tiswas throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s. He continued to perform and record and later moved into theatrical direction and production. McGough meanwhile released his spoken-word solo album Summer With Monika (based upon his celebrated poetry collection of the same name) in 1978. Since then he has arguably maintained the highest-profile and most sustained post-Scaffold career, still appearing regularly as a vocal performer on British radio and television, and he continues to be a highly-regarded poet and author.
