After Rex's death, George attempts to move his relationship with Bree forward. While on vacation with her, George drugs her by talking her into mixing antihistamines with alcohol. George decides against taking advantage of Bree in this way but when she wakes up, he tells her he will not wait much longer, thereby finally getting Bree into bed. George proposes to her. She feels pressured into agreeing. After Bree tells George about her chat with Dr. Goldfine in which he suggested she and George were taking their relationship too fast, George attacks Dr. Goldfine and throws him over a bridge. Goldfine is injured but survives. Later, George becomes more possessive. He objects to Bree's reluctance to wear her engagement ring; Bree, in turn, becomes annoyed when she sees her engagement to George announced in the newspaper. This announcement brings George's ex-fiancÃ©e to Bree's house, where she warns Bree that George is unstable. Bree dismisses her, refusing to believe. Later, while Bree and George are out having dinner, they meet Bree's old college boyfriend, Ty Grant. He asks Bree to dance and she agrees. George's overreaction to this leads Bree to end her relationship with George. In retaliation, George steals Ty's valet ticket from his jacket, speeds off in his car, takes it out to some remote location, and sets it on fire.[citation needed]
