The bloodbath on the ship leaves only two survivors: Arkosh Kovash, a Hungarian mobster hospitalized with severe burns; and Roger "Verbal" Kint, a con artist with cerebral palsy. Customs agent Dave Kujan flies from New York City to interrogate Verbal. In flashback the events that led Keaton, Michael McManus, Fred Fenster, Todd Hockney and Verbal onto the ship are described.
