Depending on the nature of the solute the solubility may increase or decrease with temperature. For many solids dissolved in liquid water, the solubility increases with temperature up to 100 °C.[7] In liquid water at high temperatures, (e.g., that approaching the critical temperature), the solubility of ionic solutes tends to decrease due to the change of properties and structure of liquid water; the lower dielectric constant results in a less polar solvent.
