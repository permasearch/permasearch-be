Whether one is a permanent resident or not is determined by the provisions of the IRPA. Under section 31(2)(a) of the IRPA, a person with a valid permanent card is presumed to be a permanent resident unless the IRCC officer determines that he or she is no longer a permanent resident.[12][13] Similarly, under section 31(2)(b) of the IRPA, a person who is outside Canada without a valid PR card is presumed not to be a permanent resident unless proven otherwise.[13]
