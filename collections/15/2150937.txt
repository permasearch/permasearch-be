The Ducks struck first after a 13-play, 75-yard drive that culminated with a two-yard Royce Freeman touchdown run.[5] The Spartans answered immediately, as Josiah Price caught a 12-yard pass from Connor Cook, following a 62-yard run from Madre London, to tie the game at 7 apiece. The offenses cooled off after what was looking like the beginning of a shootout. Both offenses traded punts, with Oregon's punter Ian Wheeler giving Michigan State great field position after a shanked 25–yard punt. However, Michigan State were unable to capitalize off of this blunder as Michael Geiger missed a 28-yard field goal. Despite that, Ducks QB Vernon Adams threw an interception two plays later to Montae Nicholson. Six plays later, Connor Cook found Aaron Burbridge over the middle, with Burbridge breaking several tackles on his way to the end zone for a 17-yard catch and run touchdown. Michigan State held a 14–7 lead early in the second quarter. On the ensuing Duck possession, Oregon drove to the Spartan one-yard line before the Michigan State defense made a goal-line stand on both third and fourth down, causing the Ducks to turn the ball over on downs. Neither team scored the remainder of the half, with Vernon Adams and Connor Cook both throwing interceptions. Michigan State took a 14–7 lead into halftime.
