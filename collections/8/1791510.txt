All thunderstorms, regardless of type, go through three stages: a 'developing stage', a 'mature stage', and a 'dissipating stage'.[6] The average thunderstorm has a 24 km (15 mi) diameter.[7] Depending on the conditions present in the atmosphere, these three stages take an average of 30 minutes to go through.[8]
