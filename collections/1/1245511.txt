If a nonminor dependent is placed out-of-state, the sending and receiving agencies must undergo a ten-step process in accordance with the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children.[9] Even if a nonminor dependent is living in an out-of-state SILP placement, case managers are required to have monthly face-to-face visits with each youth.[7] In addition, case managers are required to visit youth who are placed in another county within California, and cases are not transferred from one county to another.
