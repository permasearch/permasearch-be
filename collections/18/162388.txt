A different divining method, using the stalks of the yarrow plant, was practiced in the subsequent Zhou dynasty (1046â€“256 BC). Around the late 9th century BC, the divination system was recorded in the I Ching, or "Book of Changes", a collection of linear signs used as oracles. In addition to its oracular power, the I Ching has had a major influence on the philosophy, literature and statecraft of China since the Zhou period.
