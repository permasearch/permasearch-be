At the dawn of the 18th century, Protestants remained in significant numbers in the remote CÃ©vennes region of the Massif Central. This population, known as the Camisards, revolted against the government in 1702, leading to fighting that continued intermittently until 1715, after which the Camisards were largely left in peace.
