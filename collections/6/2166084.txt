SMC has long been involved in commercial basketball in the Philippines beginning with the Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association (MICAA) founded in 1938, where SMC organized its first basketball team, playing under the name San Miguel Brewery. After the company changed its name to San Miguel Corporation, the team’s name was changed to San Miguel Corporation Braves (or the San Miguel Braves). SMC remained with the MICAA until the league’s dissolution in 1982.
