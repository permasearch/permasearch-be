In 1994 the AFL announced that South Australia would receive a licence for a second team based in the state.[6] The major bids competing with Port Adelaide this time around were from merger club proposals in Norwood-Sturt, and Glenelg-South. On 15 June the SANFL handed down a report recommending the second license go to a team formed from the amalgamation of two clubs.[3]
