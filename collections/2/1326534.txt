In 1971, when the team moved to Foxborough and renamed from the "Boston Patriots" to the "New England Patriots", Jim Plunkett took over as quarterback.[5] Plunkett started every regular season game for four straight seasons,[6] until he was replaced by Steve Grogan as the starting quarterback in the 1975 season.[7] Grogan was the only starting quarterback for six straight seasons, until Matt Cavanaugh started for four of the sixteen games in 1980.[8] Grogan continued to start for the Patriots for parts of seasons until his retirement in 1990.[9] Grogan finished his career with 135 games as starting quarterback, the second-most of any Patriots starting quarterback ever.[9]
