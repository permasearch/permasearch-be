Averroes upholds the doctrine of divine unity (tawhid) and argues—in agreement with contemporary theologians—that God has seven divine attributes: knowledge, life, power, will, hearing, vision and speech. He devotes the most attention to the attribute of knowledge and argues that divine knowledge differs from human knowledge because God knows the universe because God is its cause while humans only know the universe through its effects.[46]
