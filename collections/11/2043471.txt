Mission-specific training has been part of a Canadian soldier's preparation for service on peacekeeping and stability operations since the 1960s. This plays a huge part in the war in Afghanistan. In preparations, "soldiers needed to know as much as possible about local customs, culture, and politics, and about the nature and motivation of groups that might oppose the establishment of peace and order."[13] This accompanied with psychological triaging with a soldiers family made, this deployment of Canadian forces the most ever prepared overseas. In training for the mission the goal in Afghanistan was clear: “The Afghan mission would only succeed when the Government of Afghanistan could provide for the needs of its people.”[13] It was this notion that shaped the Canadian and NATO approach toward reconstructing the Afghan society.
