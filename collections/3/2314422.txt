Of the album's remaining songs, Metal Hammer states that "Moonchild" is loosely based on the Aleister Crowley novel of the same name, while "Infinite Dreams" is about a character who "implores a spiritualist to unlock the meaning behind his tortured dreams",[16] although Sputnikmusic state that the song also explores "themes of reality, life after death, and the meaning of life".[17] The final track, "Only The Good Die Young", closes the storyline[17] and was later featured in an episode of the 1980s' TV series, Miami Vice.[18] The record opens and closes with an identical brief acoustic piece accompanied by two verses of lyrics,[8] written by Dickinson,[12] which, according to Sputnikmusic, "foreshadows doom and failure for the protagonist" and "wraps up the album".[17]
