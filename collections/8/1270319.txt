In September 1955, for six weeks, Mitch Miller had a Billboard number one hit with "The Yellow Rose of Texas",[9] and 13 months later, Miller's hit version was used for a key scene in the 1956 Texas-based film Giant. Miller's lyrics used "rosebud" and no words - except the term "yellow" - to indicate either Rose or the singer was a person of color.[10] The 1955 song became a gold record. The song achieved the #2 position in the UK and the #1 position in Australia.
