Other mixed reviews came from James Poniewozik of TIME,[47] Robert Bianco of USA Today[48] and Margaret Lyons of Vulture.[49] However, Sean Fitz-Gerald, who reviewed the season as a whole for Vulture, wrote in sum: "Bloodline was a gripping, slow burn of a journey, so stressful, engaging, and uncomfortable ... KZK did a fantastic job crafting something real enough to find introspective truth in."[50]
