The next year, Angel invited bands to submit demos for the theme music to the show. They asked bands to use "dark superhero ideas" and "Cello-rock."[3] Darling Violetta watched pivotal Angel-related episodes of Buffy like "Passion" and "Becoming, Part One" & "Becoming, Part Two" for inspiration along with cowriter and music producer, Holly Knight. Eventually Joss Whedon accepted Holly Knight/Darling Violetta's interpretation of an Angel theme as that most suitable for the show.
