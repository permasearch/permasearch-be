The set design for the entrance stage was at the north end of the stadium and consisted of another steel structure with various video screens hanging from it.[14][15] The steel beams for the structure were custom built in Belgium and shipped over to Orlando.[14] According to WWE Magazine, the amount of pyrotechnics used would be ten times that of the amount used on Raw.[13] Without the restriction of a roof, the pyrotechnics for the show shot as high as 2,000 feet (610 m) as compared to WrestleMania 23's height of 150 feet (46 m).[16] The fireworks were set off from boats on one of the lakes nearby the stadium. WWE has been said to have spent an estimated $300,000 on the fireworks alone.[17]
