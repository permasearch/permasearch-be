According to legend, the Caliph had his tent surrounded with a bodyguard of slave-warriors who were chained together as a defense.[citation needed] The Navarrese force led by their king Sancho VII broke through this bodyguard. The Caliph escaped, but the Moors were routed, leaving heavy casualties on the battlefield.[8] The victorious Christians seized several prizes of war: MiramamolÃ­n's tent and standard were delivered to Pope Innocent III.[9]
