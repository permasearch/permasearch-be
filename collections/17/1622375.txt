Tyrone won their first Ulster Championship in 1956, defending it successfully in 1957. They did not win a third Ulster title until 1973. The Tyrone Minors, however, won the All-Ireland in 1947, 1948 and 1973. 1973 is remembered because Frank McGuigan, who captained the minor team, was also part of the Under-21 and Senior teams that won their Ulster Championships.
