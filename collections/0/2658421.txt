This is occasionally present (occurring in up to 20% of people), but may also occur in other acute lung conditions, and, therefore, has limited diagnostic value. The most commonly seen signs in the ECG are sinus tachycardia, right axis deviation, and right bundle branch block.[58] Sinus tachycardia, however, is still only found in 8â€“69% of people with PE.[59]
