In February 1995, the album was reissued as a remixed CD which included more songs than the original vinyl edition, as well as song introductions and other banter that had been edited out of the original release. For the remix, new vocal overdubs from Daltrey, Townshend and Entwistle were recorded to address occasional flaws in the original tapes or performances. The additional songs were inserted before and in the middle of the original track list, but left "My Generation" and "Magic Bus" as the final two tracks.
