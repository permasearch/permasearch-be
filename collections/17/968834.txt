Although it was a huge American hit, the group did not think highly of the song (Lennon called it "lousy"[20]) and they never performed it live or at any of their radio sessions for the BBC. The only mime performance was for UK television on the 3 April 1965 edition of the ITV series Thank Your Lucky Stars. No film or videotape of this episode is available and it is considered lost.
