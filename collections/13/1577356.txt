Jackson was born in Pickens County, South Carolina, the oldest son in the family. His father George was a sharecropper; he moved the family to Pelzer, South Carolina, while Jackson was still a baby.[3] A few years afterwards the family moved to a company town called Brandon Mill, on the outskirts of Greenville, South Carolina.[4]  An attack of measles almost killed him when he was 10. He was in bed for two months, paralyzed while he was nursed back to health by his mother.[5]
