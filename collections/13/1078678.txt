The Grinch has since become an icon of Christmas and the winter holidays, despite the character's hatred of the season. Over the years he has appeared on various forms of memorabilia such as Christmas ornaments, plush dolls, and various clothing items.[9] The grumpy, anti-holiday spirit of the character has led to the term "Grinch"[11][12] coming to refer to a person opposed to Christmas time celebrations[13][14][15] or to someone with a coarse, greedy attitude.[12] In 2002, TV Guide ranked The Grinch number 5 on its "50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time" list.[11]
