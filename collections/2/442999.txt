The clearest example of the use of Scandinavia is Finland, based largely on the fact that most of modern-day Finland was part of the Swedish kingdom for hundreds of years, thus to much of the world associating Finland with all of Scandinavia. However, the creation of a Finnish identity is unique in the region in that it was formed in relation to two different imperial models, the Swedish[14] and the Russian,[15][16] as described by the University of Jyv채skyl채 based editorial board of the Finnish journal Yearbook of Political Thought and Conceptual History.[17][18]
