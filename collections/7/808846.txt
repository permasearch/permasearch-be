The Ranganathaswamy Temple, dedicated to the Hindu god Vishnu, is located on the island of Srirangam.[86] Often cited as the largest functioning Hindu temple in the world,[86] it has a perimeter of 4,116 metres (13,504 ft) and occupies 156 acres (630,000 m2).[242] Considered to be among the 108 Divya Desams (Holy shrines of Lord Vishnu),[243] the temple is believed to house the mortal remains of the Vaishnavite saint and philosopher Ramanujacharya.[244] Originally built by the Cholas,[245] the temple was later renovated by the Pandyas, the Hoysalas, the Madurai Nayaks and the Vijayanagar empire between the 9th and 16th centuries AD.[246] There are 21 gopurams (towers),[247] of which the Rajagopuram is 236 feet (72 m).[248] According to the Limca Book of Records, it was the tallest temple tower in the world until 1999.[249]
