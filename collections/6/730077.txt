An early Germanic people known as the Bastarnae were identified by Roman authors and were allegedly the first to reach the Graeco-Roman world, living in the area north of the Danube's mouth in the Black Sea. They resided primarily in the territory east of the Carpathian Mountains between the Dniester River valley and the delta of the Danube in what is now the Ukraine, Moldova and Romania and are considered the easternmost of the Germanic tribes.[58] The Bastarnae are mentioned in historical sources going back as far as the 3rd century BC all the way through the 4th century AD.[59] In 201–202 BC, the Macedonians under the leadership of King Philip V, conscripted the Bastarnae as soldiers to fight against the Romans in the Second Macedonian War.[58] They remained a presence in that area until late in the Roman empire while some settled on Peuce Island at the mouth of the Danube on the Black Sea which is why the name Peucini is also associated with the Bastarnae.[58] King Perseus enlisted the service of the Bastarnae in 171–168 BC to fight the Third Macedonian War. By 29 BC, they were subdued by the Romans and those that remained began merging with various tribes of Goths into the second century AD.[58]
