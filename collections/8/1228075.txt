As the battle at Cumberland Gap wore on, Morgan refused to retreat or surrender his position.[20] Thinking an invasion of Kentucky was preferable to a long siege on the Gap, Smith left a detachment to handle Morgan and proceeded toward Lexington, abandoning the plan to join Bragg and capture Nashville.[20] The move forced Bragg's hand, and he too entered Kentucky on August 28.[52] As Smith progressed toward Lexington, Indiana governor Oliver P. Morton decided that Governor Robinson was doing too little to support the Union cause.[20] He dispatched regiments across the Ohio into Louisville, and considered himself governor of both Indiana and Kentucky.[20]
