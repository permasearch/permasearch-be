There are many notable footballers from the Northeast of England. Sunderland's Alf Common became the world's first Â£1,000 player when he was signed by Middlesbrough in 1905.[98] Other pre Second World War and immediate post war greats were Charles Buchan, who created and edited the iconic magazine "Football Monthly",[99] George Camsell, Hughie Gallacher, Wilf Mannion, Raich Carter, Bob Gurney all of whom are described in a famous book by the "Clown Prince of Football" Len Shackleton. Mr Shackleton's book shot to immediate fame and caused a storm when first published because chapter 9, named "The Average Director's Knowledge of Football", was produced as a blank page.[100] Local Heroes after the Second World War included Joe Harvey, Jackie Milburn,[101] Brian Clough[102] and Newcastle's Bobby Moncur who led his team to win the Inter City Fairs Cup in 1969.[103]
