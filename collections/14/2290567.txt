Some of the best places to see them in the United Kingdom are Gigrin Farm near Rhayader, mid Wales, where hundreds are fed by the local farmer as a tourist attraction,[48] a Red Kite Feeding Station at Llanddeusant in the Brecon Beacons, visited daily by over 50 birds,[49] and the Nant-Yr-Arian forest recreation centre in Ceredigion[50] where the rare leucistic variant can be seen.[51] In the UK, the Oxfordshire part of the Chilterns has many red kites, especially near Henley-on-Thames and Watlington, where they were introduced on John Paul Getty's estate.[24] They can also be seen around Harewood near Leeds where they were re-introduced in 1999.[52] In Ireland they can be best observed at Redcross, near Avoca, County Wicklow.
