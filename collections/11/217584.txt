Crosby was reluctant to have her poems published, as she considered them to be "unfinished productions", but she acquiesced eventually because it would publicize the Institution and raise funds for it.[82] (She had suffered an illness that caused her to leave the NYIB in order to recuperate.) Her first book A Blind Girl and Other Poems was published in April 1844 after encouragement by the Institution, including â€œAn Evening Hymn" based on Psalm 4:8, which she described as her first published hymn.[83] In 1853, her Monterey and Other Poems was published which included poems focusing on the recent Mexican-American War,[84] and a poem pleading for the US to help those affected by the Irish Potato Famine.[85] She stated in her 1903 autobiography, edited by Will Carleton, that she "was under a feeling of sadness and depression at this time".[84]
