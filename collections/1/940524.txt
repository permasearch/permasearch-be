Ice ages during the Pleistocene brought a cooler and wetter pluvial climate to the region starting 2 to 3 million years ago.[64] The added precipitation increased runoff and the erosive ability of streams (especially from spring melt water and flash floods in summer).[note 3] With a greatly increased flow volume the Colorado cut faster than ever before and started to quickly excavate the Grand Canyon 2 million years before present, almost reaching the modern depth by 1.2 million years ago.[65]
