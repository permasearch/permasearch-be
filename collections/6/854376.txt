The Sign of the Beaver tells the story of a 13-year-old boy, Matt James Hallowell, and his father, who, as early settlers, together build a log cabin in the wilderness of 18th-century Maine in North America. Matt is left alone to guard the cabin and his family's claim to the land while his father heads back to Quincy, Massachusetts to pick up his mother, sister and their new baby and bring them back to the cabin. Matt learns how to survive and deal with difficult situations without the guidance of his father. Still alone, Matt gets the help from a Native American named Attean. Attean and his family help Matt survive until his father comes back. But when his family seemed to disappear and don't return, Attean asked Matt to join the Beaver tribe and move north, is Matt really going to abandon his family in order to join the Beavers?
