One of the first theories of love was developed by Sigmund Freud. As Freud so frequently attributed human nature to unconscious desires, his theory of love centered around the need for an "ego ideal".[5] His definition of an ego ideal is this: the image of the person that one wants to become, which is patterned after those whom one holds with great respect.
