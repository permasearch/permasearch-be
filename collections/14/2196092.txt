In tandem with party building, de los Reyes also set about organizing a wokers' movement in the Philippines. In 1902, Hermenegildo Cruz and other members of the Carmelo and Bauermann publishing house approached de los Reyes to seek advice in forming a cooperative store for rice and other staples.[6]:15 The Union Democratica de Litografos, Impresores, Encuadernadores y Otros Obreros was thus formed on February 2, 1902, which came to be known as the Union Obrera Democratica. De los Reyes was its first president.[1]:278
