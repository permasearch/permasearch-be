The building was pictured on the front and rear cover of the 1981 album This Is the Ice Age by Canadian New Wave band Martha And The Muffins & also their 7" single Women Around The World At Work . The album featured two photos which were taken from the same place but at different times by Muffins guitarist Mark Gane using a time lapse camera and features the building at midday & dusk. The 7" cover again features the same photo but has 9 small images taken at various times of the day & night.
