The farm of George Gay was purchased for the school and construction began in 1928.[17] The school was the first residential school east of Quebec. It was to be staffed by the Roman Catholic Order Sisters of Charity. The goal at first was to provide education for orphans or neglected children on Maritime reserves. However, just before it opened, Duncan Campbell Scott of Canada's Department of Indian and Northern Affairs, expanded its mandate to be an option to the small day schools which already existed on reserves. The school opened for staff and administrators in May 1929 and in its expanded role was intended to educate 150 students.[18] The first children arrived on February 5, 1930.[19]
