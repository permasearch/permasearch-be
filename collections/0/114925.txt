Exasperated with his boss's demands and annoyed by SpongeBob's eagerness, Squidward tries to scare SpongeBob into being afraid of the night shift by telling him a made-up story about the "Hash-Slinging Slasher", a former fry cook at the Krusty Krab who accidentally cut off his own arm and was run over by a bus during the night shift, causing his death. Squidward continues by telling SpongeBob that every Tuesday night (the night it happens to be) the ghost of the Slasher returns to the Krusty Krab. Squidward says that the Slasher's arrival will be indicated by three warnings: the lights flickering on and off, the phone ringing but nobody being on the other line, and the ghost of the bus that killed the Slasher arriving to deliver him.
