The Catholic defense mentions textual evidence of external acts of honor towards icons, arguing that there are "different kinds of worship" and that the honor shown to icons differs entirely from the adoration of God. Citing the Old Testament, these arguments present examples of forms of "honor" such as in Genesis 33:3, with the argument that "adoration is one thing, and that which is offered in order to honor something of great excellence is another". These arguments assert, "the honor given to the image is transferred to its prototype", and that venerating an image of Christ does not terminate at the image itself – the material of the image is not the object of worship – rather it goes beyond the image, to the prototype.[60][59][61]
