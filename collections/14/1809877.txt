In Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives, a more stable Tommy (played by Thom Mathews), with a friend from the institution, is ready to confront his demons - or rather the demon that is Jason.  Wanting to see Jason's decayed body himself, he also wants to make sure that Jason will never rise again and attempts to cremate him.  But his memories of his encounter with Jason still linger heavily and he madly attacks the body with a metal fence pole when the coffin is opened.  Before Tommy can cremate Jason, the pole winds up attracting bolts of lightning that reawaken Jason and gives him a more powerful lease on life; he is now immortal even to being shot at point-blank range with a shotgun, although he still feels the impact of the bullets, and possesses supernaturally powerful strength upon his victims. Trying to make amends for his mistake, Tommy warns the sheriff who, being familiar with Jarvis, locks him up thinking he's had another mental breakdown. The piles of bodies Jason racks up only convinces the sheriff that the killer is Tommy. Time is running short as Jason makes his way to the renamed campgrounds. With a plan in mind, and aided by the sheriff's daughter Megan, Tommy lures Jason into the very same lake from which the Voorhees legend started.  Chained to the bottom of the lake by a large stone, encircled in fire, and having part of his face chewed by the boat's propeller blades.[5] Although almost nearly dying from Jason's attacks during the struggle, Megan rescues him from the waters and revives him with CPR much to her and the camp's children's joy; as he embraces, he finally exclaims "It's over, it's finally over... Jason's home." as the two stare off at the lake where Jason remains trapped.
