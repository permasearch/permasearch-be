Steve has also been shown to occasionally struggle with both substance abuse and an addiction to power. In An Apocalypse to Remember, Steve claims to be hooked on "hallucinogenic berries", which ultimately turn out to be poisonous.[27] In a later episode, Steve develops an addiction to the energy drink Cougar Boost, at one point going as far as to defraud his friends with fake tickets in order to obtain money to procure more of the beverage.[28] In the episode Virtual In-Stanity, Francine derides Stan for picking up a drug bunny as a last minute gift, in the process reminding Stan that they just barely got Steve off the heroin from Stan's previous last second gift.[29] In both the pilot episode and You Debt Your Life, Steve demonstrates an addiction to power; in the former case by taking over the school after being turned down by a girl he was trying to impress,[30] in the latter case due to his obsession with making the morning announcements and deciding what is worth broadcasting to the high school.[31] Furthermore, as shown in the episode Jenny Fromdabloc, it is revealed that among his four friends Steve is considered to be the leader of the group going as far back as elementary school, prompting Roger to call Steve the "King of the Nerds".[32] In most cases when his role as the leader of the group is threatened Steve's drive to maintain this position of power results in erratic behavior such as humiliating his friends with personal or compromising information[32] or threats of physical violence against himself or others.[30] In nearly every case outside of his immediate circle of friends, Steve's position of power or authority ends up stripped or removed from him,[31] or in rare cases, remains with him in a curtailed capacity, as was the case in I am the Walrus.[33]
