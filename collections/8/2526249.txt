The Popular Front, an alliance of Socialists and Radicals with support outside the government of the Communists, was led by LÃ©on Blum. The Popular Front introduced many measures such as the 40-hour working week and holidays with pay, but Blum felt handicapped in introducing more than limited changes to the economy because of his dependence on the more right-wing Radicals. This did little to placate a population anxious for change and a wave of strikes broke involving two million workers [12] Factories were occupied and membership of the Communist party rose to 300,000 in 1937.
