Comb shape varies considerably depending on the breed or species of bird. The "comb" most often refers to chickens in which the most common shape is the "single comb" of a rooster from breeds such as the Leghorn. Other common comb types are the "rose comb" (e.g. the Rosecomb) or "pea comb" (e.g. the Brahma or the Araucana). Other distinctive shapes have been selectively bred for, such as the "buttercup comb" of the Sicilian Buttercup, "V combs" (popularly called "devil horn") in the Houdan and other breeds, the "cushion comb" of the Chantecler, and "walnut comb" of Malay game.[3]
