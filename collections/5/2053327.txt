Katherine Barner of Complex praised the song, writing: "The two voices are a true match made in dance music heaven and blend beautifully together during the second chorus." She found it "a great candidate for any playlist of summer anthems".[20] In a lukewarm review, Sasha Geffen of Pitchfork regarded the song as "a subtle, low-key affair" rather than "the kind of pop banger that gets blasted at every single Pride party for the rest of the month". She praised the two artists' voices, but noted that the track "doesn't push them to the heights they've achieved separately". She was displeased that Grande mostly serves as a background vocalist, faulting the track for its failure to "justify Grande's sidelining".[22]
