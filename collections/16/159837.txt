The production opened on May 3, 2000 at the London Palladium, directed by Renshaw and choreographed by Lubovitch, and using the Kirk and Thomson designs.[128] It reportedly took in £8 million in advance ticket sales.[129] The cast included Elaine Paige as Anna and Jason Scott Lee as the King, with Sean Ghazi as Luan Tha and Ho Yi as the Kralahome.[130] Lady Thiang was, again, played by Taewon Yi Kim, of whom The Observer wrote, "Her 'Something Wonderful' was just that."[128] The show was nominated for an Olivier Award for outstanding musical.[131] Later in the run, Lee was replaced as the King by Paul Nakauchi.[132] The revival was generally well received. The Daily Mirror said: "The King and I waltzed back to the West End in triumph last night."[133] The Daily Express noted, "Love it or loathe it, The King and I is an unstoppable smash."[133] Variety, however, noted a lack of chemistry between the leads, commenting that "there’s something not entirely right in Siam when the greatest applause is reserved for Lady Thiang".[134] Replacements included Josie Lawrence as Anna, Keo Woolford as the King[135] and Saeed Jaffrey as the Kralahome. The show closed on January 5, 2002.[133]
