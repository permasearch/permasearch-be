The tradition of leaving notes for God in the Western Wall has also been adopted by Christian pilgrims and people of other faiths.[8] Foreign dignitaries who have publicly placed a message in the Western Wall include Pope John Paul II (in 2000),[12] Pope Benedict XVI (in 2008)[13] and Pope Benedict XVI, again in 2009, who released its contents to the media.[14]
