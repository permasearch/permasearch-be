The Shibutanis moved up to the intermediate level and embarked on several visits to Colorado Springs, Colorado, to work with choreographer Tom Dickson. During that season, they were also coached by Judy Blumberg on the east coast. After unexpectedly strong results in their first year competing at the intermediate level at the Lake Placid Ice Dance Competition (including first place in every compulsory and free dance segment of the competition that they entered at the Lake Placid Ice Dance Competition in the summer of 2005), the Shibutanis decided to relocate to Colorado Springs on a full-time basis in order to benefit from the strong training center environment of the Broadmoor Skating Club. In Colorado Springs, their primary coach was Patti Gottwein[6][11] During that time, they also worked with Rich Griffin, Damon Allen, Eric Schulz, and Christopher Dean.
