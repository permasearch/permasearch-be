"Bloodletting" was written by Glen Mazzara and directed by Ernest Dickerson.[2][3] In June 2011, it was announced that Scott Wilson, Lauren Cohan, and Pruitt Taylor Vince would appear on the second season as recurring characters.[4][5] In an interview with TV Guide, Gale Anne Hurd explained that Wilson's character, Hershel Greene, served as a patriarchal figure for the group. She continued: "He's a veterinarian with a great sense of humanity and a very unique take on the [walkers]." According to Hurd, Scott Wilson was cast because of his "tremendous scope and gravitas".[4] Hurd also stated that Cohan's character, Greene's daughter Maggie, was a woman in her twenties who eventually becomes a romantic interest for Glenn (Steven Yeun).[4] Further, Cohan added in an interview with the Philadelphia Daily News that Maggie was a Christian from a sheltered background. In preparation for her role, she spent a few months in Los Angeles, California to work with a dialect coach.[6] Emily Kinney also joined the cast as Hershel's younger daughter and Maggie's half-sister, Beth.
