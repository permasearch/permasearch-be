Associated with the Order of the Netherlands Lion was the grade known as the Brother, originally intended as an award to those of a lower social class, who performed useful acts, self-sacrifice or other acts of kindness towards fellow human beings. The award came with an annual payment of 200 guilders, of which half would be paid to the widow(er) at the death of the award holder. The first female Brother, midwife Johanna Goozen, was admitted in 1921.
