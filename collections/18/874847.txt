Fire ants have been known to form mutualistic relationships with several species of Lycaenidae and Riodinidae butterflies.[10][11] In Lycaena rubidus larvae secrete a fluid that is high in sugar content. Fire ants bring the larvae back to the nest, and protect them through the pupa stage in exchange for feeding on the fluid.[11] In Eurybia elvina, fire ants were observed to frequently construct soil shelters over later instars of larvae on inflorescences that the larvae are found.[10]
