Aside from the 3000, 5000, and 7000 series, Dell also provides an Education and Rugged Series of Latitude computers. The Education series laptops are designed for use in educational institutions. They're not especially powerful, and are more geared towards office applications or internet-based applications. The Rugged series laptops are similar to the previous Latitude XFR computers. They are designed with extra durability in mind.
