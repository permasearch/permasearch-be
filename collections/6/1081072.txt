Kotaku contributor and anime critic Richard Eisenbeis gave the series an extremely negative review, describing the show as being the "most mean-spirited" anime that he had ever viewed as a critic and fan. Eisenbeis criticized the show's main source of humor, the protagonist's social anxiety disorder, as being demeaning to the mentally ill as low-brow.[46]
