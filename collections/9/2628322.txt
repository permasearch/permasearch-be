In the book Chicken Soup for the Soul: The Story Behind the Song, Aguilera revealed the occasion, theme and meaning of "Fighter". She talked about her "very chaotic and abusive" home, where she did not feel "safe".[1] In school, Aguilera was picked on and alienated because of her musical passion.[1] However, it made her become "smarter and stronger".[1] To release herself, Aguilera started to write songs at the age of 15, both music and lyrics; and it was the way how she found her voice.[1] The writing process of "Fighter" began during her promotion for her debut album in 1999,[1] when she was "a part of the big craze pop phenomenon".[1] According to Aguilera, her debut album helped her a lot to develop the process.[1] She wanted to make an "emotionally rich and positive empowering" song, especially for women, in order for them to speak for themselves be strong.[1] About the idea of the track, she revealed, "I was coming up with titles and ideas and deciding what I wanted to write about. I had to sit down and make sense of my feelings and experiences. I learned a lot from the first record that helped me to develop. I took the good and the bad and considered some of the choices I made and became better because of it.[1]
