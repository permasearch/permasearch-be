Elliot Huntley has complained of the song's enforced period in hibernation: "[It] simply beggars belief that the track was rejected by Martin, Lennon and McCartney â€“ three men whose reputations rested on their ability to spot a good tune when they heard one."[71] Huntley views "Isn't It a Pity" as worthy of "fully fledged standard" status, with Barham's "soaring" strings and Harrison's "sublime" slide guitar combining to take the song "into the heavens, where it stays".[32] Mojo contributor John Harris highlights the song in his review of one of the few "truly essential" solo albums by a former Beatle, writing: "The faster songs [on All Things Must Pass] (eg Wah Wah) are delightful; the slowies (Isn't It A Pity, Beware Of Darkness) simply jaw-dropping."[72]
