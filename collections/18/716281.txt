John Tenniel illustrated Alice Adventures in Wonderland (1865) for a fee of Â£138, which was roughly a fourth of what Carroll earned each year and which he paid for himself.[25] Tenniel was an already successful, well-known lead illustrator for the satirical magazine Punch,[26] when Carroll employed him as an illustrator in April 1864.[27] In contrast, Carroll did not have any literary fame at the time.[27] Tenniel likely based the majority of his illustrations off those in Under Ground,[28] and Carroll carefully oversaw his work;[29] among his suggestions was that Alice should have long, light-colored hair.[29] Alice's clothes are typical of what a girl belonging to the middle class in the mid-Victorian era might have worn at home.[30] Her pinafore, a detail created by Tenniel and now associated with the character, "suggests a certain readiness for action and lack of ceremony".[31] Tenniel's depiction of Alice has its origins in a physically similar character which appeared in at least eight cartoons in Punch, during a four-year period that began in 1860.[30] In an 1860 cartoon, this character wore clothes now associated with Alice: "the full skirt, pale stockings, flat shoes, and a hairband over her loose hair".[30] In the cartoons, the character appeared as an archetype of a pleasant girl from the middle classes;[32] she has been described as similar to Alice: "a pacifist and noninterventionist, patient and polite, slow to return the aggression of others".[33]
