The Patriots released email exchanges between the Patriots organization and the NFL on July 31, 2015. The emails, beginning in February 2015, show the Patriots' frustration over the NFL's failure to investigate the source of leaks, which turned out to consist largely of incorrect information.[93] Mike Florio of ProFootballTalk.com later contrasted Wells' lack of concern regarding these leaks with his "outrage" over leaks from Columbia University after they were asked to consult on the investigation.[94]
