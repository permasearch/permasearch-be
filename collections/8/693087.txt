Potential loss on a short sale is theoretically unlimited, as there is no theoretical limit to a rise in the price of the instrument. However, in practice, the short seller is required to post margin or collateral to cover losses, and inability to do so in a timely way would cause its broker or counterparty to liquidate the position. In the securities markets, the seller generally must borrow the securities to effect delivery in the short sale. In some cases, the short seller must pay a fee to borrow the securities and must additionally reimburse the lender for cash returns the lender would have received had the securities not been loaned out.
