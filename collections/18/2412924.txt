I Survived... is a documentary television series produced by NHNZ that airs on Lifetime Movie Network. The series premiered on March 24, 2008 and in the past has aired new episodes Sunday nights. The show currently airs on Friday evenings at 8 PM Eastern Time followed by its sister series I Survived... and Back (in which people share their near death experiences). The show allows survivors to explain – in their own words – how they overcame life-threatening circumstances without dramatic reenactments. Most episodes feature three separate stories involving kidnapping or getting stranded in a remote location; however, some only feature two.
