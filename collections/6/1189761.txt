Stringer pallets use a frame of three or more parallel pieces of timber (called stringers).  The top deckboards are then affixed to the stringers to create the pallet structure.  Stringer pallets can have a notch cut into them allowing "four-way" entry. Forklifts can lift a stringer pallet from all four directions, though lifting by the stringers is more secure.[20]
