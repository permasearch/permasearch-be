Pumpkins are grown all around the world for a variety of reasons ranging from agricultural purposes (such as animal feed) to commercial and ornamental sales.[15] Of the seven continents, only Antarctica is unable to produce pumpkins; the biggest international producers of pumpkins include the United States, Canada, Mexico, India, and China.[4][16] The traditional American pumpkin used for jack-o-lanterns is the Connecticut Field variety.[15][17][18][19]
