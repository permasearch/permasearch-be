We can also apply the saddle point asymptotic methods from Temme's article [17] to obtain other estimates for the Stirling numbers of the first kind. These estimates are more involved and complicated to state. Nonetheless, we provide an example.  In particular, we define the log gamma function,     Ï• ( x )   {\displaystyle \phi (x)}  , whose higher-order derivatives are given in terms of polygamma functions as
