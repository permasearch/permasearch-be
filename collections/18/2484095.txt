In xeroderma pigmentosa, the XPD helicase mutation exists at the site of ATP or DNA binding.[39] This results in a structurally functional helicase able to facilitate transcription, however it inhibits its function in unwinding DNA and DNA repair.[39] The lack of cell's ability to repair mutations, such as those caused by sun damage, is the cause of the high cancer rate in xeroderma pigmentosa patients.
