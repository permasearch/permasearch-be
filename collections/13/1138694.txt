Careful choice of medication by the prescribing physician, along with the provision of greater information to the patient can improve compliance. For example, in a 2000 study patients taking typical antipsychotics tended to experience more severe side-effects, and also receive less information about their illness, medicines and side-effects. They were naturally more likely to be non-compliant than those receiving atypicals.[69]
