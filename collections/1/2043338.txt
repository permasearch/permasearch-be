Symbrachydactyly is a congenital abnormality, characterized by limb anomalies consisting of brachydactyly, cutaneous syndactyly and global hypoplasia of the hand or foot.[1] In many cases, bones will be missing from the fingers and some fingers or toes may be missing altogether. The ends of the hand may have "nubbins"â€”small stumps where the finger would have developed, which may have tiny residual nails.[citation needed]
