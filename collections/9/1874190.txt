The π0 meson has a mass of 7002135000000000000♠135.0 MeV/c2 and a mean lifetime of 6983840000000000000♠8.4×10−17 s. It decays via the electromagnetic force, which explains why its mean lifetime is much smaller than that of the charged pion (which can only decay via the weak force). The main π0 decay mode, with a branching ratio of BR=0.98823, is into two photons:
