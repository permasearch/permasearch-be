When consumers approach their doctor with a health concern, or to request a change in medication for a condition they already have, often their first and most persuasive source of information was a pharmaceutical advertisement.  This leads consumers to direct their doctors’ visits from the start by prompting a conversation about a certain drug or course of treatment.  Doctors may be more likely to prescribe the medicine patients requested even when it may not be the most cost-effective, medically sound or safe course of treatment.  Of those patients who sought medical treatment because of an advertisement, 44% report their doctor prescribed the medication that they requested.[18] When new drugs are marketed directly to patients, the use of these drugs accelerates, even though trials and testing may not have yet had enough time to identify long-term side effects or rare reactions to the drug. Recently-released drugs usually are only tested in small pre-marketing clinical trials.[23]
