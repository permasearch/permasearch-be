The most divergent dialects of the language are to be found in the southern atolls, namely Huvadhu, Fuvahmulah and Addu. Slighter variants are spoken in Haddhunmathi and in Minicoy (Maliku) where Haddhunmathee Bas and Maliku Bas (Mahl) are spoken respectively. The dialect spoken in Minicoy has fewer differences from the standard Maldivian than other dialects. Among the dialects, MalÃ© Bas and Maliku Bas are most similar. The other variants show much difference including the dialects spoken in a few islands in Kolhumadulu, which are hardly recognised and known.
