The song title was undecided until the actual filming of the music video. There was a list of titles and Nishikido thought of additional titles such as "Pallette," "Mada Mada," "Me no Mae no Mukō e" and "Infinity." The group then voted on these names, with "Me no Mae no Mukō e" getting three votes from Shibutani, Maruyama and Murakami. Yasuda and Nishikdo voted for "Infinity," but changed their vote to "Life" when it was suggested. Ohkura and Yokoyama also voted for "Life." Maruyama gave another vote to "Kagiyaki Traveler." Yokoyama and Hina gave another vote to "Pallette."[8] Nishikido then tallied the votes and "Life" came in first with "Me no Mae no Mukō e" in second. Ohkura suggested to combine the two and the band agreed for the song's title to be, "Life (Me no Mae no Mukō e)."[9]
