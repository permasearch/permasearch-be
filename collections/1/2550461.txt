Fundamentally Chennai has 4 suburban railway lines, namely North line, West line, South line and MRTS line.[8] The South West line, West North line and West South line are merely minor extensions or modifications of the aforementioned suburban lines. The MRTS is a suburban railway line that chiefly runs on an elevated track exclusively used for running local EMUs or suburban local trains. No express trains or passenger trains run on MRTS line.
