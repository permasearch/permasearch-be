The WVS model proved to be so successful that other countries around the world set up their own version of the WVS during the war, with the assistance of British WVS.  The most successful of these was in India (formed in 1942),[4] especially in Bengal, which had during the war a membership of over 10,000[5] and continued into the 1950s. The Americans also had a WVS started soon after the start of the war by an American woman who had been working with the WVS in Northampton, England.[5]  WVS organisations were also set up in Canada and Australia.[5]
