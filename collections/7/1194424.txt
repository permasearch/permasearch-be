Apple believed the Apple II series was too expensive to produce and took away sales from the low-end Macintosh.[56] In the 1990s, Apple released the Macintosh LC, and began efforts to promote that computer by advising developer technical support staff to recommend developing applications for Macintosh rather than Apple II, and authorizing salespersons to direct consumers towards Macintosh and away from Apple II.[57] The Apple IIe was discontinued in 1993.[58]
