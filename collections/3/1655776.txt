In September 1994, Bertram Johnson purchased the Brock Candy Company of Chattanooga for $140 million, a year in which Brock Candy had sales of $112 million and profits of $6.5 million.  This was the second attempt by the two companies to join together.  The first time had been while E.J. Brach's was under American Home Products ownership.  The merger attempt at that time was canceled due to concerns of an antitrust suit.
