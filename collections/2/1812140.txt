Eckankar describes Soul Travel broadly as movement of the true, spiritual self (Soul) closer to the heart of God. While the contemplative may perceive the experience as travel, Soul itself is said not to move but to "come into an agreement with fixed states and conditions that already exist in some world of time and space".[60] American Harold Klemp, the current Spiritual Leader of Eckankar[61] practices and teaches Soul Travel, as did his predecessors,[62] through contemplative techniques known as the Spiritual Exercises of ECK (Divine Spirit).[63]
