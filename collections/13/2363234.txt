In "The List", Kevin is on the "winners" side of new Sabre CEO Robert California, and while he is out to lunch with the other "winners" and Robert, sends a text to all the "losers" telling them to suck it. Robert's odd belief that Kevin is a winner seems to persist well into "Gettysburg", when Kevin makes a vacuous statement about the desirability of cookies and Robert thinks he's making a brilliant analogy, but Ryan Howard later proves Kevin was really just talking about cookies. Robert looks completely horrified at this.
