Her ancestor, paternal with one exception being maternal, was King James II who had her closer ancestor and three other children with Arabella Churchill, sister of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, making her a distant cousin of the Spencer-Churchill, Churchill and Spencer prominent British contemporaries. The Spencers will have multiplied the Alba cousinage with the monarchy on the ascension to the throne of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge. Her titles included that of Duchess of Berwick in the Jacobite Peerage. The Jacobean Peerage has no rank in Britain; its senior holders often have inheritance and status in Catholic remnant aristocracies. In 1802 the dukedom passed to her Spanish noble male-line ancestor from his mother who took the surname accordingly.
