Mike Wass of Idolator expressed surprise over the choice of single, but wrote that the song "harks back to a time in country music when songs examined matters of the heart over simple arrangements," which works in the track's favor.[7] Billy Dukes of Taste of Country reviewed the song favorably. He wrote that "I Could Use a Love Song" is "more immediately accessible than her previous two radio hits," and praised Morris for expressing a new side to her artistry.[2]
