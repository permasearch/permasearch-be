This motion is caused by the movement of the stars relative to the Sun and Solar System. The Sun travels in a nearly circular orbit (the solar circle) about the center of the Milky Way at a speed of about 220 km/s at a radius of 7000800000000000000♠8 kPc from the center,[6][7] which can be taken as the rate of rotation of the Milky Way itself at this radius.[8][9]
