The sixth season of the Fairy Tail anime series was directed by Shinji Ishihira and produced by A-1 Pictures and Satelight.[1] Like the rest of the series, it follows the adventures of Natsu Dragneel and Lucy Heartfilia of the fictional guild Fairy Tail. It contains a single story arc, titled "Dai Matō Enbu" (大魔闘演武, lit "Grand Magic Games"), which adapts material from the beginning of the 31st through the ending of the 35th volumes of Hiro Mashima's Fairy Tail manga over 24 episodes. Focusing on Natsu and the others who were frozen in time for seven years on Tenrou Island, the members return to Magnolia and discover that Saber Tooth is the strongest guild in the Fiore Kingdom. Having become the weakest guild during the absence of its core members, Fairy Tail decides to enter the Grand Magic Games, an annual competition to decide Fiore's strongest guild.
