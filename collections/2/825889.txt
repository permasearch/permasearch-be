Blood left the series following the season three episode "Parting Shot" to star in the spin-off show Marvel's Most Wanted.[77] As that series was not picked up in May 2016,[78] it was announced in September 2017 that Blood would return to Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D during season five.[79] On where Hunter's been when he returns to help Fitz get to 2091 to rescue Coulson and the team, Blood said, "he’s been up his usual tricks, doing some mercenary work and bickering with Bobbi…. He doesn’t necessarily have access to all the bells-and-whistles and gadgetry that S.H.I.E.L.D. did, so he has to use his charm and his wit to break down doors, and call in a few favors from his dodgy friends".[80]
