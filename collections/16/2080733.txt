Most of the average Indian woman's life is spent in marriage; many[who?] women are still married before the legal age of 18, and the incidence of non-marriage is low in India. Childbearing and raising children are the priorities of early adulthood for Indian women. Thus, if they enter the workforce at all, it is far later than Indian men. Urban Indian men reach the peak of their labour force participation between the ages of 25 and 29, while urban Indian women do so between the ages of 40 and 44.[4] Because of this, women have less time for the acquisition of skills and fewer opportunities for job improvements.
