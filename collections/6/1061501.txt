Clay was given much of the credit for the Compromise's success. It quieted the controversy between Northerners and Southerners over the expansion of slavery, and helped delay secession and civil war until the 1860s. Senator Henry S. Foote of Mississippi, who had suggested the creation of the Committee of Thirteen, stated, "had there been one such man in the Congress of the United States as Henry Clay in 1860-'61 there would, I feel sure, have been no civil war".[215]
