When sound waves hit a medium, the reflection of that sound is dependent on dissimilarity of the surfaces it comes in contact with.[4] Sound hitting a concrete surface will result in a much different reflection than if sound were to hit a softer medium such as fiberglass. In an outdoor environment such as highway engineering, embankments or panelling are often used to reflect sound upwards into the sky.
