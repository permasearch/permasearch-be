Records since then have all been accomplished on personal computers using the Chudnovsky algorithm. In 2009, Fabrice Bellard computed just under 2.7 trillion digits, and from 2010 onward, all records have been set using Alexander Yee's y-cruncher software.  As of  November 2016[update], the record stands at 22,459,157,718,361 (πe × 1012) digits.[28] The limitation on further expansion is primarily storage space for the computation.[29]
