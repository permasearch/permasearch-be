Although the continental landmasses listed below are not normally called islands (by definition a landmass cannot be both an island and a continent), they are, in fact, land entirely surrounded by water. In effect, they are enormous islands and are shown here for that reason. The figures are approximations and are for the continental mainland only.[citation needed]
