His records had little success, because A&M's main releases were folk music rather than Country.[46] He had a few hits on local radio in Phoenix, with "Four Strong Winds" and "Just To Satisfy You" (co-written with Bowman). Meanwhile, he recorded an album on BAT records, called JD's. After 500 copies were sold at the club, another 500 copies were pressed by the Sounds label.[47] He also played lead guitar for Patsy Montana on a 1964 album.[48]
