Spiegelman displays his sense of guilt in many ways. He suffers anguish over his dead brother, Richieu, who perished in the Holocaust, and whom he feels he can never live up to.[103] The eighth chapter, made after the publication and unexpected success of the first volume, opens with a guilt-ridden Spiegelman (now in human form, with a strapped-on mouse mask) atop a pile of corpsesâ€”the corpses of the six million Jews upon whom Maus' success was built.[104] He is told by his psychiatrist that his father feels guilt for having survived and for outliving his first son,[105] and that some of Art's guilt may spring from painting his father in such an unflattering way.[106] As he had not lived in the camps himself, he finds it difficult to understand or visualize this "separate universe", and feels inadequate in portraying it.[27][107]
