Sociolinguistic interviews are an integral part of collecting data for sociolinguistic studies.  There is an interviewer, who is conducting the study, and a subject, or informant, who is the interviewee.  In order to get a grasp on a specific linguistic form and how it is used in the dialect of the subject, a variety of methods are used to elicit certain registers of speech.  There are five different styles, ranging from formal to casual.  The most formal style would be elicited by having the subject read a list of minimal pairs (MP).  Minimal pairs are pairs of words that differ in only one phoneme, such as cat and bat.  Having the subject read a word list (WL) will elicit a formal register, but generally not as formal as MP.  The reading passage (RP) style is next down on the formal register, and the interview style (IS) is when an interviewer can finally get into eliciting a more casual speech from the subject.  During the IS the interviewer can converse with the subject and try to draw out of them an even more casual sort of speech by asking him to recall childhood memories or maybe a near death experience, in which case the subject will get deeply involved with the story since strong emotions are often attached to these memories.  Of course, the most sought-after type of speech is the casual style (CS).  This type of speech is difficult if not impossible to elicit because of the Observer's Paradox.  The closest one might come to CS in an interview is when the subject is interrupted by a close friend or family member, or perhaps must answer the phone.  CS is used in a completely unmonitored environment where the subject feels most comfortable and will use their natural vernacular without overtly thinking about it.
