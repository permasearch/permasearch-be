Each user-created level has a unique ID (The ID is lower if the level is older), which can be used to play the level without searching its name. As similar to the official levels, user-created levels are classified by difficulty, which is decided by RobTop, by players or "level mods" who can send a level to RobTop to be rated. Unlike official levels, they cannot be played offline unless they were previously downloaded.[7]
