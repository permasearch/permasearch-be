In 2014, Transport for London suggested that pedestrianisation may not be a suitable long-term measure due to Crossrail reducing the demand for bus services along Oxford Street, and proposed to ban all traffic except buses and cycles during peak shopping times.[45] Optimisation of existing traffic signals along the street, including Pedestrian Countdown signals, have also been proposed.[58] Transport for London is concerned that in the long term traffic problems may affect trade on Oxford Street, which is now competing with shopping centres such as Westfield London, Westfield Stratford City and the Brent Cross shopping centre.[46] In 2015, while campaigning for election as London Mayor, Labour's Sadiq Khan favoured the full pedestrianisation of Oxford Street, which was supported by other parties.[59] After winning the election, he pledged the street would be completely pedestrianised by 2020, including a ban on buses and taxis.[47]
