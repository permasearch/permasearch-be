J.W. was further tested to determine after-effects on his self-recognition and familiar facial recognition.[34] He was tested in a study where he would respond yes or no to images presented, by pressing a button. These images were ranging from 0â€“100% "JW", with the 0% images being of Dr. Michael Gazzaniga, and the 100% images being of J.W. himself. What researchers found supported the idea that there are cortical networks in the left hemisphere that play an important role in execution of the self-recognition process.
