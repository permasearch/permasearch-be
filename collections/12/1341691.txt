Collectivist anarchism, also referred to as revolutionary socialism or a form of such,[190][191] is a revolutionary form of anarchism, commonly associated with Mikhail Bakunin and Johann Most.[192][193] Collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivised. This was to be achieved through violent revolution, first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence, or propaganda by the deed, which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production.[192]
