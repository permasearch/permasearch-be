To commemorate the Master's forty-fifth anniversary, Big Finish did a trilogy of audios featuring the Master in 2016; And You Will Obey Me pits the Fifth Doctor against the Beevers incarnation of the Master, seeking to regain his body after an unspecified attack left him seriously injured and hunted[104], and Vampire of the Mind pits the Sixth Doctor against the MacQueen incarnation of the Master, who is seeking to drain the neural energy of the Doctor and various Earth scientists to restore his own mind after some terrible accident[105]. These two storylines come together in The Two Masters, in which the Seventh Doctor faces both of these incarnations of the Master at once and realizes that they have been transferred into each other's bodies as part of a complex plan by the Cult of the Heretic, a cult dedicated to a Time Lord who sought to unmake the universe. The resulting paradox of the two Masters in each other's bodies, coupled with the fact that the Cult manipulated the MacQueen Master into attacking the Beevers incarnation, resulting in the crippled form witnessed in The Deadly Assassin, is revealed to be causing the universe to collapse. The Masters are able to restore themselves to their own bodies, steal the Doctor's TARDIS to trap him on a battlecruiser about to crash, and finish unmaking the universe before destroying the Cult, but the Doctor manages to track them using the Master's own TARDIS. With the Cult destroyed, the Doctor uses the Masters' discarded weapons to immobilize the two Masters before using the Cult's equipment to rebuild the universe as it was, with his only changes being to send both Masters back to their original locations in time and space and save the life of a temporary companion whom the Master had killed[106].
