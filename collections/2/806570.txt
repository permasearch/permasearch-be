This concept first appeared on their trip to Andong, North Gyeongsang when the cast were split up into YB and OB teams to determine their sleeping locations through a game of Bok-bul-bok. The OB team had won the game through a relay of Jegichagi (제기차기), but the YB team had insisted that the production team give them another chance. The same game was played, but each member represented and played for themselves. With the YB team already sleeping outside, the members who took the challenge competed to sleep indoors. However, if they lose the game, they were to sleep "out-outdoors" (sleeping in a sleeping bag without a tent). Lee Seung-gi, MC Mong and Kim Jong-min attempted the challenge but failed and were chosen to sleep "out-outdoors". Kang Ho-dong decided to challenge the game to save the YB team, but failed twice and was selected to sleep "out-outdoors" as well. Kim C decided to take the challenge, but also failed and was chosen to sleep "outdoors" (with a tent). Eun Jiwon and Lee Soo-geun did not attempt the challenge and slept "outdoors" and "indoors", respectively.
