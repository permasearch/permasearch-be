Chalke played Becky for the remainder of the sixth season and all of the seventh season. When the show reached its eighth season, Goranson managed to schedule things so that she could work as Becky again, replacing Chalke. Goranson appeared continually at the beginning of season eight, but by mid-season she had scheduling conflicts again with school. On two occasions Goranson had to pull out of episodes in which the Becky character was necessary; Darlene's wedding and a family trip to Walt Disney World. Chalke was called back in to play Becky for these episodes. Toward the end of the season, Goranson was available again and she returned to play Becky. However, after the end of the eighth season, Goranson decided not to continue due to scheduling conflicts she had during the previous season. For the ninth and what would be the final season of the original run, Goranson did not return to the show, leaving the role to Chalke for that season.
