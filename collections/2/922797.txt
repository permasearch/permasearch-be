In 2011, the Aggies began as a top 10 ranked team, but fell out of the polls after losing four games, three of which had double-digit half-time leads.[118] Three of those four losses were to teams later ranked among the top ten in the nation. On November 19, 2011, the Aggies defeated Kansas 61-7 and became bowl-eligible for a third straight season.[119] Five days later, on November 24, 2011, they would lose at home to Texas by a score of 27-25 on a last-second field goal,[120] in what would be the last game of the rivalry for the foreseeable future, as the Aggies were to join the SEC beginning in 2012.[121] It was the Aggies' sixth loss of the season, and the fifth in which they held a second-half lead of two or more scores.[118] Sherman was fired by Texas A&M on December 1, 2011.[122] The Aggies compiled a record of 25â€“25 during Sherman's four-year tenure.[123]
