Summer begins in early April and continues till the end of June, with the heat peaking in May. It is characterized by extreme heat, low humidity, very hot winds and thunderstorms. Delhi's proximity to the Thar Desert results in hot, dry continental winds, called loo, at times blowing all across from the West Asian mainland, making the days feel hotter. These winds, blowing over from vast land stretches, are very hot and dry. Since the Western Disturbance depression moves eastward (and is the reason for cyclonic occurrences in Eastern Coastal areas) by this time of the year, there is no moisture-laden wind to increase humidity. The air therefore remains dry or very dry during day. For most of its summer season, Delhi has a semi-arid climate.[1] Coming from Spring, the city witnesses a spurt in day temperature around early April, whereas nights still remain pleasant. By the latter part of April or during early May, maximum temperatures exceed 40 °C while the ambience remains very dry. Night temperatures cross the 20 °C mark towards the latter part of April. May is Delhi's hottest month during which temperatures may reach 45 °C or higher.[6] This month is characterized by frequent thunderstorms.[7] Dust storms are another feature of Delhi's summer,[8][9] and can be severe and destructive when accompanied by strong winds, particularly under cumulonimbus formation.[10] These are caused due to fine dust brought along by the hot winds arriving from the desert. They make the surroundings appear pale yellow, bring temperatures slightly down and are usually followed by thunderstorms. Post mid-June, temperatures start falling slowly, while humidity shows a gradual rise. A visual characteristic of summer in Delhi is the summer bloom, particularly the blooming Bougainvillea, Amaltas, Gulmohar, Shireesh and Jacaranda trees, which look spectacular when fully flowering during peak summer in May.[11]
