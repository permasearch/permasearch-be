The English History section is part of the background to show how the English Bill of Rights 1689 influenced the 2nd Amendment at the time it was adopted. Any statements in this section that refers to the thinking after the adoption distorts the chronological order of the article. While the English Bill of Rights definitely influenced the American Bill of Rights, it was not the only factor i.e. the 1st A. Future statements belong under another heading (English versus American law? / Later commentary), if at all. Iâ€™ll wait a few days for addition comments before editing.Grahamboat (talk) 22:56, 28 November 2010 (UTC)
