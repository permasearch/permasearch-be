New Horizons has been called "the fastest spacecraft ever launched"[186] because it left Earth at 16.26 kilometers per second (58,536 km/h; 36,373 mph), faster than any other spacecraft to date.[73][187] It is also the first spacecraft launched directly into a solar escape trajectory, which requires an approximate speed while near Earth of 16.5 km/s (59,000 km/h; 37,000 mph),[a] plus additional delta-v to cover air and gravity drag, all to be provided by the launch vehicle.
