In October 1990, Blur released their first single, "She's So High", which reached number 48 in the UK Singles Chart.[22] The band had trouble creating a follow-up single, but made progress when paired with producer Stephen Street. The resulting single, "There's No Other Way", became a hit, peaking at number eight.[23] As a result of the single's success, Blur became pop stars and were accepted into a clique of bands who frequented the Syndrome club in London dubbed the "Scene That Celebrates Itself".[24] The recording of the group's debut album was hindered by Albarn having to write his lyrics in the studio. Although the resulting album Leisure (1991) peaked at number seven on the UK Albums Chart, it received mixed reviews,[22] and according to journalist John Harris, "could not shake off the odour of anti-climax".[25] Albarn has since referred to Leisure as "awful".[26]
