In South East Queensland, the Wivenhoe Dam filled to a level equivalent to 191% of its supply capacity on 11 January 2011.[16][76] Although the dam can hold the equivalent of 225% of its supply capacity, storage exceeding 100% is required to be progressively released through the floodgates to restore capacity to mitigate future flood events.[19][77][78] Brisbane experienced its wettest December since 1859.[32] Wyaralong Dam, near Beaudesert, had recently been completed and was praised[79] for mitigating flooding in downstream Logan, having exceeded 80% of its capacity.[80]
