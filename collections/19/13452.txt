Donald B. Wagner writes that most domestic iron tools and implements produced during the Han were made of cheaper and more brittle cast iron, whereas the military preferred to use wrought iron and steel weaponry due to their more durable qualities.[24] During the Han dynasty, the typical 0.5 m (1.6 ft) bronze sword found in the Warring States period was gradually replaced with an iron sword measuring roughly 1 m (3.3 ft) in length.[25] The ancient dagger-axe (ge) made of bronze was still used by Han soldiers, although it was gradually phased out by iron spears and iron ji halberds.[26] Even arrowheads, which were traditionally made of bronze, gradually only had a bronze tip and iron shaft, until the end of the Han when the entire arrowhead was made solely of iron.[26] Farmers, carpenters, bamboo craftsmen, stonemasons, and rammed earth builders had at their disposal iron tools such as the plowshare, pickaxe, spade, shovel, hoe, sickle, axe, adze, hammer, chisel, knife, saw, scratch awl, and nails.[27] Common iron commodities found in Han dynasty homes included tripods, stoves, cooking pots, belt buckles, tweezers, fire tongs, scissors, kitchen knives, fish hooks, and needles.[26] Mirrors and oil lamps were often made of either bronze or iron.[28] Coin money minted during the Han was made of either copper or copper and tin smelted together to make the bronze alloy.[29]
