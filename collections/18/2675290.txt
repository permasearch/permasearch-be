Nerves and muscles may be trapped by broken bones; in these cases the bones need to be put back into their proper places quickly.[4] For example, fractures of the orbital floor or medial orbital wall of the eye can entrap the medial rectus or inferior rectus muscles.[25] In facial wounds, tear ducts and nerves of the face may be damaged.[3] Fractures of the frontal bone can interfere with the drainage of the frontal sinus and can cause sinusitis.[26]
