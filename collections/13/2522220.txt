The group returned to North America a second time for a more comprehensive tour consisting of 22 dates in March and April under the banner of "1999 Party", taking their entire entourage with them including dancer Stacia, MC and DJ Andy Dunkley, a lightshow by Jonathan Smeeton (Liquid Len) and support from United Artists Records label mates Man.[11][12][13] Although Dettmar still hadn't left the group, House joined the band for this tour, but not having the appropriate work permit, his performances were strictly unofficial.[10] The Chicago and Detroit shows on 21 and 23 March were professionally recorded, the former being released in 1997 as The 1999 Party.
