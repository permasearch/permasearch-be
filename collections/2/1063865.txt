Duff began dating Canadian NHL player Mike Comrie in 2007. Following the release of Dignity and the music videos for "With Love" and "Stranger," Duff began to adapt a more mature image. Duff's new image inspired some to consider her a "sex symbol."[81] This image was reinforced by her appearance in the political satire film War, Inc. (2008), in which Duff portrayed an "oversexed" Central Asian pop star named Yonica Babyyeah. The film received a limited release in the United States, and grossed $580,862 domestically.[82] Duff recorded the songs "Boom Boom Bang Bang" and "I Want to Blow You Up" for the film's soundtrack.[82] Despite initially announcing a deluxe edition of Dignity for a 2008 release, Duff later confirmed that she would release a greatest hits album to fulfill her contract with Hollywood Records.[83] Best of Hilary Duff (2008) received no promotion prior to its release, entering the Billboard 200 at number 125.[84] It became her first album released in the United States to not receive a certification from the RIAA.[84] The compilation included the single "Reach Out," which sampled the Depeche Mode song "Personal Jesus."[85] The song featured provocative lyrics referencing sex, while its music video saw Duff both humping a statue and sucking a man's thumb.[86][87] The song became her third consecutive single to top the Hot Dance Club Play chart in the United States. She announced to MTV that she would begin writing another album in December 2008, but it was never developed.[88][89] That same year, Duff ceased to have control over "Stuff by Hilary Duff", thus the line was discontinued.[90][91]
