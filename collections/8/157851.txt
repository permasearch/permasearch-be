The Cabinet Secretary should not be confused with the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, which is the senior Australian Public Service departmental secretary, or other Cabinet Secretary positions in other Westminster systems. The United Kingdom Minister for the Cabinet Office has similar but not analogous functions as the Australian Cabinet Secretary.
