Constantine had invited all 1,800 bishops of the Christian church within the Roman Empire (about 1,000 in the east and 800 in the west), but a smaller and unknown number attended. Eusebius of Caesarea counted more than 250,[20] Athanasius of Alexandria counted 318,[11] and Eustathius of Antioch estimated "about 270"[21] (all three were present at the council). Later, Socrates Scholasticus recorded more than 300,[22] and Evagrius,[23] Hilary of Poitiers,[24] Jerome,[25] Dionysius Exiguus,[26] and Rufinus[27] recorded 318. This number 318 is preserved in the liturgies of the Eastern Orthodox Church[28] and the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria.[citation needed]
