Pelleted feeds may be conducive to formation of phosphate uroliths, because of increased urinary phosphorus excretion.  This is attributable to lower saliva production where pelleted rations containing finely ground constituents are fed.  With less blood phosphate partitioned into saliva, more tends to be excreted in urine.[118]  (Most saliva phosphate is fecally excreted.[119])
