In 2008, Ford enjoyed success with the release of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, another Lucas/Spielberg collaboration. The film received generally positive reviews and was the second highest-grossing film worldwide in 2008.[40] He later said he would like to star in another sequel, "...if it didn't take another 20 years to digest."[41]
