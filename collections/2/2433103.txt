The Election Commission registered 24 political parties, and public meetings attracted many large crowds. On the eve of the elections, a cyclone struck East Pakistan killing approximately 500,000 people, though this event did not deter people from participating in the first ever general election.[103] Mobilizing support for their Six Points manifesto the Awami League secured electoral support in East Pakistan.[103] Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's Pakistan Peoples Party asserted itself even more. Its socialist rationale, roti kapda aur makaan (food, cloth, and shelter) and the party's socialist manifesto quickly popularised the party.[103] The conservative PML, led by Nurul Amin, raised religious and nationalist slogans all over the country.[103]
