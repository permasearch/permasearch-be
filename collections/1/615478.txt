When "The Look" was about to be released in Sweden as the fourth single, an American exchange student named Dean Cushman returned from Sweden and urged his local Top 40 radio station KDWB in Minneapolis to play the song.[5] It quickly became popular, and the station began distributing the track to their sister radio operations.[6][7] EMI America had previously rejected the duo as unsuitable for the American market, and Roxette did not have a recording contract there.[8] "The Look" had already entered the top fifty of the Billboard Hot 100 before the duo began official promotion. It would go on to peak at number one eight weeks later.[9]
