There are two public schools within the city: Safety Harbor Elementary School for grades 1–5 and Safety Harbor Middle School (Home of the Seahawks) for grades 6–8. The middle school was rebuilt in 2004 and now has five buildings surrounding a central courtyard, with adjacent sports fields and a regulation track field. As a joint project between the city of Safety Harbor and the school, the field and track facilities are open to the community. As of 2007, Safety Harbor Middle School has an enrollment of 1,370 students.[9]
