Generative grammar has been used to a limited extent in music theory and analysis since the 1980s.[6][7] The most well-known approaches were developed by Mark Steedman[8] as well as Fred Lerdahl and Ray Jackendoff,[9] who formalized and extended ideas from Schenkerian analysis.[10] More recently, such early generative approaches to music were further developed and extended by various scholars.[11][12][13][14]The theory of generative grammar has been manipulated by the Sun Ra Revival Post-Krautrock Archestra in the development of their post-structuralist lyrics. This is particularly emphasised in their song "Sun Ra Meets Terry Lee".
