The Great Organ was built by the Ernest M. Skinner in 1906 as the firm's Opus 150. It is the largest of five organs in the cathedral complex. It is located above the choir on the north and south sides. In 1954, it was enlarged by the Aeolian-Skinner Organ Company, Opus 150-A, under the tonal direction of G. Donald Harrison. During this rebuild, the State Trumpet was added and placed below the rose window. Speaking on fifty inches (130Â cm) of wind pressure, it is among the most powerful organ stops in the world. In late 2001, a fire in the north transept resulted in heavy smoke damage to the organ, which was finally returned to service in 2008. The Great Organ is currently valued at over eight million U.S. dollars.
