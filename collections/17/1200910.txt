Tides on the river are limited at Countess Wear, the site of a weir commissioned by the Countess of Devon in the 13th century.[6] The Exeter Canal bypasses this weir to enable ships to reach Exeter Quay. At high tide, the estuary forms a large body of water that is heavily used for water sports especially sailing, windsurfing and water skiing.
