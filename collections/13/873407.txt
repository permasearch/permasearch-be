On March 23, 1875, at sample station number 225 located in the southwest Pacific Ocean between Guam and Palau, the crew recorded a sounding of 4,475 fathoms, (8,184 meters) deep, which was confirmed by an additional sounding. As shown by later expeditions using modern equipment, this area represents the southern end of the Mariana trench and is one of the deepest known places on the ocean floor. Modern soundings to 10,994 meters have since been found near the site of the Challenger's original sounding. Challenger's discovery of this depth was a key finding of the expedition in broadening oceanographic horizons on the oceanâ€™s depth and extent and now bears the vessel's name, the Challenger Deep.
