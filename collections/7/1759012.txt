At the time of the convention, the national women's movement was in the process of splitting.  One wing, associated with Stanton and Anthony, had formed the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA).  The other, associated with Lucy Stone and Julia Ward Howe, had formed the New England Woman Suffrage Association (NEWSA) and would soon form the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA).  Isabella Beecher Hooker invited both parties to the Hartford convention and tried to heal the breach between them, but was unsuccessful.[44] The Beecher family generally opposed Anthony's and Stanton's NWSA (Isabella's brother, Henry Ward Beecher, was the first president of the more moderate AWSA[45]).  Isabella, however, was friendly with Anthony and Stanton and served as NWSA's vice president for Connecticut.[46]
