At the hospital, the sheriff tells Pam that Joey was Roy's son, and after seeing him slaughtered, he lost his sanity and adopted Jason's identity to kill everyone at the house, apparently blaming them all for the death. Tommy, after waking up from a nightmare where he kills Pam in his room, awakens a hallucination of Jason, but he faces his fears which makes Jason's hallucination disappear. He hears Pam approaching and throws his bed through the window to appear that he has escaped. When she rushes in, he appears from behind the door, wearing Roy's hockey mask and wielding a kitchen knife.
