Two other Australian Aboriginal art designs have been displayed on Qantas aircraft. Two Boeing 747s (a −400 and later a −400ER) were adorned in a paint scheme called Wunala Dreaming. Wunala Dreaming was the first Australian Aboriginal art scheme and was unveiled in 1994.[129] The motif was an overall-red design depicting ancestral spirits in the form of kangaroos travelling in the outback.[52] The second design was called Nalanji Dreaming and was painted on one of the airline's now-retired Boeing 747-300s in 1995. Nalanji Dreaming was a bright blue design inspired by rainforest landscape and tropical seas.[52][130]
