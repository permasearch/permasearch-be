The lake also features many houses around its edges and a peculiar rock formation (Goose rocks) in the center of the lake, accessible most safely by kayak or canoe. Lake Oscawana provides summer recreation to many of the local residents who use the lake for boating, swimming, fishing, and just lying on one of the lake's several private beaches.
