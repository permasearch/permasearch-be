The MSC is a registered charity [18] and non-profit organisation [19] and depends on various sources of funding. From 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2012, the MSC’s total income was £15 million. Total expenditure for the same period was £12 million. The MSC Board recognises it as generally good practice to hold reserves as a protection against any financial difficulties in the future. A reserves target of 6 to 9 months’ cover is considered to be necessary, at least as an aspiration, given the MSC’s absence of a subscribing membership and uncertainty, as a market-based program, of its various income streams.[20]
