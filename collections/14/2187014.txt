After Wade leaves with Sawyer's body, Rocco's contact Ziggy (Marc Lawrence) arrives to conclude the deal. Rocco sells Ziggy a large amount of counterfeit money. Because the captain of the luxury yacht on which they arrived from Cuba has moved to deeper water due to the storm they need another boat. Rocco forces Frank, who is a skilled seaman, to take him and his henchmen back to Cuba on the smaller hotel boat. Nora and Gaye try to convince Frank to make a break for safety once he is outside the hotel, but he agrees to take the men to Cuba. Gaye pretends a last-ditch attempt to convince Rocco to take her with him and uses the embrace to steal Rocco's gun, which she covertly passes to Frank.
