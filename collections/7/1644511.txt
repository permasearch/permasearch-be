Although South Africa has one of the best, cleanest water out of all the countries in Southern Africa, many don’t have access to basic sanitations.[5] A majority of Southern Africa’s accessible water is unclean, making the water vulnerable for water transmitted diseases to exist. Water-borne diseases such as Hepatitis A and Hepatitis E increase, while some of the water become so unclean that diseases such as: Typhoid fever, Leptospirosis, Schistosomiasis, and Bilharzia are transmitted through water contact.[6]
