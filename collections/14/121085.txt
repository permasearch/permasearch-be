The Bulletproof diet is a fad diet  developed and marketed by Asprey that recommends eating foods high in fat, moderate in protein, and low in carbohydrates, the foundation of which is "Bulletproof Coffee",  a coffee drink with butter and medium-chain triglyceride derived from coconut oil.[26][27]   Asprey developed his Bulletproof Coffee recipe after traveling to Tibet and tasting yak-butter tea drinks. He returned to the United States and experimented with buttered drink recipes and published the preparation for his buttered coffee drink on his blog in 2009.[28][29]
