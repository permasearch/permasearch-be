The Unanswered Question is a musical work by American composer Charles Ives.  Originally paired with Central Park in the Dark as Two Contemplations in 1908,[a] The Unanswered Question was revived by Ives in 1930â€“1935.  As with many of Ives' works, it was largely unknown until much later in his life, and was not performed until 1946.
