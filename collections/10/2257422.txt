When Deborah's father abandoned the family, her mother was unable to provide for her children, so she placed them in the households of friends and relatives, a common practice in 18th-century New England.[5] Deborah was placed in the home of a maternal relative.[5] When her mother died shortly afterwards, she was sent to live with Reverend Peter Thatcher's widow Mary Prince Thatcher (1688-1771), who was then in her eighties.[5] Historians believe she learned to read while living with the widow Thatcher, who might have wanted Deborah to read Bible verses to her.[5]
