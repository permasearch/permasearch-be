Classical writers did not apply the terms Κελτοί or "Celtae" to the inhabitants of Britain or Ireland,[3][4][5] leading a number of scholars to question the use of the term Celt to describe the Iron Age inhabitants of those islands.[3][4][5][6] The first historical account of the islands of Britain and Ireland was by Pytheas, a Greek from the city of Massalia, who around 310-306 BC, sailed around what he called the "Pretannikai nesoi", which can be translated as the "Pretannic Isles".[90] In general, classical writers referred to the inhabitants of Britain as Pretannoi or Britanni.[91] Strabo, writing in the Roman era, clearly distinguished between the Celts and Britons.[92]
