Avery returns to the United States in exchange for a North Korean spy,[43] Jack having unwittingly facilitated the exchange when he sold horribly uncomfortable Kouchtown couches to the CIA as interrogation tools.[24] Jack and Avery plan to renew their vows but eventually divorce each other because of Jack's relationship with Avery's mother and Avery's relationship with Scott Scottsman, a fellow former captive. Jack also admits that he and Avery only married because of Avery's pregnancy.[44]
