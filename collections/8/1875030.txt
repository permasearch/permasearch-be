The United States of Europe is widely hypotheticised, fictionalised, or depicted as a superpower that is as powerful as, or more powerful than, the US. Some people, such as T.R. Reid, Andrew Reding, and Mark Leonard, among others, believe that the power of the hypothetical United States of Europe will rival that of the US in the twenty-first century. Leonard cites seven factors: Europe's large population, Europe's large economy, Europe's low inflation rates, Europe's central location in the world, the unpopularity and perceived failure of American foreign policy in recent years, and certain European countries' highly developed social organisation and quality of life (when measured in terms such as hours worked per week and income distribution).[31] Some experts[who?] claim that Europe has developed a sphere of influence called the Eurosphere.
