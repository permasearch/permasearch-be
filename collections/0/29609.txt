Tiffany Lynn Adams was born in Layton, Utah on May 6, 1982. She has two sisters, five step-sisters and two step-brothers.[1] When she was three years old she started dancing, focusing on jazz, hip hop, and ballet dancing. As a youth, her family moved a lot because her mother "liked to build houses." The family lived near Hill Air Force Base for a while. She went to middle school and one year of high school in West Haven, Utah. She completed her high school education at Northridge High School in Layton after the family moved back to the town. She was on the dance squad at nearby Fremont High School.[2] After graduating from high school in 2000 she was a performer for two seasons with the America First Jazz Dancers for the Utah Jazz.[2] During that time, she also taught dance classes locally.[2]
