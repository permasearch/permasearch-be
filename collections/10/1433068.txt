Until the late 20th century, the term goatee was used to refer solely to a beard formed by a tuft of hair on the chinâ€”as on the chin of a goat, hence the term 'goatee'.[1] By the 1990s, the word had become an umbrella term used to refer to any facial hair style incorporating hair on the chin but not the cheeks;[2] there is debate over whether this style is correctly called a goatee or a Van Dyke.[3]
