The French- and Arpitan-speaking Aosta Valley region in Italy also presents a claim of Celtic heritage.[75] The Northern League autonomist party often exalts what it claims are the Celtic roots of all Northern Italy or Padania.[76] Reportedly, Friuli also has a claim to Celticity (recent studies have estimated that about 1/10 of Friulian words are of Celtic origin; also, a lot of typical Friulian traditions, dances, songs and mythology are remnants of the culture of Carnian tribes who lived in this area during the Roman age and the early Middle Ages. Some Friulians consider themselves and their region as one of the Celtic Nations[77])
