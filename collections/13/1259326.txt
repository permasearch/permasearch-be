TCM has been the subject of controversy within China.[72] In 2006, the Chinese scholar Zhang Gongyao triggered a national debate when he published an article entitled "Farewell to Traditional Chinese Medicine," arguing that TCM was a pseudoscience that should be abolished in public healthcare and academia.[72] The Chinese government however, interested in the opportunity of export revenues, took the stance that TCM is a science and continued to encourage its development.[72]
