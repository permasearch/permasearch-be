New ultra low-sulphur petroleum-only diesels are known to cause some seals to shrink,[29] and may cause fuel pump failures in TDI engines used in 2006 to 2009 models. TDI engines from 2009 on and before 2006  are designed to use ULSD exclusively; biodiesel blends are reported to prevent that failure[citation needed].
