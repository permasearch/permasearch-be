Christy, Bonnie and Adam bail Ray out of jail after Ray calls Adam for being arrested for getting into a fight at a Warriors game. Bonnie intends to force him to get sober and go to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, but Ray insists that he gets cleaned up his way and stays with Adam, only to resort to using cocaine again. Meanwhile, Christy fights for her job as her new boss does not condone her tardiness at work like her old one did.
