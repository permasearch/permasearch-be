During the war, Kenya was one of the single most important conscription grounds for the British Army in Africa. During the course of the war, 98,240 Kenyans were enlisted as Askaris into the King's African Rifles (KAR), representing 30% of the unit's total strength.[49] The vast majority of soldiers from Kenya, of whom most were conscripted,[50] were overwhelmingly African and the policy of racial segregation in the British Army meant that they were commanded by white officers and NCOs. Blacks were not able to rise above the rank of Warrant Officer.
