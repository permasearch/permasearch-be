On 30 April 2014, Costa won and converted a penalty in the second leg of the Champions League semi-final against Chelsea, as Atlético won 3–1 at Stamford Bridge and advanced to the final of the competition for the first time since 1974.[75] He finished the league season with 27 league goals to become the third highest scorer,[76] and the team won the title for the first time since 1996, but he was substituted after 16 minutes of the last match of the season against Barcelona due to a hamstring injury.[77] Atlético sought to cure this injury before the upcoming Champions League final against Real Madrid by sending him to Belgrade for treatment with a horse placenta,[78] and he was included in the starting line-up for the decisive match. However, he left the pitch after eight minutes in an eventual 1–4 loss;[79] manager Diego Simeone later admitted a personal mistake in selecting the player to start the final despite his recent injury.[80] Costa scored eight goals during the Champions League campaign, equalling the record held by Vavá since 1959 for most in a season by an Atlético player, and in his entire career was in the top ten Atlético players by goal average.[81] At the season's LFP Awards, he was nominated for the league's Best Forward, losing out to Cristiano Ronaldo.[82]
