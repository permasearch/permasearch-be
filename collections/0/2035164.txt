There were also some problems with early 2003 Police Interceptors. The newly designed steel wheels would rust prematurely, and the rack and pinion steering units would fail early (≤10,000 miles). This was not limited to the Police Interceptor; some 2004 Mercury Marauders were also affected. A recall, initiated on March 1, 2007 (07S48) affects the steel wheels used on 2003–05 Police Interceptors.[9]
