DI Roy Slater, a corrupt, ambitious police officer and much-reviled ex-schoolmate of Del Boy, has returned to Peckham, where he has been tasked with tracking down a stolen microwave. He meets Trigger and Boycie – both horrified by his return – in the Nag's Head, and announces that he has recently been promoted to Detective Inspector. He begins talking to Rodney, who is unaware that Slater is a police officer, and tells him that he is an old "friend" of Del's. Rodney invites Slater back to Nelson Mandela House, without informing Del.
