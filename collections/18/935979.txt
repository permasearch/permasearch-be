The Republic of UÅ¾ice was a short-lived liberated territory established by the Partisans and the first liberated territory in World War II Europe, organized as a military mini-state that existed in the autumn of 1941 in the west of occupied Serbia. By late 1944, the Belgrade Offensive swung in favour of the partisans in the civil war; the partisans subsequently gained control of Yugoslavia.[64] Following the Belgrade Offensive, the Syrmian Front was the last major military action of World War II in Serbia.
