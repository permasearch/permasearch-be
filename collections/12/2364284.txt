At Wimbledon, Bartoli made her Grand Slam breakthrough by advancing to her first grand slam final, after defeating top-seeded Justine Henin in the semifinal, in one of the biggest upsets in Wimbledon history.[21] Bartoli lost the first set, and claimed afterwards that the reason for her turnaround in the match was seeing Pierce Brosnan in the royal box and being determined to play well in front of one of her favourite actors.[citation needed] In the final, Bartoli lost to three-time former champion Venus Williams. As a result of her Wimbledon performance, she rose to a career high of No. 11 in the WTA rankings. At the US Open, Bartoli reached the fourth round for the first time by defeating world No. 25 Lucie Šafářová. In the fourth round, she lost to Grand Slam champion Serena Williams. At the Fortis Championships in Luxembourg, she reached her first semifinal since her Wimbledon run, but then lost to Daniela Hantuchová.
