Work on the tube was temporarily stopped in January 1956 after water from the Hudson River leaked into the New York side of the tunnel.[193] Almost immediately after the tube had been pumped dry, workers went on strike for a week, even though the ends of the bores were only about 350 feet (110Â m) away from being connected.[194] Construction was further disrupted by an air leakage on the New York side in May,[195] and a contractors' strike in June.[196] On June 28, 1956, the two sides were finally holed-through by the respective governors of each state. At this time, the last of the tube's 2,031 cast-iron rings had been laid.[197][186] Contractors then began placing tiles along the surface of the tube.[198] By November, the tube was nearly completed.[199] To accommodate the traffic for the new tube, the Port Authority opened the Lincoln Tunnel Expressway south to 30th Street in February 1957.[200]
