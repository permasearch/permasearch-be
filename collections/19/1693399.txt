Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps named West's debut as Ava Jerome as "Best New Character, Female" as part of his Best and Worst of 2013 list!. "This savvy soap veteran made Ava Jerome must-see soap TV whenever she walked into a room, and delivered her lines with such lethal undertones! We loved it … and Ava’s red-hot fling with the much younger Morgan Corinthos (Bryan Craig)! You go, Ava!," Fairman raved in his year-end review.[42] Daytime Confidential also listed West at number three on their list of 10 Best Female Soap Opera Entertainers of 2013, for her role as Ava Jerome. The site praised West's talent, praising, "Maura West recalled the brassy broads of Old Hollywood as mob queen Ava Jerome on General Hospital in 2013. We didn't think it was possible to love a character played by the actress more than we adored As The World Turns' Carly Snyder, but boy-oh-boy were we wrong!"[43] Head writer Ron Carlivati also praised West's portrayal of Ava, praising, "Now to see what she has brought to the character of Ava, it has just been amazing. It is so different than the character she played before, and what that shows me is … she can pretty much do anything."[13] Boston Herald praised West's performance, exclaiming, "Springfield native Maura West is mesmerizing as 'General Hospital’s' scheming Ava Jerome, sultry, sexy, vulnerable, vindictive — sometimes in the same scene. To think, this was only supposed to be a five-episode gig. If West hosted a pay-per-view in which she read the zip codes for the United States, she might make a fortune."[44]
