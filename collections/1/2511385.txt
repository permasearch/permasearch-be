The term "cult" is used in reference to devotion or dedication to a particular person or place.[98] For instance, within the Roman Catholic Church devotion to Mary, mother of Jesus is usually termed the "Cult of Mary".[99] It is also used in non-religious contexts to refer to fandoms devoted to television shows like The Prisoner, The X-Files, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.[100] In the United States, the term "cult" began to be used in a pejorative manner to refer to Spiritualism and Christian Science during the 1890s.[101] As commonly used, for instance in sensationalist tabloid articles, the term "cult" continues to have pejorative associations.[102]
