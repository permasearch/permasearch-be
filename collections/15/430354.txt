In January 2011, similar legislation again was introduced in the Arizona House of Representatives.[27] On April 14, 2011 the Arizona legislature passed a bill requiring presidential and vice presidential candidates to show the Arizona secretary of state proof that they are natural-born citizens. Such proof could be either a long-form birth certificate or at least two other forms of accepted proof, such as an early baptismal certificate, circumcision certificate or hospital birth record.[28] On April 18, Governor Jan Brewer vetoed the bill.[29]
