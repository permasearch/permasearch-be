In ancient China, most architecture was wooden, including the few known arch bridges from literature and one artistic depiction in stone-carved relief.[25][26][27] Therefore, the only surviving examples of architecture from the Han Dynasty (202 BC â€“ 220 AD) are rammed earth defensive walls and towers, ceramic roof tiles from no longer existent wooden buildings,[28][29][30] stone gate towers,[31][32] and underground brick tombs that, although featuring vaults, domes, and archways, were built with the support of the earth and were not free-standing.[33][34] China's oldest surviving stone arch bridge is the Anji Bridge, built between 595 and 605 during the Sui Dynasty; it is the oldest open-spandrel segmental arch bridge in stone.[35][36] However, the ancient Romans had virtually all of these components beforehand; for example, Trajan's Bridge had open spandrels built in wood on stone pillars.[37]
