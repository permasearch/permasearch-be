The fifth episode of the season, which aired on 2 October 2009, featured an interview with Leonie Fennell and Tony Donnelly, the mother and stepfather of Shane Clancy, a 22-year-old student involved in a murder-suicide in Bray, County Wicklow on 16 August 2009. Fennell revealed her son had swallowed a one-month supply of anti-depressants, had attempted suicide and been given another month's supply before he carried out the act.[43] The College of Psychiatrists in Ireland declined a request to take part in the discussion.[44] Father Fergus O'Donoghue, an associate of the Creane family whose son was murdered, later criticised the interview, saying they had been "exploited" and questioning why anti-depressants were used as an excuse.[44]
