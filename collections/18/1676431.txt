In his review of Super Smash Bros., GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann called Samus one of the characters that made Nintendo "what it is today."[85] Samus was ranked fifth on GameDaily's 2009 list of top characters in the Smash Bros. series,[86] while IGN ranked her as the third-best character for Super Smash Bros.[87] Her controversial portrayal in Metroid: Other M received mixed reactions. Unlike other Metroid games, where Samus took full advantage of weapons and abilities available, she deactivated most of them until Commander Adam Malkovich authorized their use, despite obvious uses for them.[88] G4 TV considered the portrayal of Samus as "sexist", stating that as she "cannot possibly wield the amount of power she possesses unless directed to by a man" and that her anxiety attack cannot be reconciled with her previous portrayals.[89] The A.V. Club echoed the misgivings about Samus's immaturity, petulant behavior, and misguided loyalty.[90] According to GamePro, while the story and Samus' monologues did not compel them, "it helped contextualize her entire existence" which developed the character to "an actual human being who's using the vastness of space to try and put some distance between herself and the past."[91] 1UP.com's Justin Hayward found the portrayal "lifeless and boring" and "nonsensical".[92] GamesRadar wrote that Other M painted Samus, widely considered a strong female lead character, as "an unsure, insecure woman who desperately wants the approval of her former [male] commanding officer."[93] Game Informer listed her 1st on their list of the top ten "dorks" of 2010, citing her "lame backstory" in Other M.[94]
