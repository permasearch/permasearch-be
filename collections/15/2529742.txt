Straight edge is a subculture of hardcore punk whose adherents refrain from using alcohol, tobacco and other recreational drugs, in reaction to the excesses of punk subculture.[55][56] For some, this extends to refraining from engaging in promiscuous sex, following a vegetarian or vegan diet, and/or not using caffeine or prescription drugs.[55] The term straight edge was adopted from the 1981 song "Straight Edge" by the hardcore punk band Minor Threat.[57]
