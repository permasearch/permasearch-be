The second generation, phase I ZB Viper was being sold in Europe during 2005â€“2006, the first model to be sold as a Dodge, as part of Chrysler's new sales strategy for the European market. In the United Kingdom it is referred to as a Viper, but it is actually sold as the Dodge SRT-10, as the Viper name is a registered trademark in the UK.[44] Prodrive currently handles the importation and modification of Vipers to meet European laws.
