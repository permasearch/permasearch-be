The horns are revealed to force people around Ig to tell him their darkest secrets and desires, which, under Ig's bidding, they act upon. Ig goes to visit his parents, but under the power of the horns his mother reveals that she doesn't want him as her son, while his father tells him that he is worthless without Merrin and that a friend of his helped him burn down the lab where DNA tests were being conducted. Ig goes to a bar, where he goads the reporters into a brawl and attempts to find evidence that he didn't kill Merrin. Several people confess their deepest secrets, and the bartender burns down the building.
