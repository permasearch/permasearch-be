In the novel, Muslims are portrayed as the enemies although the British had already started ruling Bengal. Chattopadhyay wrote this novel after Indian Rebellion of 1857 when Hindus and Muslims had fought the British together, while himself holding the post of Deputy Collector under the British Raj.[5] It has been alleged by leftist and Islamist historians that Bankimâ€™s accounts in this novel could only be explained by his political incorrectness around the facts of Iislamist atrocity against non-Muslims and secular Muslims.
