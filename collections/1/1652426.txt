I am, of course, aware of this point, put forward by the young constitutional lawyer Charles Farran in 1967 and widely publicised at the time, but not accepted by the Queen or the Privy Council, as subsequent approvals (or lack of approval) show. In the UK if the interpretation of an Act of Parliament is disputed one considers the original intention of the Act and that, in this case, is very clear.
