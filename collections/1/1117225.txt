Another sub-plot is that Fran had been saving around $250,000,000,000,000,000 as a get-out fund for her relationship with Bob, stating that it is "hard to love someone for 30 years straight." She admits to Bob that she once thought of running away - like Pip had just done - but stayed together for the sake of their children. Fran then says that she now saves it for them to treat themselves. She asks Bob where he'd most like to go and he replies Nuremberg Trials. To his surprise, she agrees to go, yet they never do.
