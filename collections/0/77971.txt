The rhyme was first recorded by James Orchard Halliwell as an English children's game in the mid-19th century.[1] He noted that there was a similar game with the lyrics 'Here we go round the bramble bush'. The bramble bush may be an earlier version, possibly changed because of the difficulty of the alliteration, since mulberries do not grow on bushes.[2]
