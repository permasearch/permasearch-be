Hitchcock returned several times to cinematic devices such as suspense,[158] the audience as voyeur,[159] and his well-known "MacGuffin," a plot device that is essential to the characters on the screen, but is irrelevant to the audience. Thus, the MacGuffin was always hazily described (in North by Northwest, Leo G. Carroll describes James Mason as an "importer-exporter"). A central theme of Hitchcock's films was murder and the psychology behind it.[160][161] His work often features the theme of fugitives on the run alongside "icy blonde" female characters.[156][157]
