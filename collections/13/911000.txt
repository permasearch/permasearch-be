Development of the game began in 2001, and lasted 22 months.[3][4] Early in development, a total of 40 dinosaurs were planned for inclusion in the game. This number was later reduced to 25 due to scheduling issues, as well as the developers choosing to focus more on fewer dinosaurs that were well-known from the Jurassic Park films. Marine reptiles and pterosaurs were among those removed from the game.[4] The developers conducted research into the behavior of dinosaurs whose behavior had not been specified in the films. Bird sounds were used for some dinosaurs that did not appear in the films.[3]
