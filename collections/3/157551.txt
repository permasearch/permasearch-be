The overland route through the Wadi Hammamat from the Nile to the Red Sea was known as early as predynastic times;[8] drawings depicting Egyptian reed boats have been found along the path dating to 4000 BC.[9] Ancient cities dating to the First Dynasty of Egypt arose along both its Nile and Red Sea junctions,[8] testifying to the route's ancient popularity. It became a major route from Thebes to the Red Sea port of Elim, where travelers then moved on to either Asia, Arabia or the Horn of Africa.[8] Records exist documenting knowledge of the route among Senusret I, Seti, Ramesses IV and also, later, the Roman Empire, especially for mining.[10]
