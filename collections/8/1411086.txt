The music video of "Burn It Down" received critical acclaim. Perri Tomkiewicz of Billboard praised the music video of "Burn It Down" as "simple yet striking...[it] displays the group's new electro influences without relinquishing their long-standing and rebellious rock roots."[44] Mark Graham of VH1 compared the video to the band's previous music video for "Waiting for the End", as well as "the undeniable combination of the organic and the mechanical present in the setting in which the band performs" of the film Alien.[45] James Montgomery of MTV noticed the band was "pushed to the absolute limit ... to the point where, when the band bursts into flames at the end, you can't help wondering if they didn't just spontaneously combust."[39] Marc Hogan of Spin noted that the video "soundtracks an emotion-wracked live performance accompanied by — you guessed it — fiery visual effects."[46] Chad Childers of Loudwire described the video as "a not-so-standard performance piece with the band members in a sweltering room seemingly filled with light and energy that only intensifies as the video progresses."[47] David Greenwald of MTV echoed similar comments, calling it a "darker, industrial offering, with trippy sci-fi special effects and a Matrix-y all-black wardrobe palette."[48]
