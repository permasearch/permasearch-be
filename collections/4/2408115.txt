"This extraordinary film tells the remarkable story of the entire Corps of Discovery -- not just the two famous Captains, but the young army men, French-Canadian boatmen, Clark's African-American slave, and the Shoshone woman named Sacagawea, who brought along her infant son. Journey with them all, across a breath-taking landscape in an unforgettable experience that explores both the history -- and promise -- of America."
