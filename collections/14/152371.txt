After Telfair and West were traded during the offseason of the 2007â€“08 season, Rondo secured a spot in the starting lineup, starting in every game. Surrounded by All-Stars Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Ray Allen, he quickly became a steady, consistent player.[33] In his 77 games played, he averaged 10.6 points per game (ppg), 5.1 assists per game (apg) and 4.2 rebounds per game (rpg).[31] His role as a playmaker reflected in him leading the team in assists and steals. In a game against the New Jersey Nets, Rondo suffered a lower back injury late in the third quarter, forcing him to miss the next four games.[34] He made his successful return from injury and to the starting lineup in a road win against the New York Knicks.[35] A week later, he matched his career-high against the Miami Heat,[36] and then scored a career-high 24 points in a home game against the Los Angeles Clippers the following month.[37] During the All-Star break, he was selected to play on the Sophomore Team in the T-Mobile Rookie Challenge and Youth Jam.[38] Following the All-Star weekend, Rondo recorded a career-high 16 assists in a home victory against the Charlotte Bobcats.[39] Despite his solid rookie year, there was much speculation about Boston needing a veteran point guard.[40] In March, they signed veteran point guard Sam Cassell as a free agent to serve as a backup.[40] The Celtics' best single-season improvement in NBA history earned them the number one seed in the Eastern Conference Playoffs.
