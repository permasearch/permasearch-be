The character's most prominent story has been the depiction of bipolar disorder. Zosia begins to drink excessively, use drugs and her behaviour becomes uncontrollable. Through her eventual diagnosis the show explored stigma attached to the illness and treatment involving lithium. The story has received acclaim from mental health charities and organisations. The character has been well received by critics. The Sun's Colin Robertson branded her the "feisty junior doctor". A South Wales Echo journalist praised her integrity regarding patient care. But one Daily Post reviewer felt that Zosia and Guy's storyline became "far-fetched". Arfwedson chose to leave the role in 2017, and made her departure in the nineteenth series episode "Veil of Tears â€“ Part Two", broadcast on 26 September 2017, before making a one episode appearance in January 2018.
