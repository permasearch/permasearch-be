Along with the Motorsport Engineering Research Center of the Foothills Campus, the Department of Mechanical Engineering also facilitates the Engines and Energy conversion lab, now going through an expansion to become the Powerhouse Energy Institute.[79] At this lab, massive internal combustion generators are investigated and made more efficient. The lab is also home to a CSU company developing Biofuel derived of algae. Laser Ignition Spark Plugs and Clean burning cookstoves are examples to technologies developed from this lab.
