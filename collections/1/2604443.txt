In Zoroastrian tradition, Sraosha is one of the three guardians of the Chinvat bridge, the "bridge of judgement" that all souls of the dead must cross. Although Sraosha is only one of the three divinities that pass judgement (the other two being Rashnu and Mithra), Sraosha alone accompanies the soul on their journey across the bridge.
