The Laws of the Game set out the basic equipment which must be worn by all players in Law 4: The Players' Equipment. Five separate items are specified: shirt (also known as a jersey), shorts, socks (also known as stockings), footwear and shin pads.[1]  Goalkeepers are allowed to wear tracksuit bottoms instead of shorts.[2]
