The so-called deed to secure debt is a security instrument used in the state of Georgia. Unlike a mortgage, a security deed is an actual conveyance of real property - without equity of redemption - in security of a debt. Upon the execution of such a deed, title passes to the grantee or beneficiary (usually lender), however the grantor (borrower) maintains equitable title to use and enjoy the conveyed land subject to compliance with debt obligations.
