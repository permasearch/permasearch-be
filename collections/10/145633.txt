Coming out of the German and Austrian film tradition, May was well versed in German Expressionism, and he introduced visual elements of this genre to the film. In one example, when Hepzibah descends the staircase, she casts a stark shadow against the wall. This is a visual doppelgänger, indicating that the character has two aspects which will be revealed in the film (the happy, youthful girl and the bitter, repressed spinster). May also used mise-en-scène, such as window panes or shadows, to show that the characters are trapped by Seven Gables or by circumstance.[18]
