- Update: Actually,there is a BP gas station on Hall Rd in Utica, MI. that sells liquor and they have Everclear in half-pints. The real deal, 190 proof grain alcohol I was surprised when I first saw them there. They had a few of them sitting on the counter right up front by the cash register and more on the shelves with the rest of the half-pints directly behind the register. I couldn't believe it, because I had always thought/been told that it was illegal in this State. It is located at 8100 Hall Rd, Utica, MI 48317. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 2601:406:C202:7591:82A:7DEE:F0F0:4077 (talk) 05:01, 29 December 2017 (UTC)
