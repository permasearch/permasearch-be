The anime and manga series Ikki Tousen features a wide and diverse cast of characters created by Yuji Shiozaki. The characters as well as their names are loosely based upon the characters from the Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. For example, the character Hakufu Sonsaku is based on the historical figure Sun Ce (Sonsaku being the Japanese name for Sun Ce, Hakufu being the Japanese pronunciation for his courtesy name Bofu). The series revolves around Hakufu Sonsaku, a female fighter who attends Nanyo Academy with her male cousin Koukin Shuyu, where seven rival schools fight each other for supremacy in the Kanto region.
