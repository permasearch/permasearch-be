People have used olive presses since Greeks first began pressing olives over 5,000 years ago.[citation needed] Roman olive presses survive to the present time, with a notable collection present at Volubilis in Morocco.[2] An olive press works by applying pressure to olive paste to separate the liquid oil and vegetation water from the solid material. The oil and vegetation water are then separated by standard decantation.
