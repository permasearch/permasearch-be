From 1978 to 2008, many flights to and from the United States used Gatwick because of restrictions on the use of Heathrow implemented in the Bermuda II agreement between the UK and the US.[17] US Airways, Gatwick's last remaining US carrier, ended service from Gatwick on 30 March 2013.[18] This leaves Gatwick without a scheduled US airline for the first time in 40 years.[19]
