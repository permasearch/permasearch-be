The song also became widely known in the Soviet Union in a 1943 adaptation by the popular singer and jazz band leader Leonid Utyosov, titled "Bombers". The translation of the lyrics into Russian is broadly accurate, but the term "prayer" is rendered as "word of honor".[5] This Russian idiom means "only just managing", "just holding on", or "in poor condition".
