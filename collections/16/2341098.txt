In this reactive region, not only is an electromagnetic wave being radiated outward into far space but there is a "reactive" component to the electromagnetic field, meaning that the nature of the field around the antenna is sensitive to EM absorption in this region, and reacts to it. In contrast, this is not true for absorption far from the antenna, which has no effect on the transmitter or antenna near field.
