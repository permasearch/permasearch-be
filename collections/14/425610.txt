In 2015, former Rangers player Brian Laudrup said that the Old Firm topped all of the rivalries he had played in,[30] which included the Milan derby and the Fiorentina-Juventus meetings[31] in Italy; ex-Celtic striker Henrik Larsson, who experienced El Cl√°sico in Spain and De Klassieker in the Netherlands, has made similar comments.[3] Jim Bett, who had already played in Iceland prior to joining Rangers in the 1980s and thereafter moved to Belgium, stated that he declined an opportunity to return to the Ibrox club due to the sectarianism associated with life as a footballer in the west of Scotland, in contrast to his positive experiences living abroad.[32]
