Pantheism is the view that everything is part of an all-encompassing, immanent God.[9] All forms of reality may then be considered either modes of that Being, or identical with it.[10] Some hold that pantheism is a non-religious philosophical position. To them, pantheism is the view that the Universe (in the sense of the totality of all existence) and God are identical (implying a denial of the personality and transcendence of God).[11]
