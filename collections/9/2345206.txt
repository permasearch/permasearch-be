Groundhogs will occasionally eat snails, insects and baby birds they come upon by accident.[40] An adult groundhog will eat more than a pound of vegetation daily.[41] In early June, woodchucks' metabolism slows, food intake decreases, their weight increases by as much as 100% and fat deposits are produced upon which they will live during hibernation and late winter.[42] Instead of storing food, groundhogs stuff themselves to survive the winter without eating.[43] Thought not to drink water, groundhogs are reported to obtain needed liquids from the juices of food-plants, aided by their sprinkling with rain or dew.[44][45][46]
