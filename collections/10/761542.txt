Zika is a mosquito-borne disease. The resurgence of Aedes aegypti's worldwide distribution over the past 2â€“3 decades makes it one of the most widely distributed mosquito species.[96] In 2015, Aedes albopictus was present in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions of the Americas, reaching as far north as the Great Lakes of North America and, internationally, living alongside Aedes aegypti in some tropical and subtropical regions.[13]
