In the early 1970s, the Picc-Vic tunnel project proposed building an underground station, Piccadilly Low Level, under the station.[18] The scheme proposed creating a direct rail link between Piccadilly and Manchester Victoria by building a tunnel and several underground stations under the city centre. The project was cancelled because of the high cost causing transport planners to turn to light rail as a lower-cost option; the stations were eventually linked by the Manchester Metrolink system that opened in the early 1990s. The street-level tramway across the city centre linked the stations and two converted rail lines to Altrincham and Bury. The tram stop in the station's undercroft opened in 1992.[8][13]
