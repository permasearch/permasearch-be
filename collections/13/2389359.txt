In the early 1990s Viz Media had planned to release an English-language version of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure in North America as "The Strange Adventures of Jojo", evident by an advertisement in their newsletter at the time, Viz-In.[22] It is suspected the plans were canned after Baoh, another series by Hirohiko Araki, sold poorly. The series was brought up again for talks in 2002, for release as individual monthly chapters.[22] However, by this time, that publication format for manga was becoming less popular in North America.
