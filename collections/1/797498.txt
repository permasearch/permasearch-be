On April 13, 1592, the First Division of the Japanese invasion army, consisting of 7,000 men led by Konishi Yukinaga,[141] left Tsushima in the morning, and arrived outside the port city of Busan in the evening.[142] Korean naval intelligence had detected the Japanese fleet, but Won Gyun, the Right Naval Commander of Gyeongsang, misidentified the fleet as trading vessels on a mission.[143] A later report of the arrival of an additional 100 Japanese vessels raised his suspicions, but the general did nothing about it.[143] Sō Yoshitoshi landed alone on the Busan shore to ask the Koreans for a safe passage to China one last time; the Koreans refused as they had previously done, and Sō Yoshitoshi laid siege to the city. Konishi Yukinaga attacked the nearby fort of Dadaejin the next morning.[142] Japanese accounts claim that the battles resulted in the complete annihilation of Korean forces (one claims 8,500 deaths, and another, 30,000 heads), while a Korean account claims that the Japanese themselves took significant losses before sacking the city.[144] Chǒng Pal, the Korean commander at Busan was killed by a Japanese bullet, and with his death, Korean morale collapsed.[145] In the meantime Konishi took the fortress of Dadejin, where under heavy volleys of supporting fire, the Japanese were able to place ladders against the walls, and took the fortress.[146] Konishi ordered that no prisoners be taken, and the entire garrison was massacred.[146] Konishi and the First Division then turned north, marching to take Seoul.[146] The disciplined Japanese brought down a rain of bullets that was lethal to anyone not taking cover.[146] On the morning of May 25, 1592, the First Division arrived at Dongnae eupseong.[144] Konishi sent a message to Song Sanghyǒn, the commander of the Dongnae fortress, explaining to his him that his objective was the conquest of China and if the Koreans would just submit, their lives would be spared. Song replied "It is easy for me to die, but difficult to let you pass", which led Konishi to order that no prisoners be taken to punish Song for his defiance.[146] The resulting Siege of Dongnae lasted twelve hours, killed 3,000, and resulted in Japanese victory.[147] The Japanese took no prisoners and killed everyone at Dongnae, civilian and military, even killing all of the cats and dogs of Dongnae.[146] Konishi's intention to terrify the Koreans into submission by showing them what the price of resisting Japan was, but he instead stimulated Korean resistance, as ordinary Koreans were enraged at an enemy who invaded their nation without provocation and behaved so brutally.[146]
