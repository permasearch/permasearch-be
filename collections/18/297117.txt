Nichols is first seen in the first episode.[5] She becomes friends with the series' protagonist Piper Chapman (played by Taylor Schilling) within the first few episodes. Nichols had a sexual relationship with Lorna Morello which ended in the fifth episode because Morello said that she wanted to remain loyal to her fiancÃ© and complained that Nichols was "making her feel like a cave".[6] Galina "Red" Reznikov (played by Kate Mulgrew) is a close friend and 'mother figure' to Nichols, however, the two have a disagreement when Red cuts off fellow inmate Tricia Miller (played by Madeline Brewer) and allows her to be sent to solitary confinement.[7] Nichols retaliates against Red by reporting to a correctional officer exactly how Red manages to smuggle contraband into the prison.[8] In the final episode of the season, Nichols is seen to be seducing Alex Vause (played by Laura Prepon), who is a love interest of Chapman.[9]
