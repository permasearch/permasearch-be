Zoe (Kate Mara) receives a call from Frank, who wants her to write a story blaming Spinella (Al Sapienza) for the brick incident. Public opinion turns against Spinella and the union, who tries to figure out a way to strike back. Meanwhile, with a newly-sober Russo (Corey Stoll) agreeing to run for governor of Pennsylvania, Frank tasks Claire with drafting a bill that will create jobs in Peter's district. Claire agrees in exchange for getting CWIâ€™s water filters through Sudanese customs, which Durant (Jayne Atkinson) has put a hold on. On Frank's instruction, Doug orchestrates a fake protest throwing foam bricks at Spinella, causing the striking teachers to retaliate with violence. In the wake of the public outcry, Spinella's media relations team suggests a televised debate against Frank, to which he reluctantly agrees.
