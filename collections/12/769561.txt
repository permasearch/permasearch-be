Originally titled as "What Doesn't Kill You", "Stronger" was written by JÃ¶rgen Elofsson, Ali Tamposi, David Gamson, and Greg Kurstin in September 2010.[2] In an interview with American Songwriter, Tamposi revealed that the song was inspired by the Friedrich Nietzsche adage ("That which does not kill us makes us stronger") that her mother told her as advice.[2] Although Tamposi found the phrase saccharine, she submitted it as an idea to Elofsson and Gamson during their writing sessions. Elofsson originally intended "Stronger" for Leona Lewis, who turned it down in the process.[3] Tamposi's manager, Tom Maffei, then had one of his producers, Matty Trump, produce a demo track, later  pitched to RCA A&R executive Jeff Aldrich, who gave the song to Clarkson. Tamposi revealed that Clarkson had also altered a lyric from the track.[2] Aldrich had then commissioned Greg Kurstin, whom Clarkson wanted to collaborate with, to produce and add additional writing to the final version. Kurstin recalled, "I rethought the music part of it, I guess. It had a different tempo, beat, chords, and I kinda just came up with that guitar riff that goes into the verse, and that was the first thing that I kinda contributed just changed the feel of the song."[4] The song's uplifting theme of empowerment led Clarkson to name her fifth studio album Stronger.[5] saying that it is one of her favorite songs in the album, she said, "Everybody loves the message 'What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.' It's a perfect representation of my life."[6]
