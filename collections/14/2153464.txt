The Gospel of John (John 3:23) refers to Enon near Salim as one place where John the Baptist baptized people, "because there was much water there".[16][17] Separately, John 1:28 states that John the Baptist was baptizing in "Bethany beyond the Jordan".[16] This is not the village Bethany just east of Jerusalem, but is generally considered to be the town Bethany, also called Bethabara in Perea on the Eastern bank of the Jordan near Jericho.[17] In the 3rd century Origen, who moved to the area from Alexandria, suggested Bethabara as the location.[25] In the 4th century, Eusebius of Caesarea stated that the location was on the west bank of the Jordan, and following him, the early Byzantine Madaba Map shows Bethabara as (Βέθαβαρά).[25]
