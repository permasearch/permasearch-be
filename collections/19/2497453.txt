The Chairman, also known as Control, is the head of Charon Industries, a company which specializes in military hardware. In the finale of season 12, the Reds and Blues acknowledge his true identity, Control. He then receives a threat from them, after which we learn that he is in possession of the Meta's helmet. He and the Director of Project Freelancer are heard in the introductions of most Reconstruction episodes, with the Chairman suspecting him of criminal acts with his experiments. He eventually presses charges against the Director and sends officers to place him under arrest in Reconstruction's epilogue.
