Days later, Carlos escaped while being transported to prison. Anna was certain that Paul had had a hand in staging the accident and Carlos' subsequent escape. Anna joined in on the manhunt and found Carly hiding at the piers. She tried to arrest him, but he managed to overpower her and knock the gun out of her hand. Carlos threw Anna into a meat locker then fled. Trapped and injured, Anna dreamed a vision of Duke. Duke begged Anna not to waste her life seeking justice for him. He wanted her to focus on the time they'd had together rather than trying to change something that couldn't be undone. After Duke vanished, Anna woke up.
