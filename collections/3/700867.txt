The details of a decomposition process are not always well defined, but some of the process is understood. A lot of energy is needed to break bonds. Since all decomposition reactions break apart the bonds holding it together in order to produce into its simpler, basic parts, the reactions would require some form of this energy in varying degrees. Because of this fundamental rule, it's known that most of these reactions are endothermic, although exceptions do exist.
