Research dietitians may focus on social sciences or health services research, for example, investigate the impact of health policies or behaviour change, or evaluate program effectiveness.[22] They may survey foodservice systems management in order to guide quality improvement. Some research dietitians study the biochemical aspects of nutrient interaction within the body.[24] In universities, they also may have teaching responsibilities. Some clinical dietitians' roles involve research in addition to their patients care workload.
