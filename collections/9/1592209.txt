In the 10th century, the rivalry between Sumatran Srivijaya and the Javanese Medang kingdom became more intense and hostile. The animosity was probably caused by Srivijaya's effort to reclaim the Sailendra lands in Java or by Medang's aspiration to challenge Srivijaya domination in the region. In East Java, the Anjukladang inscription dated from 937 mentioned about infiltration attack from Malayu — which refer to a Srivijayan attack upon Medang Kingdom of East Java. The villagers of Anjuk Ladang was awarded for their service and merit on assisting the king's army — under the leadership of Mpu Sindok, on repelling invading Malayu (Sumatra) forces, subsequently a jayastambha (victory monument) was erected in their honor.
