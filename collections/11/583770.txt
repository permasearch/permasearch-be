Windows NT family includes an installation API and an associated service called Windows Installer. Microsoft provides a bare minimum of tools required to create installers using Windows Installer in the freely available Windows SDK. Third party tools may supporting create installers using this API to speed the process. Examples include InstallShield (Flexera Software) and WiX (Outercurve Foundation). Installation authoring tools that do not rely on Windows Installer include Wise Installation Studio (Wise Solutions, Inc.), Installer VISE (MindVision Software), Visual Installer (SamLogic), NSIS, Clickteam, InnoSetup and InstallSimple.
