Virginia's culture was popularized and spread across America and the South by figures such as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Robert E. Lee. Their homes in Virginia represent the birthplace of America and the South.[205] Modern Virginia culture has many sources, and is part of the culture of the Southern United States.[206] The Smithsonian Institution divides Virginia into nine cultural regions.[207]
