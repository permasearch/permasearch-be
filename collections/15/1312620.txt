May recorded a cover version of God Save the Queen, the British national anthem, in 1974 before their Sheer Heart Attack tour. He played a guide piano which was edited out later and added several layers of guitars.[11] After the song was completed it was played as an outro at virtually every Queen concert. When recording the track May played a rough version on piano for Roy Thomas Baker. He called his own skills on the piano sub-par at the time.[11] He performed the song live on the roof of Buckingham Palace for the Queen's golden jubilee in 2002.[24]
