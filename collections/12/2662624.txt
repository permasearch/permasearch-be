On the evening of 25 February 2006, forensic teams, accompanied by armed police officers, also raided a house in Southborough near Tunbridge Wells. On the afternoon of the next day, Kent Police challenged two men who then fled in a blue BMW 3 Series coupe on Marine Parade in Tankerton, near Whitstable. Police marksmen then appeared to shoot out at least one tyre bringing the car to a halt and arresting the driver and one other man nearby. Other reports have suggested the police may have in fact have used a "stinger" device.[10]
