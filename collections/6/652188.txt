Legio Patria Nostra (in French La LÃ©gion est notre Patrie, in English The Legion is our Fatherland) is the Latin motto of the Foreign Legion.[57] The adoption of the Foreign Legion as a new "fatherland" does not imply the repudiation by the legionnaire of his original nationality. The Foreign Legion is required to obtain the agreement of any legionnaire before he is placed in any situation where he might have to serve against his country of birth.
