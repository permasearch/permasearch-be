If the environmental lapse rate is less than the moist adiabatic lapse rate, the air is absolutely stable â€” rising air will cool faster than the surrounding air and lose buoyancy. This often happens in the early morning, when the air near the ground has cooled overnight. Cloud formation in stable air is unlikely.
