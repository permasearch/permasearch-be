In 1933 the Fianna Fáil party, led by Éamon de Valera, won the Irish general election, and began to put forward a series of reforms intended to more strongly assert Irish independence, including the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1935, which received the royal assent on 10 April 1935. This was the first example of a Commonwealth member country passing legislation to create its own citizenship distinct from the status of "British subject", and it expressly repealed (s. 33) both the British nationality legislation and common law carried over at independence.
