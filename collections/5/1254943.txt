Gavin Hood was announced as director of the project in July 2007 for a 2008 release.[53] Previously, X-Men and X2 director Bryan Singer and X-Men: The Last Stand director Brett Ratner were interested in returning to the franchise,[54][55] while Alexandre Aja and Len Wiseman also wanted the job.[56][57] Zack Snyder, who was approached for The Last Stand, turned down this film because he was directing Watchmen.[58] Jackman saw parallels between Logan and the main character in Hood's previous film Tsotsi.[12] Hood explained that while he was not a comic book fan, he "realized that the character of Wolverine, I think his great appeal lies in the fact that he's someone who in some ways, is filled with a great deal of self-loathing by his own nature and he's constantly at war with his own nature".[59] The director described the film's themes as focusing on Wolverine's inner struggle between his animalistic savagery and noble human qualities. Hood enjoyed the previous films, but set out to give the spin-off a different feel.[60] Hood also suggested to make the implied blood relation of Wolverine and Sabretooth into them explicitly being half brothers, as it would help "build up the emotional power of the film".[61] In October, Fox announced a May 1, 2009, release date and the X-Men Origins prefix.[14]
