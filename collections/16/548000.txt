If the narrator remains silent on the ancestors of Mr Bennet, we know a little more about the family of his wife. Mrs. Bennet, born Gardiner and married for twenty-three years (at the start of the novel), is the daughter of an attorney of Meryton in Hertfordshire. She has a brother and a sister, both married. Though equally vulgar, ignorant, thoughtless, tasteless and gossipy, the marriages of the two sisters have resulted in them revolving in different circles (one married a member of the local gentry, the other is wed to one of her late father's law clerks), while their naturally genteel brother has gone on to acquire an education and a higher social status in a respectable line of trade in London.[15]
