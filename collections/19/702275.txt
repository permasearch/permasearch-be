After the first series ended, ITV announced that Broadchurch would return for a second series.[70] The show's creator, Chris Chibnall, told The Daily Mirror in the summer of 2013 that "the focus of the next series will be on how the shattered community rebuilds itself after the grisly events" of series one.[71] Series one actor Will Mellor, who does not appear in series two,[72] strongly implied in an interview that a new murder would not be the focus of the second series,[71] while David Tennant told the Associated Press that the series would go in a "very unexpected direction" which he called "as gripping as the first season."[73] Chibnall said he mapped out the show's plot and characters on several whiteboards in his office. "You have to be very methodical," he said about plotting Broadchurch. "It's like a mathematical puzzle where you put all these blocks together and move them around for the most satisfying thing."[74] Chibnall ended series two with what he described as "the cheekiest cliffhanger yet â€“ a real shocker."[75]
