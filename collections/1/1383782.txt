Beginning in the late 1990s, Landing Support Battalions (which at the time were the only units authorized to wear the red patch) and their respective Motor Transport Battalions merged to create Transportation Support Battalions (TSB). 1st LSB and 7th MTB merged to create 1st TSB, 2nd LSB and 8th MTB merged to create 2nd TSB, and 3rd LSB and 9th MTB merged to create 3rd TSB. 4th Landing Support Battalion, a reserve unit, remained under the command of 4th Force Service Support Group (FSSG). Subordinate units such as Transportation Support detachments and Landing Support detachments attached to MEU Service Support Groups (MSSG) were also authorized to wear the patch.
