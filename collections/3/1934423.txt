Greenacres was built in the 1920s in Beverly Hills, one of Los Angeles's all-white planned communities.[14] The area had restrictive covenants prohibiting non-whites (this also included Jews[15]) from living there unless they were in the employment of a white resident (typically as a domestic servant).[16]:57 In 1940, Lloyd supported a neighborhood improvement association in Beverly Hills that attempted to enforce the all-white covenant in court after a number of black actors and businessmen had begun buying properties in the area. However, in his decision, federal judge Thurmond Clarke dismissed the action stating that it was time that "members of the Negro race are accorded, without reservations or evasions, the full rights guaranteed to them under the 14th amendment."[17] In 1948 the United States Supreme Court declared in Shelley v. Kraemer that all racially restrictive covenants in the United States were unenforceable.[18]
