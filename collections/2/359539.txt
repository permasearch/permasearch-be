The initiative was named after United States Secretary of State George Marshall, who served as the United States Army Chief of Staff during WWII. The plan had bipartisan support in Washington, where the Republicans controlled Congress and the Democrats controlled the White House with Harry S. Truman as president. The Plan was largely the creation of State Department officials, especially William L. Clayton and George F. Kennan, with help from the Brookings Institution, as requested by Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.[5] Marshall spoke of an urgent need to help the European recovery in his address at Harvard University in June 1947.[2] The purpose of the Marshall Plan was to aid in the economic recovery of nations after WWII and to reduce the influence of communist parties within them. In order to combat the effects of the Marshall Plan, the USSR developed its own economic plan, known as the Molotov Plan. It was not as effective as the Marshall Plan, and in some ways contradictory to Eastern Bloc countries that served alongside the Axis powers in WWII.[6]
