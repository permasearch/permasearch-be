The bridge is a dual, tied arch bridge or bowstring bridge. It has a pair of continuous, differently-sized structural steel arches with suspended precast concrete decking[2][4][9] and one asymmetrically placed river pier. The tapering arches with a trapezoidal box section are fabricated from weathering steel plate.[10] The arches both bifurcate within the spans to form a double rib over the river pier.[19][20][21] A reflex piece between the two arches holds them together[10] making the two arches one continuous curve. No other bridge is known to have quite the same design.[2][4]
