Devotions to Mary are part of Catholic piety but are distinct from the worship of God.[136] Practices include prayers and Marian art, music, and architecture. Several liturgical Marian feasts are celebrated throughout the Church Year and she is honoured with many titles such as Queen of Heaven. Pope Paul VI called her Mother of the Church because, by giving birth to Christ, she is considered to be the spiritual mother to each member of the Body of Christ.[134] Because of her influential role in the life of Jesus, prayers and devotions such as the Hail Mary, the Rosary, the Salve Regina and the Memorare are common Catholic practices.[137] Pilgrimages to the sites of several Marian apparitions affirmed by the church, such as Lourdes, FÃ¡tima, and Guadalupe,[138] are also popular Catholic devotions.[139]
