In coverb constructions, the negator may come before the coverb (preposition) or before the full verb, the latter being more emphatic. In constructions with a passive marker, the negator precedes that marker; similarly, in comparative constructions, the negator precedes the bǐ phrase (unless the verb is further qualified by 更 gèng "even more", in which case the negator may follow the gèng to produce the meaning "even less").[34]
