When the British departed from the Indian subcontinent in 1947, they offered the various princely states in the sub-continent the option of acceding to either India or Pakistan, or staying on as an independent state.[citation needed] As stated by Sardar Patel at a press conference in January 1948, "As you are all aware, on the lapse of Paramountcy every Indian State became a separate independent entity."[14] In India, a small number of states, including Hyderabad, declined to join the new dominion.[15][16] In the case of Pakistan, accession happened far more slowly.[17] Hyderabad had been part of the calculations of all-India political parties since the 1930s.[18] The leaders of the new Union of India were wary of a Balkanization of India if Hyderabad was left independent.[8]:223[not in citation given]
