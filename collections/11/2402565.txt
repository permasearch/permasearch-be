In order to solve for the     2 ( N − 1 ) − ( R − 1 )   {\displaystyle 2(N-1)-(R-1)}   unknowns, there must be     2 ( N − 1 ) − ( R − 1 )   {\displaystyle 2(N-1)-(R-1)}   equations that do not introduce any new unknown variables. The possible equations to use are power balance equations, which can be written for real and reactive power for each bus. The real power balance equation is:
