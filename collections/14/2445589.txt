Judges can use their equitable powers to dismiss a UCL claim or deny injunctive relief.[44] For example, in competitor-vs.-competitor lawsuits, the defendant may assert unclean hands if it believes the plaintiff has engaged in serious misconduct that relates to the subject of relief being sought. In other words, a “plaintiff must not behave inequitably with respect to the rights being asserted in the case.” [45] Because the UCL is a strict liability statute, other equitable defenses such as “good faith, mistake of law and lack of wrongful intent are generally inapplicable [to] a UCL action.” [46]
