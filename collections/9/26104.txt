The kidnappers move Cheryl and Stan to the ship at the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino which they plan to blow up. Soon afterwards, Hart, Fuller and Joel arrive at the Oasis Drag club where they end up singing Tina Turner songs and are told by a Dolly Parton contestant where Cheryl and Stan are being held. It is then up to Hart to save the day once more, but this time with the help of Agent Fuller.
