The creators also had to address why Lex Luthor would socialize with young people. They created a loneliness in the character which they felt would drive him to reach out to the teenagers,[4] a loneliness echoed in Clark and Lana.[3] Gough and Millar wanted a parallel to the Kents and created Lionel Luthor, Lex's father, whom they saw as conducting an "experiment in extreme parenting."[4] They wanted a younger Kent couple, to be involved in Clark's life and help him on his journey.[3] Chloe Sullivan (another character created for the series) was considered the "outsider" the show needed to ensure that someone would notice the strange happenings in Smallville[4] rather than a "precursor to Lois Lane".[3]
