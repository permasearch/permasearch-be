Gilmore meets Shooter McGavin, who sees him as a detriment to golf's etiquette. Though Gilmore has a powerful drive, his putting is terrible, and his outbursts along with a lack of etiquette draw the attention of Tour Commissioner Doug Thompson, who tries to expel him from the tour. However, public relations head Virginia Venit convinces Thompson to reconsider, citing higher TV ratings, attendance, drawing more youthful sponsors, and offers to work on Gilmore's anger issues.
