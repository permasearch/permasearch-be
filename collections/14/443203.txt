At the end of the film, Doc kept his racing colors, becoming a trainer as well as a friend to the young McQueen. Just like McQueen, Doc learned some lessons: Friendship, promises, how greed affected others and secrets could not be kept forever. When a racing museum subsequently opened in Radiator Springs, one entire wing was devoted to his racing career. Much as Junior #8 acknowledged to "The King" that "you've been an inspiration to me", The King indicated "the Hudson Hornet was my inspiration".
