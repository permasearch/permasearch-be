The Toccoa River and Ocoee River are the names in use for a single 93-mile-long (150Â km)[3] river that flows northwestward through the southern Appalachian Mountains of the southeastern United States. It is a tributary of the Hiwassee River, which it joins in Polk County, Tennessee, near the town of Benton. Three power generating dams are operated along it. It is notorious for its whitewater rapids on the Tennessee side.
