Rates of diagnosis and treatment have increased in both the United Kingdom and the United States since the 1970s.[203] This is believed to be primarily due to changes in how the condition is diagnosed[203] and how readily people are willing to treat it with medications rather than a true change in how common the condition is.[14] It is believed that changes to the diagnostic criteria in 2013 with the release of the DSM-5 will increase the percentage of people diagnosed with ADHD, especially among adults.[204]
