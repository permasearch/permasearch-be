In the Mishnaic sense, the word avot, meaning "fathers," refers to fundamentals, or principal categories.  Thus, the principal categories of creative work forbidden on Shabbat are called avot melacha, and the principal categories of ritual impurity are referred to as avot tum'ah. Perakim, or in the construct form pirkei, means "chapters."  Thus Pirkei Avot means "Chapters of Fundamental Principles".[1][2]
