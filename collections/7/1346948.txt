Zevon was a much darker and more ironic songwriter than Browne and other leading figures of the era's L.A.-based singer-songwriter movement. But he and his 1970s L.A. peers shared a grounding in earlier folk and country influences, and a commitment to songcraft with roots in the work of artists like Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell. The album Warren Zevon (1976), produced by Browne, was a modest commercial success, but it was later termed a masterpiece in the first edition of the Rolling Stone Record Guide and is cited in the book's most recent revised edition (November 2004) as Zevon's most realized work. Representative tracks include the junkie's lament "Carmelita"; the Copland-esque outlaw ballad "Frank and Jesse James"; "The French Inhaler", a scathing insider's look at life and lust in the L.A. music business (which was, in fact, about his long-time girlfriend and mother of his son, Jordan); and "Desperados Under the Eaves", a chronicle of Zevon's increasing alcoholism.
