Although it seems obvious to me and many others, not all who have seen the movie would have agreed it was nuclear. Here at WP, in articles, such as List of apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction and List of nuclear holocaust fiction, editors have removed it from inclusion and argued the fact that the movie didn't spell it out. I had to search a good bit to find that reliable reference (from the writer himself no less) and had almost missed it. Internet searches turned up all sorts of arguments as to what had "really" happened - the Rapture, aliens, solar flare, etc. So I think it is important to have it somewhere in the article.
