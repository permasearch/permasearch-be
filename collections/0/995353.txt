In Guatemala, a sing-song phrase is used: "A la ley de Cristo, cada quien con su pisto", literally 'By the law of Christ, each one with his own stew', more a simple rhyme than having any religious connotation. Pisto is a stewed dish similar to ratatouille, and is used in this phrase as a stand-in for food in general.
