Chinese citizens who are permanent residents of Hong Kong but less than 11 years old are not also eligible for this passport since they do not hold a permanent ID. Such persons may be issued Hong Kong Re-entry Permit in lieu of HKSAR passport. After they obtain a permanent ID, they may be issued HKSAR passport, however.
