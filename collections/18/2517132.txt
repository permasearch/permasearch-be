Three-by-three skew-symmetric matrices can be used to represent cross products as matrix multiplications. Consider vectors      a  = (  a  1      a  2      a  3    )   T      {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} =(a_{1}\ a_{2}\ a_{3})^{\mathrm {T} }}   and      b  = (  b  1      b  2      b  3    )   T      {\displaystyle \mathbf {b} =(b_{1}\ b_{2}\ b_{3})^{\mathrm {T} }}  . Then, defining matrix:
