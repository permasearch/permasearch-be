The Supreme Court on June 27, 2008 per Leonardo Quisumbing, dismissed the suit of the Makati, seeking to nullify Special Patents 3595 and 3596 signed by Fidel Ramos conveying to the Bases Conversion and Development Authority public land in Fort Bonifacio, Taguig. Because of a pending civil case filed by the Taguig City government asking the court to define its territorial boundaries, Makati therefore cannot stop Taguig from collecting taxes on land located in Fort Bonifacio.[13][14] Taguig is competing with Makati, where round-the-clock construction of office and residential towers, as well as hotels and retail and commercial areas, BPO and call centers, are now transferring to Taguig.[citation needed]
