Miami Vice is noted for its innovative use of stereo broadcast music, particularly countless pop and rock hits of the 1980s and the distinctive, synthesized instrumental music of Jan Hammer. While other television shows used made-for-TV music, Miami Vice would spend $10,000 or more per episode to buy the rights to original recordings.[7] Getting a song played on Miami Vice was a boost to record labels and artists.[22] In fact, some newspapers, such as USA Today, would let readers know the songs that would be featured each week.[23] Among the many well-known bands and artists who contributed their music to the show were Roger Daltrey, El Debarge, Devo, Sin√©ad O'Connor, Russ Ballard, Black Uhuru, Jackson Browne, Kate Bush, Meat Loaf, Phil Collins,[24] Bryan Adams, Tina Turner, Peter Gabriel, Pink Floyd, ZZ Top, The Tubes, Dire Straits, Depeche Mode, The Hooters, Iron Maiden, The Alan Parsons Project, The Ward Brothers, Godley & Creme, Corey Hart, Glenn Frey, U2, Underworld, Frankie Goes to Hollywood,[7] Propaganda, Foreigner, The Police, Red 7, Ted Nugent, Suicidal Tendencies, The Damned and Billy Idol. Several artists even guest-starred in episodes, including Phil Collins,[24] Miles Davis,[25] Power Station,[26] Glen Frey,[27] Suicidal Tendencies, Willie Nelson,[28] Nugent,[29] Frank Zappa,[30] The Fat Boys,[31] Sheena Easton, Gloria Estefan, and[32] Gene Simmons. An iconic scene from the Miami Vice oeuvre involves Crockett and Tubbs driving through Miami at night to Phil Collins's song "In the Air Tonight".[33][34]
