Following Rooney's sending off and suspension due to a foul on Stewart Downing in the match against West Ham,[89] Mata was reinstated to the starting lineup, and he started the next match against Everton, a 2–1 win at Old Trafford in which he provided the assist for Ángel Di María's goal.[90] Mata later scored winning goals in home games against Crystal Palace[91] and Stoke City, the former after coming on as a second-half substitute. He made his return to the starting line-ups for the first time, in a 3–0 win over Tottenham but was substituted in the 77th minute for Andreas Pereira.[92] On 22 March 2015, Mata scored a brace, including a bicycle kick, in a 2–1 victory over Liverpool,[93] a performance which he rated as his best for Manchester United.[94][95] His second goal against Liverpool was also voted as Premier League Goal of the Month in March 2015.[96] His inspired performances led to him being named as Manchester United's Player of the Month for March.[97]
