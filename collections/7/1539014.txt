The maximum published age of 149 years was determined via radiometric dating of trace isotopes found in an orange roughy's otolith (ear bone).[4] Similarly, counting by the growth rings of orange roughy otoliths has given a maximum age of 125 to 156 years.[5] The validity of these results is questioned by commercial fishers as some state the former method is controversial and the latter method is known to underestimate age in older specimens.[citation needed] The issue has yet to be resolved definitively, but carries important implications relating to the orange roughy's conservation status.
