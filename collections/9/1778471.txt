The Latin name stannum originally meant an alloy of silver and lead, and came to mean 'tin' in the 4th century[20]—the earlier Latin word for it was plumbum candidum, or "white lead". Stannum apparently came from an earlier stāgnum (meaning the same substance),[18] the origin of the Romance and Celtic terms for tin.[18][21] The origin of stannum/stāgnum is unknown; it may be pre-Indo-European.[22]
