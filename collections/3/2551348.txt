Though it belongs to the Indo-Aryan group, Konkani was influenced by a language of the Dravidian family. A branch of the Kadambas, who ruled Goa for a long period, had their roots in Karnataka. Konkani was never used for official purposes.[39] Another reason Kannada influenced Konkani was the proximity of original Konkani-speaking territories to Karnataka.[40]
