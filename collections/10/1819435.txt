From 1982 to 2000, California's prison population increased 500%.  To accommodate this population growth, the state of California built 23 new prisons at a cost of $280 million to $350 million apiece.  California's prisons are public and are financed by the Public Works Department and operated by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. In 2015, California had a prison population of 129,593, which was lower than the peak prison population of 173,942 in 2006.[8] Beginning in 2006, when the prison population in California was at its peak, the state used out-of-state facilities to house inmates.[9] California's prison population in 2015 made up roughly 9.74% of the United States' total prison population, making up the second largest contribution to the country's prison population (second to Texas which contributed 12.32%).[8] The state funds the prison system's annual costs.  In 2005 the state rate of incarceration was 616 per 100,000 adults, or about .6%.
