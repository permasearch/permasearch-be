Triumph in the 1976 League Cup final gave Manchester City a place in the UEFA Cup after a four-year absence. City drew Juventus in the first round. Drawn at home first, City won the first leg 1–0, Brian Kidd scoring his first goal for the club. The second leg in Turin resulted in a 2–0 defeat and elimination.[32] Juventus went on to win the competition. As league runners-up in 1976–77, Manchester City again qualified for the UEFA Cup. Drawn against Widzew Łódź, City drew the first leg at Maine Road 2–2. In the late 1970s, hooliganism was becoming a more prominent part of English football. Following an incident where a fan invaded the pitch and attacked Widzew's Zbigniew Boniek, City were fined by UEFA, and fencing was erected between the pitch and the stands.[33] A 0–0 draw in Łódź resulted in City's elimination on the away goals rule.
