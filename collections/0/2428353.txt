The production of La Fille mal gardée was staged jointly by the Imperial Ballet's Premier maître de ballet Marius Petipa and the company's régisseur and second ballet master Lev Ivanov, while Zucchi herself would assist with staging some of the dances she had known from Paul Taglioni's version. The production also incorporated dances from the Imperial Ballet's old production to the music of Hérold. The reasons for the joint staging by both Petipa and Ivanov are not entirely clear, though it may be due to the fact that Ivanov was needed to stage the numbers brought out from the old production of the ballet. Petipa was responsible for the setting of all of the new dances, and even commissioned the composer Ludwig Minkus to score music for two additional variations for Zucchi.
