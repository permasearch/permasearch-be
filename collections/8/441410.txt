Cutler began December completing a season high 80% of his 40 passes for 286 yards, 2 TDs and 1 Int in a 24-17 win over the Chiefs.[52] The win came via a 95-yard drive and go-ahead touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall for Cutler's fourth rally of the season.[53] But Cutler was just 21-of-33 with 172 yards, 1 TD and 1 Int in a 20-30 loss at Carolina,[54] and despite 359 yards and 2 rushing TDs, had 0 passing TDs and 1 Int in a 30-23 loss to Buffalo.[55][56] This set up a winner-takes-the-division season finale against the San Diego Chargers. Cutler went 33-of-49 with 316 yards, 1 TD and 2 Ints, but it wasn't enough to counteract the Chargers seven TDs and Denver lost 52â€“21, failing to reach the playoffs for the third straight season.[57]
