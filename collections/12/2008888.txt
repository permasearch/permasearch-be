After First Union stopped their backing at the end of the season, the team was scheduled to close down,[14] but instead it changed its number to No. 01 and served as the team's research and development car. Green, Steve Grissom, and Ron Hornaday drove the car on a limited schedule in 1999. The team reappeared at Sears Point in 2001 under CGR/FS as car No. 04. Jason Leffler attempted to make the race while Dorsey Schroeder piloted Leffler's regular ride, the No. 01; Leffler did not qualify for the race.
