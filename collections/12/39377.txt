In 1958, Cuba was a relatively well-advanced country by Latin American standards, and in some cases by world standards.[90] On the other hand, Cuba was affected by perhaps the largest labor union privileges in Latin America, including bans on dismissals and mechanization. They were obtained in large measure "at the cost of the unemployed and the peasants", leading to disparities.[91] Between 1933 and 1958, Cuba extended economic regulations enormously, causing economic problems.[77][92] Unemployment became a problem as graduates entering the workforce could not find jobs.[77] The middle class, which was comparable to that of the United States, became increasingly dissatisfied with unemployment and political persecution. The labor unions supported Batista until the very end.[77][78] Batista stayed in power until he was forced into exile in December 1958.[93]
