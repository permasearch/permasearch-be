Salvadoran desserts include pan dulce, semita, Salvadoran quesadilla (a type of cheese-based pastry, similar to the Honduran rosquillo and unrelated to the Mexican quesadilla), torta de yema, marquezote, salpores, poleada (vanilla custard), arroz con leche (rice pudding), atol de elote, atol de piÃ±a, empanadas de platano (plantain patties), and many others. The dulce de leche of El Salvador has a soft, crumbly texture, with an almost crystallized form. Fruits are widely consumed, the most popular being mangoes, coconuts, papayas, and bananas. Sometimes fruit with ice cream and cinnamon sprinkled on top is served.
