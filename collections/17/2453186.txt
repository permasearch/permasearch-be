In October 2005, after 17 years in prison, Kuklinski was diagnosed with a rare and incurable inflammation of the blood vessels and was transferred to a secure wing at St. Francis Medical Center in Trenton, New Jersey. Although he had asked doctors to make sure they revived him if he developed cardiopulmonary arrest, (or risk of heart attack), his wife had signed a "do not resuscitate" order. A week before his death, the hospital called Barbara to ask if she wished to rescind the instruction, but she declined.[32] Kuklinski died at age 70 on March 5, 2006.[4] His body was cremated.[33]
