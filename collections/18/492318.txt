Wearable computers, also known as body-borne computers or wearables, are miniature electronic devices that are worn under, with, or on top of clothing.[1] This class of wearable technology has been developed for general or special purpose information technologies. It is also used in media development. Wearable computers are especially useful for applications that require more complex computational support, such as accelerometers or gyroscopes, than just hardware coded logic strained by the physical hardware of the system.[clarification needed] Merchandiser often use the broadest definition, as any computing device worn on the body. This article page will use the broadest definition.[2][3]
