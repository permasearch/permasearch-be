The use of live action was a stepping stone for Pixar, as Stanton was planning to make John Carter of Mars his next project.[11] Storyboarder Derek Thompson noted introducing live action meant that they would make the rest of the film look even more realistic.[37] Eggleston added that if the historical humans had been animated and slightly caricaturized, the audience then would not have been able to recognize how serious their devolution was.[34] Stanton cast Fred Willard as the historical Buy n Large CEO because "[h]e's the most friendly and insincere car salesman I could think of."[25] The CEO says "stay the course", which Stanton used because he thought it was funny.[38] Industrial Light & Magic did the visual effects for these shots.[8]
