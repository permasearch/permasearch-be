In April 2006, Marvel hired Jon Favreau to direct Iron Man,[6] with the writing teams of Art Marcum and Matt Holloway and Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby writing competing scripts.[6][19] Favreau consolidated both into one script, which was then polished by John August.[7] Robert Downey, Jr. was cast in the title role in September 2006, after growing out a goatee and working out to convince the filmmakers he was right for the part.[20] Principal photography began on March 12, 2007,[21] with the first few weeks spent on Stark's captivity in Afghanistan,[22] which was filmed in Inyo County, California.[23] Production also occurred on the former Hughes Company soundstages in Playa Vista, Los Angeles, California,[24] with additional filming at Edwards Air Force Base[25] and Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada.[26] Iron Man premiered at the Greater Union theater in George Street, Sydney, on April 14, 2008,[27] and was released internationally on April 30, and in North America on May 2.[28][29]
