ANZ has also been criticised in the Senate for its allegedly "hard boiled" approach to farmers exposed to the fallout from ANZ's purchase of the Landmark loan book.[53][54] One submission to the Senate inquiry into bank conduct mentioned one farmer self-immolating himself after alleged defaults occurring.[55] Another former customer in the Senate inquiry was mentioned as being subjected to victimisation by receivers and police, including use of SWAT teams and being held at gun-point.[55] In 2016 it was reported that ANZ was accused of racism in a high-profile court case involving the businessman Pankaj Oswal and his wife;[56] specifically it was reported that an email contained comments stating that, "“We are dealing with Indians with no moral compass and an Indian woman [the wife of Mr. Oswal], as every bit as devious as PO (Pankaj Oswal),” and “This has been a very Indian characteristic transaction."[56][57] The ANZ agreed to a settlement for an undisclosed amount in respect of the legal claim made by the Oswals.[58]
