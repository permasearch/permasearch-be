The grand jury system in the United States came under renewed criticism following three high-profile cases in 2014, where police officers caused the deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and Tamir Rice. In all three cases, after being presented the evidence, the grand juries voted not to return indictments. Public perception was that the officers involved had failed to follow proper police procedure.[58] As a result, these grand jury decisions sparked riots across the United States.[59]
