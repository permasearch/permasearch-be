Townsend suffered ill health for several years. She smoked, had tuberculosis (TB), peritonitis at 23 and suffered a heart attack in her 30s.[2] She developed diabetes in the 1980s.[25] It was a condition with which she struggled, believing herself to be the "world's worst diabetic".[26] The condition led to Townsend's being registered blind in 2001,[12] and she wove this theme into her work.
