In the Pokémon anime, Togepi is one of the first second generation Pokémon revealed before the release of Pokémon Gold and Silver. In "Attack of the Prehistoric Pokémon", Ash finds a Pokémon egg. It hatches into a Togepi in "Who Gets to Keep Togepi?", and since Misty is the first thing the baby Pokémon sees, it believes Misty is its mother due to filial imprinting, thus anticipating Togepi's connection with birds, which becomes clearer in the evolved forms Togetic and Togekiss.
