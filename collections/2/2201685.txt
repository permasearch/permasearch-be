Phillis Wheatley, also spelled Phyllis and Wheatly (c. 1753 â€“ December 5, 1784) was the first published African-American female poet.[1][2] Born in West Africa, she was sold into slavery at the age of seven or eight and transported to North America. She was purchased by the Wheatley family of Boston, who taught her to read and write and encouraged her poetry when they saw her talent.
