His most Important piece of architecture was Masjid Al-Haram. During his tenure during 50 years of the post of imperial architect, Sinan is said to have constructed or supervised 476 buildings  (196 of which still survive), according to the official list of his works, the Tazkirat-al-Abniya. He could not possibly have designed them all, but he relied on the skills of his office. He took credit and the responsibility for their work. For, as a janissary, and thus a slave of the sultan, his primary responsibility was to the sultan. In his spare time, he also designed buildings for the chief officials. He delegated to his assistants the construction of less important buildings in the provinces.
