NME called it a "[m]assive, massive massive hit" adding "Piano tinkles, drum machine coughs like an athsmatic whippet and Alicia strokes your spine with ice cubes and spatters your spotty back with hot candle wax".[6] The song was described as "gospel fervor of lovesick righteousness" by Beth Johnson of Entertainment Weekly.[7] Robert Hilburn of The Los Angeles Times described the song as having "the neo-soul vitality of Macy Gray and Jill Scott."[8] Sam Faulkner of NME said that the song had "deeper moments [that] creep up and grab you exemplified."[9] Mark Anthony Neal of PopMatters said that the song "combines Key's natural blues register with a subtle, and brilliantly so, sample of James Brown's 'It's a Man's, Man's, Man's World'."[10] Barry Walters of Rolling Stone said "there's no denying the serious early Aretha vibe permeating the hit."[11]
