Section 186A sets out the information or documents an enforcement agency must retain to ensure the Ombudsman is able to inspect the agency’s records to determine the agency’s compliance with Chapter 4 of the TIA Act. The types of documents or information required to be kept in the agency’s records include the authorisations made by an officer of the agency under sections 178, 178A, 179 or 180, and documents or materials that indicate whether the authorisation was made properly. Subsection 186A(2) allows the Attorney-General to prescribe additional kinds of documents and other materials enforcement agencies must keep.
