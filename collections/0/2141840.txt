Claire Elizabeth Beauchamp Randall Fraser - Main female character around whom the series revolves. Nurse/Physician. Born in 1918 and married in the 20th century to professor/historian Frank Randall, Claire falls through the standing stones at Craigh na Dun in Scotland at Beltane (1 May) while on a second honeymoon with Frank in 1946, and finds herself in the 18th century Scotland Highlands in 1743. She is forced to marry James Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser (Jamie), whom she eventually falls in love with. Mother of Faith (stillborn, 18th century) and Brianna, foster mother of Fergus, and mother-in-law to Marsali. Returned through the stones to 20th century in 1746 to protect hers and Jamie's unborn child (who is then born in Boston in the 20th century). Twenty years later, after Frank Randall has died, Claire discovers (through Roger's research) that Jamie probably didn't die at Culloden, and she returns through the standing stones to 1766 to search for him.
