Amtrak's Auto Train is often said to have the longest passenger train in the world,[9] although (as mentioned above) it may be best regarded as a mixed train, rather than as a pure passenger train. Currently, two Auto Train consists are in simultaneous operation each day. At 4:00 pm, there are departures from both the Lorton and Sanford terminals. Florence, South Carolina, is the only scheduled stop on the 855-mile (1,376 km) run: at this stop, the train is refueled and serviced and the engine crew and conductors are changed, but no passengers are entrained or detrained. Each train is scheduled to arrive at the other end the next morning at 9:00 am, for an endpoint-to-endpoint average speed of about 49 miles per hour (79 km/h).
