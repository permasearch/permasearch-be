The number of units of measure to which derogations applied was reduced with effect from 1 October 1995[c] and reduced further with effect from 1 January 2000.[e] A direct result of the changes that were effective from 1 January 2000 was the requirement that most loose goods sold by weight, volume or length (for example, potatoes or tomatoes that were sold loose, or cheese or meat that was cut or weighed in front of the customer) must be priced and measured using metric units.
