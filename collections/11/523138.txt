Politics was an early passion for Moniz. He supported a republican government, diverging from his familyâ€™s support for the monarchy. As a student activist, he was jailed on two separate occasions for participating in demonstrations. While serving as Dean of the Medical School at the University of Lisbon, he was arrested a third time for preventing police from settling a student-run protest.[4]
