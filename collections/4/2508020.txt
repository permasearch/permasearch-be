As both a high altitude and high velocity ride, Millennium Force is affected by unfavorable weather conditions such as rain, lightning or strong winds; under these conditions the ride is closed, but in light rain it can remain open.[38] There is no minimum age requirement, but passengers must be between 48 and 78 inches (120 and 200Â cm) to ride.[51] Persons over a certain weight or waist size are not allowed to ride if the seat and lapbar harness cannot accommodate them.[38] Passengers on Millennium Force may not take loose articles onto the train and are required to wear shirts and footwear. Headphones must be removed before boarding.[38] Passengers are advised not to ride Millennium Force if they have recently had surgery, heart trouble, high blood pressure, neck or back trouble, or any medical condition that may be aggravated by riding, or are pregnant.[52]
