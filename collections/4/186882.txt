Other recent additions include a new $30.8 million science building complete with a 64-seat planetarium and a new observatory at Tarleton's Hunewell Ranch, which houses a fully robotic 32-inch-diameter (810Â mm) research-grade telescope. The old science building went through an extensive $13.5 million renovation and expansion upgrading laboratories and classrooms. Tarleton's recent progress also includes a remarkable expansion and renovation of the Dick Smith Library and comfortable new housing facilities.
