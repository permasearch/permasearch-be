The group's lack of success in the US puzzled the Beatles' producer George Martin and manager Brian Epstein given their huge hits in the UK. Their only US release that had charted was "From Me to You", which lasted three weeks in August 1963, never going higher than No. 116 on the Billboard Hot 100.[30] Capitol Records had been stubborn in turning down the chance to become their record label in the US, and consequently the Beatles had been with Vee-Jay Records until that label failed to pay their royalties on time. Transglobal Music, an affiliate of EMI, held the licenses to their output in the US, and promptly ordered Vee-Jay to halt their manufacturing and distribution of Beatles records. Epstein, who needed a record label to release "She Loves You" in the US, asked Transglobal to find another label for him, and Transglobal came up with Swan Records. To avoid potential disagreements and lawsuits, the contract signed with Swan licensed to them only "She Loves You" and "I'll Get You", enough only for the A- and B-sides of a single â€“ and only for two years.
