FIDE divide time controls for chess into "classical" time controls, and the fast chess time controls. Currently, for master-level players (with an Elo of 2200 or higher) the regulations state that at least 120 minutes per player (based on a 60-move game) must be allocated for a game to be rated on the "classical" list;[1] for lower rated players this can reduced to as little as 60 minutes.[1] Games played faster than these time controls can be rated for rapid and blitz, but only if they comply with the time controls for those categories.[2]
