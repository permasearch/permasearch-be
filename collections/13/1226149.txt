"Love Me with All Your Heart" is a popular song, based on the Spanish language song "Cuando calienta el sol". The music was written by Rafael Gaston Perez, a Nicaraguan songwriter and bandleader. SADAIC (the Argentine Society of Music Authors and Composers) also credits the Argentine composer, Carlos Albert Martinoli.[1][2]
