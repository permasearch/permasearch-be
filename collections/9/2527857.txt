The first known recording of the song was made on December 15, 1965 for a demo record at Elektra Records in New York City.  The first formal release was a recording of the song made on November 10, 1968, as part of a live performance at Canterbury House in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  This recording was released as the B-side of Young's 1969 single "The Loner" (and again as the B-side of the "Cinnamon Girl" the following year), but was not collected on an album until the 3-LP compilation Decade was released in 1977.  A CD/DVD release of recordings from the Canterbury House performance, Sugar Mountain - Live at Canterbury House 1968, was released November 25, 2008 as part of Young's ongoing Archives Performance Series; this release includes the first-ever stereo mix of "Sugar Mountain" itself.
