Benefiting from lessons learned from the early adopters, some BPR practitioners advocated a change in emphasis to a customer-centric, as opposed to an IT-centric, methodology. One such methodology, that also incorporated a Risk and Impact Assessment to account for the effect that BPR can have on jobs and operations, was described by Lon Roberts (1994).[13] Roberts also stressed the use of change management tools to proactively address resistance to changeâ€”a factor linked to the demise of many reengineering initiatives that looked good on the drawing board.
