The fuse element is made of zinc, copper, silver, aluminum,[citation needed] or alloys to provide stable and predictable characteristics.[4][5] The fuse ideally would carry its rated current indefinitely, and melt quickly on a small excess. The element must not be damaged by minor harmless surges of current, and must not oxidize or change its behavior after possibly years of service.
