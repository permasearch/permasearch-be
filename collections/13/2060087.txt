Acting as a small community within the larger UWG community, the newly opened Greek Village features 18 houses ranging in size. These houses are complete with a living and or chapter room, kitchen, laundry facilities, a mix of single and double bedrooms and semi-private bathrooms. Also included within the village are outdoor green spaces, adequate parking, and a commons building. Greek Village has also recently added a pavilion, a basketball court, a volleyball court, and a fireplace with grills for everyone's use.
