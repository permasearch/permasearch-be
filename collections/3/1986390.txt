The series portrays Chinna Devi as Krishnadevaraya's senior wife and chief queen and Tirumalamba as his junior wife.[11] This is inaccurate. Tirumalamba (also known as Tirumala Devi) was actually Krishnadevaraya's senior wife and his chief queen or patta mahishi.[12][13] She was the princess of Srirangapattana and Krishnadevaraya had married her most probably in 1498, long before his accession to the throne in 1509.[14] Chinna Devi was actually a courtesan whom Krishnadevaraya had married immediately after his accession to the throne and was his junior wife.[12]
