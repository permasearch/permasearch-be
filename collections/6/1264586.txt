The generic name is derived from the Latin term bōlētus "mushroom", which was borrowed in turn from the Ancient Greek βωλίτης, "terrestrial fungus".[10] Ultimately, this last word derives from bōlos/βῶλος "lump", "clod", and, metaphorically, "mushroom".[11] The βωλίτης of Galen, like the boletus of Latin writers like Martial, Seneca and Petronius,[12] is often identified as the much prized Amanita caesarea.[13] The specific epithet edulis in Latin means "eatable" or "edible".[14]
