For the instrumental accompaniment, Canned Heat uses a "basic E/G/A blues chord pattern"[10] or "one-chord boogie riff" adapted from John Lee Hooker's 1949 hit "Boogie Chillen'".[11] Expanding on Jones' hypnotic drone, Wilson used an Eastern string instrument called a tambura to give the song a psychedelic ambience. Although Bob Hite was the group's primary vocalist, "On the Road" features Wilson as the singer, "utilizing his best Skip James-inspired falsetto vocal".[10][c] Wilson also provides the harmonica parts.[d]
