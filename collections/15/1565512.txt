This is an incomplete list of the highest-grossing concert tours. Only tours using reliable references and having grossed over $100Â million (adjusted for inflation) have been added to the list. Some of the gross may be higher than reported on this list because not all concerts are reported. Billboard and Pollstar regularly provide the official figure of concerts' gross revenue worldwide.
