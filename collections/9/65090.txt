Air-popped popcorn is naturally high in dietary fiber and antioxidants,[26][unreliable source?] low in calories and fat, and free of sugar and sodium.[27] This can make it an attractive snack to people with dietary restrictions on the intake of calories, fat or sodium. For the sake of flavor, however, large amounts of fat, sugar, and sodium are often added to prepared popcorn, which can quickly convert it to a very poor choice for those on restricted diets.
