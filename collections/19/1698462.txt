In March 2009, the band made an announcement on their official website that they were releasing the encore set from the Mexico City show, in which they came out with Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge style clothing and the stage set up like the Revenge tour, and played nine songs from the album. It came with a vest, and the videos were put onto a special bullet shaped USB flash drive.
