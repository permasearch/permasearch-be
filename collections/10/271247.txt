Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,200 mm (47 in) in the eastern parts of Formosa Province to a low of 450 to 500 mm (18 to 20 in) in the west and southwest.[54][56]:30 Summer witnesses the maximum precipitation.[54][57] Summer rains are intense, and torrential rain is common, occasionally causing floods and soil erosion.[66][68] During the winter months, precipitation is sparse.[54][57] Eastern areas receive more precipitation than western areas since they are more influenced by moist air from the Atlantic Ocean, which penetrates the eastern areas more than the west, bringing in more precipitation.[54] As a result, the vegetation differs: eastern areas are covered by forests, savannas, marshes and subtropical wet forest, and western areas are dominated by medium and low forests of mesophytic and xerophytic trees and a dense understory of shrubs and grasses.[50] In all parts of the region, precipitation is highly variable from year to year.[26]
