However, as part of a plan to escape, she pretends to forgive Ken, gaining access to his dream house. Barbie then ties Ken hostage to try to get him to reveal how to reset Buzz back to normal. As a provocation, she rips his clothing apart. Ken reveals the truth after she begins to sabotage his Nehru jacket. He is not seen again until Lotso has the toys cornered at the dumpster, where he is the first to turn on Lotso. Ken comes to Barbie's help by trying to stop Lotso, having realized Barbie through her understanding of civics. Lotso tells Ken "there's 100,000,000 just like her", but Ken insists that for him, there is no one else like her, and wins back her affections.
