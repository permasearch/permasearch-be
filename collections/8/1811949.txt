Gaye was born Marvin Pentz Gay Jr. on April 2, 1939, at Freedman's Hospital[7] in Washington, D.C., to church minister Marvin Gay Sr., and domestic worker Alberta Gay (nÃ©e Cooper). His first home was in a public housing project,[8] the Fairfax Apartments[9] (now demolished) at 1617 1st Street SW in the Southwest Waterfront neighborhood.[10] Although one of the city's oldest neighborhoods, with many elegant Federal-style homes, Southwest was primarily a vast slum. Most buildings were small, in extensive disrepair, and lacked both electricity and running water. The alleys were full of one- and two-story shacks, and nearly every dwelling was overcrowded.[11][12][13] Gaye and his friends nicknamed the area "Simple City", owing to its being "half-city, half country".[14][15][a]
