Nyabinghi Issemblies typically take place in rural areas, being situated in the open air or in temporary structures—known as "temples" or "tabernacles"—which are specifically constructed for the purpose.[133] Any elder seeking to sponsor a Nyabinghi Issembly must have approval from other elders to do so, and requires the adequate resources to organise such an event.[134] The assembly usually lasts between three and seven days.[133] During the daytime, those Rastas attending the event engage in food preparation, ganja smoking, and reasoning, while at night they focus on drumming and dancing around bonfires.[133] Nyabinghi Issemblies often attract Rastas from a wide area, including from different countries.[133] They establish and maintain a sense of solidarity among the Rasta community and cultivate a feeling of collective belonging.[133] They also help to confirm Rastas' convictions in the veracity of Rastafari teaching.[133]
