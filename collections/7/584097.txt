"Family" had a diverse guest cast, portraying the various family members of the crew. Bikel and Brown were both well known in Yiddish theatre circles, although there were concerns from the crew that they might seem comically Jewish on screen. But their fears were unfounded and the duo later returned in the fifth season episode "New Ground". Kemp and Eggar were known for a variety of television and stage performances. Birkin returned in the sixth season episode "Rascals" as Captain Jean-Luc Picard, when the character is changed into a pre-adolescent child by the transporter.[5] The characters of Robert and RenÃ© were later mentioned in the film Star Trek Generations, as they were killed off-screen in a fire.[6] Doug Wert portrayed Jack Crusher, and later returned as the character in the fifth-season episode "Violations".[1] The episode was also the only episode of The Next Generation in which Brent Spiner did not appear as Data.[7]
