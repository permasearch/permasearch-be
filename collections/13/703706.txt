Since the November 1991 release of Beauty and the Beast, O'Hara has returned to The Walt Disney Company on several occasions to voice Belle in a variety of media and merchandise, including its direct-to-video sequels Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas (1997), Belle's Magical World (1998) and Belle's Tales of Friendship (1999), as well as various video game releases such as the Kingdom Hearts series and several audio and video recordings associated with the Disney Princess franchise.[32] Additionally, O'Hara was hired by Disney to perform the song "Belle" at the 64th Academy Awards in 1992.[48] O'Hara has referred to the studio as her "main employer for 20 years".[49] In 2011,[50] O'Hara was officially replaced by actress Julie Nathanson, who first voiced Belle in the video game Kinect Disneyland Adventures (2011).[51][52][53] O'Hara revealed to the Las Vegas Review-Journal that news of the replacement greatly upset her to the point of which she was willing to re-record much of Belle's dialogue in an attempt to prove to the company that she is still capable of voicing the character. However, O'Hara eventually admitted that she found the process quite difficult as a result of the way in which her voice has changed over the course of 20 years.[49] In July 2017, it was announced that O'Hara would return as the voice of Belle in the 2018 film Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2.[54]
