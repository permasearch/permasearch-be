In Oriya history, people used to sail across the river for business and trade, after worshiping the Lord. This is popularly known as Boita Bandana which means "worship of the boat". So, on the same day, paper boats are lit with candles and are set afloat in the river as a symbol of remembrance of the past traditions of the Sadhaba Community (BTBS). People make a dish called Bada Oshaa Bhoga made up off raw rice grindings, coconut and sugar to perform the Naivedhya.
