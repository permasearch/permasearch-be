The set      R  ∪ { ∞ }   {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} \cup \{\infty \}}   is the projectively extended real line, which is a one-point compactification of the real line. Here     ∞   {\displaystyle \infty }   means an unsigned infinity, an infinite quantity that is neither positive nor negative. This quantity satisfies     − ∞ = ∞   {\displaystyle -\infty =\infty }  , which is necessary in this context. In this structure,     a  /  0 = ∞   {\displaystyle a/0=\infty }   can be defined for nonzero a, and     a  /  ∞ = 0   {\displaystyle a/\infty =0}  . It is the natural way to view the range of the tangent function and cotangent functions of trigonometry: tan(x) approaches the single point at infinity as x approaches either     + π  /  2   {\displaystyle +\pi /2}   or     − π  /  2   {\displaystyle -\pi /2}   from either direction.
