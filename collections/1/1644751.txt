The Quran instructs both Muslim men and women to dress in a modest way, but there is disagreement on how these instructions should be interpreted. The verses relating to dress use the terms khim캐r (head cover) and jilb캐b (a dress or cloak) rather than 拷별j캐b.[5] In the Quran, there are over 6,000 verses and only about half a dozen refer specifically to the way a woman should dress or walk in public.[14]
