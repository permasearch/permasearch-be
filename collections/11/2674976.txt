We are the army of God By death or wealth unmoved, We march, our leader and we, Ready to die!  In the name of God, we march And in his name, We die We serve in the name of God God's servant are we!  God is our king, And great is he, We serve our Lord, His slaves are we!  Our country's cause We serve with our breath, For such an end, Glorious is death  We serve and we love Our people and our cause Freedom is our aim, And our lives are its price.  We love our country And respect our country Zealously we protect it For the glory of God  By cannon or gun undismayed Soldiers and horsemen, None can come between, Our work and our duty.[6]
