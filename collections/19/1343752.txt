The W term represents a constant energy contribution for acidâ€“base reaction such as the cleavage of a dimeric acid or base.  The equation predicts reversal of acids and base strengths. The graphical presentations of the equation show that there is no single order of Lewis base strengths or Lewis acid strengths.[7]
