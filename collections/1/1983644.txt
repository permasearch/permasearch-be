Muslims often refer to Muhammad as Prophet Muhammad, or just The Prophet or The Messenger, and regard him as the greatest of all Prophets.[6][7][8][9] He is seen by Muslims as a possessor of all the virtues.[10] As an act of respect, Muslims follow the name of Muhammad by the Arabic benediction sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam, "[Salutations of God and] peace be upon him",[11] sometimes abbreviated SAW or PBUH.
