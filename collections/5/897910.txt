Grand Bahama remained relatively quiet until the mid-19th century, with only around 200-400 regular inhabitants in the capital, West End. In 1834, the towns of Pinderâ€™s Point, Russell Town and Williams Town were established by former Bahamian slaves after slavery was abolished in the British empire. The island remained under-developed until a brief boom of economic activity during the American Civil War, when it was a center for blockade runners smuggling goods (mostly weaponry, sugar and cotton) to the Confederacy. A second brief smuggling boom occurred during the years of prohibition in the US.[4]
