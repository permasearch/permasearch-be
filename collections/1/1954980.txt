The main tools that come with Windows 2000 can be found in the Computer Management console (in Administrative Tools in the Control Panel).[83] This contains the Event Viewerâ€”a means of seeing events and the Windows equivalent of a log file,[84] a system information utility, a backup utility, Task Scheduler and management consoles to view open shared folders and shared folder sessions, configure and manage COM+ applications, configure Group Policy,[85] manage all the local users and user groups, and a device manager.[86] It contains Disk Management and Removable Storage snap-ins,[87] a disk defragmenter as well as a performance diagnostic console, which displays graphs of system performance and configures data logs and alerts. It also contains a service configuration console, which allows users to view all installed services and to stop and start them, as well as configure what those services should do when the computer starts. CHKDSK has significant performance improvements.[88]
