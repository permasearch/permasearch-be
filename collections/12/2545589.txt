Along with the football and men's basketball teams, the Texas Tech baseball team was founded during the university's initial academic year, in 1925–26. The team's first series was against the West Texas A&M Buffaloes in 1926, an 18–9 victory in the first game and 14–9 loss in the second.[2] The third game in the team's history—this one against Daniel Baker College—ended in a 3–3 tie after 11 innings.[3]
