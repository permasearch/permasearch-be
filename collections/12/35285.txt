The most characteristic initial physical symptoms are jerky, random, and uncontrollable movements called chorea.[12] Chorea may be initially exhibited as general restlessness, small unintentionally initiated or uncompleted motions, lack of coordination, or slowed saccadic eye movements.[12] These minor motor abnormalities usually precede more obvious signs of motor dysfunction by at least three years.[15] The clear appearance of symptoms such as rigidity, writhing motions or abnormal posturing appear as the disorder progresses.[17] These are signs that the system in the brain that is responsible for movement has been affected.[18] Psychomotor functions become increasingly impaired, such that any action that requires muscle control is affected. Common consequences are physical instability, abnormal facial expression, and difficulties chewing, swallowing, and speaking.[17] Eating difficulties commonly cause weight loss and may lead to malnutrition.[19][20] Sleep disturbances are also associated symptoms.[21] Juvenile HD differs from these symptoms in that it generally progresses faster and chorea is exhibited briefly, if at all, with rigidity being the dominant symptom. Seizures are also a common symptom of this form of HD.[17]
