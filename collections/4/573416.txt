The band went on hiatus in 2003. While on hiatus on September 1 2004, baseball player Mike Piazza leaked a previously unheard track, "I.R.S." on the Eddie Trunk radio show.[184] The band management heard about the nationwide leak, and obtained a cease and desist order for all stations that had a copy of the like tracks. The band's hiatus continued until it was scheduled to play at Rock in Rio Lisboa in May 2004.[185] However, Buckethead left the band in March of that year, causing the band to cancel.[186][187] Buckethead reportedly left the band because of the "inability to complete an album or tour", according to his manager.[187] Rose claimed "the band has been put in an untenable position by guitarist Buckethead and his untimely departure. During his tenure with the band, Buckethead has been inconsistent and erratic in both his behavior and commitment, despite being under contract, creating uncertainty and confusion and making it virtually impossible to move forward with recording, rehearsals and live plans with confidence. His transient lifestyle has made it impossible for even his closest friends to have nearly any form of communication with him whatsoever."[186]
