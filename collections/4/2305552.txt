Microsoft's developer initiative programs and marketing have gained attention from application developers. As of Q3 2013, an average of 21% of mobile developers use the Windows Phone platform, with another 35% stating they are interested in adopting it.[142] Some reports have indicated that developers may be less interested in developing for Windows Phone because of lower ad revenue when compared to competing platforms.[143] The main criticism of Windows Phone is still the lack of applications when compared to iOS and Android.[144][145][146][147] Developers are backing out of the platform and retiring apps because of the low market share.[148][149]
