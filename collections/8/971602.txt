Higson stated that he was instructed by the Fleming estate to ignore all other interpretations of Bond, except the original Fleming version.[115] As the background to Bond's childhood, Higson used Bond's obituary in You Only Live Twice as well as his own and Fleming's childhoods.[116] In forming the early Bond character, Higson created the origins of some of Bond's character traits, including his love of cars and fine wine.[115]
