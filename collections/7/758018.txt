Damper is a traditional Australian bread prepared in a similar style to the pan breads found in North American and native Inuit cuisine. First documented in 1827 and prepared by farm-men, damper was a quick and easy way to prepare bread in the Australian bush.[14] The word "damper" derives from the English word "to snack" or to dampen the flour in the fire or one's appetite.[15]
