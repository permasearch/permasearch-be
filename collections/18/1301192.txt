The amount of body hair on the Hairless variety varies quite extensively, from the true hairless which has very little or no body hair and furnishings, to what is called a "hairy hairless", which, if left ungroomed, often grows a near-full coat of hair. These hairy hairless are not a mix between Powderpuffs and Hairless Chinese crested dogs, but are merely a result of a weaker expression of the variable Hairless gene. The mutation responsible for the hairless trait was identified in 2008.[4]
