During the governorship of Jonathan Belcher (1730-1741), speculation runs rampant, and Walker's business flourishes. Becoming a member of the local stock exchange, Tom buys a big house and a coach but furnishes neither even though he has the money (he is so miserly he even half starves his horses). Tom never tires of swindling people until he suddenly becomes fearful about the afterlife. He then becomes fiercely and loudly dedicated to God, always keeping two Bibles at handâ€”thinking that any sin on his neighbor's "account" is a "credit" to his own. He even has his best riding horse saddled and buried upside down so that he might flee when Old Scratch comes to collect his due from Tom.
