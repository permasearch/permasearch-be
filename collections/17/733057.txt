In 2004, due to the presence of 20 teams, it also became possible to play in midweek: on Wednesday evening, with some matches on Tuesday and others on Thursday (at 8:45). In 2010, a "lunch match" was introduced: a match played on Sunday at 12:30. Finally, for a few weeks, matches can be played on Friday or on Monday (in the evenings).[54]
