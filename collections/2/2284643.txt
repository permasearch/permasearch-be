The title of the television series is taken from W, a fictional webtoon which became a bestseller in South Korea. Authored by Oh Seong-moo (Kim Eui-sung), the webtoon became a living universe, engendering “two worlds”: the real world and the webtoon or W world. The gap between the two worlds is closed as Seong-moo's daughter and resident cardiothoracic surgeon Oh Yeon-joo (Han Hyo-joo) gets dragged into the webtoon world, inciting a series of twisted events.
