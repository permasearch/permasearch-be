The Taiwanese market Lancer Fortis and iO were simultaneously facelifted in May 2014.[48] The design of the front grille and bumper combination on both models became more aggressive, while the Fortis adopted the 'shark head' design and the headlamps from the global Lancer.[48] The rear lamps on both models were also revised, and the interior designs received minor cosmetic enhancements.[48] The powerplant configuration for both models were refined for better fuel efficiency, but were otherwise largely unchanged.[48] The Chinese market Lancer EX was later updated in line with the Lancer iO design.[47]
