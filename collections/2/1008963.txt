Real-world examples influenced several character designs by artists Isao Ohishi and Ryoji Shimogama. For example, Ohishi based Leon on his bloodhound, and Annette Birkin was modeled after actress Jodie Foster.[38] The police department in which Resident Evil 1.5 began had a more modern and realistic design, and was smaller than the final building seen in Resident Evil 2.[35][36] There were more encounters with surviving policemen, such as a superior officer of Leon called Roy.[36][38] The number of polygons used for enemy models was far lower than in the released version.[33] This allowed many zombies to appear on the screen, a method of invoking fear in the player that recurred throughout Resident Evil 1.5.[33][34] Furthermore, the game employed dynamic music, and frequently applied alterations to the pre-rendered backgrounds in response to events during the gameplay.[35] The playable characters could be equipped with gear, such as protective clothes that enhanced their defense and enabled them to carry more items.[39][40] The characters' polygonal models were altered by costume changes and by damage received from enemies.[39]
