Both phones have a 12.2 megapixel rear camera capable of recording 4K video at 30 FPS, 1080p video at 120 FPS, and 720p video at 240 FPS. The camera also contains phase-detection autofocus, laser autofocus, and HDR+ processing. The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL also include the Intel-designed Pixel Visual Core image processor for faster and lower power image processing,[6] though it was not enabled until Android 8.1 was released in January 2018.[7][8] The camera does not allow capturing Raw images and lacks manual controls. Unlike Apple's iPhone 8 and IPhone X, the Pixels do not have support for 4K video at 60 FPS, as the processor is not powerful enough.[9][10] Although the camera has Optical Image Stabilization it is unable to remove some high frequency vibrations that other smartphones are able to remove.[11] Pixel 2 owners receive free unlimited storage for all photos and videos taken on the phone in original quality through the end of 2020, with unlimited high-quality storage continuing afterwards.[12]
