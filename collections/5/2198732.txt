The match was Portugal's first competitive win against France, first overall win against France since 1975, and gave Portugal their first major trophy.[13][17] The win also qualified Portugal for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup in Russia, marking their first appearance in the competition, and the first time that three countries from the same confederation participated in the competition (hosts Russia, world champions Germany, and European champions Portugal).[33]
