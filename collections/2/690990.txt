In 1999 and 2000, Italian clubs returned to their record-breaking ways, with Christian Vieri transferring from Lazio to Inter for £28 million,[185] while Hernán Crespo's transfer from Parma to Lazio ensured he became the first player to cost more than £30 million.[179][186] The transfer of Vieri led to the suicide of a Lazio fan, who wrote in his suicide note, "All that money for a footballer, but money is not everything in life,"[187] while the Crespo transfer prompted the BBC to ask, "[H]as the world gone mad?"[188]
