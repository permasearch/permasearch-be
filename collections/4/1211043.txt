The United States government encouraged settlement of these lands by offering public land at $2 per acre (160-acre minimum), though auctioneering tended to retard sales and raised prices slightly.[73] The terms required a down payment of one-fourth of the total cost and the balance in four annual payments. Failure to pay in full in five years meant forfeiture.[74][75][76] Public land debt ballooned from $3 million in 1815 to $17 million in 1818.[50]
