In 1997, Brooklyn-based  Jazz composer Fred Ho premiered his Jazz opera Journey To The East, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, which he developed into what he described as a "serial fantasy action-adventure music/theater epic,” Journey Beyond the West: The New Adventures of Monkey based upon Wu Cheng’en’s 16th-century novel. Ho's pop-culture infused take on the story of the Monkey King has been performed to great acclaim.
