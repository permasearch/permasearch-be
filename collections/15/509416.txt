It is extremely difficult to obtain worldwide sales figures for singles due to the lack of verifiable sales reporting in many countries. The best-selling single of all time by a female group is thought to be the 1996 hit "Wannabe" by British group Spice Girls, with estimated sales of 8 million copies worldwide.[8]
