Myers must have ranked Brookes that high only on reputation. Brookes only played in Australia and gave a walkover in the final of the Victorian Championships (then the most important tournament in Australia even ahead the Australasian Championship). Wilding won all three of the ILTF's World Championships â€“ Wimbledon, World Hard Court Championships (Clay), World Covered Court Championships (Indoor). Maurice McLoughlin won the US Championships.
