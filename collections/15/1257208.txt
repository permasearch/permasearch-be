Despite the unification, a distinction between the three systems survives in the service labels: IRT lines (now referred to as A Division) have numbers and BMT/IND (now collectively B Division) lines use letters.[122] There is also a physical and less widely noticed difference, as A Division cars are narrower than those of B Division by 18 inches (46 cm)[123] and shorter by 9 feet (2.7 m) to 24 feet (7.3 m).[123][124] Because the A Division lines are of lower capacity for a given capital investment, all new extensions and lines built between World War II and 2007[125][126][127] have been for the B Division. A Division cars can travel on B Division lines when necessary, but are not used for passenger service on those lines due to the dangerously wide gap between the car and the station platform. This stems from the IRT and BRT's disagreement during the early days of the subway, where the BRT (part of the current B Division) built cars that would be purposefully too wide for the IRT (today's A Division).[76]
