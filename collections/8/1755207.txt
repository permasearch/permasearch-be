The Indo-Aryan migrations form part of a complex genetic puzzle on the origin and spread of the various components of the Indian population, including various waves of admixture and language shift. There is "general agreement" that north and south Indians share a common maternal ancestry.[28][29][30][31] A series of studies show that South Asia harbours two major ancestral components,[32][33][34] namely the Ancestral North Indians (ANI) which is "genetically close to Middle Easterners, Central Asians, and Europeans," and the Ancestral South Indians (ASI) which is clearly distinct from ANI.[32][note 5] These two groups mixed in India between 4,200 and 1,900 years ago (2200 BCE-100 CE), whereafter a shift to endogamy took place,[34] possibly by the enforcement of "social values and norms" by the "Hindu Gupta rulers."[36]
