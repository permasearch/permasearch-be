The military government and President Yahya himself made no efforts to frame a constitution, aside from issuing the extrajudicial order in 1970.[18] Across the country, the expectations were that a National Assembly would be set up by holding a free and fair election. To hold the proposed elections, President Yahya promulgated a Legal Framework Order on 30 March 1970 that also spelled out the fundamental principles of the proposed constitution and the structure and composition of the national and provincial assemblies.[18]
