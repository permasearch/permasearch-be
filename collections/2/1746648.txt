IFFM 2015 was the largest and most ambitious yet: with 50+ screenings, Q&As and masterclass sessions, a flag-hoisting by Anil Kapoor for Indian Independence Day, the Telstra Bollywood Dance Competition (with dance groups from across Australia performing across the afternoon to a crowd of 1000s at Federation Square); and the second IFFM Awards Night, with the inaugural Equality Fashion Show. The festival showcased 29 Australian premieres, and films in 11 languages. Nagesh Kukunoor and Kiku Sharda shared filmmaking insights at masterclass sessions, and filmmakers from across India and Australia, including Paul Cox, Srijit Mukherji and B. S. Lingadevaru, participated in Q&As following screenings of their films. Guests of the festival included Bollywood actress and international model, Sonam Kapoor, the timeless Simi Garewal, and Katti Batti trio, Kangana Ranaut, Imran Khan and Nikhil Advani.
