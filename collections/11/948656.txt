The 1961 season saw the chase of Babe Ruth's 1927 single season home run record by Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle.[85] Both Maris and Mantle would continue to reach the home run record until Mantle got injured late in the season, leaving Maris to reach the record.[85] On the last day of the season, Maris broke the record with his 61st home run of the year off Red Sox pitcher Tracy Stallard at Yankee Stadium.[86][87] Former Hall of Fame shortstop for the Yankees, Phil Rizzuto, called the shot in what was one of his first games as an announcer.[88] The Yankees won the game 1â€“0 to win their 26th American League pennant and then to win their 19th World Series title.[89]
