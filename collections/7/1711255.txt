Shortly before noon on 19 February, Thảo and Phát attacked, using around 50 tanks and a mixture of infantry battalions to seize control of the post office and radio station in Saigon, cutting off communication lines. The tanks were led by Colonel Dương Hiếu Nghĩa, a Catholic member of the Dai Viet. He surrounded the home of General Khánh, and Gia Long Palace, the residence of head of state Sửu.[35][51][53][54] When he was spotted by the press, Phát emerged from a tank to quip "This operation is to expel Nguyễn Khánh from the government".[55] Thảo said he was going to bring back Khiêm from Washington to head the new regime. In doing so, he caught Khiêm—at least nominally—off guard, asleep in his Maryland home. When informed of what was happening, Khiêm sent a cable pledging "total support" to the plot.[55] Rebel forces also surrounded the headquarters of the Republic of Vietnam Navy located on the Saigon River,[54] apparently in an attempt to capture Cang. However this was unsuccessful, and Cang moved the fleet to Nhà Bè—a port downstream on the Saigon River—to prevent the rebels from seizing the boats.[54]
