Matthew Broderick reprised his Bueller role in a Honda commercial aired during the Super Bowl in which "Oh Yeah" was featured.[17] A teaser for the ad had appeared two weeks prior to the Super Bowl, which had created rumors of a possible film sequel.[18][19] It was produced by Santa Monica-based RPA and directed by Todd Phillips.[20] AdWeek's Tim Nudd called the ad "a great homage to the original 1986 film, with Broderick this time calling in sick to a film shoot and enjoying another day of slacking."[20] On the other hand, Jalopnik's Matt Hardigree called the spot "sacrilegious".[21]
