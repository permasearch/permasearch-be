On the night of February 29, 2016, the signature Pearl at the top of Revel was lit for the first time since the resort closed.[49] The next morning on March 1, Straub said it was part of an ongoing effort to test systems at the Revel in preparation for the anticipated June 15 opening. Straub also said he expected to have 500 hotel rooms ready to go and most, if not all, of the property's restaurants up and running, stating that the restaurants' owners had been wanting to reopen since the property originally closed. Additionally, he stated the reopened resort would not be named Revel, but he had yet to decide on a name.[50]
