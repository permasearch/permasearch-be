Greg Horvath (Kevin Symons) is the CEO of the DAKA Shoe Company (also mentioned in Drake & Josh) in "iPromote Techfoots". He hires the iCarly children to endorse their new athletic shoe, the Techfoot, on their webshow. After the children discover that the shoes have many defects, they try to get the company to recall their product. Instead, Horvath threatens to sue iCarly for breach of contract. Spencer discovers a loophole in the contract, which requires the iCarly gang to only say "positive" things about the Techfoots. The children then proceed to highlight all the shoe's defects on the show, in a sarcastic but positive matter. Realizing that he has been outsmarted, Horvath is forced to buy out the contract. If he refused, he would be countersued for tricking the children into advertising the faulty shoes.
