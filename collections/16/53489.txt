Gallstones form when the bile is saturated, usually with either cholesterol or bilirubin.[16] Most gallstones do not cause symptoms, with stones either remaining in the gallbladder or passed along the biliary system.[17] When symptoms occur, severe "colicky" pain in the upper right part of the abdomen is often felt.[16] If the stone blocks the gallbladder, inflammation known as cholecystitis may result. If the stone lodges in the biliary system, jaundice may occur; and if the stone blocks the pancreatic duct, then pancreatitis may occur.[17] Gallstones are diagnosed using ultrasound.[16] When a symptomatic gallstone occurs, it is often managed by waiting it to be passed naturally.[17] Given the likelihood of recurrent gallstones, surgery to remove the gallbladder is often considered.[17] Some medication, such as ursodeoxycholic acid, may be used; and lithotripsy, a procedure used to break down the stones, may also be used.[17]
