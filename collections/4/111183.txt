Over time, consumer demand pushed the SUV market mostly towards family-friendly four/five-door models.[9][10] For example, even the only 159 in (4.0 m) long 1991 Chevrolet Tracker mini SUV was a four-door model. 1999 Saw the final production of the two-door full-size truck-based Chevrolet Tahoe SUV; and in late 2013, Toyota dropped its badly selling 2-door Land-Cruiser variants.[57] Some of the last old-school two-door SUVs soldiered on for some time as carry-over models, but their sales were not viable enough to warrant a redesign at the end of their life cycle. The SWB 2-door Mercedes-Benz G-Class was ended after 2011, and the Land Rover Defender was alltogether axed in 2016.
