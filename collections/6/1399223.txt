La fille remains one of the most recorded musical compositions of Debussy's.[13]  Despite its performance on a recurring basis, the prelude remains popular among audiences,[4] partly because of its "memorable tune" which is juxtaposed with a "mellow accompaniment".[14]  It has received acclaim for its expansiveness of emotion,[3] with the Richmond Times-Dispatch's Clarke Bustard describing the piece as "perhaps the most delicately characterful" out of all his twenty-four preludes.[15]
