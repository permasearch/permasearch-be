With the court case between Kevin McClory and Fleming surrounding Thunderball still in the High Courts, producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman turned to Goldfinger as the third Bond film.[19] Goldfinger had what was then considered a large budget of $3 million (US$23 million in 2016 dollars[20]), the equivalent of the budgets of Dr. No and From Russia with Love combined, and was the first James Bond film classified as a box-office blockbuster.[2] Goldfinger was chosen with the American cinema market in mind, as the previous films had concentrated on the Caribbean and Europe.[21]
