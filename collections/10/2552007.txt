Trinitarians see the absence of the actual word "Trinity" and other Trinity-related terms in the Bible as no more significant than the absence in the Bible of the words "monotheism", "omnipotence", "oneness", "Pentecostal", "apostolic", "incarnation" and even "Bible" itself.[76][77] They maintain that, "while the word Trinity is not in the Bible, the substance of the doctrine is definitely biblical."[2][51][78]
