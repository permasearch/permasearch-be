The texts of many court opinions contain dicta. Not only that, but courts in subsequent cases often refer to (or even quote from) such dicta without even clearly identifying such items as dicta. The effect of this is that although dicta are usually correct statement about the law, both lawyers and non-lawyers should be especially careful when reading the texts of court opinions.
