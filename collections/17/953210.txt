Webb then brought the song to Glen Campbell, who recorded it in 1978. His record label, Capitol Records, wanted him to go in a different direction and record music like the group The Knack.[2] Campbell wanted to release the song as a single, but Capitol refused.[3] After recording thirty albums for the only record label he had worked with since 1962, Campbell left the main studios of Capitol and never returned. Although he would record three more albums for Capitol, the relationship was at an end.[4] Campbell eventually released the song on his album Highwayman in October 1979.
