Scott Lee's casting was revealed when he appeared alongside the Home and Away cast at the Logie Awards in May 2015.[1] He had been filming with the show for around three months prior to his appearance.[2] Two months later, Lee's casting as Hunter was officially announced.[3] Lee told his agent that he did not think he would win the role, as he believed that he had performed badly in his audition. He later received a callback and started filming the following week.[4] Actor Reece Milne also auditioned for the role of Hunter, before he was cast as Tank Snelgrove a month later.[5] The role marks Lee's television acting debut.[6] Lee commented that joining the cast was "very exciting",[3] and he told Kaylee Martin of The West Australian: "It's Home and Away, you grow up watching it and I just thought 'if I'd ever get on that show, it would be so out of this world'. It was really bizarre and strange walking past Ray Meagher and all the people who have been on there that you grow up watching, I'm over the moon."[6] Lee made his first appearance as Hunter during the episode broadcast on 27 July 2015.[6]
