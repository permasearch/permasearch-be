In 2011, the Cleveland Clinic was second on the Becker's Hospital Review list of top-grossing hospitals in the United States, with total patient revenue of $9.14 billion.[56] The hospital posted $243 million operating income on $8 billion revenue in 2016. Operating income fell about 50 percent from 2015, which it said was due to shrinking reimbursements and rising drug costs.[57][58]
