Barbary macaque females have the ability to recognize their own offspring’s calls through a variety of acoustic parameters.[17] Because of this, infant calls do not have to differ dramatically for mothers to be able to recognize their own infant’s call. Mothers demonstrate different behaviours on hearing the calls of other infant macaques as opposed to the calls of their own offspring.[17] More parameters for vocalizations lead to more reliable identification of calls in both infants and in adult macaques so it is not surprising that the same acoustic characteristics that are heard in infant calls are also heard in adult calls.[17]
