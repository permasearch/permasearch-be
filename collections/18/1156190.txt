Tracy is allowed a day release from prison to attend her grandmother Blanche Hunt's (Maggie Jones) funeral. While at the funeral she argues with Steve's wife, Becky (Katherine Kelly) when she realises that Becky is playing a mother figure to Amy (now played by Elle Mulvaney). A few months later, Tracy returns to the Street. She tells the Barlows that the expert who handled the forensic evidence for her trial falsified his qualifications so she has been released on bail, pending a retrial. Tracy is found not guilty at the retrial, owing to the unreliability of forensic evidence. On New Year's Eve 2010, Tracy is found unconscious with a head injury, she survives and it later announces it was Becky's friend Claire Peacock (Julia Haworth) who pushed her.
