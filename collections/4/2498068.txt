Asynchronous message passing is generally implemented so that all the complexities that naturally occur when trying to synchronize systems and data are handled by an intermediary level of software. Commercial vendors who develop software products to support these intermediate levels usually call their software "middleware". One of the most common types of middleware to support asynchronous messaging is called Message-oriented middleware (MOM).
