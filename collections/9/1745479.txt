Piers Brendon wrote that Macaulay is "the only British rival to Gibbon."[53] In 1972, J. R. Western wrote that: "Despite its age and blemishes, Macaulay's History of England has still to be superseded by a full-scale modern history of the period."[54] In 1974 J. P. Kenyon stated that: "As is often the case, Macaulay had it exactly right."[55]
