The song fell down the charts relatively quickly for a top-ten hit. This was likely due to an overabundance of Shady/Aftermath/G-Unit-related singles all competing for airtime during this time period, as Eminem and G-Unit members 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Young Buck, and Game all had songs on the chart during the months of late 2004 and early 2005. However, despite its fast fall out of the top twenty, the song managed to hang on in the lower rungs of the top 40 for months, in spite of, or possibly because of, The Game's follow up, "Hate It or Love It" becoming even bigger on pop radio only a few weeks after "How We Do" had peaked.[citation needed] Dr. Dre had produced "How We Do" during his time in N.W.A[1]
