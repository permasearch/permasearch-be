Following this, England need to beat Argentina to get through to the second round. England succeed when Tonkinson dribbles past the Argentinian defence, his shot deflects off the crossbar and he punches the ball into the net (alluding to Diego Maradona's infamous Hand of God goal and his legendary Goal of the Century, both scored against England in the 1986 World Cup).
