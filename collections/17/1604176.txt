The 125 miles (201Â km) from San Jose to Merced, crossing the Pacheco Pass, will run at top speed on dedicated HSR tracks (since the current right-of-way south of Tamien is freight-owned). This segment runs through the Chowchilla Wye. This is included in the Initial Operating Segment (IOS), with a service start date per the 2016 Business Plan (pg. 112) of 2025.
