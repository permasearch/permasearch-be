Radisson Blu operates 158 hotels, with 42 projects in development.[5] Radisson Blu previously did not exist within the borders of the United States. The first Radisson Blu in the United States opened in downtown Chicago in Aqua, a skyscraper, in November 2011.  The second one opened in March 2013 in Bloomington, Minnesota and is connected to the Mall of America. Former Radisson Plaza hotels in Philadelphia and Minneapolis were converted to Radisson Blu.[6]
