Twain was born Eilleen Regina Edwards in Windsor, Ontario on August 28, 1965,[13] the daughter of Sharon (nÃ©e Morrison) and Clarence Edwards. She has two sisters, Jill and Carrie Ann. Her parents divorced when she was two and her mother then moved to Timmins, Ontario with her daughters. Sharon married Jerry Twain, an Ojibwa from the nearby Mattagami First Nation, and they had a son together, Mark. Jerry adopted the girls, legally changing their last name to Twain. When Mark was still a toddler, Jerry and Sharon adopted Jerry's baby nephew, Darryl, after Darryl's mother died. Because of her connection to Jerry, it has been reported that Twain is of Ojibwe descent,[14] but she stated in an interview that her biological father was part Cree, a claim his family denies.[15] Her confirmed ancestry includes English, French, and Irish.[16][17] Through a maternal great-grandmother, she is a descendant of French carpenter Zacharie Cloutier.[18] Her Irish maternal grandmother, Eileen Pearce, emigrated from Newbridge, County Kildare.[19]
