Leading is a function predominantly interpersonal in nature. In the organizational context many problems arise because of the failure of managers to understand the people, their aspirations, attitudes, and behaviour as individuals and in groups. If the manager fails in leading the people towards better performance, any amount of planning and organizing, however effective they are, may not help the organisation.
