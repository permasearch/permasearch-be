Towards the middle of 24's run, the series attracted significant criticism for its depictions of torture,[96][97] as well as its negative portrayal of Muslims. The frequent use of ticking time bomb scenarios in storylines, as well as the main character, Jack Bauer portraying torture as normal, effective, acceptable and glamorous,[98][99][100] was criticized by human rights activists, military officials, and experts in questioning and interrogation,[101][102] with concerns raised that junior U.S. soldiers were imitating techniques shown on the series.[103][104][105] In response to these concerns, members of the U.S. military met with the creators of the show. Partly as a result of these discussions, and the military's appeal to the creators of the show to tone down the scenes of torture since it was having an impact on U.S. troops,[103][104][106] there was a reduction in torture in subsequent seasons of the series.[107][108] However, the writers stated that they reduced the number of torture scenes, not as a concession, but because it was starting to overwhelm the storytelling.[109]
