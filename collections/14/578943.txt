Note must be taken of expert evidence to show why people sometimes do not report such offences immediately. In Holtzhauzen, the alleged victim had wanted to lead the evidence of a hypnotist—this was not allowed—and an expert witness on why she had not come forward immediately. (This was allowed.) Prior to the commencement of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, expert evidence was sometimes led to explain the delay in reporting. It could be argued that such evidence would no longer be necessary, in view of the explicit provisions of the new statute.
