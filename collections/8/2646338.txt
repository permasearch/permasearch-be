The conquest of Algeria was initiated in the last days of the Bourbon Restoration by Charles X, it aimed to put a definite end to Barbary privateering and it was also an attempt to increase the king's popularity amongst the French people, particularly in Paris, where many veterans of the Napoleonic Wars lived. Algerine slave trade and piracy immediately ceased when the French conquered Algiers.[16]
