Females secrete small amounts of sex pheromones, which leave a trail the males follow using their tongues and Jacobson's organs as  guides.[50] Once a receptive female has been located, the male  often spends several days following her around (a behavior not common outside of the mating season), frequently touching and rubbing her in an attempt to stimulate her.[51][52]
