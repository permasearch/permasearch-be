Spencer (Corbin Bleu) is a student in the drama club who is obsessed with theatre. He speaks with a projected theatrical voice and dreams of being a Hollywood star. In the episode "School Plays", Spencer and Suzie play the lead roles in Romeo & Juliet, and Spencer makes Ned jealous by saying that the big kiss will win Suzie over leading Ned to destroying the play which Spencer gets injured in the mayhem. In another episode, "Revenge", Backpack Boy gets revenge on Spencer for stealing his crush, Claire Sawyer.
