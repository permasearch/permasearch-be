For a Shuklapaksha ('bright fortnight') day-time birth the exalted lord of the navamsa occupied by the Moon at the time of birth makes one a great orator, invincible, very powerful and highly influential, and enjoy Raja yoga, but if the lords of the navamsas, occupied by the lords of the 2nd, the 5th, the 9th and the 11th house, are all in their respective signs of exaltation then in addition to the enjoyment of Raja yoga one also gains world-wide fame as a great scholar.[18]
