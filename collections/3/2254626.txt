Sweeping through Fort McMurray, the wildfire destroyed approximately 2,400 homes and buildings. Another 2,000 residents in three communities were displaced after their homes were declared unsafe for reoccupation due to contamination. The fire continued to spread across northern Alberta and into Saskatchewan,[14] consuming forested areas and impacting Athabasca oil sands operations. With an estimated damage cost of C$9.9Â billion, it was the costliest disaster in Canadian history.
