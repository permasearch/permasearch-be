"Yes, I'm Ready" has been covered by other artists, including Mona Carita (fi) (as "Tahdon"), Shirley Ellis, Gladys Knight and the Pips, Maureen McGovern, Jeffrey Osborne, and Carla Thomas. It was recorded as a duet by the artist Jed and American singer La Toya Jackson. This single was released only in 7" format in Japan, where it failed to chart. It was not included on any of Jackson's albums and includes the instrumental version on the B-side. In 1997, teenage singing sensation Kimberly Scott, mostly known for her hit “Tuck Me In”, remade this song with Taiwanese musician Harlem Yu, which was included in Harlem Yu's 1997 English cover album "Harlem Music Channel".
