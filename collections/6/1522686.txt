The band's show on July 17, 1993 was the last at which all members except Rose and Reed would perform as members of Guns N' Roses.[6] After not being involved in the recording of the cover version of "Sympathy for the Devil" in 1994, Clarke's involvement with the band ended.[7] He was replaced by Paul "Huge" Tobias.[8] Slash left the band in October 1996, reportedly due to disagreements with Rose and issues with lineup changes.[9] He was followed in 1997 by McKagan, who left, and Sorum, who was fired, leaving only Rose, Reed and Tobias.[10]
