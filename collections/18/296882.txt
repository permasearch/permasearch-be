In the Eddic poem "Hyndluljóð", Freyja expresses appreciation for the many sacrifices of oxen made to her by her acolyte, Óttar.[197] In Hrafnkels saga, Hrafnkell is called Freysgoði for his many sacrifices to Freyr.[198][69] There may also be markers by which we can distinguish sacrifices to Odin,[199] who was associated with hanging,[200] and some texts particularly associate the ritual killing of a boar with sacrifices to Freyr;[200] but in general, archaeology is unable to identify the deity to whom a sacrifice was made.[199]
