The accompanying musical staves show the series of harmonics which are generated when a bell is struck. The Erfurt bell bell is notable that it although it is an old bell, it is harmonically tuned, but was not typical of its time. Pieter and Fran√ßois Hemony in the 17th century reliably cast many bells for carillons of unequalled quality of tuning for the time, but after their death their guarded trade secrets were lost, and not until the 19th century were bells of comparable tuning quality cast. It was only in modern times that repeatable harmonic tuning using a known scientific basis was achieved.The main partials (or harmonics) of a well-tuned bell are:
