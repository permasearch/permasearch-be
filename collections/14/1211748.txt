Initially, the battlefield is shrouded by a fog of war, which is uncovered by moving units to clouded regions of the map. Units can be selected and commanded to engage in combat or interact with structures on the battlefield.[5] Combat is balanced by a "rock–paper–scissors" counter-attack system, in which ground vehicles are effective in combat against infantry, infantry are effective against aircraft, and aircraft are effective against ground vehicles.[6] In addition to their primary attacks, every unit has at least one special ability. For example, Spartan supersoldiers are capable of hijacking vehicles and performing a smash attack after leaping into the air.[7] Players can build additional bases once they have accumulated enough resources and gained control over areas of the map, allowing them to expand their army.[5]
