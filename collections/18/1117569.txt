The Magic Tree is a magical tree that Courage grows, capable of making ideas and dreams come true and it can talk. It grants wishes, whether they are good or bad, and it ends up granting a wish for Eustace which causes Muriel's head to swell up. Eustace then considers it a threat and decides to chop the tree down and Courage has to defend it for three days in order to cure Muriel. Although Eustace had a bit of sympathy, he chose to cut it down anyway. After the tree has been cut down and before it dies, it tells Courage how to cure Muriel. The tree had the last laugh against Eustace as the episode ended with Eustace's head swollen up just like Muriel's had been.
