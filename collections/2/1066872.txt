In the mid-1980s Microsoft developed a multitasking version of DOS.[7][8] This version of DOS is generally referred to as "European MS-DOS 4" because it was developed for ICL and licensed to several European companies. This version of DOS supports preemptive multitasking, shared memory, device helper services and New Executable ("NE") format executables. None of these features were used in later versions of DOS, but they were used to form the basis of the OS/2 1.0 kernel. This version of DOS is distinct from the widely released PCÂ DOS 4.0 which was developed by IBM and based upon DOS 3.3.
