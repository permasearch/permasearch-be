Dissatisfied with actor Peter Stormare's vocal performance in the film version of this duet, Bjork had desired a replacement partner for Selmasongs. Not surprisingly, Thom Yorke was the first name that came to mind. It was recorded over a four-day span in March 2000, with Björk recording her vocals in Las Vegas.[3] Bjork said she wanted to work with Yorke on the song because he is a "very pure soul". In an interview with Time Out magazine, she said: "It was my idea to work with Thom. We spent four days in Spain just singing as and when we felt like it. He's a very pure soul and I know he doesn't do things lightly. So it was great that he agreed".[4] The song was made available for download through Björk's website on 21 July 2000.[5]
