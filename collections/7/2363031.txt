The 50th Law is the fourth book by Greene—written collaboratively with rapper 50 Cent—and was published in 2009.[31][32][33] The book mixes talk of strategy and fearlessness by supplementing anecdotes from 50 Cent's rise as both a young urban hustler and as an up-and-coming musician with lessons from various historical figures.[34][35][36] Each of the 10 chapters in the book explains a factor of fearlessness and begins by telling how 50 learned this "Fearless Philosophy" in Southside Queens.[37][38][39]
