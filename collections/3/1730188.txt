The redback spider is widespread across Australia. The current distribution reported by the World Spider Catalogue includes Southeast Asia and New Zealand.[1] Colonies and individuals have been found elsewhere, including Japan,[54][55] England, Belgium, the United Arab Emirates and Iran.[56][43][57][58] It was believed at one time that the redback may have been introduced to Australia, because when it was first formally described in 1870, it appeared to be concentrated around sea ports.[10][59] However, an earlier informal description (1850) from the Adelaide Hills is now known, and names in Australian Aboriginal languages also show that it was present well before European settlement. Its original range is thought to be a relatively small arid part of South Australia and Western Australia.[56] Its spread has been inadvertently aided by modern buildings, which often provide habitats conducive to redback populations.[23] The close relationship between the redback and the New Zealand katipo also supports the native status of both in their respective countries.[35]
