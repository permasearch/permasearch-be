In 1908 the portrait was exhibited at the Kunstschau in Vienna where critical reaction was mixed.[35] The unnamed reviewer from the Wiener Allgemeine Zeitung described the painting as "an idol in a golden shrine",[40] while the critic Eduard PÃ¶tzl described the work as "mehr Blech als Bloch" ("more brass than Bloch").[39][n 6] According to the art historian Tobias G. Natter, some critics disapproved of the loss of the sitter's individuality, while others "accused Klimt of endangering the autonomy of art".[41]
