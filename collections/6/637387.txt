The longest doubleheader in Major League history came on May 31, 1964. The San Francisco Giants beat the New York Mets 5–3 in nine innings in the day's first game at Shea Stadium, and then won the nightcap 8–6 after 23 innings (despite a rare triple play turned by the Mets in the 14th). The two games lasted a combined nine hours, 52 minutes. The Mets' Ed Kranepool played in all 32 innings of the two games; Kranepool had been called up to the team that day after having played in both games of a doubleheader the day before for their Triple-A farm club in Buffalo.
