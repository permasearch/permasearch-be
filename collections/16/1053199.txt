Since the balanced scorecard was popularized in the early 1990s, a large number of alternatives to the original 'four box' balanced scorecard promoted by Kaplan and Norton[6] in their various articles and books have emerged.  Most have very limited application, and are typically proposed either by academics as vehicles for expanding the dialogue beyond the financial bottom line â€“ e.g. Brignall (2002)[25] or consultants as an attempt at differentiation to promote sales of books and / or consultancy (e.g. Neely et al. (2002),[37] Bourne (2002),[38] Niven (2002)[39]).
