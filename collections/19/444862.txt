Moses and acting Port Authority Chairman Bayard F. Pope were agreeable to letting either of their respective agencies construct and operate the proposed Narrows Bridge, as long as that agency could do so efficiently. In 1954, the two agencies started conducting a joint study on the logistics of building and constructing the bridge. Because of restrictions by the TBTA's bondholders, construction could not begin until at least 1957.[46] Frederick H. Zurmuhlen, the Commissioner of Public Works, estimated that the Narrows Bridge would cost $200 million total.[47] He encouraged the TBTA to start construction on the bridge as soon as possible in order to reduce congestion on East River crossings to the north.[48] Staten Islanders viewed the project cautiously, since the Narrows Bridge would provide a connection to the rest of the city, but could also cause traffic congestion through the borough.[49] Moses had only a positive view of the bridge's proposed effects on Staten Islanders, saying that it was vital for the borough's future.[50]
