As a result of the proclamation of the Arms of Canada by King George V on 21 November 1921, red and white became Canada's official colours.[1] The proclamation stated "a Royal helmet mantled argent doubled gules" and "a wreath of the colours argent and gules",[3] in which argent refers to the colour white or silver, and gules to red, tinctures used to emblazon a coat of arms.[5] In 1957, the Arms of Canada were modifiedâ€”the maple leaves on the shield were changed from green to red "in recognition of Canada's official colours".[2] The proclamation accepts both colours for the maple leaves, stating "three maple leaves conjoined on one stem proper",[3] in which "proper" refers to the natural colour of the leaves, which is green in spring and summer, and red in autumn.
