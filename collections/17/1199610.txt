Diabetes has posed a significant health risk to Native Americans. Type I diabetes is rare among Native Americans. Type II diabetes is a much more significant problem and is the type of diabetes referred to in the remainder of this section. The prevalence of diabetes began primarily in the middle of the twentieth century and has grown into an epidemic. About 16.3% of Native American adults have been diagnosed with diabetes.[50] Type two diabetes and the complications that follow have gone from being acute infectious diseases to chronic illnesses within Native American and Alaska Native communities. Native Americans and Alaska Natives experience high rates of end-stage renal disease, which is mainly driven by, and directly correlates with, the increase in diabetes within their communities.[51]
