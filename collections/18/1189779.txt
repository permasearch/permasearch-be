Discarded wooden pallets should not be used for firewood or crafts unless it has been determined that the wood in these pallets has not been treated with wood preservatives, fungicides and/or pesticides.  Various pyrethrins and propiconazole are common treatments for wooden pallets.  In addition, imported palletized goods are routinely fumigated with highly toxic pesticides.  During use, harmful materials or chemicals also may spill on the pallet wood and be absorbed.
