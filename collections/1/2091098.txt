Even before IQ tests were invented, there were attempts to classify people into intelligence categories by observing their behavior in daily life.[7][8] Those other forms of behavioral observation are still important for validating classifications based primarily on IQ test scores. Both intelligence classification by observation of behavior outside the testing room and classification by IQ testing depend on the definition of "intelligence" used in a particular case and on the reliability and error of estimation in the classification procedure.
