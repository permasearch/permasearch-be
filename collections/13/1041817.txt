During a workout, increased blood flow to metabolically active areas causes muscles to temporarily increase in size, known colloquially as being "pumped up".[7] About two hours after a workout and typically for seven to eleven days, muscles swell due to an inflammation response as tissue damage is repaired.[8] Longer-term hypertrophy occurs due to more permanent changes in muscle structure.
