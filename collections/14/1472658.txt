Saadat Ali Khan II, after being made the Nawab by John Shore, entered into a treaty with the Company and gave the fort to the British in 1798.[45] Lord Wellesley after threatening to annex the entire Awadh, concluded a treaty with Saadat on abolishing the independent Awadhi army, imposing a larger subsidiary force and annexing Rohilkhand, Gorakhpur and the Doab in 1801.[46]
