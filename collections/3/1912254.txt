Most tropical hardwood hammocks outside of the Florida Keys are now protected from development. On the mainland outside of Dade County, few tropical hardwood hammocks exist that are not already publicly owned. On the Miami Rock Ridge in Dade County, many tropical hardwood hammock parcels are still privately owned. Development of these tropical hardwood hammocks, however, is regulated and a permit is required from the Dade DERM before development can commence. In the Keys, tropical hardwood hammocks continue to be developed even though regulations and permit requirements are in place (C. Kruer, Florida Audubon Society, personal communication 1998).
