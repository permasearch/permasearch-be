In 1912 the government invited suggestions from the public as to the name of the future city. Almost 750 names were suggested. At midday on 12 March 1913,[43][44] the city was officially given its name "Canberra" by Lady Denman, the wife of Governor-General Lord Denman, at a ceremony at Kurrajong Hill,[45][46][47] which has since become Capital Hill and the site of the present Parliament House.[48] Canberra Day is a public holiday observed in the ACT on the second Monday in March to celebrate the founding of Canberra.[32] After the ceremony, bureaucratic disputes hindered Griffin's work;[49] a Royal Commission in 1916 ruled his authority had been usurped by certain officials,[50] and his original plan was reinstated. Griffin's relationship with the Australian authorities was strained and a lack of funding meant that by the time he was fired in 1920, little work had been done.[51][52] By this time, Griffin had revised his plan, overseen the earthworks of major avenues,[53] and established the Glenloch Cork Plantation.[54]
