Beld was a former member of the "Six Heroes", a band of adventurers who fought and defeated the demon god 30 years before the events of Record of Lodoss War. During the battle with the demon god, Beld's soul was destroyed when his blade became baptized in the blood of the demon, and in the aftermath, his sword became the legendary blade Soul Crusher. He later became the lord of Marmo Island and led an army comprising humans, dark creatures, and Dark Elves in an invasion of Lodoss. The invasion was largely successful, but just after killing his old friend Fahn in personal combat, he is betrayed and struck down by Karla the Grey Witch; the rule of Marmo subsequently passed over to his general, Ashram.
