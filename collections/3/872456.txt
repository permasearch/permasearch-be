Referring to the phrase repeated in the chorus of the song, “Sad eyed lady of the lowlands/ Where the sad eyed prophet says that no man comes”, Ricks suggests that the prophet Ezekiel is relevant, noting that the phrase “no man” occurs several times in the Book of Ezekiel. Ricks also notes several references to “gates” in that Book, as in Dylan’s song. “This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man may enter in by it.” Ezekiel 44:2.[7] Dylan’s song alludes to “the kings of Tyrus”, and Ricks points out that, in the Book of Ezekiel, Tyrus is described as “a merchant of the people for many isles” (Ezekiel 27:3); this chapter of Ezekiel lists the many commodities and luxuries which Tyrus trades in, including silver, gold, spices, precious stones, emeralds, ebony and ivory.  Thus, for Ricks, Tyrus is “one huge warehouse of hubris”, but there is a force that can outwait the kings of Tyrus, “the Lord, he who speaks through his propher Ezekiel of the doom to come”.[7]
