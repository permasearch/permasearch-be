Another staple of the setlist is a segment of the show known as the "Fan Dedication Song", where a song is requested by fans attending particular concerts on the tour, through social media service Instagram, for the band to play during their C-stage set.[40] The segment was described by Martin as being similar to a photo booth, stating, "we'd ask people to give us a reason why they want us to play that song so there is a purpose behind why we play it."[31][41]
