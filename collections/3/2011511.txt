The River Teme (pronounced /tiÀêm/; Welsh: Afon Tefeidiad) rises in  Mid Wales, south of Newtown, and flows through Knighton where it crosses the border into England down to Ludlow in Shropshire, then to the north of Tenbury Wells on the Shropshire/Worcestershire border there, on its way to join the River Severn south of Worcester. The whole of the River Teme was designated as an SSSI, by English Nature, in 1996.
