Although never released as a single, it is still today one of Alice in Chains' best-known songs. The song is notable for its emotional acoustic instrumentation and its electric guitar solo, as well as its dark lyrics dealing with loneliness, despair, and death. The lyrics are also thought to be an expression of Staley's frustration with lack of privacy. It is considered a staple of 1990s alternative rock despite not hitting a single U.S. Billboard chart or any charts around the world.
