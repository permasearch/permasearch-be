Sexual headaches, also known as coital cephalalgia, are a rare type of headache that occur in the skull and neck during sexual activity, including masturbation or orgasm. These headaches are often benign, but should be evaluated by a clinician to rule out intracranial hemorrhage and cerebral infarction, especially if the pain is sudden and severe.[1] They may be caused by general exertion, sexual excitement, or contraction of the neck and facial muscles.[1] Most cases can be successfully treated with medication.[1]
