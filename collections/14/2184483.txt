An active virtual ground circuit is sometimes called a rail splitter. Such a circuit uses an op-amp or some other circuit element that has gain. Since an operational amplifier has very high open-loop gain, the potential difference between its inputs tend to zero when a feedback network is implemented. This means that the output supplies the inverting input (via the feedback network) with enough voltage to reduce the potential difference between the inputs to microvolts. More precisely, it can be shown that the output voltage of the amplifier in the figure is approximately equal to     âˆ’    R  f    R  i n      V  i n     {\displaystyle -{\frac {R_{f}}{R_{in}}}V_{in}}  . Thus, as far as the amplifier is working in its linear region (output not saturated, frequencies inside the range of the opamp), the voltage at the output terminal remains constant with respect to the real ground, and independent from the loads to which it may be connected. This property characterize a "virtual ground".
