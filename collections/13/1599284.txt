Indian mythology also reflects the competition between the various Indian religions. A popular story tells how Vajrapani kills Mahesvara, a manifestation of Shiva depicted as an evil being.[182][183] The story occurs in several scriptures, most notably the Sarvatathagatatattvasamgraha and the Vajrapany-abhiseka-mahatantra.[184][note 26] According to Kalupahana, the story "echoes" the story of the conversion of Ambattha.[183] It is to be understood in the context of the competition between Buddhist institutions and Shaivism.[188]
