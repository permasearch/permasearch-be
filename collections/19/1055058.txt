After 1872, steel started to be introduced as a material for construction. Compared to iron, steel allows for greater structural strength for a lower weight. The French Navy led the way with the use of steel in its fleet, starting with the Redoutable, laid down in 1873 and launched in 1876.[56] Redoutable nonetheless had wrought iron armor plate, and part of her exterior hull was iron rather than steel.
