If you want to cite a video you saw on YouTube as a source, such as an excerpt from a documentary or TV program, don't use the YouTube information, but instead find the original movie or TV program's data (a web search should be sufficient to find this information if you know the title). Sites such as imdb and  Amazon often have the data you will need. If you provide readers with the necessary data, they can search a video out on YouTube themselves. You can use the {{cite video}} or {{cite episode}} templates if you like. If the title on YouTube differs from the title of the actual video being used as a source, you can put the YouTube title in the "quote" field of the template like this: |quote=YouTube title: Two Men in Dallas Part 2
