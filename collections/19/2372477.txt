In November 2007, Simpson began dating Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo. The relationship was controversial among fans of the Cowboys, who blamed Simpson for Romo's poor performance in games after the pair got together. Some fans dubbed Simpson "Yoko Romo," a reference to Yoko Ono who is widely believed to have been the cause of the split of The Beatles.[91] Then-president George W. Bush even commented on the pair's relationship, implying that Simpson was to blame for Romo's lackluster performances.[92] Simpson and Romo were reported to have ended their relationship in July 2009.[93] Simpson appeared alongside Luke Wilson in the film Blonde Ambition (2007); it had a limited release in Texas before being released on home media.[94] She also starred in the direct-to-video film Private Valentine: Blonde & Dangerous (2008), portraying an actress that later joins the military. The film was met with an overwhelmingly negative reaction upon its release.[95] Simpson teamed up with Parlux Fragrances to launch her first scent, Fancy, in 2008. The fragrance was met with a positive commercial reaction.[96]
