With Tarleton's right flank and center line collapsed, only a minority of the 71st Highlanders were putting up a fight against part of Howard's line. Tarleton, realizing the desperate nature of what was occurring, rode back to his one unit left that was whole, the British Legion cavalry. He ordered them to charge, but they refused and fled the field.[56] The Highlanders, surrounded by militia and Continentals, surrendered. Desperate to save something, Tarleton found about forty cavalrymen and with them tried to save the two cannons his forces had brought, but they had been taken and held. With a few remaining horsemen Tarleton rode back into the fight, but after clashing with Washingtonâ€™s men, he too retreated from the field.[4] He was stopped by Washington himself, who attacked him with his saber, calling out, "Where is now the boasting Tarleton?". A cornet of the 17th, Thomas Patterson, rode up to strike Washington but was shot by Washington's orderly trumpeter. Tarleton shot Washington's horse from under him and fled, ending the battle.[57] It was now 8:00 a.m. and the Battle of Cowpens had lasted approximately one hour.[4] In his retreat, Tarleton was able to escape capture by forcing a local planter named Adam Goudylock to serve as a guide.[58]
