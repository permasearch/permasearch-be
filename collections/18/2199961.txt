On the basis of a rebellion that took place during the Ahom King Sunyeophaa's reign, as described by renowned historian Dr SK Bhuyan in his book Konwar Bidroh, Phani Sarma wrote a historical drama Bhogjara. His first film Joymati had also revolved around historical events in the Ahom kingdom and its director whom Sarma had worked under, Jyoti Prasad Agarwala was the pioneer among such a new wave of dramatists. With local plots, he wrote a number of dramas like Sonit Kunwari, Karengar Ligiri, Lobhita, etc. Following in Jyotiprasad's footsteps, Phani Sarma wrote a number of dramas with cultural familiarity to the Assamese people. With his own dramatic approach and treatment, Bhogjara became successful in its own right as a powerful drama.
