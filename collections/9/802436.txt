The character of Lisa has been known since 2015, but former friend Sonia Albright (Kiza Deen) has been pretending to be her.[15] Lisa has been billed as "a loud and brassy party animal" and "is on a mission to claim back the family that is rightfully hers".[13] Rachel Adedeji was cast in the role of Lisa and had already begun filming with the show when her casting was announced.[13] Adedeji stated she was "excited" to have joined the show's cast, but said it was "quite a pressure" to be introduced as Lisa because "she is such an anticipated arrival".[13] Adedeji added that Lisa's backstory had "turned her into a tough cookie".[13] Adedeji's agent informed her that Hollyoaks were interested in hiring her. She attended a meeting with production and read for the part. Adedeji told Lorraine Kelly that her character has "sass" and is "feisty".[16]
