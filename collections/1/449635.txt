A popular way of increasing one's vitamin B intake is through the use of dietary supplements. B vitamins are commonly added to energy drinks, many of which have been marketed with large amounts of B vitamins[28] with claims that this will cause the consumer to "sail through your day without feeling jittery or tense."[28] Some nutritionists have been critical of these claims, pointing out for instance that while B vitamins do "help unlock the energy in foods," most Americans acquire the necessary amounts easily in their diets.[28]
