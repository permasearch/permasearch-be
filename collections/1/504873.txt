Four days after Harvick's Daytona 500 win in his first race with Shell-Pennzoil as the primary sponsors, his team owner Richard Childress was asked by NASCAR to downsize the Shell logo on his fire suit and to have Harvick wear a more prominent Pennzoil logo, in an effort to play down any perceived competition with NASCAR fuel supplier Sunoco. This company asked NASCAR to talk with Childress after Harvick won both the Nationwide Series and Sprint Cup Series races wearing a prominent Shell logo on his fire suit.[8] For the rest of the season, Harvick won the Sprint All-Star Race and finished 10th in points.
