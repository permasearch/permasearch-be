The fan vote allowed two drivers to transfer the main event.  Originally scheduled for one driver voted by the fan vote, the rules called for a second in 2016 because of a quirk in the eligibility.  There were 16 drivers eligible for the All-Star Race, so the rules were designed so the three Showdown winners and the fan vote winner would make it 20.  With Jeff Gordon, eligible by the November 2015 Martinsville win, retired, the runner-up in the fan vote was chosen to advance.  If special circumstances warranted the withdrawal of another eligible driver, the third (and subsequent) placed driver in the fan vote would have also advanced.
