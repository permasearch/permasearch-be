Group Date: Kat, Clare, Cassandra, Danielle, Alli, Andi, Sharleen, Chelsie, and Kelly. They meet with Juan Pablo at a river with a date card saying, "Can you go with the flow?"  They ride a traditional Vietnamese boat down the river. They are paired into four teams which were Kat & Andi, Cassandra & Danielle, Alli & Chelsie and Sharleen & Kelly. Some were mad that Clare didn't have a teammate, and was partnered with Juan Pablo instead, having struggled on a paddle boat reaching a grassy point. Then, they traveled to Tra Que Village and participate in traditional Vietnamese customs like giving Vietnamese hats, eating Vietnamese food for lunch, and farm work. Later that night, Juan Pablo and the girls on the date have a night of partying. Juan Pablo asks Clare to take a night dip in a pool, and she receives the rose.  Shortly after the date ended, Clare found Juan Pablo and asked if he wanted to swim in the ocean with her at night. He agreed and the two took a dip into the ocean.
