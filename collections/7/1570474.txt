The synaptic vesicles of acetylcholine are clear core synaptic vesicles with a diameter of 30Â nm. Each acetylcholine vesicle contains approximately 5000 acetylcholine molecules. The vesicles release their entire quantity of acetylcholine and this causes miniature end plate potentials (MEPPs) to occur which are less than 1mV in amplitude and not enough to reach threshold.[7]
