The covering factor of the torus might play an important role. Some torus models[37][38] predict how Seyfert 1s and Seyfert 2s can obtain different covering factors from a luminosity- and accretion rate- dependence of the torus covering factor, something supported by studies in the x-ray of AGN.[39] The models also suggest an accretion-rate dependence of the broad-line region and provide a natural evolution from more active engines in Seyfert 1s to more “dead” Seyfert 2s[40] and can explain the observed break-down of the unified model at low luminosities[41] and the evolution of the broad-line region.[42]
