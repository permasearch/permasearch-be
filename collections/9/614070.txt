For the mid-season finale of the show's third season, Leighton Meester was dressed in an Escada coat, a Valentino bag, black fleece Brooks Brothers skirt, black Falke fishnet tights, and Lanvin pumps. Meester also sported an Alexander McQueen dogstooth print blouse for the episode. InStyle praised Meester's attire, calling it "an eyeful of style".[2]
