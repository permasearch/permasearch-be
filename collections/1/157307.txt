The 2017 Democracy index registered the worst year for global democracy since 2010â€“11 in the aftermath of the global economic and financial crisis.[citation needed] 89 countries experienced a decline in their total score compared with 2016, more than three times as many as the countries that recorded an improvement[citation needed]. Asia was the worst performing region overall, while Venezuela was downgraded from a "hybrid regime" to an "authoritarian regime" and Armenia was reupgraded from an "authoritarian regime" to a "hybrid regime".[11]
