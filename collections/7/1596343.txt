Resham announces to everyone that the hotel rooms have been booked etc. The bus stops and everyone gets off and Annie sees Kushan there. Annie tells him to do something fast because Pooja and Ronit are getting closer and closer. She points at the two and they are drinking chai out of the same cup. Kushan says he can't believe Ronit's taste would be this bad and says he has a plan for Pooja; she'll either have to commit suicide or Ronit will dump her. He tells Annie to make sure Pooja is at the hotel. The episode ends.
