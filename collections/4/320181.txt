The Oakland Raiders were founded as a charter member of the American Football League (AFL) in 1960. The team joined the NFL as a result of the merger in 1970. From 1966 until 1981, it played home games at the Oaklandâ€“Alameda County Coliseum, which it shared with Major League Baseball's Oakland Athletics after that team moved to Oakland in 1968. In 1980 Al Davis, dissatisfied with the stadium situation in Oakland and seeing luxury boxes as the future of the NFL came to an agreement with the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum commission to move the Raiders to Los Angeles. The NFL had refused to let the team move, but a court over-ruled the league, clearing the way for the Raiders to move to Los Angeles and become the Los Angeles Raiders.[7] In 1982, the Raiders (then owned by Al Davis) were approved to relocate from Oakland to Los Angeles. The Raiders played home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum from 1982 to 1994. In 1995, after being unable to secure a new stadium in the Los Angeles area and after a proposed move to Sacramento that involved Davis taking ownership of the Sacramento Kings fell apart the Raiders moved back to Oakland.[8][9]
