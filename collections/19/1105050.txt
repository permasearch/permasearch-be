Prior to its abolition, the ICC issued identification numbers to Motor Carriers (bus lines, trucking companies) which it issued licenses. These identification numbers were generally in the form of ICC MC-000000. When the ICC was dissolved, the function of licensing interstate Motor Carriers was transferred to the U.S. Department of Transportation, so now all motor carriers which have federal licenses have a USDOT number such as USDOT 000000.
