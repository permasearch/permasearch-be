McNulty grew up in the Lauraville neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland. His father was an employee for Bethlehem Steel before being laid off in 1973. After a year of attending Loyola College in Maryland, McNulty joined the Baltimore Police Department when his girlfriend Elena (whom he later married) became pregnant, with his EOD (Entrance on Duty) being on April 5, 1994. In his first few years on the job, he proved himself to be an effective patrolman in the Western District under the command of Major Howard "Bunny" Colvin. After assisting Ray Cole in solving a homicide, he was promoted to detective and assigned to the Homicide Unit, where he was partnered with Bunk Moreland.
