Rome was therefore forced to contend by around 340 BC against both Samnite incursions into their territory and, simultaneously, in a bitter war against their former allies. Rome bested the Latins in the Battle of Vesuvius and again in the Battle of Trifanum,[64] after which the Latin cities were obliged to submit to Roman rule.[65][66] Perhaps due to Rome's lenient treatment of their defeated foe,[63] the Latins submitted largely amicably to Roman rule for the next 200 years.
