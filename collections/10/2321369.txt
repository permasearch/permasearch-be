Colombian cuisine includes the cooking traditions and practices of Colombia's Caribbean shoreline, Pacific coast, mountains, and ranchlands. Colombian cuisine varies regionally and is influenced by the indigenous Chibcha, Spanish, African, Arab and some Asian cuisines.[1][2] Colombia is also one of the world's largest consumers of fruit juices (more than three quarters of a serving each day).[3]
