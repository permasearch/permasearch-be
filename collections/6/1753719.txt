Commercially grown sprouts have been associated with multiple outbreaks of harmful bacteria, including salmonella and toxic forms of Escherichia coli.[18] Such infections, which are so frequent in the United States that investigators call them "sproutbreaks",[18] may be a result of contaminated seeds or of unhygienic production with high microbial counts.[19][20] Sprout seeds can become contaminated in the fields where they are grown, and sanitizing steps may be unable to kill bacteria hidden in damaged seeds.[18] A single surviving bacterium in a kilogram of seed can be enough to contaminate a whole batch of sprouts, according to the FDA.[18]
