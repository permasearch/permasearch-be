The British Broadcasting Company began transmitting radio news from London in 1922, dependent entirely, by law, on the British news agencies.[142] BBC radio marketed itself as a news by and for social elites, and hired only broadcasters who spoke with upper-class accents.[143] The BBC gained importance in the May 1926 general strike, during which newspapers were closed and the radio served as the only source of news for an uncertain public. (To the displeasure of many listeners, the BBC took an unambiguously pro-government stance against the strikers).[142][144]
