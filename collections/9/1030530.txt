Willow fills everyone in about the body she found, and about Percy talking badly about her. After she shows everyone the symbol carved into the student's chest, Giles says it is definitely the end of the world again. Buffy hunts down this demon, and finds it at a mausoleum where it is collecting the bones of a small child. She fights with the demon, but it escapes and she runs into Riley. He tries to convince her to give a relationship between them a chance, but because of all the pain in her past, she tells him no. Research leads them to find that the demon needs the blood of a man, the bones of a child, and the Word of Valios to perform a ritual called the 'Sacrifice of Three', which will destroy the world. Riley talks to his team and sends them out to find and kill the demon.
