Beca is invited to join the Bellas by current senior co-leaders Aubrey and Chloe Beale (Brittany Snow), but she declines. Later, Chloe discovers Becaâ€™s talent for singing and convinces her to audition, and Beca reluctantly does so by singing "Cups (When I'm Gone)" and joins with Cynthia Rose (Ester Dean), Stacie (Alexis Knapp), Lilly (Hana Mae Lee), and Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson), but Kori and Mary Elise were kicked out for having sex with a Treblemaker the next day. Meanwhile, Jesse is also revealed to have joined the Treblemakers.
