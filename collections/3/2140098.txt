Because of the high pressure, the depth to which a diver can descend without special equipment is limited. The deepest recorded made by a skin diver is 127 m (417 ft).[12] Revolutionary new diving suits, such as the "JIM suit," allows divers to reach depths up to approximately 600 m (1,969 ft).[20] Some additional suits feature thruster packs that boost a diver to different locations underwater.[21]
