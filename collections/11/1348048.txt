Las Vegas Boulevard is a major, world-famous road in the Las Vegas Valley of Nevada, best known for the Las Vegas Strip portion of the road and its casinos. Formerly carrying U.S. Route 91 (USÂ 91), which had been the main highway between Los Angeles and Salt Lake City, it has been bypassed by Interstate 15, and serves mainly local traffic with some sections designated State Route 604.
