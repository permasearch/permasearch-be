Link was planned to appear together with Samus Aran in Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, but was later removed.[48] Incarnations of Link from The Legend of Zelda, The Wind Waker, Twilight Princess and Tri Force Heroes also appear as "Mystery Mushroom" costumes in Super Mario Maker, which are unlocked by completing the 100 Mario Challenge or by scanning the respective Amiibo figures.[49][50][51]
