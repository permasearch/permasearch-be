Cautery is described in the Hippocratic Corpus.[4] Abu Al-Qasim Al-Zahrawi developed techniques and instruments for cauterization and described them in his book Al-Tasrif and these continued to influence medical world for five centuries. The cautery was employed for almost every possible purpose in ancient times: as a counter-irritant, as a haemostatic, as a bloodless knife, as a means of destroying tumours, etc.[5] Later, special medical instruments called cauters were used to cauterize arteries. The technique of ligature of the arteries as an alternative to cauterization was later improved and used more effectively by Ambroise Par√©.
