The cover for the album is an image of an artwork by Boyd Elder, also known as "El Chingadero".[14] Elder created artwork of painted skulls in the early 1970s, and pieces of his work, titled "American Fetish", were exhibited in an art gallery in Venice, California in 1972. Among those who attended the opening were members of the Eagles who performed "Witchy Woman" at the show, an early appearance by the band as the Eagles.[14][15] Elder was also a friend of the album cover designer Gary Burden, who had been responsible for the Eagles' three previous albums and who was interested in using one of Elder's pieces for this cover.[16] Elder presented two of his works to the Eagles in Dallas in late 1974, one of which was then chosen for the cover of One of These Nights.[17] Later another work of Elder, an image of an eagle's skull, would be used for the cover of Their Greatest Hits album. The painted animal skull motif was also used in the cover for their compilation album The Very Best of, and the skull of One of These Nights was used for the cover of the documentary History of the Eagles.
