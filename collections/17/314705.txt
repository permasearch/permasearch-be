In the medieval Islamic world, an elementary school was known as a maktab, which dates back to at least the 10th century.[citation needed] Like madaris (which referred to higher education), a maktab was often attached to an endowed mosque. In the 11th century, the famous Persian Islamic philosopher and teacher Ibn S카n훮 (known as Avicenna in the West), in one of his books, wrote a chapter about the maktab entitled "The Role of the Teacher in the Training and Upbringing of Children," as a guide to teachers working at maktab schools. He wrote that children can learn better if taught in classes instead of individual tuition from private tutors, and he gave a number of reasons for why this is the case, citing the value of competition and emulation among pupils, as well as the usefulness of group discussions and debates. Ibn S카n훮 described the curriculum of a maktab school in some detail, describing the curricula for two stages of education in a maktab school.[17]
