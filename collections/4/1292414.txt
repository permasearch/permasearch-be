Jainism views attachments to material or emotional possessions as what leads to passions, which in turn leads to violence.[7] According to the aparigraha principle, a Jain monk or nun is expected to be homeless and family-less with no emotional longings or attachments.[41] The ascetic is a wandering mendicant in the Digambara tradition, or a resident mendicant in the Śvētāmbara tradition.[41]
