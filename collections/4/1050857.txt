Combs became an intern at New York's Uptown Records.[14] While talent director at Uptown, he helped develop Jodeci and Mary J. Blige.[15] In his college days Combs had a reputation for throwing parties, some of which attracted up to a thousand participants.[16] In 1991, Combs promoted an AIDS fundraiser with Heavy D held at the City College of New York (CCNY) gymnasium, following a charity basketball game. The event was oversold, and a stampede occurred in which nine people died.[17]
