In 1589, the church was partially destroyed by an earthquake. Because the roof had collapsed, the Dominican friars decided to build a larger church made from stronger materials.[3] Through the direction of Father Alonzo Jiménez, the second church was made from stone. Contributions were given by Captain Castillo, María Pérez, and Captain Domingo Mendiola.. The church was inaugurated on April 9, 1592.[3][4]
