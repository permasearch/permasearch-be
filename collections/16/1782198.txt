At some later point, Jack Shephard and his mother learn of Claire Littleton's existence when they find her name in Christian's last will and testament.  Soon afterward, partly by chance and partly through Desmond's machinations, Claire and Jack find each other, and Jack has her stay with him and his son David (Dylan Minnette), as they are family.
