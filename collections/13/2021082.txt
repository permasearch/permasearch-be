On August 5, 2011, the combined cloud of three consecutive CMEs produced brilliant auroras, reported as far south as Oklahoma and Alabama. The geomagnetic storm reached a G4 (severe) level, enough to make power outages. It was one of the strongest geomagnetic storms in years. In the southern hemisphere, auroras could have been seen as far north as South Africa, Southern Chile and Southern Australia. The CMEs were hurled by three M-class flares erupted in active sunspot 1261: M1.4 on August 2, M6.0 on August 3 and M9.3 on August 4.[37][38][39]
