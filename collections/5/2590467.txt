Since        x →      {\displaystyle {\vec {x}}}   and        k →      {\displaystyle {\vec {k}}}   are conjugate variables (with respect to the Fourier transform) we can use the Nyquist theorem to show that the step in k-space determines the field of view of the image (maximum frequency that is correctly sampled) and the maximum value of k sampled determines the resolution; i.e.,
