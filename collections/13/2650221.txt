The act introduced a means-tested method of payment for students based on the amount of money their families earned. Students whose families earned less than £23,000 would be exempt from fees whilst those families earning between £23,000 and £35,000 a year would be charged a percentage of the fees on a sliding scale. Those families who earned over £35,000 a year would be charged the full fees which amounted to £1,000 a year.[13] The maximum fees rose in line with inflation, reaching £1225 in 2007–08.[10] Starting with 1999-2000, maintenance grants for living expenses would also be replaced with loans and paid back at a rate of 9 percent of a graduate's income above £10,000.[11] All loans would be government funded and administered by the Student Loans Company, the organisation responsible for administering loans throughout the UK.[14][note 2]
