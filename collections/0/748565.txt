Louisiana was transferred to the Spanish government in 1762.[113] Because of the good relations between France and Spain, and their common Catholic religion, some Acadians chose to take oaths of allegiance to the Spanish government.[114] Soon the Acadians comprised the largest ethnic group in Louisiana.[115] They settled first in areas along the Mississippi River, then later in the Atchafalaya Basin, and in the prairie lands to the westâ€”a region later renamed Acadiana. During the 19th century, as Acadians reestablished their culture, "Acadian" was elided locally into "Cajun".
