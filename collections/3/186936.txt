Seasonally, summers are generally hot and humid throughout the entire region. The Bermuda High pumps hot and moist air mass from the tropical Atlantic Ocean and eastern Gulf of Mexico westward toward the southeast United States, creating the typical sultry tropical summers. Daytime highs are often in the upper 80's to lower 90's F.[3][4] Rainfall is increasingly summer concentrated as one moves southward, reaching a sharp summer monsoon like pattern over Florida. Sunshine is abundant across the southeastern United States in summer, as the rainfall comes in quick, but intense tropical downpours.
