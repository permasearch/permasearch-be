When the team was founded in 1960, the Oakland Tribune held a name-the-team contest. The winning name was the Oakland Señors.[79] After a few days of being the butt of local jokes (and accusations that the contest was fixed, as Chet Soda was fairly well known within the Oakland business community for calling his acquaintances "señor"), the fledgling team (and its owners) changed the team's name nine days later[80] to the Oakland Raiders, which had finished third in the naming contest.[81] Chet Soda hired a well known sportswriter, Gene Lawrence Perry as the first Director of Public Relations.[82]  Perry (who was hired in 1959 as the first front office hire) commissioned an unknown Berkeley artist and asked that a logo be created which included a helmeted man with an eyepatch, with the firm chin of a Randolph Scott,[83] a well known Westerns actor. The new owner’s had their newly minted Raiders logo, a pirate wearing a football helmet with an eye patch on a gold football background with two white swords in black trim with gold handles criss-crossed behind the football.
