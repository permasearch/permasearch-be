Long-time trainer Gil Reyes has been called one of Agassi's closest friends; some have described him as being a "father figure" to Agassi.[145][146] In 2012, Agassi and Reyes introduced their own line of fitness equipment, BILT By Agassi and Reyes.[147] In December 2008, Agassi's childhood friend and former business manager, Perry Rogers, sued Graf for $50,000 in management fees he claimed that she owed him.[148][149]
