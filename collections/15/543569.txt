For the past ten years, the Philippines has experienced a number of extremely damaging tropical cyclones, particularly typhoons with more than 20 km/h (12 mph; 11 kn; 5.6 m/s) of sustained winds. Because of this, the Super Typhoon (STY) category with more than 220 km/h (140 mph; 120 kn; 61 m/s) maximum sustained winds was officially adopted by the PAGASA. However, according to different stakeholders, the extensive and devastating damages caused by strong typhoons such as Typhoon Yolanda in 2013 made the four‑level warning system inadequate.
