"Can You Feel My Heart" has also been included in several commentators' lists of the best Bring Me the Horizon songs â€“ Alternative Press included it at number two on their list in May 2015,[20] Loudwire ranked it at number six in May 2014,[21] and AXS named it the seventh best in May 2015.[22] Metal Hammer writer Luke Morton ranked it the fifth best song by the band, highlighting it as "the point the metal game changed" due to its use of electronics, which he claimed was "the finest use of electronics ever in a BMTH song".[23]
