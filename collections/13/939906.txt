The UEFA Europa League, formerly the UEFA Cup, is an association football competition established in 1971 by UEFA.[1] It is considered the second most important international competition for European clubs, after the UEFA Champions League. Clubs qualify for the Europa League based on their performance in national leagues and cup competitions. For the first 25 years of the competition, the final was contested over two legs, one at each participating club's stadium, but in 1998, Internazionale defeated Lazio in the competition's first single-legged final held at a neutral venue, the Parc des Princes in Paris.[2] Tottenham Hotspur won the inaugural competition in 1972, defeating Wolverhampton Wanderers 3â€“2 on aggregate.[3] Nine finals have featured teams from the same national association: Italy (1990, 1991, 1995 and 1998), Spain (2007 and 2012), England (1972), Germany (1980) and Portugal (2011).
