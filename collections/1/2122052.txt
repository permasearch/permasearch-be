Pregnancy loss is a broad term that describes miscarriage, ectopic and molar pregnancies.[99] The term fetal death applies variably in different countries and contexts, sometimes incorporating weight, and gestational age from 16 weeks in Norway, 20 weeks in the US and Australia, 24 weeks in the UK to 26 weeks in Italy and Spain.[126][127][128] A fetus that died before birth after this gestational age may be referred to as a stillbirth.[126] Under UK law, all stillbirths should be registered,[129] although this does not apply to miscarriages.
