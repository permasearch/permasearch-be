The mistranslation of pithos, a large storage jar, as "box"[12] is usually attributed to the sixteenth century humanist Erasmus of Rotterdam when he translated Hesiod's tale of Pandora into Latin. Hesiod's pithos refers to a large storage jar, often half-buried in the ground, used for wine, oil or grain.[13] It can also refer to a funerary jar.[14] Erasmus, however, translated pithos into the Latin word pyxis, meaning "box".[15] The phrase "Pandora's box" has endured ever since.
