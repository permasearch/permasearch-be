The TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition was first publicly referenced in October 2012 in a tweet from TI.[5][6] Even though this tweet had gone unnoticed, in November 2012, it was discovered[7] through a leak from a pilot class that TI was developing a color-screen TI-84 Plus, tentatively called the TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition. It has a high-resolution 320x240-pixel color screen, a modified version of the 2.55MP operating system, a rechargeable battery and keystroke compatibility with existing math and programming tools. It has the standard 2.5mm I/O port and a mini-USB port. More details about the calculator's math and programming features were published when TI began distributing review models in February 2013,[8] and even more when the calculator was released in 2013.
