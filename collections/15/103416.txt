It is illustrated that Angela has a love of learning, as seen in "Ben Franklin" where she is the only female intently listening to the Ben Franklin impersonator, "Diwali" where she takes a cautious interest in learning more about Hindu religion and culture (although she also makes ignorant comments about the religion and Indian food, specifically whining that the naan at the Diwali party is dry), and "The Job" in which she enthusiastically participates in Dwight's lecture on soil.
