In Darkest Night, it is revealed that along with all the other cats who were drowned by Darktail, Needletail was not granted entry into StarClan, nor the Place of No Stars. Instead, she has been sent to an unnamed residence where she connects with Tree, to who she admits she was wrong to trust Darktail, and later her childhood friend, Alderheart, giving him a prophecy to not dispel the incoming shadows. Upon doing so, Needletail and the other cats are allowed into StarClan. In River of Fire, Needletail, despite having previously acknowledged her mistakes, continues to blame Rowanstar for ShadowClan's downfall for being a "weak leader". Shadowstar rebukes her statement, saying there is more to it than that, and Needeltail seemingly accepts her point.
