The p-chart only accommodates "pass"/"fail"-type inspection as determined by one or more go-no go gauges or tests, effectively applying the specifications to the data before they are plotted on the chart.  Other types of control charts display the magnitude of the quality characteristic under study, making troubleshooting possible directly from those charts.
