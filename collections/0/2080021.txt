Nemo me impune lacessit was the Latin motto of the Royal Stuart dynasty of Scotland from at least the reign of James VI when it appeared on the reverse side of merk coins minted in 1578 and 1580.[1][2] It is the adopted motto of the Order of the Thistle and of three Scottish regiments of the British Army.[3] The motto also appears, in conjunction with the collar of the Order of the Thistle, in later versions of the Royal coat of arms of the Kingdom of Scotland and subsequently in the version of the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom used in Scotland. It means No one "cuts" (attacks/assails) me with impunity, and has been loosely rendered in Scots as Wha daur meddle wi me?[4] (in Scottish Gaelic Cha togar m' fhearg gun dìoladh, Scottish Gaelic pronunciation: [xa t̪okəɾ mɛɾak kuɲ tʲiəl̪ˠəɣ]). It is also alternatively translated into English as No one can harm me unpunished.
