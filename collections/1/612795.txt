The song's music video was shown in heavy rotation on MTV,[26] introducing the revamped Yes lineup and sound to a new generation of fans largely unfamiliar with the band's very different earlier work, which had helped to define the genre of progressive rock. The music video was directed by graphic designer Storm Thorgerson[27] who, as part of Hipgnosis, had previously designed the covers for the band's albums Going for the One and Tormato.  The video starred actor Danny Webb.
