Bubbles are her character's main theme. When she first appears, she is surrounded by bubbles as she sings to Fiona. When Shrek uses her card to ask for help, a voice mail message of her appears with her saying "Is it on? Is it on?" she is again surrounded by a bubble, which then shows an image of the Fairy Godmother's cottage. After the message ends, the bubble bursts. Finally when the Fairy Godmother "dies," she bursts into a host of bubbles. Her death later influences Charming to get revenge by taking over Far Far Away.
