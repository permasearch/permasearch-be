Following its home video release, "Brawl in the Family" received negative reviews from critics. Aaron Peck of High-Def Digest criticized the episode for being unoriginal, writing "Homer is always doing something that jeopardizes his marriage to Marge. When Homer's 'Vegas Wife' shows up unexpectedly [...] the same thing happens. This is a storyline that has worn out its welcome, but it still continues."[9] 411Mania's Ron Martin described the episode as having a "ridiculous set up".[10] Andre Dellamorte of Collider thought negatively of the episode as well, calling it "Mannered to the point of ridiculousness."[8] While he didn't consider it the worst episode he's ever seen, he criticized the episode's pacing and lack of satire, writing "it’s just that the plates spin so fast and so pointlessly that it becomes just about the gags. [...] the satire is gone; it’s just incident after incident to set up gags (some of which are funny) and get the show to an end time."[8]
