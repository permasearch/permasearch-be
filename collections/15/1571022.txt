In 1934, Krishnamacharya authored the book titled Yoga Makaranda, which was published by Mysore University. In the introduction to Yoga Makaranda, Krishnamacharya lists Sritattvanidhi, a 19th-century treatise containing a yoga section by Maharaja of Mysore, Krishnaraja Wodeyar III (1794â€“1868) as one of the sources for his book. In The Yoga Tradition of the Mysore Palace, Norman Sjoman asserts that Krishnamacharya was influenced by the Sritattvanidhi and also the Vyayama Dipika, a Western-based gymnastics manual written by the Mysore Palace gymnasts.[32]
