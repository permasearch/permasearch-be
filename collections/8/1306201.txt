Ballet developed as a performance-focused art form in France during the reign of Louis XIV, who was passionate about dance.[14] Pierre Beauchamp, the man who codified the five basic positions of the feet in ballet, was the king's personal dance teacher and favorite partner in ballet de cour in the 1650s.[15] In 1661 Louis XIV, who was determined to reverse a decline in dance standards that began in the 17th century, established the Acad√©mie Royale de Danse.[14] Beauchamp was appointed Intendant des ballets du roi and in 1680 became the director of the dance academy, a position he held until 1687.[15]
