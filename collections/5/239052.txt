As of 2017, College Board charged $0.42 per name for access to student information.[27] Investigation by the New York Civil Liberties Union revealed that one of College Board's customers was JAMRS, a military recruitment program run by the United States Department of Defense.[28] College Board and ACT have been sued over the use of this information.[29] In addition there is criticism that students aren't sufficiently made aware that their data is being sold.[citation needed]
