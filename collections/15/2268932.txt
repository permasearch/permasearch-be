However, many commentators criticised the lack of invention on the album. Mason panned it for featuring "generally unimaginative songwriting", which he claimed added "little to the existing knowledge base" of the genre.[10] He also criticised Sykes's vocal style on the record, which he described as an "immediately irritating" and a "high-pitched gibber".[10] Similarly, Bowar dubbed the album "way too generic and repetitive", claiming that it features "too many breakdowns" and a majority of "extremely forgettable" songs.[6] Axl Rosenberg of MetalSucks complained that the band displayed "nothing to distinguish them from the pack" on the album, although he did praise the presence of "some decent breakdowns" and claim that the songs would make "good background noise".[8]
