Demons in the series are generally portrayed as cruel and sadistic, often taking pleasure in causing humans pain. They are also, as series creator Eric Kripke deems them, "erudite and sophisticated".[22] While the "tyrant" Azazel commanded the demons in the first two seasons,[23] demons as a whole became the villains of the third season.[24] At times their culture has been compared to normal humans, with the third-season episode "Sin City" introducing their religious side. They believe in their own higher powerâ€”Lucifer.[25] Though many demons came to lose faith,[26] they followed the fallen angel upon his release from Hell in the fifth season.
