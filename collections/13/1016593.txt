Originally, Lafferty would bring potential real estate customers to the howdah (carriage) at the top, where he could point out parcels available for sale.[6] Today, visitors to the roadside attraction may take guided tours through the building and access the howdah, which now serves as an observation deck, offering unique views of Margate, Atlantic City's skyline, the beach, and the Atlantic Ocean.
