Originally called the United States Interregional Women’s League, the W-League was formed in 1995 as the first national women's soccer league, providing a professional outlet for many of the top female soccer players in the country. Starting as the Western Division of the W-League, the Women’s Premier Soccer League broke away and formed its own league in 1997 and had its inaugural season in 1998. Both the W-League and the WPSL were considered the premier women’s soccer leagues in the United States at the time, but eventually fell to a “second-tier” level upon the formation of the Women’s United Soccer Association in 2000.
