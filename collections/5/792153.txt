Having previously worked as a builder, Anderson and his partner Rachel moved south to run the Wellington Arms public house in Rooks Bridge, Somerset, for fellow PDC player Steve Grubb.[163] The couple have a son Tai (born 2014),[164] and in October 2017 welcomed a baby girl. Regulars at the Wellington Arms included former world champions, Trina Gulliver and Mark Webster.[162] After handing over running of the pub in 2016 to a new manager to allow Andersen to fully commit to his darts career, the family have since resided Burnham on Sea, Somerset.
