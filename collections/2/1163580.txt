This gave the Lions the first overall pick to draft Heisman Trophy winner Billy Sims from Oklahoma. Detroit also drafted quarterback Eric Hipple in the 4th round of the draft who became the Lions starting quarterback for most of the decade. Detroit improved immediately in 1980 jumping to a 9-7 record which unfortunately wasn't good enough to qualify for the playoffs. The  next year the Lions finished 8-8 again failing to qualify for the playoffs.
