Anglican eucharistic theology is diverse in practice, reflecting the comprehensiveness of Anglicanism. Its sources include prayer book rubrics, writings on sacramental theology by Anglican divines, and the regulations and orientations of ecclesiastical provinces. The principal source material is the Book of Common Prayer; specifically, its eucharistic prayers; and Article XXVIII of the Thirty-Nine Articles. Article XXVIII comprises the foundational Anglican doctrinal statement about the eucharist, although its interpretation varies amongst churches of the Anglican Communion, as well as between those of Anglo-Catholic and Evangelical churchmanship.
