When the U.S. joined in World War I, an anti-German hysteria quickly spread in American society. German-Americans, especially immigrants, were blamed for military acts of the German Empire, and even speaking German was seen as unpatriotic. Many German-American families anglicized their names (e.g. from Schmidt to Smith, Schneider to Taylor, MÃ¼ller to Miller), and German nearly disappeared in public. Many states forbade the use of German in public and the teaching of German in schools.
