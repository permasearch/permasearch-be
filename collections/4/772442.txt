In Loco Motives, Grissom and his team were brought to the scene of the murder of a janitor, found lying face-first in a basin of shallow water at a chicken processing plant. The basin, the CSIs learned, was a stun bath, used to paralyze chickens before killing them by putting an electric current through the water. When Raymundo landed in the water, he became paralyzed long enough to drown.
