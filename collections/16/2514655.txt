Each trustee also appoints two members to the Participant Local Government Advisory Council (PLGAC), which reviews the administration of the local government investment pool known as Florida Prime.[17] The PLGAC was statutorily created as an additional measure to ensure that the Pool is operated and managed in the best interest of investors in the fund. The Board of Trustees appoints six members to serve on the PLGAC for four-year terms, subject to confirmation by the Florida Senate.[18]
