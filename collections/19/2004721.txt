Shortly after she had received the habit of the Daughters of Charity, Sr Justine was sent to teach the poor in Blangy. On September 8, 1840 (the Feast of the Nativity of Mary), while Sr Justine was at prayer, the Virgin Mary again appeared, holding in her right hand her heart surrounded by flames, and in her left a type of scapular consisting of a single piece of green cloth strung on green cords. On the cloth was an image of the Virgin as she had appeared to Sr Justine, holding her heart in her right hand. On the cloth's reverse was "a Heart all ablaze with rays more dazzling than the sun and as transparent as crystal". The heart was pierced by a sword, surmounted by a gold cross and with words in the shape of an oval around the heart: "Immaculate Heart of Mary, pray for us now and at the hour of our death". Sr Justine heard an interior voice say that the Virgin Mary wished the scapular to be promoted widely as an instrument in the conversion of souls.[5] Sr Justine told her superior about the visions and, subsequently, her spiritual director, Jean-Marie Aladel, C.M..
