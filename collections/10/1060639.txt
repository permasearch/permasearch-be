Spice trade involving spices native to India—including cinnamon and black pepper—gained momentum as India started shipping spices to the Mediterranean.[6] Roman trade with India followed as detailed by the archaeological record and the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea.[6] Chinese sericulture attracted Indian sailors during the early centuries of the common era.[6] Crystallised sugar was discovered by the time of the Guptas (320-550 CE),[47] and the earliest reference of candied sugar come from India.[48] The process was soon transmitted to China with traveling Buddhist monks.[48] Chinese documents confirm at least two missions to India, initiated in 647 CE, for obtaining technology for sugar-refining.[49] Each mission returned with results on refining sugar.[49] Indian spice exports find mention in the works of Ibn Khurdadhbeh (850), al-Ghafiqi (1150), Ishak bin Imaran (907) and Al Kalkashandi (fourteenth century).[50]
