Service: For the first time in Hell's Kitchen history, breakfast would be served as in main service instead of dinner. The customers were emergency medical technicians and emergency room personnel, and the first team to complete service would win. The women took a huge early lead as Ray underseasoned scrambled eggs and Jeremy served one of Ramsay's sample dishes. However, Nedra struggled on Eggs Benedict until Amanda helped her and Jacqueline burned pancakes. The men caught up, and due to Jacqueline again burning pancakes for the final ticket, finished their service first, earning them their second successive service win.
