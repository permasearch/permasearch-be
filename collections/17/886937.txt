The first stage is called roughing, which produces a rougher concentrate. The objective is to remove the maximum amount of the valuable mineral at as coarse a particle size as practical.[23] The finer an ore is ground, the greater the energy that is required, so it makes sense to fine grind only those particles that need fine grinding.[23] Complete liberation is not required for rougher flotation, only sufficient liberation to release enough gangue from the valuable mineral to get a high recovery.[23]
