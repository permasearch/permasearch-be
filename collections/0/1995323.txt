Rodrigo Duterte revealed in June 2016 that Ramos was the one who pushed him to run for office so that 'Mindanao will finally have a Filipino president'. On 23 July 2016, Ramos was appointed by President Rodrigo Duterte as the Philippine Envoy to China to strengthen bilateral ties again after a much-heated diplomatic war over the West Philippine Sea. On 1 November 2016, however, Ramos, stating that he miscalculated the possibilities and effects of a Duterte presidency, sent his resignation due to Duterte's drug war which has killed at least 8,000 Filipino drug suspects at the time. President Duterte accepted his resignation from the post on the same day.[32] He was replaced by veteran journalist Jose Santiago “Chito” Sta. Romana. Months later, Ramos admitted that he made the wrong decision to persuade Rodrigo Duterte to run for president. During that time, Filipino deaths caused by Duterte's Philippine Drug War exceeded 14,000, the worst genocidal government activity since the Marcos dictatorship, which ironically, Ramos pursued to topple during People Power Revolution.[33]
