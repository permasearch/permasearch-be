A new update to the game on May 22, 2017 released a new game mode, known as the "Builder Base". Players can sail to a new island and create a new village, with a different set of buildings.[16] In this mode, two players attack each other's bases simultaneously. The one with the most damage or getting more star gets the gold, elixir, and trophies. You can only win loot from attacks three times in 22 hours, but can continue attacking for trophies afterwards. The player can spend gems for skip the period of time. The progress will be much faster in this base with the introduction of Clock Tower (temporarily speeds the process of upgrading and production) and Gem Mine (spawns gems at a very slow rate).
