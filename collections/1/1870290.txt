A method for checkmate applicable when the lone king is in the corner of the opposite colour from the bishop, was given by Philidor in the 1777 update[5] to his famous 1749 treatise, L'Analyze des Echecs.[6] A method, known as "Delétang's Method" or "Delétang's Triangles",[7] applicable when the lone king is trapped behind one of the seven square diagonals of the same colour as the bishop, involves confining the lone king in a series of three shrinking isosceles right-angled triangles, with the "right" corner at the 90-degree angle of the triangle. Some of the ideas of this method date back to 1780, but the complete system was first published in 1923 by Daniel Delétang.[8] The method as propounded is not optimal, but it's relatively simple; so long as White has trapped the king behind the diagonal in a reasonable number of moves, it will lead to mate before the fifty-move rule takes effect. His "second triangle" or "middle triangle" occurs also in the analysis of play with the king in the corner of opposite colour to the bishop shown in Fine (1941:4), as well as in Philidor's analysis (see below). Fine's analysis improves on Philidor's. Checkmate can be forced without using either method to complete the mate.
