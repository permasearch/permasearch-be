The MP3 lossy compression works by reducing (or approximating) the accuracy of certain parts of a continuous sound that are considered to be beyond the auditory resolution ability of most people. This method is commonly referred to as perceptual coding or "psychoacoustics".[9] It uses psychoacoustic models to discard or reduce the precision of components less audible to human hearing, and then records the remaining information in an efficient manner.
