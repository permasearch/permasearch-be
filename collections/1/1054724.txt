The main keep has two pillars, with one standing in the east and one standing in the west.[5] The east pillar, which has a base diameter of 97 cm (38 in), was originally a single fir tree, but it has since been mostly original.[5] [24] The base of the west pillar is 85 by 95 cm (33 by 37 in), and it is made of Japanese cypress.[5] During the Shōwa Restoration (1956–1964) a Japanese cypress tree with a length of 26.4 m (87 ft) was brought down from the Kiso Mountains and replaced the old pillar.[5] The tree was broken in this process, so another tree was brought down from Mount Kasagata, and the two trees were joined on the third floor.[5]
