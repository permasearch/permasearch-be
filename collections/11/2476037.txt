In August 2014, in response to a complaint to the Metropolitan Police's Operation Yewtree (set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal),[138] Richard's apartment in Berkshire was searched, but there were no arrests. He strongly denied the allegations.[139][140] The BBC was criticised for its coverage of the search.[141] The former Director of Public Prosecutions, Lord Macdonald of River Glaven, QC, criticised the police force for its "completely disreputable conduct" and said its action could make the warrant unlawful.[142] Richard pulled out of a visit to the US Open tennis championships, turned down the freedom of his adopted Portuguese home city of Albufeira, and cancelled a scheduled appearance at Coventry Cathedral because he did not want the event to be "overshadowed by the false allegation".[143] He subsequently returned to the UK and voluntarily met with and was interviewed by members of South Yorkshire Police.[144] He was never arrested or criminally charged.[145] Subsequently, David Crompton, chief constable of South Yorkshire Police, was criticised for his interactions with the BBC, and publicly apologised to Richard.[146]
