COBOL has an English-like syntax, which is used to describe nearly everything in a program. For example, a condition can be expressed as  x IS GREATER THAN y or more concisely as  x GREATER y  or  x > y. More complex conditions can be "abbreviated" by removing repeated conditions and variables. For example,  a > b AND a > c OR a = d  can be shortened to a > b AND c OR = d. As a consequence of this English-like syntax, COBOL has over 300 keywords.[101][c] Some of the keywords are simple alternative or pluralized spellings of the same word, which provides for more English-like statements and clauses; e.g., the IN and OF keywords can be used interchangeably, as can IS and ARE, and VALUE and VALUES.
