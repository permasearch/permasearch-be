"I've Done Everything for You" was a staple of Sammy Hagar's live performances as early as 1977. A live version of the song (running time: 3:35) appeared on the 1978 live album All Night Long and was released as a single (on Capitol P4596 b/w "Someone Out There") but did not chart. (That album was released in the UK in 1979 as Loud & Clear.) In 1979, a studio version was released as a b-side to the non-album single of "(Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay" (a cover of the Otis Redding hit). This studio version was released on LP on the 1982 greatest hits album Rematch following the success of the Rick Springfield version, although Australian pressings of Hagar's 1980 album Danger Zone featured it as a bonus track closing side one.
