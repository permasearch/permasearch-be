The cross-current along the floor of the channel is part of the secondary flow and sweeps dense eroded material towards the inside of the bend.[11] The cross-current then rises to the surface near the inside and flows towards the outside, forming the helical flow. The greater the curvature of the bend, and the faster the flow, the stronger is the cross-current and the sweeping.[12]
