Uhls described the film as a "romantic comedy", explaining, "It has to do with the characters' attitudes toward a healthy relationship, which is a lot of behavior which seems unhealthy and harsh to each other, but in fact does work for themâ€”because both characters are out on the edge psychologically."[14] The Narrator seeks intimacy, but he avoids it with Marla Singer, seeing too much of himself in her.[15] While Marla is a seductive and negativist prospect for the Narrator, he instead embraces the novelty and excitement that comes with befriending Tyler Durden. The Narrator is comfortable being personally connected to Tyler Durden, but he becomes jealous when Tyler becomes sexually involved with Marla. When the Narrator argues with Tyler about their friendship, Tyler tells him that being friends is secondary to pursuing the philosophy they have been exploring.[16] Tyler also suggests doing something about Marla, implying that she is a risk to be removed. When Tyler says this, the Narrator realizes that his desires should have been focused on Marla and begins to diverge from Tyler's path.[15]
