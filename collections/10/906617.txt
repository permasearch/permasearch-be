With Daivari as his manager, the unnamed Singh debuted on WWE television as a villain on the 7 April episode of SmackDown!, attacking The Undertaker and leaving him defenceless during his match with Mark Henry, thus causing a no contest ruling.[22] The following week on SmackDown! he was introduced as The Great Khali and Daivari explained that he finally had a client who would destroy The Undertaker (after Muhammed Hassan and Mark Henry had previously failed).[23] Khali made his in-ring debut on the 21 April episode of SmackDown!, defeating Funaki.[24]
