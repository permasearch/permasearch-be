Nick, Hank, and Wu investigate the death of a woman who aged seventy years overnight, only to learn they are dealing with a Wesen, operating as a photographer, who sucks youthfulness out of young people and regurgitates it as a goo. He sells this goo to a doctor operating a clinic that caters to the youth-obsessed. The doctor has created a successful anti-aging cream, for which he has become dependent. In addition to removing his wrinkles, the dosage he is taking is also making him quite insane. Rosalee goes undercover to help expose the racket. Meanwhile, Eve devises a plan to go undercover as Renard to learn more about his involvement with Black Claw.
