Series creator McNamara calls his show "historical fiction"[16] as it is inspired by Manson but not historically accurate. This is also expressed in the episodes' opening slate. It also contains completely fictional storylines in a period setting and involves historical events, politics, music, and social issues of the era.[16][17] NBC has published a blog of events from 1967 to provide context.[18]
