Fuqua worked to create a diverse cast[14] by incorporating actors of color such as African-American Denzel Washington, Korean Lee Byung-hun and Mexican Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, and making sure the lead female Emma Cullen (Haley Bennett) did not conform to stereotypes.[15][16] It is a decision Fuqua stated reflects historical reality more than it does any conscious attempt to update the story. "There were a lot of black cowboys, a lot of Native Americans; Asians working on the railroads. The truth of the West is more modern than the movies have been."[17] When Fuqua met studio executives to see possible actors for the film, he saw that they were all white. He found this to be problematic and instead wanted to make the cast diverse, so that audiences could identify with more of the characters.[15] The actors were cast between December 2014 and July 2015.[18][19][20][21] At one point, Jason Momoa was in talks to join the project, but had had to leave because he was already booked to play Aquaman.[22] The cast were put through cowboy training before filming commenced,[9] and were sent to boot camp in order to hone their skills.[15]
