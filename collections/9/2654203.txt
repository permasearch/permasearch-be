Sandy confronts Brodie on her crimes, most especially her manipulation of Mary, her part in her senseless death (for which Brodie is unapologetic), and the harmful influence she exerted on other girls, adding that Mary's brother is actually fighting for the Spanish Republicans. Brodie, for her part, makes some harsh but astute comments about Sandy's character, particularly her ability to coldly judge and destroy others. Sandy retorts that Brodie professed to be an admirer of conquerors and walks out of the classroom, with Brodie following her to the landing, screaming "Assassin!!" at Sandy.
