The Chief Minister of Jharkhand, an east Indian state, is the head of the Government of Jharkhand. As per the Constitution of India, the Governor of Jharkhand is the state's de jure head, but de facto executive authority rests with the chief minister. Following elections to the Jharkhand Legislative Assembly, the governor usually invites the party (or coalition) with a majority of seats to form the government. The governor appoints the chief minister, whose council of ministers are collectively responsible to the assembly. Given that he has the confidence of the assembly, the chief minister's term is for five years and is subject to no term limits.[1]
