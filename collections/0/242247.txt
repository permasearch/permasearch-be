In 2003, Carter moved back to Los Angeles and helped Eve get her own show on UPN.[4] The following year, Carter and Erving sold Erving Wonder to British-based firm Sanctuary, with Carter serving as the company's executive vice president. Over the next two years, Erving Wonder's deal with Sanctuary fell apart, Eve fired him, and by 2006, Carter not only lost all the money from the Sanctuary deal, but he was severely in debt. His home mortgage was foreclosed and his car was repossessed.[4] As Carter was facing eviction from his home, record producer Vincent Herbert, who had just left Universal Records, introduced Carter to a new client, then-unknown Lady Gaga, who had just been dropped from Def Jam Records.[4] For the next year, Carter, Herbert, and Gaga went around California, performing at multiple clubs each night with both little money and little support.[5] It was also in 2007 that Carter founded Coalition Media Group, and its management division Atom Factory in 2010.[5]
