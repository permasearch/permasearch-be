In 2002, the discharge petition was successfully used to pass[8] the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, known as McCain–Feingold in the Senate and Shays–Meehan in the House. Starting in 1997, several attempts were made to bring it to the floor via the discharge petition. Once it finally passed then the Senate passed it 60–40, narrowly avoiding a filibuster.[citation needed]
