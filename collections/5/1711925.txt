The Commander format, also known as Elder Dragon Highlander (EDH), uses 100 card singleton decks (no duplicates except basic lands), a starting life total of 40, and features a "Commander" or "General".[57][58] The Commander must be a legendary creature (with some exceptional cases, namely Planeswalkers with text that specifically states they can be your Commander), and all cards in the deck can only have mana symbols on them from the Commander's colors.  The Commander is not included in one's library; it is visible to all players in the "command" zone and can be played as if it was in one's hand. Whenever it would be put into a graveyard or exiled, the Commander's owner may choose to put it back into the "command" zone instead.  A Commander that is cast from the command zone costs an additional 2 generic mana for every other time that Commander has been cast from the command zone that game- this is referred to as "Commander tax" (for example, a 3 mana Commander would cost 3 mana the first time it is cast, 5 mana the 2nd time it is cast, 7 mana the 3rd time, etc). If a player takes 21 combat damage from any one commander, that player loses the game regardless of life total (a rule to bring games to an eventual halt and somewhat keep lifegain in check).  The format has its own official banned list.[58]  Commander is usually a multiplayer format, although a special separate banned list exists for "Duel Commander" balanced for 1v1 matches on Magic Online.[59]
