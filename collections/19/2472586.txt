Functional neuroimaging research has shown that very early bilinguals display no difference in brain activation for L1 and L2â€”which is assumed to be due to high proficiency in both languages. Additionally, in highly proficient late bilinguals, there is a common neural network that plays an important role in language production tasks;[33][37] whereas, in late bilinguals, spatially separated regions are activated in Broca's area for L1 and L2.[32] Finally, it has been found that larger cerebral activation is measured when a language is spoken less fluently than when languages are spoken fluently. Overall, in bilinguals/polyglots, achieved proficiency, and possibly language exposure, are more crucial than age of acquisition in the cerebral representation of languages.[27] However, since age of acquisition has a strong effect on the likelihood of achieving high fluency, these variables are strongly intertwined.
