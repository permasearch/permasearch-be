Following HergÃ©'s death, hundreds more unofficial parodies and pastiches of the Adventures of Tintin were produced, covering a wide variety of different genres.[140] Tom McCarthy divided such works into three specific groupings: pornographic, political, and artistic.[142] In a number of cases, the actual name "Tintin" is replaced by something similar, like Nitnit, Timtim, or Quinquin, within these books.[140]
