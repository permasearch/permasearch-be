Argentine football finally inscribed their name on the winner's list in 1964 when Independiente became the champions after disposing of reigning champions Santos and Uruguayan side Nacional in the finals.[11][12] Independiente successfully defended the title in 1965;[12] Pe√±arol would defeat River Plate in a playoff to win their third title,[7] and Racing would go on to claim the spoils in 1967.[13] One of the most important moments in the tournament's early history occurred in 1968 which saw Estudiantes participate for the first time.[14]
