By 1902, 90% of all the land that makes up Africa was under European control. The large part of the Sahara was French, while after the quelling of the Mahdi rebellion and the ending of the Fashoda crisis, the Sudan remained firmly under joint Britishâ€“Egyptian rulership with Egypt being under British occupation before becoming a British protectorate in 1914.
