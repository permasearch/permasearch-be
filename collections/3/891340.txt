Among the vegetables that come with the hamburger, the first described in the literature on its history is the onion, usually finely sliced in rings.[3][48] Thus, the hamburger came to continue the long American tradition of sandwiches featuring some kind of plant product, whether that be lettuce (as in the case of the BLT sandwich), sauerkraut (as on the reuben), coleslaw, or pickles. It is possible that after the creation of the hamburger by uniting the steak with the bread, vegetables were included to give the finished product a more "natural" appearance and taste.[45] All of these condiments were incorporated into the classical image of the hamburger during its golden age, the 1940s.[45] In some cases, the hamburger is prepared differently and distinctly to add regional flavor, as in the case of Tex-Mex style burgers, which are served with a side of chili con carne.
