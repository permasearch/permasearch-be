On the Sunday before the storm struck, the farmers' forecast had predicted bad weather on the following Thursday or Friday, 15â€“16 October.[9] By midweek, however, guidance from weather prediction models was somewhat equivocal. Instead of stormy weather over a considerable part of the UK, the models suggested that severe weather would reach no farther north than the English Channel and coastal parts of southern England.[9]
