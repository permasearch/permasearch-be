Study of Saturn's moons has also been aided by advances in telescope instrumentation, primarily the introduction of digital charge-coupled devices which replaced photographic plates. For the entire 20th century, Phoebe stood alone among Saturn's known moons with its highly irregular orbit. Beginning in 2000, however, three dozen additional irregular moons have been discovered using ground-based telescopes.[25] A survey starting in late 2000 and conducted using three medium-size telescopes found thirteen new moons orbiting Saturn at a great distance, in eccentric orbits, which are highly inclined to both the equator of Saturn and the ecliptic.[26] They are probably fragments of larger bodies captured by Saturn's gravitational pull.[25][26] In 2005, astronomers using the Mauna Kea Observatory announced the discovery of twelve more small outer moons,[27][28] in 2006, astronomers using the Subaru 8.2Â m telescope reported the discovery of nine more irregular moons,[29] in April 2007, Tarqeq (S/2007 S 1) was announced and in May of the same year S/2007 S 2 and S/2007 S 3 were reported.[30]
