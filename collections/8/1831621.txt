The move of the franchise from Round Rock to Corpus Christi following the 2004 season was made possible when the owners of the Express, Ryan Sanders Baseball, acquired the Triple-A franchise in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada and announced their intention to move the club to Round Rock. That paved the way for the Double-A franchise to relocate to the Gulf Coast of Texas.[3] In 2004 the organization held a "Name the Team" contest that sought suggestions from the community for a new name for the team. The contest was won by Corpus Christi resident, Michael Braly. The team's new name, Corpus Christi Hooks was born. The team's colors are navy blue and light blue, representing the ocean and sky of the popular South Texas fishing area. The team mascots are Sammy the Seagull and Rusty Hook. The Hooks have played every home game since the move to Corpus Christi at Whataburger Field.
