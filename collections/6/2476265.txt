The earliest unambiguous crab fossils date from the Jurassic,[9] although Carboniferous Imocaris, known only from its carapace, may be a primitive crab.[10] The radiation of crabs in the Cretaceous and afterward may be linked either to the break-up of Gondwana or to the concurrent radiation of bony fish, crabs' main predators.[11]
