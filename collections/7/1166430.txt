There is a difference between FAR and agency supplements. For example, the FAR focuses on "data" while the DFAR provisions focus on the narrower subset of "technical data". For technical data, DFARS 227.7102-3(b) states "Use the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial Items, in lieu of the clause at 252.227-7015 if the Government will pay any portion of the development costs. ..."  Thus, the Government wouldn't be using that clause if it was not paying some portion of development costs â€“ the question is whether or not this particular item's development costs were in fact paid for by the Government.  It is prudent to make this determination up front in the CLIN structure of a contract for technical data deliverables.
