Cycloid-β (サイクロイド-β, Saikuroido Bēta) and Cycloid-γ (サイクロイド-γ, Saikuroido Ganma), who both appear as secret characters in Street Fighter EX Plus and EX Plus α, are a pair of cyborgs that use the special techniques of other characters. Beta primarily uses command-based special moves, while Gamma specializes in charge-based moves. Both characters were based on test models used for motion capture during the development of the game. Beta is an untextured blue polygonal model resembling a male human, and Gamma is a green wireframed model.[91] In the Japanese version of Street Fighter EX Plus α for the PlayStation, Gamma is given an additional back-story, a weapon secretly developed by Balba (Pullum's father) to annihilate a huge criminal organization.[92] In Street Fighter EX2 Plus, an unidentified Cycloid model appears in one of the bonus rounds.
