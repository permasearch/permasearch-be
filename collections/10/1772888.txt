The Talmud lists the punishment for blaspheming the Ineffable Name of God as death. The sons of Noah are to be executed by decapitation for most crimes,[23] considered one of the lightest capital punishments,[24] by stoning if he has intercourse with a Jewish betrothed woman,[25] or by strangulation if the Jewish woman has completed the marriage ceremonies, but had not yet consummated the marriage.[25] In Jewish law the only form of blasphemy which is punishable by death is blaspheming the Ineffable Name Leviticus 24:16.[26] Some Talmudic rabbis held that only those offences for which a Jew would be executed, are forbidden to gentiles.[27] The Talmudic rabbis discuss which offences and sub-offences are capital offences and which are merely forbidden.[28]
