In January 1985, following on the heels of the Macintosh, the Lisa 2/10 (with integrated 10Â MB hard drive) was re-branded the Macintosh XL and with new software, positioned as Apple's high-end Macintosh. The price was lowered yet again, to $4,000 and sales tripled, but (according to CEO Sculley) Apple would have lost money increasing production to meet the new demand.[23] Apple discontinued the Macintosh XL, leaving an eight-month void in Apple's high-end product line until the Macintosh Plus was introduced in 1986.
