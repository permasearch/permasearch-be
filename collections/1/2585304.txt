Libations poured onto the earth are meant for the dead and for the chthonic gods. In the Book of the Dead in the Odyssey, Odysseus digs an offering pit around which he pours in order honey, wine and water. For the form of libation called choē (from IE *gheu-, Greek cheuma, χεῦμα, "that which is poured"[14]), a larger vessel is tipped over and emptied onto the ground for the chthonic gods, who may also receive spondai.[15] Heroes, who were divinized mortals, might receive blood libations if they had participated in the bloodshed of war, as for instance Brasidas the Spartan.[16] In rituals of caring for the dead at their tombs, libations would include milk and honey.[17]
