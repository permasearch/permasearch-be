The album's art direction was designed by Michael Carney, the brother of drummer Patrick Carney. Michael wanted a change from their illustration-driven covers, and devised a simple approach, littered with messages that identify everything, such as the front saying, "This is an album by The Black Keys. The name of this album is Brothers". Nonesuch was initially perplexed, but once the label's marketing department approved it, he went with it. Michael said taking risks with an unconventional packaging added an incentive to purchasing physical copies, while acknowledging the minimalistic cover also helped with digital copies given "it does jump out on the iTunes page". In 2011, Michael won the Grammy Award for Best Album Package.[22][23] The packaging is designed to resemble a vinyl record jacket, with the old Nonesuch logo on the front cover in the lower left, and the words "STEREO SOUND" in the upper right. The album was released as a 12-inch double LP. The Brothers art was compared to the front cover design of Howlin' Wolf's 1969 album, The Howlin' Wolf Album, which reads, "This is Howlin' Wolf's new album..." Auerbach and Carney have both stated repeatedly that Howlin' Wolf was one of their greatest influences.[24]
