Tunisia players and supporters claim that the Paraguayan referee Carlos Amarilla failed to award Tunisia a penalty kick in the second half and then mistakenly awarded one to Ukraine, which when converted by Andriy Shevchenko resulted in the 1â€“0 win and qualification by Ukraine to the second round. At the time Tunisia was playing with 10 men since Ziad Jaziri was sent off for his second yellow card in the last minute of the first half. The German magazine Spiegel Online described the turn of events this way: "Tunisia went close on 65 minutes after Namouchi was hacked down on the edge of the box. Ayari's left footed free kick deflected off Voronin in the Ukrainian wall and crept just over the bar. Replays suggested the ball hit Voronin's elbow and Tunisia could feel aggrieved not to have been awarded a penalty. Then almost immediately the action switched to the other end when Shevchenko stumbled into the penalty area only to be brought down by Haggui. This time replays suggested Shevchenko fell over his own feet but Amarilla pointed to the spot and Shevchenko made no mistake with the penalty kick. It was tough luck for the Tunisians with two dodgy decisions costing the team badly and with only ten men left on the field the game looked beyond them."[37]
