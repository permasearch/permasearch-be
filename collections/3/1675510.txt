Each fission of a parent atom produces a different set of fission product atoms.  However, while an individual fission is not predictable, the fission products are statistically predictable.  The amount of any particular isotope produced per fission is called its yield, typically expressed as percent per parent fission; therefore, yields total to just over 200% (because of ternary fissions), not 100%.
