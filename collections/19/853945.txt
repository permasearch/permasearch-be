In its original interpretation,[when?] one of the first consequences of implementing the Internet of things by equipping all objects in the world with minuscule identifying devices or machine-readable identifiers would be to transform daily life.[38][39] For instance, instant and ceaseless inventory control would become ubiquitous.[39] A person's ability to interact with objects could be altered remotely based on immediate or present needs, in accordance with existing end-user agreements.[31] For example, such technology could grant motion-picture publishers much more control over end-user private devices by remotely enforcing copyright restrictions and digital rights management, so the ability of a customer who bought a Blu-ray disc to watch the movie could become dependent on the copyright holder's decision, similar to Circuit City's failed DIVX.[citation needed]
