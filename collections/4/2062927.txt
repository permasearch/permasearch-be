For example, she bought out every shoe store in Riverdale so she could have all the shoes which amounted to 200 pairs and so she could be totally exclusive and nobody else could have any shoes. This act of unbridled selfishness angers her father who grounds her indefinitely, orders her to return the shoes and cancels a party she wanted to throw, and she has a nightmare where she remade Riverdale in her own image, calling it Veronicaville. At first the idea of running the town her way, and basically being the queen was fun, but when Betty wore the same outfit she did, she naturally got upset and banished everyone out of town. When they leave for a new town to live in, and finally losing her father, when he leaves for greener pastures and she is left alone, she wakes up and finally wises up. She gives Betty the 200 pairs of shoes and throws the party she scheduled as a birthday party for her. (This was in a story called "The Me-ning of life").
