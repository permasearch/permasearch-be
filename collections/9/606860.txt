The amount of peremptory challenges can also vary according to the circumstances of the jury. The prosecutor and the accused are each entitled to one additional peremptory challenge if there are 13 jurors, or two additional challenges each in the case of 14 jurors (s. 634 (2.01), Criminal Code of Canada). As well, the number of peremptory challenges increases accordingly if the judge makes an order for alternate jurors at a rate of one additional challenge for each party per alternate juror (s. 634 (2.1), Criminal Code of Canada). In the event that replacement jurors are required, each party is similarly entitled to one peremptory challenge per replacement (s. 634 (2.2) Criminal Code of Canada).
