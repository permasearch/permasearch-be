It was in 2007 when Brazilian hegemony was finally broken: AC Milan disputed a close match against Japan's Urawa Red Diamonds, who were pushed by over 67,000 fans at Yokohama's International Stadium, and won 1–0 to reach the final.[14] In the final, Milan defeated Boca Juniors 4–2, in a match that saw the first player sent off in a Club World Cup final: Milan's Kakha Kaladze from Georgia at the 77th minute. Eleven minutes later, Boca Juniors' Pablo Ledesma would join Kaladze as he too was sent off.[15] The following year, Manchester United would emulate Milan by beating their semifinal opponents, Japan's Gamba Osaka, 5–3.[16] They saw off Ecuadorian club LDU Quito 1-0 to become world champions in 2008.[17]
