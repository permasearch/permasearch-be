Under British rule, French Canadians struggled to maintain their culture, notably outside of Quebec (where they became a minority) but within the province as well, as much of the province's economy was dominated by British settlers. The cause of Québécois nationalism, which waxed and waned over two centuries, gained prominence from the 1960s onward. The use of the word "sovereignty" and many of the ideas of this movement originated in the 1967 Mouvement Souveraineté-Association of René Lévesque. This movement ultimately gave birth to the Parti Québécois in 1968.
