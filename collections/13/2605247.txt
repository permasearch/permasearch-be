In scuba diving, the United States measures cylinder volume by the amount of free air that can be compressed into the cylinder; Europe and most of the rest of the world measure the cylinder volume as the internal volume of the cylinder: e.g. United States 19 cubic feet = European 3 liter at 180 bar.
