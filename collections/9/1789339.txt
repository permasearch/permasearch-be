The Space Capsule Recovery Experiment (SCRE or more commonly SRE or SRE-1)[67] is an experimental Indian spacecraft that was launched using the PSLV C7 rocket, along with three other satellites. It remained in orbit for 12 days before re-entering the Earth's atmosphere and splashing down into the Bay of Bengal.[68]
