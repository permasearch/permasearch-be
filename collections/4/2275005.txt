According to initial media reports of the incident, a fight broke out between Alpizar and his wife,[24] after which Alpizar suddenly ran up the aisle from the back of the plane. Lonny Glover, national safety coordinator for the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said, "As the man came forward it was obvious that he was upset ... That's when one of our attendants at the front of plane told him, 'Sir, you can't leave the plane.' His response, she said, was implying that he had a bomb in his backpack.[citation needed] It was at that point that the air marshals gave up their cover and pursued him out the door and up the jet bridge."[19]
