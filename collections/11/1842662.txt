Kahn helped Bayard Rustin organize the 1957 Prayer Pilgrimage to Washington and the 1958 and 1959 Youth March for Integrated Schools.[61] As a white student at historically black Howard University, Kahn and Norman Hill helped Rustin and A. Philip Randolph to plan the 1963 March on Washington, at which Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered his "I Have a Dream" speech.[62][63] Kahn's role in the civil rights movement was discussed in the eulogy by Rachelle Horowitz.[53]
