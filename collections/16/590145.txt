Before the events of the novel Dr. Grant was first approached by Donald Gennaro, chief counsel for InGen, to provide information on the requirements for the care of infant dinosaurs, claiming it to be for a museum exhibit. He is invited by John Hammond, the eccentric billionaire and creator of Jurassic Park, to take a tour of the park and endorse it so his investors will be more confident. Finding it hard to turn down a request from a major financial donor, Grant agrees, unaware that Hammond has managed to clone real dinosaurs. When the creatures escape, Grant becomes stranded in the park with Hammond's grandchildren. Throughout a large portion of the book, Dr. Grant and the two children explore the park trying to find their way back to the rest of the group. In the film, much of this period is omitted, with only a few key events occurring onscreen.
