Goal! (also known as Goal! The Dream Begins in the United States) is a 2006 sports drama film directed by Danny Cannon and starring Kuno Becker as Santiago Munez, a young man with a rough background who is offered the chance to trial with one of England's top association football clubs. The film was produced by Mike Jefferies, Matt Barrelle, and Mark Huffam and distributed by Buena Vista Pictures. It was made with full co-operation from FIFA, which is one of the reasons why actual teams and players are used throughout the film. The $50m deal that was struck between the producers and Adidas was, at the time - and still is - the biggest ever between a corporate brand and a film production.[3]
