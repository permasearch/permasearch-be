"O Holy Night" (French: "Minuit Chretiens!" or "Cantique de Noël") is a well-known Christmas carol composed by Adolphe Adam in 1847 to the French poem "Minuit, chrétiens" (Midnight, Christians) written by a wine merchant and poet, Placide Cappeau (1808–1877). In both the French original and the two familiar English versions of the carol, as well as many other languages, the text reflects on the birth of Jesus and on humanity's redemption.
