Avea Trotter (voiced by Haviland Stillwell)[38] is a hybrid monster: her father is a centaur and her mother is a harpy. She has blue hair and eyes, two-toned purple skin, and the body of a horse.[39][40] She also has black feathered wings that fade to green.[39] For clothing, she wears a top hat, a red jacket with blue ruffled shirt, black belt, and leg warmers. She transferred with other hybrids to Monster High. She first appears in the film Monster High: Freaky Fusion in 2014,[41][42] where she and the other hybrids help Frankie Stein's friends after they were fused together on the return trip from the past. Although she has a body of a horse, she does not like to be ridden like a pony ride.[40]
