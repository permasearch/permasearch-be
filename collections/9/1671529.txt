Mike is a strong 15 inch gauge red engine who prefers goods trains to passengers. His temper matches his paint, as he can often be hot-headed. He is proud of his shrill whistle, which he once lost trying to shoo a cow. He arrived at the station along with Rex and Bert in 1967 after their line in England was closed down.
