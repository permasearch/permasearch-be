Estimates of the number of arthropod species vary between 1,170,000 and 5 to 10Â million and account for over 80 per cent of all known living animal species.[8][9] The number of species remains difficult to determine. This is due to the census modeling assumptions projected onto other regions in order to scale up from counts at specific locations applied to the whole world. A study in 1992 estimated that there were 500,000 species of animals and plants in Costa Rica alone, of which 365,000 were arthropods.[10]
