In this version, Harry Osborn was a social outcast at high school. Peter Parker said that rumor has it that he tried to burn his old prep school down. Flash Thompson bullies him and nicknames him the "Green Goblin" based on his wealth and when people saw him carrying role-playing dice. Gwen Stacy and Peter befriend him out of pity, and Harry asks Gwen out to the prom, angering Peter. He witnesses Peter transform into the Lizard, fight Spider-Woman and die. At Peter's funeral, he feels guilty that he didn't do anything to prevent Peter's death, and disappears from school for two years.[50] He returned one night to Gwen at the cabin of Mary Jane Watson's aunt to reveal to her that he joined the army and S.H.I.E.L.D. after Peter's death and plans to avenge him by taking down Spider-Woman. He also learned to pilot a glider similar to the one the Green Goblin uses in the main universe. During his fight with Spider-Woman, he takes the Lizard serum to overpower the heroine, but runs away after discovering Spider-Woman is Gwen. He is then on the run from S.H.I.E.L.D. and is pursued by the Hand ninjas, Wolverine, and Shadowcat before fully transforming into the Lizard. Figuring out that there's a connection with their powers and a mysterious substance given to her by Matt Murdock, Gwen manages to get the Lizard serum out of Harry's blood and combines it with the substance, which forms the Venom symbiote.[51]
