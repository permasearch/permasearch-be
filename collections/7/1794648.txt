NAND flash architecture was introduced by Toshiba in 1989.[40] These memories are accessed much like block devices, such as hard disks. Each block consists of a number of pages. The pages are typically 512[41] or 2,048 or 4,096 bytes in size. Associated with each page are a few bytes (typically 1/32 of the data size) that can be used for storage of an error correcting code (ECC) checksum.
