In August 2016, the European Southern Observatory announced the discovery of a planet slightly larger than the Earth orbiting Proxima Centauri.[94] Proxima Centauri b was found using the radial velocity method, where periodic Doppler shifts of spectral lines of the host star suggest an orbiting object. From these readings, the radial velocity of the parent star relative to the Earth is varying with an amplitude of about 2 metres (6.6Â ft) per second.[94] The planet lies in the habitable zone of Proxima Centauri, but it is possible that the planet is tidally locked to the star,[94] resulting in temperature extremes that would be difficult for life to overcome.[95]
