Different measures for pain control have varying degrees of success and side effects to the woman and her baby. In some countries of Europe, doctors commonly prescribe inhaled nitrous oxide gas for pain control, especially as 53% nitrous oxide, 47% oxygen, known as Entonox; in the UK, midwives may use this gas without a doctor's prescription.[citation needed] Opioids such as fentanyl may be used, but if given too close to birth there is a risk of respiratory depression in the infant.[citation needed]
