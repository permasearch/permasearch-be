Identification of patients presymptomatically via newborn screening has allowed early intervention and treatment.  Treatment for SPCD involves high dose carnitine supplementation, which must be continued for life.[5]  Individuals who are identified and treated at birth have very good outcomes, including the prevention of cardiomyopathy.[4]  Mothers who are identified after a positive newborn screen but are otherwise asymptomatic are typically offered carnitine supplementation as well.  The long-term outcomes for asymptomatic adults with SPCD is not known, but the discovery of mothers with undiagnosed cardiomyopathy and SPCD has raised the possibility that identification and treatment may prevent adult onset manifestations.[5][8]
