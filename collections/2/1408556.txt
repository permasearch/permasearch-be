The southern European marker plant for climate as well as cultural indicator is the olive tree, which cannot withstand long periods below zero so its cultivation area matches the cool winter zone. The Mediterranean Sea acts as a temperature regulator, so this area is generally warmer than other parts of the continent; except in mountainous areas where the sea effect lowers, it belongs in zones 8–10; however, southern Balkans (mountainous- Western and Eastern Serbia, continental Croatia and Bulgaria) are colder in winter and are in zones 6–7. The Croatian (Dalmatian) coast, Albania and northern Greece are in zones 8–9, as are central-northern Italy (hills and some spots in Po Valley are however colder) and southern France; Central Iberia is 8–9 (some areas are slightly colder). The Spanish and Portuguese Atlantic coast, most of Andalusia and Murcia, almost all the Valencian Community, a part of Catalonia, Balearic Islands, southwestern Sardinia, most of Sicily, coastal southern Italy and southwestern Greece are in zone 10, the islands of Malta, Lampedusa and the southern zone of Spain (Málaga, Cádiz and Granada, where there is mango and avocado cultivation) belong to zone 11a.[4] Also, a few areas on the southernmost coast of Cyprus are inside zone 11a.
