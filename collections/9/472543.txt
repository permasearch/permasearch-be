Throughout the 2016 season, the Rams' signage around the stadium, endzones, and other uses of the logo showed a variation that was only colored in blue and white, leading some fans to believe the team's upcoming rebrand would involve gold being completely dropped from the color scheme. For the 2017 season, the Rams announced they would be wearing helmets similar to the Fearsome Foursome era: Millennium blue helmets with white helmet horns and, voted on by fans, a white facemask.[90] Fans also voted for a new pants design, which was a single blue stripe down the side of white pants, as well as an inverse design for road games. The team also began using the blue and white logo as their primary logo, confirming that they would be phasing out gold from their colors (although gold remains on the jerseys due to an NFL rule that teams must wait a certain amount of time before changing jersey designs). The Rams also announced a fan vote via Twitter to decide two home games in which they would wear throwback uniforms. Fans selected the October 8, 2017 game against the Seahawks and the December 31, 2017 game against the 49ers, the same two opponents the Rams wore throwbacks against last season. In their Week 3 road game against the 49ers, the Rams also participated in NFL Color Rush, wearing throwback-style all-yellow uniforms with blue detailing and blue numbers, as well as yellow horns on the helmets and white stripes outlined in blue on the pants.
