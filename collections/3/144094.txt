Eurogamer's Parkin wrote that the "childlike" and "unusually Western" graphics were similar to EarthBound's in "flat pastel textures devoid of shading" as juxtaposed with background art that "fizzes with life and character".[50] He described the cutscenes' animations as "bespoke", rare for 16-bit role-playing games, and of greater dramatic impact.[2] RPGamer's Jordan Jackson wrote that the visuals are typical of the series and fit the game's mood,[4] and the website's Mike Moehnke criticized the inventory limits carried over from the previous game.[5] Green of NGC said the game mechanics were "depressingly basic" against more advanced role-playing games.[63] Eurogamer's Parkin felt that the role-playing game elements were less interesting and added that Mother 3 had few standout selling points other than its attention to detail and "only systemic innovation": the rhythm-based battle system.[2] Kotaku's Richard Eisenbeis praised the system,[36] and GameSpot's Greg Kasavin compared it with that of the Mario & Luigi series.[68] Jackson wrote that the music was "just as catchy as previous games" despite being "almost completely new".[4] Moehnke agreed, calling it "nothing less than stunning".[5] He noted overtones of Wagner and Chuck Berry.[5] Jackson said that the game was somewhat easier than the rest of the series and somewhat shorter, at about 30 hours in length.[4] Both RPGamer reviewers noted that Mother 3 has few penalties for death.[4][5] Jackson reflected that while the game is humorous and grows in enjoyment, it has some somber moments as well.[4] Eisenbeis of Kotaku cited "the importance of mothers" as a key theme about which the game revolves, which he preferred to the mid-game "slapstick insanity" and final plot twist.[36] Parkin wrote that the game was filled with "memorable moments", including a character who criticizes the player "for not giggling at puns", frogs with progressively silly costumes that save the game, a "reconstructed mecha caribou" battle, a bad haiku, and the "campfire scene", and that while the game's simpleness could have lent towards "raw stupidity", instead it was "elegant in its simplicity".[2]
