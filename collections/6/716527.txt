The Jammu and Kashmir High Court on 23 July advised the government to discontinue the use of pellet guns.[377] On 26 July, the court demanded the Union Government to submit report on the use of the guns by untrained personnel while disapproving of their use. It asked the government to only allow its use by trained personnel while also asking it to look into other means of crowd-control.[378] The High Court issued notices to both the state and Union government asking them to file a response to a petition seeking ban on the guns.[379] When Prasad was asked during an interview on 9 August about when will the CRPF stop using pellet guns, he replied it was like asking when will you stop beating your wife. His remarks created a controversy and were seen as misogynistic by women's organisations, news organisations and social media users. Prasad later apologised for his comment.[380][381][382] Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Singh ruled out a ban on the weapons stating they were only used in extreme situations.[383] The army recommended the CRPF and police to use sound cannons, pepper shotguns and chilli grenades instead of the pellet guns.[384]
