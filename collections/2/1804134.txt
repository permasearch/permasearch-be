Thomson told David Collins from TV Choice that his first audition was "troublingly easy", and following a second audition, his agent called to tell him he had won the part.[5] Thomson was surprised and initially in disbelief that he had been successful.[5] To prepare for the role, Thomson went on a tour of a hospital with a heart surgeon.[5] He commented, "I went to meetings about the best course of treatment for someone who needed a new organ. It was fascinating. There's also a massive amount of politics, which is why a show like Holby City is endlessly fascinating because there are so many layers. There's such a fluctuation of power."[5] Holby City was Thomson's first television role.[6] The actor expected to get fired within the first six months because he initially struggled to hit his marks and get his lines right. He thought the producers had made a mistake in casting him.[6]
