Manaus was one of the host cities of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and one of the seats of some Olympic football games.[21] It was the only host city in the Amazon rainforest and the most geographically isolated, being further north and west than any of the other host cities. A massive prison riot occurred in January 2017, having begun in Manaus and later spreading to two additional cities in Brazil,[22] thus unleashing security problems within the country.[23][24]
