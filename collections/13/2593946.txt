Ford Motor Company invested $12 million in tooling to finance Ferguson's new distribution company.[2] The investment resulted in the production of the 9N tractor which was introduced on June 29, 1939.[2] It was officially called a "Ford tractor with the Ferguson system", although the name Ford-Ferguson was widely used. It sold for $585 including rubber tires, power take-off, Ferguson hydraulics, an electric starter, generator, and battery; lights were optional. Ford's 9N further improved the cantankerous Model F by updating the ignition with a distributor and coil. An innovative system of tire mounts for the rear wheels and versatile axle mounts for the fronts enabled farmers to accommodate any width row-crop work they needed.[2] The 9N weighed 2340 pounds and had 13 drawbar horsepower, which could pull a two-bottom plow.[1] It was designed to be safe, quiet and easy to operate. Ford once said "Our competition is the horse."; the 9N was intended for farmers who were not mechanically minded.[1]
