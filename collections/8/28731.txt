It has been recently suggested that Valles Marineris is a large tectonic "crack" in the Martian crust.[4][5] Most researchers agree that this formed as the crust thickened in the Tharsis region to the west, and was subsequently widened by erosion.[citation needed] Near the eastern flanks of the rift, there appear to be channels that may have been formed by water or carbon dioxide. It has also been proposed that Valles Marineris is a large channel formed by the erosion of lava flowing from the flank of Pavonis Mons.[6]
