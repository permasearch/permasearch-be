Skuld (スクルド, Sukurudo) is a Keyblade wielder and a member of the same Union as Ephemer. She appears in Kingdom Hearts χ. Having been told by Ephemer that the world will be ravaged in a calamity, Skuld searches for him and meets the player character along the way. She learns about Ephemer's whereabouts and accepts Ava's offer to search refuge in the World of Light while the Keyblade War occurs, but is dismayed at the player character's choice to stay behind and help their fellow Keyblade wielders. Skuld is later selected to be one of the new Foretellers made to lead the Dandelions after the Keyblade war.
