They first came to prominence with Hunstanton School, completed in 1954, which used some of the language of high modernist Ludwig Mies van der Rohe but in a stripped back way, with rough finishes and a deliberate lack of refinement that kept architectural structure and services exposed[8]. They are arguably among the leaders of the British school of New Brutalism. They referred to New Brutalism as "an ethic, not an aesthetic."[9] Indeed, their work sought to emphasize functionality and connect architecture with what they viewed as the realities of modern life in post-war Britain.[10] Alison Smithson articulated their desire to connect building, users, and site when, describing architecture as an act of "form-giving," she noted, "My act of form-giving has to invite the occupiers to add their intangible quality of use."[11]  After the critical success of Hunstanton School, they were associated with Team X and its 1953 revolt against old Congr√®s International d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM) philosophies of high modernism.
