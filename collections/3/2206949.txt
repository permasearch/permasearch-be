Essayist Allison Harl speculates that the Watcher may be a kraken created and bred by Morgoth in Utumno [8] and that Watcher in the Water represents itself as a gatekeeper whose goal, in the context of the archetypal journey, is to guard the Doors of Durin keeping the heroes from entering into new territory, psychologically or spiritually. This "guardian theory" has also been theorised by other writers such as Joseph Campbell and Bill Moyers.[8][9]
