In 1996, the twins were introduced into post-Crisis DC continuity in the series Extreme Justice as escaped slaves of an alien overlord. Unable to speak English, they inadvertently attack some civilians and the Justice League. During their fight with the JLA, Zan becomes an ice golem, a water monster, and a demonic-looking whirlpool, while Jayna becomes a griffin, a werewolf, and a sea serpent.[4] The pair are later emancipated by the Justice League and join Captain Atom's team in issue #16 (May 1996).[5] That same year, they appeared in the crossover storyline Final Night[6] and in the series Total Justice.[7]
