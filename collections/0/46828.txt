Snow in the state of Louisiana presents a rare and serious problem because of the state's subtropical climate. For snow to push into the southern region of Louisiana, extreme weather conditions for the area must be present, usually a low-pressure system coupled with unusually low temperatures.[1] Average snowfall in Louisiana is approximately 0.2 inches (5.1Â mm) per year, a low figure rivaled only by the states of Florida and Hawaii.[2] Due to the infrequency of these cold weather patterns,[3] southern areas affected in this state are often unprepared to deal with slick streets and freezing temperatures.
