There is broad consensus that teaching effectively requires a reflective approach.[32][33][34] However, reflective practice "is a term that carries diverse meaning"[3] and about which there is not complete consensus.[35][36] Teaching and learning are complex processes, and there is not one right approach. Reflecting on different approaches to teaching, and reshaping the understanding of past and current experiences, can lead to improvement in teaching practices.[35] SchÃ¶n's reflection-in-action can help teachers explicitly incorporate into their decision-making the professional knowledge that they gain from their experience in the classroom.[37]
