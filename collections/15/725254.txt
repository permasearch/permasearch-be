These are drugs whose primary effects are thought to be mediated by different neurotransmitter systems (dopamine for stimulants, serotonin for antidepressants), but many also increase levels of norepinephrine in the brain.[citation needed] Amphetamine, for example, is a stimulant that increases release of norepinephrine as well as dopamine.[45] Monoamine oxidase inhibitors are antidepressants that inhibit the metabolic degradation of norepinephrine as well as serotonin.[citation needed] In some cases it is difficult to distinguish the norepinephrine-mediated effects from the effects related to other neurotransmitters.[citation needed]
