Stephanie Zacharek of Salon felt positively about the episode itself but ambivalent about the lack of resolution, stating, "I'm not sure if Tuesday night's finale is a deeply unsatisfying way to close out a series that's ending before its time or the only way to end such a series." However, she blamed the network for this ending. She also commented on the tone and themes of the episode, arguing that one of the series's main takeaways was that the rich would always be in charge. However, she did not view the finale as being spiteful and pessimistic: "'Veronica Mars' has always been a clear-eyed show, never a bitter one."[26] Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly felt unsatisfied with the episode's conclusion, partially because Veronica and Logan did not resume dating. However, he praised the sex-tape mystery and the plot involving the Castle because of their similarities to earlier seasons. He also praised Keith's actions, stating, "Okay, maybe I'm a sap, but this tugged at my heartstrings a bit and left me relieved there wasn't a dreaded Veronicaâ€“Keith battle at the end." Stransky concluded by saying that "the end is fine".[35] Sydney Bucksbaum of Zap2it felt disappointed because of the ambiguous endings of Keith's arc and Veronica's love triangle. Although she was positive towards "The Bitch Is Back" as a standalone episode, she found herself hoping that there were another episode to the season: "Watching Veronica walk out into the pouring rain all alone after casting a probably insignificant vote for her dad was depressing, symbolic (rain in SoCal?), and just downright unsatisfying."[36]
