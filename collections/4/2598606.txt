Having used a shortcut pointed out by Misu, Zuko and Sokka arrive at Noren and Noriko's before Azula. Zuko goes inside to see the couple, where he divulges his true identity and Ursa's. Noren acknowledges this, revealing himself to be Ikem, but Ursa does not remember Zuko. Ikem explains that the Mother of Faces had learned of Ursa's memories of her life with Ozai, including those concerning Zuko and Azula, and offered to remove them after seeing the pain they caused Ursa. With no way of liberating her children and being unwilling to live without knowing what was happening to them, Ursa agreed to the offer. Azula and Sokka then crash through the roof as they battle, and Azula then focuses her attention on Ursa, and in her psychosis accuses her mother of trying to overpower her since she was born. Noriko/Ursa apologizes for that - she must not have loved Azula enough if she had turned out so badly - bringing the former princess to the edge of tears. Zuko then intervenes and fights off Azula. He states that he has accepted his destiny as Fire Lord, and that although he and Azula may never have a good relationship, she is still his sister. Unable to handle the fact that someone does love her, Azula flees towards Forgetful Valley, despite Zuko's pleas that he wants to help her, leaving the incriminating letter behind.
