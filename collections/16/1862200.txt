The Puritans created a deeply religious, socially tight-knit, and politically innovative culture that is still present within the modern United States. They hoped that this new land would serve as a "redeemer nation." They fled England and attempted to create a "nation of saints" in America: an intensely religious, thoroughly righteous community designed to be an example for all of Europe.
