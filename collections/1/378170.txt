During Google's developer conference in May 2013, the company announced that, on Google Chrome and Chrome OS, users would be able to say "OK Google", with the browser initiating an audio-based search, with no button presses required. After having the answer presented, users can follow up with additional, contextual questions; an example include initially asking "OK Google, will it be sunny in Santa Cruz this weekend?", hearing a spoken answer, and reply with "how far is it from here?"[71][72] An update to the Chrome browser with voice-search functionality rolled out a week later, though it required a button press on a microphone icon rather than "OK Google" voice activation.[73] Google released a browser extension for the Chrome browser, named with a "beta" tag for unfinished development, shortly thereafter.[74] In May 2014, the company officially added "OK Google" into the browser itself,[75] though the company removed it in October 2015, citing low usage, though the microphone icon for activation remained available.[76] In May 2016, 20% of search queries on mobile devices were done through voice.[77]
