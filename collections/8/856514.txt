In The Wizard of Oz, the hot air balloon that had transported the Wizard to the Land of Oz—and which was to take him, Dorothy, and Toto to Kansas—has "State Fair Omaha" prominently written on it, as Omaha was one of the rotating host cities of the Fair until 1901. The movie is based on the 1900 book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum.
