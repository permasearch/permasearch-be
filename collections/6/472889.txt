Wyatt began making Steffy the face of Spencer Publications' social media, and promised her that Quinn would no longer be a problem for them. However, Wyatt soon discovers that Quinn had begun an affair with Steffy's grandfather, Eric Forrester. Quinn and Eric were married in September 2016, and Wyatt stood by Steffy and the rest of the Forrester family in boycotting the wedding. Wyatt supports Quinn when she is appointed interim CEO while Eric recovers from a brain aneurysm, caused by an argument he was having with his family over the wedding boycott. During this time, Ridge and Steffy lied to Quinn and the rest if the Forrester family by claiming that Ridge had Eric's power of attorney, when in fact Quinn had it. Ridge's attempt to regain control of Forrester Creations failed and Wyatt told Quinn about Steffy and Ridge's lie. When Steffy finds out that Wyatt had betrayed her trust and that their marriage was based on the lie of Liam's disappearance, Steffy filed for divorce, and returned to Liam. A few weeks before the divorce was due to be finalised, Quinn suggested to Eric that Steffy should be made CEO of Forrester Creations, to which he agrees. Wyatt and Steffy realise that this was part of Quinn's scheme to reunite them, and Wyatt agreed to fast-track the divorce as a result.
