In his first game back in Toronto, on April 15, 2005, Carter was heavily booed and jeered by Raptors fans; some fans were found burning Vince Carter jerseys, while many donned No. 15 baby bibs, 'FUVC' T-shirts, and other merchandise that labelled Carter as "Wince" or as "immature", alluding to Carter's knee and ankle injuries and his dissent.[38] Much like former Raptors teammate Tracy McGrady,[39] Carter received such treatment for years to come in the town that once embraced him.[12]
