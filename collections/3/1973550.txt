Janowitz claims he attempted to commission the sets from designer and engraver Alfred Kubin, known for his heavy use of light and shadow to create a sense of chaos,[17][41][65] but Kubin declined to participate in the project because he was too busy.[17][60][64] In a conflicting story, however, Janowitz claimed he requested from Decla "Kubin paintings", and that they misread his instructions as "cubist painters" and hired Reimann and RÃ¶hrig as a result.[17] David Robinson argues this story was probably an embellishment stemming from Janowitz's disdain for the two artists.[60] Janowitz has claimed that he and Mayer conceived the idea of painting the sets on canvas, and that the shooting script included written directions that the scenery be designed in Kubin's style.[17][60] However, the later rediscovery of the original screenplay refutes this claim, as it includes no such directions about the sets.[60] This was also disputed in a 1926 article by Barnet Braverman in Billboard magazine, which claimed the script included no mention of an unconventional visual style, and that Janowitz and Mayer in fact strongly opposed the stylization. She claims Mayer later came to appreciate the visual style, but that Janowitz remained opposed to it years after the film's release.[61]
