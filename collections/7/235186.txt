Awards ceremonies to crown the world's best player were held annually since 1956, when the inaugural Ballon d'Or awarding took place. The Ballon d'Or was presented to the player who had been voted to have performed the best over the previous year, and was established by French journalist Gabriel Hanot. Originally, votes could only be awarded to European players before a 1995 rule change. In the voting for the 2004 Ballon d'Or, Ronaldo received his first votes, finishing in joint 12th with Milan Baro≈° on 11 points.[221] In 2005 he received three points,[222] and in 2006 received five points, the same year Messi earned his first votes, finishing with three points.[223]
