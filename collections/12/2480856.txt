The Peace Tea can designs were created by Steve Jugan (Peace Tea Brand Manager) and artist John Malloy aka FLuX in homage to the different peace movements throughout history. Mr. Malloy is a mixed-media artist who began drawing at a very young age. He later earned a background in old master's style painting and has since been self-taught in fine art, illustration, comics, and design.[2] His illustrations have been featured in a variety of publications, including The Big Book of Contemporary Illustration and the 'Illusive 3' Book of Contemporary Illustration.[2] His artwork has led each Peace Tea packaging can to tell a story behind a significant peace movement throughout history.
