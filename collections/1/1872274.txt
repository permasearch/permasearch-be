The final challenge was to see who could log the most miles from the starting point to Baikonur with a condition: only the winner can attend the launch event, and the losing cars will be subjected to 'hard labour'. In preparation, Matt stripped the Mercedes to make it quicker, Chris repainted the Volvo so it resembled the Volvo 850 BTCC and installed a 'high-mileage fuel tank' - a 55-gallon oil drum - while Rory did nothing to his London black cab. Matt returned to a salt bed he previously passed through (where his silencer and makeshift crash bar fell off), Chris went into town to look for an airfield to race around, while Rory jacked up the back wheels of his cab and put it in gear so as to run up easy miles. While refuelling he knocked the jacks and the car drove off by itself, before beaching on a dune. At the cosmodrome the results were announced: Chris did 211 miles, Matt did 284 miles, Rory did 329 miles, and the losing cars were turned into taxicabs by locals. At the end of the show, Rory showed that his black cab had been mounted on a plinth beside the Buran spacecraft at the cosmodrome. Winner: Rory
