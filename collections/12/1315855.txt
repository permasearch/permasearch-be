During the Joseon Dynasty royal titles and styles (forms of address) had been extensive and complex. The general title of the king was wang (왕, 王), while Gojong of Korea crowned himself hwangje (황제), or emperor, a title that was only allowed for Chinese emperors.[1] Official titles came with official forms of address, depending on who the addressee was and by whom he or she was addressed.
