The United States and Canada have different racial makeups, different obesity rates and different alcoholism rates, which would likely cause the US to have a shorter average life expectancy and higher infant mortality even with equal healthcare provided. The US population is 12.2% African Americans and 16.3% Hispanic Americans (2010 Census), whereas Canada has only 2.5% African Canadians and 0.97% Hispanic Canadians (2006 Census). African Americans have higher mortality rates than any other racial or ethnic group for eight of the top ten causes of death.[125] The cancer incidence rate among African Americans is 10% higher than among European Americans.[126] U.S. Latinos have higher rates of death from diabetes, liver disease, and infectious diseases than do non-Latinos.[127] Adult African Americans and Latinos have approximately twice the risk as European Americans of developing diabetes.[126] The infant mortality rates for African Americans is twice that of whites.[128] Unfortunately, directly comparing infant mortality rates between countries is difficult, as countries have different definitions of what qualifies as an infant death.
