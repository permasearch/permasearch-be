The standard charge is £11.50 for each day, for each non-exempt vehicle that travels within the zone, with a penalty of between £65 and £195 levied for non-payment. Since 1 July 2013 the Greener Vehicle Discount was replaced by the Ultra Low Emission Discount (ULED), which introduced more stringent emission standards that limit the free access to the congestion charge zone to all-electric cars, some plug-in hybrids, and any vehicle that emits 75g/km or less of CO2 and meets the Euro 5 emission standards for air quality. The ULED scheme was designed to curb the growing number of diesel vehicles on London's roads, which since 24 June 2016 pay the full congestion charge.[4][5] A new toxicity charge, known as T-charge will be introduced from 23 October 2017 for vehicles that do not meet Euro 4 standards. These older polluting vehicles will pay an extra £10 charge on top of the congestion charge to drive within the Congestion Charge Zone.[6][7][8]
