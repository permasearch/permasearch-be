In September 1863, Lincoln announced a plan to auction 60,000 acres of South Carolina land in lots of 320 acresâ€”setting aside 16,000 acres of the land for "heads of families of the African race", who could obtain 20-acre lots sold at $1.25/acre.[59] Tax Commissioner William Brisbane envisioned racial integration on the islands, with large plantation owners employing landless blacks.[60] But Saxton and French considered the 16,000-acre reserve to be inadequate, and instructed black families to stake claims and build houses on all 60,000 acres of the land.[61] French traveled to Washington in December 1863 to lobby for legal confirmation of the plan.[62] At French's urging, Chase and Lincoln authorized Sea Island families (and solitary wives of soldiers in the Union Army) to claim 40-acre plots. Other individuals over the age of 21 would be allowed to claim 20 acres. These plots would be purchased at $1.25 per acre, with 40% paid upfront and 60% paid later. With a requirement of six months' prior residency, the order functionally restricted settlement to blacks, missionaries, and others who were already involved in the Experiment.[63]
