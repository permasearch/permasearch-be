In January 2010, Santa Monica's studio director John Hight told video-gaming blog Joystiq that "while God of War III will conclude the trilogy, it won't spell the end of the franchise" and said "We're going to be really careful about what we do next."[32] From April 2011 until April 2012, several sources claimed that a fourth main entry would release sometime in 2012 and would feature an online component.[33][34][35][36][37][38] On April 12, 2012, Sony released a teaser image on its official PlayStation Facebook page,[39] which was followed by the game's announcement on April 19,[40] though Amazon leaked the announcement the day before.[41] The trailer announced Todd Papy, who had worked as a designer on God of War and God of War II and as Design Director on God of War III, as Game Director.[40] David Jaffe confirmed that God of War III Game Director Stig Asmussen did not return to direct this game because he was working on another project at Santa Monica.[42] The announcement trailer was narrated by Linda Hunt; it refers to a time before Kratos became the Ghost of Sparta and was not "bound in blood".[43] The announcement officially confirmed that the game's title would be God of War: Ascension. Papy said the game was not titled God of War IV to avoid confusion because it is a prequel, rather than a sequel, to the trilogy. The name was chosen because it complements the story and the additional multiplayer component; according to Papy, in this mode, players are "basically ascending from an unknown hero to a god".[30][43]
