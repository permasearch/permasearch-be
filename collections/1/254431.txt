The line score is always listed as part of the box score, usually near the top; it lists the total runs scored in each inning. (The Atlanta Braves scored two runs in the fifth inning and one in the seventh.  The Minnesota Twins scored two runs in the first inning, one in the fifth, and one in the eleventh. ) Innings are normally grouped in sets of three for ease of reading. The team totals of runs, hits, and errors are listed last, after a separating character such as a dash.  The actual score of the game is represented by the first column after the dash; (the Twins won this game four runs to three.)
