In 1654 Belgian Jesuit mathematician Andr√© Tacquet used Kircher's technique to show the journey from China to Belgium of Italian Jesuit missionary Martino Martini.[12] It is sometimes reported that Martini lectured throughout Europe with a magic lantern which he might have imported from China, but there's no evidence that anything other than Kircher's technique was used. However, Tacquet was a correspondent and friend of Christiaan Huygens[13] and may thus have been a very early adapter of the magic lantern technique that Huygens developed around this period.
