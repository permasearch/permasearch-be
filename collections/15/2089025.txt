As the adopted child of General Krishna Bahadur Rana, who was a governor of Palpa, Dev Shamsher had a lavish upbringing compared to his natural brothers. The only occasions that he met his own siblings were during festivities and family gatherings. He was closer to the sons of Jung Bahadur and spent the majority of his time in their palace, Thapathali Durbar. He inherited the entire wealth of his uncle as well as a share of his father's wealth. Since he was much richer than his brothers, they envied him.[3]
