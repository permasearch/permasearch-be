There are two Optional Protocols to the Covenant. The First Optional Protocol establishes an individual complaints mechanism, allowing individuals to complain to the Human Rights Committee about violations of the Covenant.[65] This has led to the creation of a complex jurisprudence on the interpretation and implementation of the Covenant. As of July 2013[update], the First Optional Protocol has 114 parties.[66]
