Organized prayer is first introduced in the Hebrew Bible in Deuteronomy, when the recitation of prayer over the fruit bringing sacrifice is mandated, and liturgy established for the first time, in Deuteronomy.[22] Moses mandates that one who goes to offer the sacrifice recite a basic creed, declaring his people's heritage and history, as well as a prayer of thanks to God for the fruits they have harvested. Moses also requires Israelites to, at certain times, recite a declaration saying they have not transgressed any of the mitzvot.
