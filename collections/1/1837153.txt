Despite popular culture, there is no evidence that Vikings used horned helmets in battle as such horns would be impractical in a melee,[31] but it is possible that horned head dresses were used in ritual contexts.[32] The horned and winged helmets associated with the Vikings in popular mythology were the invention of 19th-century Romanticism.[7] The horned helmet may have been introduced in Richard Wagner's Ring opera: The male chorus wore horned helmets, while the other characters had winged helmets.[30]
