Cavanagh first guest starred on the sitcom Scrubs in 2002 ("My Big Brother") where he was cast as Dan Dorian, the brother of lead character J.D., because of his resemblance to Zach Braff. He returned for one episode in 2003 ("My Brother, Where Art Thou?"), for a two-episode arc in 2004 ("My Cake" and "My Common Enemy"), for one episode in April 2006 ("My New Suit") and then on November 8, 2007 ("My Inconvenient Truth"). He took the role for one last time in Braff's final episode as a series regular, the eighth season finale ("My Finale").
