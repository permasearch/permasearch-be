Marvel announced that Rogers will become Captain America once again in the comic series Captain America: Steve Rogers.[50] This new series follows the events of “Avengers: Standoff!,” in which Captain America is restored to his youthful state following an encounter with the sentient Cosmic Cube, Kobik, and his past is drastically rewritten under the instructions of the Red Skull. Afterward, Captain America plots to set himself and Hydra in a position where they can conquer America in Marvel’s upcoming event “Secret Empire.”[51]
