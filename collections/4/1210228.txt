Charleston is known as "The Holy City",[86] perhaps because churches are prominent on the low-rise cityscape[87] or because South Carolina was among the few original colonies to tolerate all Christian Protestant denominations (though not Roman Catholicism).[88] The Anglican church was dominant in the colonial era, and the Cathedral of St. Luke and St. Paul is today the seat of the Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina. Many French Huguenot refugees settled in Charleston in the early 18th century.[89] The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church is the oldest African Methodist Episcopal church in the Southern United States and houses the oldest black congregation south of Baltimore, Maryland.[90]
