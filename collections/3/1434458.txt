In 1991, MCA Records Canada released Morissette's debut studio album Alanis, which went Platinum in Canada.[6] Her second album Now Is the Time was a commercial failure, selling a little more than half the copies of her first album.[7][8] With her two-album deal complete, Morissette was left without a recording contract. In 1993, Morissette's publisher Leeds Levy at MCA Music Publishing introduced her to manager Scott Welch.[9] Welch told HitQuarters he was impressed by her "spectacular voice", her character and her lyrics. At the time she was still living with her parents in Ottawa. Together they decided it would be best for her career to move to Toronto and start writing with other people.[9]
