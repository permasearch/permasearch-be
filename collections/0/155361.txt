Injury once again plagued Pennington and 2005 was another lost year with a 4–12 Jets record and yet another season sweep by the Patriots; in a 16–3 win in Foxboro the Pats' Adam Vinatieri passed Patriots legend Gino Cappelletti for first on the team's all-time list for points scored. The Jets responded to the season by releasing Herm Edwards. Despite the sweep of the Jets, the Patriots fell to 10–6 and were bounced by the hated Denver Broncos in the playoffs.
