A regular feature since issue 167, the Empire Masterpiece is a two-page essay on a film selected by Empire in the Re.View section. The selection of the films seem to be quite random and follow no specific pattern. Only a few issues since the first masterpiece feature have not featured one â€“ 169, 179, 196, 197, 198 and 246. Issue 240 had director Frank Darabont select 223 masterpieces.[3] L.A. Confidential was featured twice, once in issue 191 and again in issue 303.[citation needed]
