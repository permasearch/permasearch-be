In the US, the book became the No. 1 nonfiction book and ebook on The Wall Street Journal's Best-Selling Books list,[48][49] it also topped The Washington Post,[50][51] and Reuters U.S. bestsellers list,[52] reached No. 2 on USA Today's overall list,[53] as well as topping hardcover nonfiction and top 10 overall category for Publishers Weekly,[54][55][56] selling over 442,000 copies until July 9, 2018.[57] In the category it replaced Michael Wolff's Fire and Fury.[58] Penguin Random House's CEO Markus Dohle in late March stated that the book has already sold over 700,000 copies in the US.[59] However, books editor Deborah Dundas from Toronto Star found the book did not chart on The New York Times, Los Angeles Times and IndieBound bestsellers list, without reliable answers from NYT. The NYT stated it was not counted because it was published by a Canadian company.[60] According to Random House Canada, the book was handled properly for the U.S. market.[35][61] Dennis Prager contends that the issue is its conservative context, and its lack of inclusion in the lists being the mainstream American media's manipulation.[62]
