As amino acids gradually appeared in the RNA world under prebiotic conditions,[54][55] their interactions with catalytic RNA would increase both the range and efficiency of function of catalytic RNA molecules.[47] Thus, the driving force for the evolution of the ribosome from an ancient self-replicating machine into its current form as a translational machine may have been the selective pressure to incorporate proteins into the ribosomeâ€™s self-replicating mechanisms, so as to increase its capacity for self-replication.[51]
