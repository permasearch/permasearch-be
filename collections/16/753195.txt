Small membrane bound vesicles responsible for transporting proteins from one organelle to another are commonly found in endocytic and secretory pathways. Vesicles bud from their donor organelle and release the contents of their vesicle by a fusion event in a particular target organelle.[1] The net movement of proteins from the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) to the Golgi Apparatus represents one form of intracellular transport through this mode of vesicle budding. Since the ER is the site of protein synthesis it would serve as the parent organelle and the cis face of the golgi, where proteins and signals are received, would be the acceptor. In order for the transport vesicle to accurately undergo a fusion event it must first recognize the correct target membrane then fuse with that membrane.
