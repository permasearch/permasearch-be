The giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) is the world's most massive tree,[1][2] and arguably the largest living organism on Earth.[3] It is neither the tallest extant species of tree (that distinction belongs to the coast redwood),[4][5] nor is it the widest (that distinction belongs to the baobab tree or Montezuma Cypresses), nor is it the longest-lived (that distinction belongs to the Great Basin bristlecone pine).[6] However, with a height of 286 feet (87 m) or more, a circumference of 113 feet (34 m) or more, an estimated bole volume of up to 52,500 cubic feet (1,487 m3), and an estimated life span of 1800–2700 years,[7] the giant sequoia is among the tallest, widest and longest-lived of all organisms on Earth.
