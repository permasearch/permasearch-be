The American ska band No Doubt recorded a cover version of the song to promote their first greatest hits album The Singles 1992–2003 (2003). Because the band was on hiatus, while lead singer Gwen Stefani recorded her solo debut album, they decided to record a cover to avoid having to write a new song.[21] Eventually, after the band listened to hundreds of songs from the 1980s, they narrowed it down to two contenders — "It's My Life" and "Don't Change" by Australian rock band INXS ("A Question of Lust" by English electronic band Depeche Mode was another close contender).[22] No Doubt were dubious about recording a cover and contemplated writing new material.[21] However, they decided on "It's My Life" after rehearsing the song with producer Nellee Hooper,[22] referring to it as a "feel-good" song.[21] No Doubt's version of "It's My Life" was nominated for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 47th Grammy Awards.[23] Jacques Lu Cont, the song's programmer, created the Thin White Duke mix of "It's My Life", which won the award for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical.[24]
