The Melbourne Football Club rules of 1859 are the oldest surviving set of laws for Australian rules football.  The ten simple rules were drawn up on 17 May at a meeting chaired by Wills and in attendance were journalists W. J. Hammersley and J. B. Thompson.[14]  Accounts of the people directly involved differ.  Some sources also claim that Thomas H. Smith[17] and H. C. A. Harrison[18] were also present.  The meeting was held at the Parade Hotel, East Melbourne hosted by owner and Melbourne Cricket Club member James (Jerry) Bryant.  The publican was a friend of Tom Wills with a personal interest in introducing football to Melbourne's schools.  Bryant had played a role in organising early football matches at the nearby Richmond Park and his son was one of the first players.[19]  The rules were signed by Tom Wills, William Hammersley, J. Sewell, J. B. Thompson, Alex Bruce, T. Butterworth and Thomas H. Smith.  Importantly, the rules were widely publicised and distributed.
