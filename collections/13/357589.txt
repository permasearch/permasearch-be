In 1983, the city opened Plantation Central Park: a 77-acre recreation complex, including any Olympic swimming pool, gym, and spaces for softball, football, soccer, tennis and basketball.[9] That same year, the former Plantation Chamber of Commerce building (a 1,000 square foot office building) was moved over a mile by truck to a new location. The intent was for the building to be used as a museum building by the Plantation Historical Society; however, it was subsequently vandalized and fell from its foundation, requiring demolition as a result.[9] Instead, an alternative, Plantation Historical Museum (founded by Genevieve Veltri) is dedicated in June of 1985.[33][9]
