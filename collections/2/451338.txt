Hippocratic medicine was notable for its strict professionalism, discipline, and rigorous practice.[32] The Hippocratic work On the Physician recommends that physicians always be well-kempt, honest, calm, understanding, and serious. The Hippocratic physician paid careful attention to all aspects of his practice: he followed detailed specifications for, "lighting, personnel, instruments, positioning of the patient, and techniques of bandaging and splinting" in the ancient operating room.[33] He even kept his fingernails to a precise length.[34]
