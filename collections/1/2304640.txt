Since current therapies improve motor symptoms, disability at present is mainly related to non-motor features of the disease.[55] Nevertheless, the relationship between disease progression and disability is not linear. Disability is initially related to motor symptoms.[102] As the disease advances, disability is more related to motor symptoms that do not respond adequately to medication, such as swallowing/speech difficulties, and gait/balance problems; and also to levodopa-induced complications, which appear in up to 50% of individuals after 5 years of levodopa usage.[102] Finally, after ten years most people with the disease have autonomic disturbances, sleep problems, mood alterations and cognitive decline.[102] All of these symptoms, especially cognitive decline, greatly increase disability.[55][102]
