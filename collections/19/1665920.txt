Alice in Wonderland, released in 1951, met with a lukewarm response at the box office and was a sharp critical disappointment in its initial release.[70] Peter Pan, released in 1953, was, on the other hand, a commercial success and the highest-grossing film of the year. In 1955, Lady and the Tramp was released to higher box office success than any other Disney feature from the studio since Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,[71] earning an estimated $7.5 million in rentals at the North American box office in 1955.[72] Lady is significant as Disney's first widescreen animated feature, produced in the CinemaScope process,[71] and was the first Disney animated feature to be released by Disney's own distribution company, Buena Vista Distribution.[73]
