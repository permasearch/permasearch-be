Though Belle has been reunited with Rumplestiltskin, he continues to struggle with his dark impulses. Upon learning that Regina had locked Belle up for 28 years, he summons a Wraith to kill the Queen. A disappointed Belle temporarily leaves him. She soon returns though, deciding she can't give up on him just yet, and they continue to pursue a relationship.[24] Belle moves in with Rumple, as she is oblivious to her father trying to find her; however, when he does, he attempts to force her over the town line to make her forget about her life with Rumplestiltskin, refusing to bless their relationship. This makes her both upset with him and Rumple, who she's learned is continuing to practice dark magic. Though she cuts ties with both of them, she eventually gives Rumple another chance upon realizing that he's attempting to change, giving her the town's library and setting her up with the apartment above it. They agree to then go out and get a hamburger, as Belle has never had one before.[25] As Belle explores life in Storybrooke, she comes to befriend Ruby (Meghan Ory), who turns into a werewolf during every full moon. Belle stands by Ruby and insists that she is not the monster many believe her to be, as Belle sees the goodness in her heart.[26] Meanwhile, Belle and Rumple grow closer, as they continue to go out on dates like lunch at Granny's Diner and a picnic in Rumple's pawnshop. However, interruptions occur frequently as the town panics due to the arrival of Regina's mother, Cora (Barbara Hershey), who has become a new threat to them all.[27][28]
