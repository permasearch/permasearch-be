Many Israeli settlements and outposts are originally composed of caravans (Hebrew: קראוואן‎ caravan; pl. קראוואנים, caravanim). They are constructed of light metal, are not insulated but can be outfitted with heating and air-conditioning units, water lines, recessed lighting, and floor tiling to function in a full-service capacity. Starting in 2005, prefabricated homes, named caravillas (Hebrew: קרווילה‎), a portmanteau of the words caravan, and villa, begin to replace mobile homes in many Israeli settlements.
