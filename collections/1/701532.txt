The red, military appreciation jersey was introduced on February 5, 2014. The jerseys feature navy blue piping with a white border, the Braves script in blue with white stars, and the American Flag on the left sleeve. The updated red jerseys will not include the tomahawk logo. The jerseys will be worn for five home games in 2014: April 26 vs. the Cincinnati Reds (military family night), June 13 vs. the LA Angels of Anaheim (celebrating the Army), July 26 vs. the San Diego Padres (celebrating the Marines), Aug. 30 vs. the Miami Marlins (celebrating the Navy), and September 19 vs. NY Mets (celebrating the Air Force).[79] The jerseys will be paired with camouflage caps.[80] The military appreciation jerseys replace the red jerseys introduced in 2005.[81] Worn with the white pants, these jerseys included the same elements as the white jerseys, with the Braves script, player numbers, and piping in navy blue with a white border. The tomahawk was primarily blue, with red and yellow detail and a white border. The player names consisted of white lettering sewn to a red nameplate. These jerseys were paired with an alternate home cap, which was a red brimmed, navy blue cap with a red, embroidered "script A" logo with a tomahawk, outlined in white. The alternate cap did not have a matching batting helmet. The red alternate jerseys were worn for Sunday home games from 2005 to 2011. The only exceptions to this were the opening game of the 2005 NLDS, which was played on a Wednesday, and on Memorial Day in 2006. The 2006 Memorial Day game is also the only time the red jerseys were paired with the primary home cap. With the introduction of the cream uniform in 2012, the red jerseys were worn for Friday night home games from 2012 to 2013. However, the Braves chose to wear the traditional white jerseys for their 2012 home opener, which took place on Friday, April 13.
