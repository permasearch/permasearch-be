Vehicles are increasingly computerized, with engine timing, cruise control, anti-lock brakes, seat belt tensioners, door locks, airbags and advanced driver-assistance systems on many models. Additionally, connected cars may use Wif-Fi and bluetooth to communicate with onboard consumer devices and the cell phone network.[42] Self-driving cars are expected to be even more complex.
