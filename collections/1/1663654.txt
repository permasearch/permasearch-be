Although Jayasuriya made his Test debut in 1991, it was not until 1996 that he scored his first century, when he had become a regular player in the Sri Lankan side.[59] His career high of 340 against India in August 1997 was the highest score by a Sri Lankan cricketer until 2006,[60] and is also part of the highest team total (952/6) made in Test cricket.[61][62] He has also scored two double centuries; 213 against England and 253 against Pakistan. His 157 against Zimbabwe in 2004 is the second fastest century by a Sri Lankan player.[63] Jayasuriya, having scored centuries against every Test playing nation except New Zealand and West Indies,[64] retired from Test cricket in 2007 with 14 to his name.[64]
