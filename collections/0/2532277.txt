Akatsuki Kain (架院 暁, Kain Akatsuki) is Hanabusa's cousin and considered one of "Lord Kaname's right-hand men." While the Day Class girls have nicknamed him "Wild", Kain is actually mellower than Aido and his laid-back attitude and association with Aido frequently sees him getting into trouble, despite not being directly responsible.[8] Since Aido is lazy, Kain is left to clean their room when he's out, making Aido mistakenly believe their room gets cleaner on its own. Kain is incredibly perceptive and frequently sensitive to others' feelings, most particularly with his cousins, Aido and Ruka's. Kain has the ability to conjure and control fire. He has been in love with Ruka ever since they were kids, but never reveals his true feelings to her because she is in love with Kaname.[9] His protectiveness over Ruka is the only thing preventing him from fully devoting himself to Kaname like Aido. During Rido's attack on Cross Academy, Kain and Ruka fight vampires attacking the Day Class on Kaname's orders. After the one year timeskip, Akatsuki leaves with Ruka and Kaname, joining in the latter's mission to eliminate Purebloods, though defected when Kaname injures Ruka. After Kaname escapes, Yuki offers to heal Ruka with her blood, but Akatsuki sucks the blood from Yuki's wrist and gives it to Ruka through a kiss, finally revealing his love for her.
