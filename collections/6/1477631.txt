Led Zeppelin's "In My Time of Dying" was released on their sixth album Physical Graffiti. At 11:06, it is the longest studio track on any Led Zeppelin studio album, but contains no long instrumental passages despite its extended timing. Physical Graffiti's credits list the four members of Led Zeppelin as the song's authors, despite the earlier released versions of the song.
