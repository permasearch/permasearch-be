Steve Barton of Dread Central gave it a qualitative score of 2.8/5, opining "Hellraiser: Judgment's biggest accomplishment is that it's actually good. All of the acting is solid, as is the story. Pinhead is omnipresent, and Taylor delivers a worthy performance and is every bit as majestic as you'd hope he'd be... While not perfect nor as good as the classic Hellraiser films, [it] delivers a rather striking vision that feels as new as it does familiar."[14] Giving the film two stars out of five, We Got This Covered writer Matt Donato found the police procedural elements to be generic, and the gore and Hell elements inadequate, labeling the entirety "one of the least realized, most throwaway" of the series.[50] News editor Scott Wampler wrote that "The acting's bad, the story's half-baked, and Pinhead's barely in it" referring to the whole as a "mixed bag with the stuff I enjoyed ultimately outweighed by the stuff I did not", but continued "I can't help but be curious to see what Tunnicliffe might do with a decent budget, or less meddling from the rights holders."[51]
