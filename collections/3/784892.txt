An additional strategy to water conservation is practicing sustainable methods of utilizing groundwater resources.[7]  Groundwater flows due to gravity and eventually discharges into streams.[8] Excess pumping of groundwater leads to a decrease in groundwater levels and if continued it can exhaust the resource.[7] Ground and surface waters are connected and overuse of groundwater can reduce and, in extreme examples, diminish the water supply of lakes, rivers, and streams.[9] In coastal regions, over pumping groundwater can increase saltwater intrusion which results in the contamination of  groundwater water supply.[9] Sustainable use of groundwater is essential in water conservation.
