Some information can be obtained from the study of the cult of Eileithyia at Crete, and the cult of Despoina. In the cave of Amnisos at Crete, Eileithyia is related with the annual birth of the divine child and she is connected with  Enesidaon (The earth shaker), who is the chthonic aspect of the god Poseidon.[53]  Persephone was conflated with Despoina, "the mistress", a chthonic divinity in West-Arcadia.[36] The megaron of Eleusis is quite similar with the "megaron" of Despoina at Lycosura.[29] Demeter is united with the god Poseidon, and she bears a daughter, the unnameable Despoina.[54] Poseidon appears as a horse, as it usually happens in Northern European folklore. The goddess of nature and her companion survived in the Eleusinian cult, where the following words were uttered "Mighty Potnia bore a great sun".[53] In Eleusis, in a ritual, one child ("pais") was initiated from the hearth. The name pais (the divine child) appears in the Mycenean inscriptions,[29] and the ritual indicates the transition from the old funerary practices to the Greek cremation.[55]
