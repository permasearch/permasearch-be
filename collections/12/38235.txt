Corey Clark was disqualified during the finals for having an undisclosed police record; however, he later alleged that he and Paula Abdul had an affair while on the show and that this contributed to his expulsion. Clark also claimed that Abdul gave him preferential treatment on the show due to their affair. The allegations were dismissed by Fox after an independent investigation.[56] Two semi-finalists were also disqualified that year â€“ Jaered Andrews for an arrest on an assault charge, and Frenchie Davis for having previously modelled for an adult website.[57]
