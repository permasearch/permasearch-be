Arya Stark successfully secures passage back to Westeros by bribing a Westerosi trader. However, she is subsequently attacked on a nearby bridge and repeatedly stabbed in the abdomen by the Waif, in the guise of an elderly woman. Arya pushes the Waif away, and barely escapes by jumping off the bridge and swimming away underwater. After surfacing, she is then left stumbling through the streets, critically wounded.
