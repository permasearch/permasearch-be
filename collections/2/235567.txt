KRL Jabodetabek or commonly known as Commuterline is a commuter rail system which serves commuters in Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, South Tangerang, and Bekasi. The commuter system was started in 2000.[163] The number of passengers in 2014 reached 208 million, rising from 158 million in the previous year.[164] About 280 million commuters used KRL Jabodetabek in the year of 2016.[165] KRL Jabotabek serves all municipalities in Jakarta excluding the Thousand Islands, as well as Greater Jakarta region. Though during rush hours, the number of passengers greatly exceeds the system's capacity, and crowding is common. Currently KRL Jabotabek is the only rail-based transit system in Jakarta, as the mass rapid transit and light rail transit are still under construction.
