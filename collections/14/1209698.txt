Krill is a rich source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids which are under development in the early 21st Century as human food, dietary supplements as oil capsules, livestock food, and pet food.[69][71][75] Krill tastes salty with a somewhat stronger fish flavor than shrimp. For mass-consumption and commercially prepared products, they must be peeled to remove the inedible exoskeleton.[75]
