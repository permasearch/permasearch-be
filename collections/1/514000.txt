The 2nd-century-BCE tomb of the Lady Dai contained not only decayed remnants of actual food, such as rice, wheat, barley, two varieties of millet, and soybeans, but also a grave inventory with recipes on it.[266] This included vegetable and meat stews cooked in pots, which had combinations such as beef and rice stew, dog meat and celery stew, and even deer, fish, and bamboo shoot stew.[266] Seasonings mentioned in the recipes include sugar, honey, soy sauce, and salt.[266] Recipes in the Han usually called for meat stuffed in cereals, cakes, and other wrappings.[265]
