The ZFS name is registered as a trademark of Oracle Corporation;[4] although it was briefly given the retrofitted expanded name "Zettabyte File System", it is no longer considered an initialism.[5] Originally, ZFS was proprietary, closed-source software developed internally by Sun as part of Solaris, with a team led by the CTO of Sun's storage business unit and Sun Fellow, Jeff Bonwick.[6][7] In 2005, the bulk of Solaris, including ZFS, was licensed as open-source software under the Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL), as the OpenSolaris project. ZFS became a standard feature of Solaris 10 in June 2006.
