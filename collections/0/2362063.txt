Measurements of Enceladus's "wobble" as it orbits Saturn—called libration—suggests that the entire icy crust is detached from the rocky core and therefore that a global ocean is present beneath the surface.[75] The amount of libration (0.120° ± 0.014°) implies that this global ocean is about 26 to 31 kilometers deep.[76][77][78][79] For comparison, Earth's ocean has an average depth of 3.7 kilometers.[78]
