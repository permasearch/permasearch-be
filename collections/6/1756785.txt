In his third season with the Seahawks in 2012, Carroll, along with rookie quarterback Russell Wilson, led the team to an 11-5 record, including going undefeated at home.[78] The 2012 season was Carroll's first winning season for the team. The Seahawks were also involved in controversy during Week 3's Monday Night Football game against the Green Bay Packers in Seattle, when the replacement officials called two different results for Russell Wilson's Hail Mary pass to wide receiver Golden Tate. The officials called the play in the Seahawks' favor, igniting a national outrage about the officiating.[79][80] When the NFL referee lockout ended several days later, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell acknowledged that public furor over the call accelerated the eventual resolution of the labor dispute.[81] Carroll's record was enough to post the team's second playoff berth, and the Seahawks won their Wild Card Round playoff game on the road against the Washington Redskins and fellow rookie quarterback Robert Griffin III, 24-14.[82] Seattle lost the following week in the Divisional Round to the Atlanta Falcons at the Georgia Dome by a score of 30-28.[83]
