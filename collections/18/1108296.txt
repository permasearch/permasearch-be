Take Care expands on the low-tempo, sensuous, and dark sonic aesthetic of Thank Me Later.[29] Primarily a hip hop album,[30] it has a languid, grandiose production that incorporates R&B,[2] pop,[31] electronica,[32][33] and post-dubstep styles.[34] The music is typified by an atmospheric sound,[35] muted textures, slow tempos,[36] subtle chords,[37] melodic synth tracks, low-end grooves,[38][39] and sparse, ambient arrangements.[9] Noah "40" Shebib contributed to most of the album's production with murky beats, dark synth layers, atmospheric keyboards,[40] moody guitar sounds,[36] smooth piano, muffled drums,[29] dramatic flourishes,[10] and low-pass filters.[41] Although he is credited as producer for only eight of the album's 17 songs, Shebib also served as audio engineer and mix engineer on the album.[10] His production for the album is characteristic of the Toronto hip hop scene, which experienced a mainstream breakthrough with Shebib's work with Drake, producers Boi-1da and T-Minus, and singer-songwriter The Weeknd, all of whom contributed to Take Care.[42] Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club comments that the album is "crafted primarily around the oblique production of Drake's native Torontoâ€”all rippling synths, distant pulses, and purposeful empty space".[43]
