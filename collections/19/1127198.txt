During World War II, Ohio State was one of the few colleges able to field a marching band for every home game. The band was able to field 100 to 120 musicians throughout the war. Because the band was still under ROTC control, women were not allowed to perform. The band was open to alumni members of the band, woodwind players, vocalists, high school students, even strangers on the street who expressed interest. The morale with which this highly volunteer band helped to cheer on Ohio State football was during a time when spirits on the home front were at a low. By the early 1950s, the Department of Defense issued much more stringent rules about what courses and activities constitute eligible curriculum for the ROTC program. The Marching Band was no longer an eligible activity, and in 1952, the Marching Band officially ended ties with the ROTC department. Cadets in the band could continue to try out and participate in band, but they would no longer receive ROTC credit. Once the Marching Band separated from ROTC control, the band was more free to experiment with show themes and music genres, culminating in the band's 1965 performance of "Hang On, Sloopy!". After the extremely positive response for "Sloopy", the band decided to venture into more modern and topical styles of music.
