"Rockstar" is the fifth U.S. single by the Canadian rock band Nickelback from their fifth album, All the Right Reasons (2005). It was initially only released in the United States and Canada, and has since been re-released worldwide. The lyrics feature the pretentious, materialistic desires of a wannabe rockstar, who craves money, cars and women. Spoken-word vocals between each verse are provided by Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top.
