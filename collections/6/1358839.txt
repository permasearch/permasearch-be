Patients being treated with antibiotics when symptoms begin should stop taking them, if possible. This break in antibiotic therapy can sometimes lead to spontaneous resolution of symptoms. Patients that don't respond to the cessation of broad-spectrum antibiotics will need to be treated with antibiotics capable of killing C. difficile spores. Primary infections are typically treated with metronidazole. This medication is normally given 3 times a day orally and should be taken for a minimum of 10 days. Some patients can't tolerate the side effects of metronidazole, which include severe nausea and vomiting, which can lead to dehydration. In this case, patients should be given oral vancomycin, usually at a dosage of 125 milligrams every 6 hours.[20]
