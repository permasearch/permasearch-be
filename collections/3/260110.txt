This behavior of the PIQ can be used to determine if code is being executed inside an emulator or directly on the hardware of a real CPU.[citation needed] Most emulators will probably never simulate this behavior. If the PIQ-size is zero (changes in the code always affect the state of the processor immediately), it can be deduced that either the code is being executed in an emulator or the processor invalidates the PIQ upon writes to addresses loaded in the PIQ.
