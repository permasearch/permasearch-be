In Legends of the Jews, a conservative rabbi Louis Ginzberg wrote that the worship of the Golden Calf was the disastrous consequence for Israel who took mixed multitude in their exodus from Egypt. Had not the mixed multitude joined them, Israel would not have been misled to worship this molten idol. The form of calf itself came from a magical virtue of an ornament leaf with the image of the bull which is made by Moses.[6]
