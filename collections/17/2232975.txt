High on the Soy Sauce, Dave inadvertently travels into the past to the moment the bullet he was shot with was manufactured and accidentally distracts the quality assurance employee. This leads to a poor quality bullet that ultimately fails to kill him in the present. Molly and John rescue him from the burning trailer. Along with Detective Appleton, Big Jim, and several people who were at the party, the group tries to track down the body of one of the Soy Sauce users, now possessed by multiple demonic entities, called "Shadow Men" - nihilistic, reality-warping ghosts who seek to control all dimensions and do so by utilizing the Soy Sauce, the essence of Shadow Men, and their powers, able to manipulate reality and time to their will and kill people to remove all traces of their existence. The Shadow Men possess or kill those who ingest the Soy Sauce - such as Appleton, who is killed en route.
