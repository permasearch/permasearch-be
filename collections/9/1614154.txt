The rivalry between the Dallas Cowboys and Washington Redskins is called the top NFL rivalry of all time and "one of the greatest in sports" by Sports Illustrated.[19] The two franchises have won 36 combined division titles and ten NFL Championships, including eight combined Super Bowls. They are the two wealthiest franchises in the NFL.[20] The rivalry started in 1960 when the Cowboys joined the league as an expansion team.[21] During that year they were in separate conferences, but played once during the season. Since 1961, Dallas has been in the same division as the Redskins. Dallas leads the all-time series 68–44–2 as of the end of the 2016 season.[citation needed] Despite their storied history they've only met twice in the playoffs (1972 & 1982), both times in the NFC Championship Game. Washington won both of those meetings.
