In North America, The Last Knight was originally projected to gross $70–75 million from 4,069 theaters over its first five days, which would have been the lowest debut of the franchise.[105] However, after the film grossed a franchise-low $15.7 million on its first day (including $5.5 million from Tuesday night previews), opening estimates were lowered to $60–65 million. On Thursday, it grossed $8.1 million, potentially dropping the five-day debut to under $60 million.[106] It ended up having an opening weekend of $45.3 million, the lowest debut of the franchise by $25 million (and lowest since the first film's $70.5 million). The film's five-day gross of $68.4 million was also lower than every three-day opening of the previous four films.[107] The film grossed $16.9 million in its second weekend, dropping 62.2% and finishing third at the box office,[108] and $6.4 million in its third, dropping an identical 62.2% and finishing 5th.[109]
