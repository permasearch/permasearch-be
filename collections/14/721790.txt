Radio signals carried long distances, and a number of American stations could easily be received in parts of Canada.  The first Canadian station was CFCF, originally an experimental station from the Marconi Company in Montreal.[14] Civilian use of Wireless Telegraphy had been forbidden in Canada for the duration of World War I. The Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of Canada was the only one to retain the right to continue radio experiments for military use.  This proved instrumental in giving the company a lead in developing an experimental radio broadcasting station immediately after the war. The first radio broadcast in Canada was accomplished by The Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of Canada in Montreal on December 1, 1919 under the call sign XWA (for "Experimental Wireless Apparatus") from its Williams Street factory. The station began regular programming on May 20, 1920 and its call letters were changed to CFCF on November 4, 1920.[15] In Toronto, the first radio station was operated by the Toronto Star newspaper.  Station CKCE began in April 1922. and were so well received that the Star pushed forward with its own studios and transmitting facilities, returning to the air as CFCA in late June 1922.  In Montreal, another newspaper, La Presse, put its own station, CKAC on the air in late September 1922.  Because there were governmental limitations on radio frequencies back then, CKAC and CFCF alternatedâ€”one would broadcast one night, and the other would broadcast the night after that.[16] For a time, CKAC was broadcasting some programs in French, and some in English: in 1924, for example, the station rebroadcast fifteen Boston Bruins hockey games from station WBZ in Boston.  Meanwhile, in other Canadian provinces, 1922 was also the year for their first stations, including CJCE in Vancouver, and CQCA (which soon became CHCQ) in Calgary.
