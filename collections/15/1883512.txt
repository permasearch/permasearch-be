Since its foundation, EARLI has organised over 15 international conferences, in as many different European countries. The aim of the Biannual EARLI Conference is to allow researchers in education, learning and instruction to meet face to face and discuss a wide variety of topics. The first Biannual EARLI Conference took place in Leuven, Belgium, where the association was founded.
