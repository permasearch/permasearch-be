In November 2010, Fox began airing short commercials for the program, which displayed the text "Coming to America Fall 2011".[9][10] The New York Times described the commercials as efforts by the network to set up the launch of The X Factor as a television "event."[9] In February 2011, during Super Bowl XLV, Fox unveiled the official logo for the show in a promo starring Cowell.[11] A second promo was shown during the course of that evening, featuring Katy Perry, Justin Bieber, The Black Eyed Peas, Usher, Lady Gaga, the Pussycat Dolls and Madonna. This promo gave rise to speculation about who would join Cowell on the X Factor judging panel.[12]
