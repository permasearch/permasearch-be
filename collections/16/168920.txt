In Fast & Furious 6, he comes to Toretto for help to bring down Owen Shaw, the leader of an international crime syndicate, recognizing that Toretto's team are the best candidates to match Shaw's own skills. He partners up with DSS Agent, Riley Hicks, who turns out to be a double agent who double crossed Hobbs and Toretto's team. While Riley and Letty are fighting with each other in the airplane, Hobbs tosses a harpoon to Letty, who in return uses it to impale Riley off the airplane, killing her on impact. After the mission is completed, Hobbs grants amnesty to Toretto and his team, the two men publically disagreeing on which of them was in charge during that mission but privately acknowledging that they trust each other.
