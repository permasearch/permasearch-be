Colfer as Kurt received kudos in most reviews. Semigran wrote, "I give Chris Colfer all the credit in the world, because no matter what the material, he knocks it out of the park every time."[27] James Poniewozik of Time agreed that given the episode's material, "it's important to have it in the hands of an actor as good as Chris Colfer".[30] The scene with Kurt, Burt, Finn and Blaine was singled out by Jenna Mullins of E! Online, who observed that it "quickly turned into much more than just prom ensembles. It's the jumps from quirky to heavy that make Glee special, and I love watching the cast handle so much in one scene."[31]
