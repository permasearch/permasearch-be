In 1858, local businessmen, Charles R. Bishop (who had immigrated from upstate New York a decade earlier) and William A. Aldrich, opened Bishop & Co. -- the first successful banking partnership under the laws of the independent Kingdom of Hawaii. It operated from a basement room in "Makee & Anthon's Building" on Kaahumanu Street. On the day Bishop & Co. opened, it took in $4,784.25 in deposits. Its successor, First Hawaiian Bank, today is the second oldest bank west of the Rockies. [3]
