Male cheetahs are sociable and often live in a group of other males called coalitions.[21] In the Serengeti, it was found that 41% of the adult males were solitary, 40% lived in pairs and 19% lived in trios.[22] Male East African cheetahs are territorial, and establish their territories by marking their territories by urinating on trees or logs. They react aggressively against intruders.[citation needed]
