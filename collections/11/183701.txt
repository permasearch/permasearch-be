The purpose of a cooktop is to prepare food; for example, long periods of simmering may be required. A rational measure of efficiency would be to compare the actual energy input to the cooktop compared to some theoretical value require to prepare the specified foodstuffs. Since experiments to make these measurements would be difficult to replicate, energy efficiency measurements that are published concentrate on the ability of a cooktop to transfer energy to a metal test block, which is much easier to measure in a repeatable fashion.
