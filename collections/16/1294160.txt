Archie is introduced to the young people by May-Li Wang (Stacy Liu). When Kazima Tako (Akuc Bol) asks May-Li to adopt her, Archie is one of the others to compete with Kazima to be adopted. Archie also told Kazima after asking about her dad and brother, that he has no family at all. It has been noted that he sees Bailey Wharton as a brotherly figure, as the two get along well and stick up for each other frequently.
