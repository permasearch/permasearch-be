The Bulls currently wear three different uniforms: a white uniform, a red uniform, and a black alternate uniform. The original uniforms were aesthetically close to what the Bulls wear today, featuring the iconic diamond surrounding the Bulls logo on the shorts and block lettering. What distinguished the original uniforms were the black drop shadows and white lettering on the red uniforms. For the 1969â€“70 season, side stripes of red, black and white were added while the red uniforms were tweaked to include the city name. [51]
