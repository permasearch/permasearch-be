Controversy flared again with the publication of excavations by Ã‰tienne Zangato and colleagues of their excavations in the Central African Republic.[14][15] At the site of Oboui they excavated an undated iron forge, for which they obtained eight consistent radiocarbon dates of 2000 BC.  This would make Oboui the oldest iron working site in the world, and more than a thousand years older than any other dated evidence of iron in Central Africa.  Opinion among African archaeologists is sharply divided. Some accept this interpretation, but it has also been suggested that Oboui is a highly disturbed site, with older charcoal having been brought up to the level of the forge by the digging of pits into older levels [16] Questions have also been raised about the unusually good state of preservation of metallic iron from the site.[17]
