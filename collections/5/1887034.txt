Populations with a higher rate of diagnosis of GAD are individuals that are traditionally oppressed. This includes individuals with low and middle socio-economic status, separated, divorced, and widowed individuals. Women are twice as likely to develop GAD as men. This is primarily because women are more likely than men to live in poverty, be subject to discrimination, and be sexually and physically abused.[72] African Americans have significantly higher odds of enduring GAD and the disorder often manifests itself in different patterns.[73][74] Other populations that are more diagnosed with GAD are those who live alone, those with a low level of education, and the unemployed.[75] GAD is also common in the elderly population.[76]
