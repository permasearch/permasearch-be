On a budget of $110 million,[1] principal photography began in New York City on March 26, 2010.[13] In May, scenes were filmed in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood.[14] That month, scenes were shot all night for five nights in a row at F.A.O. Schwartz toy store.[5] Production was temporarily halted after a worker fell 30 feet from a set at the toy store on Fifth Avenue and 58th Street; he later recovered in a hospital.[15] Other locations used for filming were Belvedere Castle, the Russian Tea Room, Rockefeller Center, and Brooklyn's Prospect Park.[5] A two-thirds-scale replica of the Belvedere Castle was built with wooden grates as floors (to create additional contrast). Gargamel's dungeon under the Belvedere Castle, which included the "Smurfalator", was built on a soundstage. It took three months to build because some parts were hard to come by. Production eventually found the rare parts at garage sales, flea markets, on eBay and Craigslist.[5]
