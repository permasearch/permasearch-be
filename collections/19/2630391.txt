In the 10th century, chess arrived in Europe and the board acquired its characteristic recognisable chequered pattern[5] used at the time in Draughts, which had a smaller 5x5 board.[6] This change proved particularly useful for diagonal movements, now highlighted by the continuous sequence of same-coloured squares in the diagonals, facilitating the movement of the recently-added Bishop and Queen.[7]
