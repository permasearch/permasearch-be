One way tradition is used more simply, often in academic work but elsewhere also, is to indicate the quality of a piece of information being discussed.  The phrase "according to tradition," or "by tradition," usually means that whatever information follows is known only by oral tradition, but is not supported, (and perhaps may be refuted) by physical documentation, by a physical artifact, or other quality evidence. For example, "According to tradition, Homer was born on Chios, but many other locales have historically claimed him as theirs." This tradition may never be proven or disproven. In another example, "King Arthur, by tradition a true British king, has inspired many well loved stories."  Whether they are documented fact or not does not decrease their value as cultural history and literature.
