On January 21, 1838 a recording was made by the Russian merchant Neverov in Yakutsk, of −60 °C (−76 °F; 213 K).[5] On January 15, 1885 H. Wild reported that a temperature of −68 °C (−90 °F; 205 K) was noted in Verkhoyansk.[5] A later measurement at the same place in February 1892 was reported as −69.8 °C (−93.6 °F; 203.3 K). Soviet researchers later announced a recording of −67.7 °C (−89.9 °F; 205.5 K) in February 1933 at Oymyakon, about 650 km (400 mi) to the south-east of Verkhoyansk; this measurement was reported by Soviet texts through the 1940s as a record low, with the previous measurement from Verkhoyansk retroactively adjusted to −67.6 °C (−89.7 °F; 205.6 K).[6]
