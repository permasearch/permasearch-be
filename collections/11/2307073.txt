The Palo Alto City Library has five branches, with a total of 265,000 items in their collections.[75] The library's mission is to enable people to explore library resources to enrich their lives with knowledge, information, and enjoyment. For Palo Alto library card holders, the main library web page also offers links to primary source databases with collections of magazine, newspaper, and other print articles. The Palo Alto City Library is also a member of the Northern California Digital Library, which allows card holders to browse and download the digital resources made available. Library cards are freely available for California residents.[76] The Mitchell Park Library, the largest one in Palo Alto, was under construction beginning in 2010, but reopened in December 2014.[77][78]
