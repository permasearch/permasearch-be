The 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Italy were the first in which the medals were placed around the neck of the athletes.  The medals hung from a chain of laurel leaves, while they are now hung from a coloured ribbon.[17]  When Athens hosted the 2004 Summer Olympics the competitors on the podium also received an olive wreath crown. In the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, each medalist received a wooden statuette of the Olympic logo.[30]
