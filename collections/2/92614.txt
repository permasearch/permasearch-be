Mays feels the character has a lot of depth, juxtaposing Emma's position helping the students with her own phobia of germs and love for a married man. She explained that "the character is not a stereotypical TV-style husband-stealer who immediately would be luring the dude into the sack, but rather seems like a real person facing real issues."[1] Mays has performed several musical numbers in the show, including "I Could Have Danced All Night" from My Fair Lady, Madonna's "Like a Virgin", "Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me" from The Rocky Horror Show, "Afternoon Delight" by the Starland Vocal Band, and The 5th Dimension's "Wedding Bell Blues". "Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me" was originally Mays' audition piece; her performance of it on Glee was met with critical acclaim. The songs appear on the series' soundtrack albums and EPs.
