Elvis leads the list for male entertainers. Madonna leads the list of female artists of Top 10 Hot 100 hits, with a total of 38. She and the Beatles, who last reached the region with reunion single "Free As A Bird" in 1995, were tied with 34, until Madonna notched her 35th with "Die Another Day" in 2002. She scored her 38th and most recent Top 10 with "Give Me All Your Luvin'" (featuring Nicki Minaj and M.I.A.) in 2012.[1] Had The Jackson /The Jacksons singles counted, Michael Jackson would then have an additional eleven more Billboard Hot 100 Top 10 hits as a lead vocalist, making his total of 40 Top 10 Hot 100 singles.
