One day during the rehearsal of a play at school, Jae-kyung notices that the play is resembles the incident that had happened in his life. He recalls a childhood memory of being at the orphanage at Gangwon, where he had met Eun-hwan and had made a promise to return in ten days. He finds Eun-hwan and tells her that he did not remember her or his promise because his parents had died in a car accident on that same day and his memories were thus erased. He tells her he loves her and they kiss.
