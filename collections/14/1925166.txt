Evil Dead II continues the story from the previous film, after an alternate recap, where within a few minutes we see Ash and Linda go to the same cabin. Ash finds a reel to reel player and plays the tape. He releases the Evil Dead and Linda gets possessed. Ash decapitates her with a shovel and buries her.  Then the Evil Dead chases Ash through the cabin and attacks Ash (just like the end of the first film). From this point, the film continues the story from where the first film left off. Carried a good distance by the demon, Ash is slammed against a tree and falls in a puddle of water; he becomes a deadite, but shortly afterwards is released from the spirit by the light of dawn, only to pass out. Ash regains consciousness moments before sunset. Deciding to get out of there as fast as he can, he climbs into his car and drives to where the bridge was, only to find it completely destroyed by the Evil Dead. As the sun quickly sets, said force starts climbing up the cliff, and Ash hops into his car, driving away as fast as he can and as a result, crashing right into a tree stump that sends him flying through the windshield.
