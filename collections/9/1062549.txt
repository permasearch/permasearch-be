The lyrics of the song have the narrator (lead singer Bobby Smith), pledging his devotion and love to a lover who has just left him for another while at the same time holding out hope that she will return to him ("There's always a chance, a tiny spark will remain/And sparks turn into flames/And love can burn once again..."). So, in case she changes her mind, he'll be around.
