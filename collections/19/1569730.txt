The English Evangelical Lutheran church of the Redeemer started with four persons, John Knudsen and wife and John H. Lingenfelter and wife. During the summer of 1889 Paul Klingler, a student in the Lutheran Theological seminary at Philadelphia, Pa., spent his vacation in an effort to gather together the anglicized Lutherans living in Lansingburgh, and succeeded in gathering fifty or sixty men, women and children. The time having arrived for Mr. Klinger to return to his studies in the seminary, the little flock was left without a shepherd. In the month of October Rev. Samuel G. Finckel came from Hartleton, Pa., to organize a congregation. In December about a score of members were incorporated, bought a lot and started a church, the cornerstone of which was laid about March 1, 1890. The building was completed and opened for service in May, 1890.
