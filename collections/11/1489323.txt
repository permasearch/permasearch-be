The final findings of the National Commission, issued April 19, included a statement that the public generally desired an economic partnership with Canada.[11] Fearing Bouchard and Dumont would further dilute their position as the referendum wore on,[10] Parizeau agreed to negotiate a broader approach, and would agree to a statement that included partnership with Dumont and Bouchard on June 12, 1995.[12] The Agreement contained details of the partnership negotiation process, and a general plan of seeking "sovereignty" while requiring an economic and social partnership offer be negotiated and presented to the rest of Canada. Most importantly for Parizeau, the agreement also allowed the government to declare immediate independence if negotiations were not successful or heard after a successful referendum. [13]
