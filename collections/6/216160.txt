On 5 December 1914, Shackleton's expedition ship Endurance left South Georgia for the Weddell Sea, on the first stage of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition.[1] It was making for Vahsel Bay, the southernmost explored point of the Weddell Sea at 77Â° 49' S, where a shore party was to land and prepare for a transcontinental crossing of Antarctica.[2] Before it could reach its destination the ship was trapped in pack ice, and by 14 February 1915 was held fast, despite prolonged efforts to free her.[3] During the following eight months she drifted northward until, on 27 October, she was crushed by the pack's pressure, finally sinking on 21 November.[4]
