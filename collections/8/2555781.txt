There is a large amount of lifespan variability in actual use.   One full file pass is equal to writing enough data to fill an entire tape and takes between 44 and 136 end-to-end passes.  Regularly writing only 50% capacity of the tape results in half as many end-to-end tape passes for each scheduled backup, and thereby doubles the tape lifespan.  LTO uses an automatic verify-after-write technology to immediately check the data as it is being written,[42][43] but some backup systems explicitly perform a completely separate tape reading operation to verify the tape was written correctly. This separate verify operation doubles the number of end-to-end passes for each scheduled backup, and reduces the tape life by half.
