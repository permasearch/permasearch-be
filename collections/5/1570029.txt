On 5 November, Jiangsu constitutionists and gentry urged Qing governor Cheng Dequan (程德全) to announce independence and established the Jiangsu Revolutionary Military Government with Cheng himself as the governor.[79][85] Unlike some of the other cities, anti-Manchu violence began after the restoration on 7 November in Zhenjiang.[86] Qing general Zaimu (載穆) agreed to surrender, but because of a misunderstanding, the revolutionaries were unaware that their safety was guaranteed.[86] The Manchu quarters were ransacked, and an unknown number of Manchus were killed.[86] Zaimu, feeling betrayed, committed suicide.[86] This is regarded as the Zhenjiang Uprising (鎮江起義).[87][88]
