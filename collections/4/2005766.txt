Unless there's some other reason, a section describing why this book was banned and where would cover a homosexual themes section. It's on wikipedias list of banned books, but there is no explanation there. This article mentions that Knowles said that Finny and Gene were in love on page 2. http://www.looksmartjrhigh.com/p/articles/mi_qa4063/is_200401/ai_n9385166/pg_2?pi=gdw Then again, that guy used the word love like nobody's business. The article cites a source I am currently to lazy to look up. I think it's probable that the writer of the article didn't intentionally take Knowles out of context, though. 66.41.66.213 14:32, 28 April 2006 (UTC)
