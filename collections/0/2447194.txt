Australian Wheat Board ceases operation as a government controlled statutory authority. It becomes AWB Limited, a grower owned and controlled corporation. At this time, all government financial assistance, such as the underwriting of borrowings ceased. Through subsidiary company, AWB (International) Limited (AWBI), AWB Limited continues to be the sole exporter of bulk wheat from Australia via the "single desk" system.
