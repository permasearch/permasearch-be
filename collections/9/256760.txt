At the time of Tencent's investment into Epic in 2012, Epic Games had a US$825 million valuation.[72] Because of Fortnite Battle Royale, Epic's valuation increased to US$4.5 billion as of May 2018.[73] Bloomberg raised the estimate to around US$8.5 billion by the end of 2018 should Fortnite Battle Royale reach US$2 billion during the year.[72] Partially due to the influx of revenue from Fortnite Battle Royale, Epic reduced its portion of sales it collected from the Unreal Engine Marketplace from 30% to 12% in July 2018, applying that retroactively to past sales.[74]
