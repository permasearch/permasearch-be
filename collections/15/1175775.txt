The Bike Shed Theatre and Cocktail Bar opened in September 2010 before permanently closing in March 2018. The Theatre was forced to close after failing to generate enough profit from the cocktail bar in order to operate the theatre. Fundamentally, the theatre offered intimate live music and performances and operated from basement premises in Fore Street.
