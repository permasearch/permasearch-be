Nintendo Co., Ltd.[a] is a Japanese multinational consumer electronics and video game company headquartered in Kyoto. Nintendo is one of the world's largest video game companies by market capitalization, creating some of the best-known and top-selling video game franchises, such as Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and Pok√©mon.[3] Founded on 23 September 1889 by Fusajiro Yamauchi, it originally produced handmade hanafuda playing cards.[4][5] By 1963, the company had tried several small niche businesses, such as cab services and love hotels.[6] Abandoning previous ventures in favor of toys in the 1960s, Nintendo then developed into a video game company in the 1970s, ultimately becoming one of the most influential in the industry and Japan's third most-valuable company with a market value of over $85 billion.[7] From 1992 until 2016, Nintendo was also the majority shareholder for the Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball.
