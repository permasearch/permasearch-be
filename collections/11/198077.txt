The show has received positive reviews from The New York Times, Slate, Entertainment Weekly, New York Post, and HuffPost. Beginning 2007, the show became subject to on-air controversies and criticism due to frequent changes in its panel of co-hosts, subsequently causing a decline in ratings. In 2014, the show was transferred from the helm of the entertainment division to that of ABC News, which led to a viewership growth and warmer critical response. In 2017, the show became the only broadcast daytime program to see a rise in its overall audience from the previous season. In the span of twenty years, the show has won thirty Daytime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Talk Show and Outstanding Talk Show Host.
