The original lineup, consisting of thirty-seven episodes, was recorded and produced between 1972 and 1979. George Newall and Tom Yohe were the executive producers and creative directors of every episode, along with Bob Dorough as musical director. The first season of Schoolhouse Rock, "Multiplication Rock", debuted in 1973 and included all of the multiplication tables from two through twelve, with one episode devoted to powers of 10 (My Hero Zero) instead of multiples of ten. This original series was followed in short order by a new series, run from 1973 to 1975, entitled "Grammar Rock", which included nouns, verbs, adjectives, and other parts of speech (such as conjunctions, explained in "Conjunction Junction").
