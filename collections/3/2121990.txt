Miscarriage may occur for many reasons, not all of which can be identified. Risk factors are those things that increase the likelihood of having a miscarriage but don't necessarily cause a miscarriage. Up to 70 conditions,[5][1][25][26][27][28] infections,[29][30][31] medical procedures,[32][33][34][34] lifestyle factors,[6][7][6][35][36][37] occupational exposures,[10][38][10][38][39] chemical exposure,[39] and shift work are associated with increased risk for miscarriage.[40] Some of these risks include endocrine, genetic, uterine, or hormonal abnormalities, reproductive tract infections, and tissue rejection caused by an autoimmune disorder.[41]
