I added the language of who has the power to arm the militia from the Articles of Confederation as well as the corresponding language from the US Constitution, so that readers could more easily understand the concerns of the Founding Fathers. Salty has several times stated that the Second Amendment brought back the language of the Articles of Confederation. That is plainly not true as the states continue to NOT HAVE THE POWER to arm their own militias.71.184.184.238 (talk) 02:03, 20 August 2010 (UTC)
