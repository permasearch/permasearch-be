Businesses that have an online presence should provide accessibility to disabled users. Not only are there ethical and commercial justifications[24] for implementing the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, in some countries and jurisdictions, there are also legal reasons. Under UK law, if a business's website is not accessible, then the website owner could be sued for discrimination.[25]
