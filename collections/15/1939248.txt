We three kings of Orient are; Bearing gifts we traverse afar, Field and fountain, moor and mountain, Following yonder star  Refrain: O star of wonder, star of night, Star with royal beauty bright, Westward leading, still proceeding, Guide us to thy perfect light.  Born a King on Bethlehemâ€™s plain Gold I bring to crown Him again, King forever, ceasing never, Over us all to reign.  Refrain  Frankincense to offer have I; Incense owns a Deity nigh; Prayer and praising, all men raising, Worship Him God Most High.  Refrain  Myrrh is mine, its bitter perfume Breathes a life of gathering gloom; Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying, Sealed in the stone cold tomb.  Refrain  Glorious now behold Him arise; King and God and sacrifice; Alleluia!, Alleluia!, Peals through the Earth and skies.  Refrain
