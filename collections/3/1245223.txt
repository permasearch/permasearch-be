Recently, there have been reports of people dressing up untrained, ordinary pets as "service dogs" to bring their dog with them to places that only allow service dogs to be at. Law enforcement agencies have begun cracking down and penalizing people who attempt to pass of an ordinary pet as a service dog.[34] Online companies have been profiting by selling service dog vests and other accessories even though the buyers may not have a need for a service dog nor may their dog have been trained to be a legitimate service dog.
