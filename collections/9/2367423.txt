Mike is sent to Hawaii to check on a construction project, and his firm allows him to take the family and Alice along. The family then enjoys a tour of Hawaii before Mike visits the jobsite. When Bobby joins his father on the tour of the construction project, he stumbles upon an ancient tiki; which, according to an old Hawaiian legend, brings bad luck to anyone who touches it. The Brady boys laugh at the curse and blow it off as superstition, but then start to think differently when Greg has a surfing accident. During their sightseeing tour of Hawaii, the Bradys learn about the history and legend of Pearl Harbor, and Cindy is pleased to have legendary Hawaiian crooner Don Ho and Sam Kapu serenade her.
