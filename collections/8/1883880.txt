The story was adapted as a segment in the film Creepshow. Although there are numerous small changes, the film version remains essentially faithful to the written source material. The changes include the appearance of the beast to an ape-like creature with a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth, and the beast destroying the water-logged crate after being dumped in the 400-foot-deep (120Â m) lake and escaping into the outside world.
