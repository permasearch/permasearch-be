Cage reawakens and locates Vrataski, who takes him to Dr. Carter. Carter is an expert in Mimic biology and explains that Mimics are a superorganism in which the "Omega" controls the cerebrum, while the "Alphas" behave as the ganglia in which the Omega controls ordinary Mimics. If an Alpha is terminated, the Omega resets the day and rearranges its tactics until the battle is won. Cage inadvertently "hijacked" their ability to reset time through his exposure to an Alpha's blood. Vrataski had this ability at Verdun, using it to win the battle before losing its power when she was wounded in battle and received a blood transfusion. She tells Cage to locate and kill the Omega in order to end the alien invasion and save the human race.
