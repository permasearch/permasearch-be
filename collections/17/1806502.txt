Peirce was ordered to first send Col. Abram Duryee's 5th New York Volunteer Infantry (Duryée's Zouaves) from Camp Hamilton at Hampton to a point between Little Bethel and Big Bethel and then, after having cut the road to Big Bethel, to attack the Confederates at Little Bethel. Col. Frederick Townsend's 3rd New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, with two howitzers, was to march from Hampton after the 5th New York Infantry had departed and provide support at Little Bethel. Meanwhile, Col. J. Wolcott Phelps, commanding at Newport News, would send detachments from his own 1st Vermont Infantry and Col. David W. Wardrop's 4th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment (90–day Militia) under the command of Lt. Col. Peter T. Washburn to approach Little Bethel from the opposite side. Washburn would be followed by Col. Bendix's German–speaking 7th New York Infantry Regiment and two artillery pieces manned by regulars from the 2d U.S. Artillery Regiment, commanded by Lt. John T. Greble.[34] The plan was for this force to meet the 3rd New York Infantry under Townsend at a road junction about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from Little Bethel and form a combined reserve.[35] Peirce and his staff headed for Little Bethel with Townsend's 3rd New York Infantry Regiment.[36]
