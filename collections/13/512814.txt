From its inception, the scripts for the series had been drafted and the broadcasts produced by Harvey's son Paul Harvey, Jr., who in later years of his father's career also acted as a substitute host. Some of the radio stories were published in book form as The Rest of the Story and More of The Rest of the Story. (On the back cover of More of the Rest of the Story, the book is said to contain "True mysteries from history".) After the elder Harvey's death on February 28, 2009, ABC radio host Doug Limerick was chosen as the show's new host.[1] The Rest of the Story was canceled after three weeks with Limerick as host.
