In English, British and American historians tended to see the FLN as freedom fighters with the French being condemned as imperialists.[125] One of the first books about the war in English, A Scattering of Dust' by American journalist Herb Greer depicted the Algerian struggle for independence in a very sympathetic way.[126] Most work in English done in the 1960s and 1970s, which usually the work of left-wing scholars, focused on explaining how the FLN as a part of a generational change in Algerian nationalism and depicted the war as either a reaction to intolerable racist oppression and/or an attempt by peasantry impoverished by French policies to improve their lot.[127] One of the few military histories of the war was The Algerian Insurrection by a retired British Army officer Edgar O'Ballance who wrote with frank admiration for French tactics in Algeria, seeing the FLN as a terrorist group that needed to be suppressed and concluded that unfortunately the tactics that won the war militarily lost the war politically.[128]
