As is customary since 2004, the men's marathon medals (at the Summer Olympics) or the men's 50Â km cross-country skiing freestyle mass start medals (at the Winter Olympics) are presented as part of the Closing Ceremony, which take place later that day, in the Olympic Stadium, and are thus the last medal presentation of the Games.
