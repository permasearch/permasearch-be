Although there were no typical "yearly" updates to the DeLorean, several changes were made to the DeLorean during production.[2] John DeLorean believed that model years were primarily a gimmick used by automobile companies to sell more cars. Instead of making massive changes at the end of the model year, he implemented changes mid-production, which has become more common in car manufacturing.[citation needed]) This resulted in no clear distinction between the 1981, 1982, and 1983 model years, but with subtle changes taking place almost continuously throughout the life of the DeLorean. The most visible of these changes related to the hood style.[citation needed]
