The Helen Hall Library, a member of the Galveston County Library System, is operated by the city and located at 100 West Walker Street.[32][33] The League City Public Library was renamed after Hall in 1985. During that year a $2.5 million bond to expand the 7,000-square-foot (650 m2) library passed. The library received a two-story adult services wing and a renovation of the original structure, which housed the children's and audio-visual services sections; the projects were completed by 1988. As of 2008 Hall, with 29,000 square feet (2,700 m2) of space, is the largest and busiest unit of the Galveston County Library System.[34]
