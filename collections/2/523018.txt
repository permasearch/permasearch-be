George's most infamous affair, with the actress Mary Astor, became national news when Astor's husband, Franklin Thorpe, announced it to the press in 1934, during the couple's divorce proceedings.  To reporters' requests for comment, Beatrice responded, "I am not going to divorce Mr. Kaufman. Young actresses are an occupational hazard for any man working in the theatre."  According to their friend Alexander King, "Beatrice was one of those great, daring women who knows that her husband is having extramarital relations and knows that everybody else knows it, and knows that this can be borne either by throwing fits in lobbies or by being Wife Number One. And she was Wife Number One."[2]
