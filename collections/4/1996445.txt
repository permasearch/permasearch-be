Tour de Cure is a series of fund-raising cycling events held in 44 states nationwide to benefit the ADA.[24] The Tour is a ride, not a race, with routes designed for everyone from the occasional rider to the experienced cyclist. In 2009, Tour de Cure events across the nation began to recognize participants who have diabetes by awarding them with red shirts or cycling jerseys to signify that they are Red Riders.[25]
