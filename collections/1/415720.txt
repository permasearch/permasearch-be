This is the Pre-Deployment Phase. Here trainees will sit down with a job counselor and are shown a list of jobs they qualify for, and that are available, and are instructed to prioritize that list in order of preference. The job counselors then take the preferences, and the preferences of all of the other recruits in the same week of training that are in the same guaranteed aptitude area, and try and work it out the best they can to give everyone the preferences they want.[5] Those who enlisted with a guaranteed job will not go though this process.
