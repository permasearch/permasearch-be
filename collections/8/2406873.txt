When Robert Liggett (i.e., Big Boy Restaurants International) bought Big Boy from the bankrupt Elias Brothers in 2000, ten western Bob's Big Boys were in operation, dropping to eight by 2006. (The last Bob's in Hawaii closed after suffering a fire in 2009.[48]) Now limited to California, Bob's grew to 16 restaurants by 2011, but started to decline again. Although Big Boy Restaurants International expected to open 140 California units by 2018,[49] in 2017 only five Bob's Big Boy Restaurants remain, all in the Greater Los Angeles Area of Southern California.
