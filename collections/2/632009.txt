Touchscreens would not be popularly used for video games until the release of the Nintendo DS in 2004.[30] Until recently, most consumer touchscreens could only sense one point of contact at a time, and few have had the capability to sense how hard one is touching. This has changed with the commercialization of multi-touch technology.
