TR> Fred's new neighbor, Mr. Loudrock, becomes a thorn in his side, but Dino falls in love with Loudrock's pet and has puppies.  Note: Mr. Loudrock is voiced by Henry Corden, who later provided the singing voice of Fred in The Man Called Flintstone and years later replaced Alan Reed completely as the voice of Fred following Reed's death.
