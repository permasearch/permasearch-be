With approximately 1,200 square miles (3,100 km2) of offshore waters included in the Alabama’s Artificial Reef Program it is currently the largest in the United States. The program is the product of a cooperative agreement between the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Department’s Marine Resources Division. Started in 1953, the program continues to expand helping to reinforce the Gulf’s natural aquatic diversity.
