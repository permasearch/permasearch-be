The film's original negative was damaged because of poor care and ill treatment. AP International started a restoration project, which scanned the film frame-by-frame in a 2K workflow. They were able to remove all wear and tear and retain the natural film grain.[59] This restored version was released on 2 August 2012 on Blu-ray format.[1]
