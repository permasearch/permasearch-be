Area code 760 was split from 619 in 1997, which in turn had been split from area code 714 in 1982. Within a decade of its creation, however, the proliferation of cell phones and pagers left 760 strained to the point that a new area code was needed for the area. The initial plan was a further area code split, with the San Diego and Imperial portions moving to a new 442 area code. However, this met with protests from businesses who did not want to change their numbers for the second time in a decade. At 46,666 square miles (120,860Â km2), it is the largest area code in California with approximately 29% of the state served by area codes 760 and 442.[2]
