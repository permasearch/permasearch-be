The shoreline location and its changing position over time is of fundamental importance to coastal scientists, engineers and managers.[16] [20] Shoreline monitoring campaigns provide information about historic shoreline location and movement, and about predictions of future change.[22] More specifically the position of the shoreline in the past, at present and where it is predicted to be in the future is useful for in the design of coastal protection, to calibrate and verify numerical models to assess sea level rise, map hazard zones and to regulate coastal development. The location of the shoreline also provides information regarding shoreline reorientation adjacent to structures, beach width, volume and rates of historical change.[16][20]
