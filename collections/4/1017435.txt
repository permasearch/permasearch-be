In 2013, former Rouse employee Michael McCall proposed county executive-backed plans to convert the wooded land called Symphony Woods surrounding the pavilion. McCall's company, Strategic Leisure, first proposed a $50 million publicly funded six-story parking garage at the Toby's Dinner Theatre location; later proposals included a 39-acre arts park with features such as an outdoor amphitheater called the Chrysalis, a 300-foot-long floating picnic table, and an 800-foot-long tube called the Caterpillar.[32] The new project was named the "Inner Arbor", a spin on another Rouse development, Baltimore's "Inner Harbor".[33] Artist William Cochran, son of former County Executive Edward L. Cochran, and brother of Councilwoman Courtney Watson, was commissioned for artwork that includes horns up to 28 feet tall.[34]
