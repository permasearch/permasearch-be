Moore's Bond was very different from the version created by Ian Fleming. Screenwriters such as George MacDonald Fraser provided scenarios in which Moore was cast as a seasoned, debonair playboy who would always have a trick or gadget in stock when he needed it. This was designed to serve the contemporary taste of the 1970s. Moore's version of Bond was also known for his sense of humour and witty one liners, Moore himself said, "My personality is different from previous Bonds. Iâ€™m not that cold-blooded killer type. Which is why I play it mostly for laughs."[30]
