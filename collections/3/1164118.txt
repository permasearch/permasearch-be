Pajama Party (1964) was unofficially the fourth in the series; it was a science fiction spoof, Avalon ceded leading man duties to Tommy Kirk, but he had a cameo. He was back as leading man in Beach Blanket Bingo (1965). Avalon later recalled, "'That's the picture of mine that I think people remember best, and it was just a lot of kids having a lot of fun -- a picture about young romance and about the opposition of adults and old people... It was also fun because we got to learn how to fake skydive out of an airplane."[13]
