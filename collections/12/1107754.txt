Sunday on the Pot With George (acrylic on canvas by John Gedraitis; donated by Jim Schulman) has been deemed "iconic" by Bella English of The Boston Globe, who assures the work is "100 percent guaranteed to make you burst out laughing".[8] Wilson has pointed to George as an example of a technically well-executed piece of art using a subject not usually seen rendered in paint.[43]
