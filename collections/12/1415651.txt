In June 1999, TD sold 42 million shares or 12.4 percent of TD Waterhouse in an initial public offering, with shares priced at C$35.28 or US$24 per share, earning US$1.01 billion. In 2001, with the burst of the Dot-com bubble and lower trade volumes that decreased Waterhouse's share price, TD repurchased that minority stake at US$9 per share for only US$378 million, earning a profit on the privatization. The acquisition was conditional on TD owning at least 90 per cent of Waterhouse's outstanding common shares, and it owned almost 89 percent when the privatization was announced.[18][19]
