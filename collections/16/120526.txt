The US is the largest source of illicit traffic of weapons to Mexico. Many of the traceable weapons come from American weapons markets and festivals that do not have regulations for the buyers, and there is a geographic coincidence between the supposed American origin of the firearms and the places where these weapons are seized: mainly in the Northern Mexican states.[71] Most grenades and rocket-launchers are smuggled through Guatemalan borders from Central America.[72][73] Firearms that make their way to Mexico come from the American civilian market.[74][75] Most grenades and rocket-launchers are smuggled through Guatemalan borders, as leftovers from past central-American conflicts.[72] However grenades are also smuggled from the US to Mexico.[73] In an effort to control smuggling of firearms, the U.S. government is assisting Mexico with technology, equipment and training.[76] Project Gunrunner was one such efforts between the U.S. and Mexico to collaborate in tracing Mexican guns which were manufactured in or imported legally to the U.S.[77]
