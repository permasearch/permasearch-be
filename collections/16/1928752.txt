Muslims are playing an increasingly prominent role in political life.[97] Fifteen Muslim MPs were elected in the June 2017 general election,[98] and there are twelve Muslim peers in the House of Lords[citation needed] (there have historically been about fourteen, starting with Lord Stanley, a peer that lived in the 19th century).
