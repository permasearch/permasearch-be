At Magic Kingdom, the chase scene was altered to show the pirates making off with various treasure as the formerly "chased" women attempt to thwart them or to show pirates chasing women for food. The "Pooped Pirate" here holds a treasure map in his lap and a magnifying glass in one hand. The woman in the barrel remains, although this time she is hiding a small treasure chest in the barrel with her. Previously, the entire scene was pirates chasing women.[12]
