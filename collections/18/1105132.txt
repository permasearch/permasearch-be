In Germany, shopping days and opening hours were previously regulated by a federal law called the "Shop Closing Law" (Ladenschlussgesetz), first enacted in 1956 and last revised on 13 March 2003. However, on 7 July 2006, the federal government handed over the authority to regulate shopping hours to the sixteen states. Since then, states have been allowed to pass their own laws regulating opening hours. The federal Ladenschlussgesetz continues to be valid in states that have not passed their own laws.
