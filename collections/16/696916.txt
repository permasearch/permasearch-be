UCF has had eight head coaches since organized football began in 1979. The Knights have played nearly 400 games in their 34 seasons. In that time, 3 coaches have led the Knights to the postseason: Gene McDowell, George O'Leary, and Scott Frost. McDowell in 1987, 1990, and 1993, O'Leary in 2005, 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2012, and Frost in 2016 and 2017. O'Leary and Frost are the only coaches to win a division or conference championship at the school. Before leading UCF in 1983 and 1984, Lou Saban was a head coach in both the American Football League (AFL) and the National Football League (NFL).[197] O'Leary also coached in the NFL between 2002 and 2004.
