Patagonia's temperatures are relatively cold for its latitude due to the cold Malvinas Current and the high altitude.[16] A characteristic of the temperature pattern is the NW–SE distribution of isotherms due to the presence of the Andes.[15] The warmest parts of the region are in northern parts of Rio Negro Province and Neuquén Province, where mean annual temperatures range from 13 to 15 °C (55 to 59 °F), while the coldest are in western Santa Cruz Province and Tierra del Fuego Province, where mean temperatures range from 5 to 8 °C (41 to 46 °F).[16] At higher altitudes in the Andes stretching from Neuquén Province to Tierra del Fuego Province, mean annual temperatures are below 5 °C (41 °F).[16] Strong westerly winds can decrease the perception of temperature (wind chill), particularly in summer.[15] The annual range of temperatures in Patagonia is lower than at similar latitudes in the northern hemisphere owing to the narrowness of the region at higher latitudes and the stronger maritime influence.[15][115]
