In 2015 the National Capital Commission (NCC) put out a request for proposals to redevelop the LeBreton Flats area in Ottawa. In 2016 the NCC settled on the proposal presented by Senators owner Eugene Melnyk and his RendezVous LeBreton Group.[57] The proposal includes housing units, park space, a recreation facility, a library and a new arena for the Ottawa Senators.[58] Negotiations are proceeding, with a possible 2021 opening for the new arena.
