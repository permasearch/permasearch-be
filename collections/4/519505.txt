Young and hard-working, Fidel is married to a woman called Juliette and has a daughter named Rosie who was born in the Series 1 finale. He is put forward for his sergeant's exams by his boss, DI Richard Poole, in series 2, in recognition of his hard work. He passes them, and officially becomes a sergeant. Fidel often gets stressed and sticks to protocol, whereas Dwayne is the complete opposite. Nevertheless, the two become great friends. At the start of series 4, in a phone call between him and Dwayne (his voice does not feature; the conversation is shown from Dwayne's end), it is revealed that he has been promoted and is now working on the neighbouring island of St. Lucia.
