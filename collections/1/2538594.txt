The city's architecture is a mix of styles. Despite the appearance of large buildings, especially at the city's edge, Ljubljana's historic center remains intact. Although the oldest architecture has been preserved from the Roman period, Ljubljana's downtown got its outline in the Middle Ages.[87] After the 1511 earthquake, it was rebuilt in the Baroque style following Italian, particularly Venetian, models.
