Hobgoblins, by Rick Sloane, is widely considered a blatant rip-off that capitalizes on the popularity of the 1984 film Gremlins. It gained popularity in 1998 after being featured on an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. MST3K writer Paul Chaplin later commented on Hobgoblins, saying, "Oh, man. You have no idea the torture it was to watch this movie several times in the space of a week. It shoots right to the top of the list of the worst movies we've ever done." Specific points of the film that were lampooned was the extreme misogyny and atrocious treatment of women, the film's technical incompetence and repetitive scenes, its moronic, very poorly conceived plot, its dreadful acting, its ugly look and its preference towards rather needless vulgarity, particularly in regards to its characters and subject matter.[204] Greg Muskewitz at Efilmcritic.com called it "Jim Henson's worst nightmare",[205] while David Cornelius of DVD Talk stated, "There's not one aspect of this movie that isn't the Worst Thing Ever."[206] After seeing the MST3K episode himself, Sloane was inspired to direct a sequel, which was released in 2009.
