Around the same time that she approached Carter about writing an episode, Anderson was also receiving offers from several television networks to direct shows. She, however, had never directed before, and decided that she would first attempt to helm an episode of The X-Files before branching out into other series. Anderson thus expressed her wish to direct the episode when she pitched the original idea for "all things". Carter accepted her story, but did not appoint her as director until all the revisions and rewrites had been completed.[5] Anderson worked with series director Kim Manners for the majority of the episode, later noting that if she had any questions, she would approach Manners first. To help Anderson, Manners gave her directing exercises, such as making a list of shots for every scene.[8] The episode also marked the first time that a woman had helmed the direction of an episode of The X-Files.[5]
