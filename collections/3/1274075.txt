Some researchers and anti-tobacco advocates are concerned that irresponsible marketing could make e-cigarettes appeal to young people.[85][44] There is also a risk that infants or toddlers could ingest the e-liquid from an improperly-stored device.[86] About 48% of poison control calls involved exposures in children in 2016.[87] In 2016 there were 2,907 total calls specifically regarding e-cigarettes and liquid nicotine for all age ranges. The number of these calls seems to be trending downward after a peak of 4,023 calls for all ages in 2014. For 2018, the total number of calls for these vape related substance exposures is 2,226 for the first three quarters that have been reported.[88]
