The Institute for Theology, Imagination and the Arts (ITIA) was founded within the college by professors Trevor Hart and Jeremy Begbie (currently Thomas A. Langford Research Professor at Duke Divinity School) in 2000.  It "aims to advance and enrich an active conversation between Christian theology and the arts â€“ bringing rigorous theological thinking to the arts, and bringing the resources of the arts to the enterprise of theology."[10]  The current director is Dr Gavin Hopps.
