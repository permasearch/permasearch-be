The body and the broad, flat tail of the platypus are covered with dense, brown fur that traps a layer of insulating air to keep the animal warm.[9][14] The fur is waterproof, and the texture is akin to that of a mole.[17] The platypus uses its tail for storage of fat reserves (an adaptation also found in animals such as the Tasmanian devil[18]). It has webbed feet and a large, rubbery duck-like snout. The webbing is more significant on the front feet and is folded back when walking on land.[14] Unlike a bird's beak (in which the upper and lower parts separate to reveal the mouth), the snout of the platypus is a sensory organ with the mouth on the underside. The nostrils are located on the dorsal surface of the snout, while the eyes and ears are located in a groove set just back from it; this groove is closed when swimming.[14] Platypuses have been heard to emit a low growl when disturbed and a range of other vocalisations have been reported in captive specimens.[9]
