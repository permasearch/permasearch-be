Kim is raised in a nuclear family.[24] Unlike popular animated sitcoms such as The Simpsons and Family Guy, both of Kim's parents are intelligent, accomplished and attractive;[75] Kim's own intelligence is often attributed to the fact that she is born to a rocket scientist father and neurosurgeon mother.[63] Kim's inherent confidence is a Possible family trait; her father James, who views women as equals,[16] proudly reiterates the phrase "Nothing is impossible for a Possible" on numerous occasions.[18] In her younger years, Kim's grandmother "Nana" Possible fought crime much like Kim herself.[10] Kim Possible approaches the subject of the friend zone via Kim and Ron's relationship,[10][23] discussing male-female friendship in a manner reminiscent to that of the romantic comedy When Harry Met Sally... (1989).[75] According to Sarah Freymiller of Bustle, the protagonists friendship evokes that of Batman and the Joker, "Kim holds the functional and social power, while Ron exerts more of a calming, occasionally slapstick influence on the show ... he is the intelligent, kind chaos in her highly-organized life."[75] Kim and Ron are solely platonic friends for the show's first three seasons and remain best friends even after they start dating in Season 4, defying the popular belief that "being romantically involved is worth more than being in a friendship."[77] The series avoids the popular "Will they or wonâ€™t they?" trope often used in television shows, keeping them as a couple for the remainder of the series.[76] Having grown up together and learned from each other's mistakes, Kim and Ron ultimately make up for each other's shortcomings.[77] According to Feminist Fairytales, "Ron has a very relaxed attitude towards life which often provides a balance to Kim's assertive nature and perfectionism, while Kim helps Ron become much more independent and self-reliant."[77] Freymiller also believes Ron might have been conceived because "the creators sensed that television would only be able to accept a strong female character if she had a male counterpart," eliminating fears Kim might be perceived as too bitchy, complementing her actions as opposed to dominating.[75]
