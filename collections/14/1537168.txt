Foreign spirits are not of your family.  That is all it means.  Foreign spirits are not your ancestors.  My forefathers, for instance, were warriors and they killed some people.  When these people were killed, they become my family's foreign spirits.  There must be a working relationship with your foreign spirit and your ancestors.  They have something, an injustice, a murder that must be worked out, must be healed.  During training, as the ancestors come out, you have to finish up with your own ancestors first.  That relationship sorts itself out, then you are ready to work with the foreign spirits.  It happens in a natural way.  The ancestors do the work through you. Maybe the foreign spirit want to be the important or senior ancestor; when the ancestor of your clan comes, well, they may have to fight it out.  You might feel some aches during this time.  It is friction among them that is working itself out.[68]
