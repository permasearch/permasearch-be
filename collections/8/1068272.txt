Serving as the centrepiece of Canada's special operations, JTF2 is primarily tasked with counter-terrorism operations but also specializes in direct action, hostage rescue, personnel recovery, and foreign internal defence. Much of the information regarding Joint Task Force 2 is classified, and is not commented on by the Government of Canada.[6]
