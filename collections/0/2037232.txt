Tam O'Shanter closed on January 12, 2004.[12][15] An asbestos-removal project for the motel took 19 days to complete. Tam O'Shanter was subsequently demolished on February 6, 2004,[14] to make room for The Palazzo.[16] The Vagabond Inn, which contained asbestos as well, was also demolished in February 2004. The asbestos-removal project cost between $500,000 and $1 million.[14] The land had also been occupied by the Las Vegas Kosher Deli,[17] as well as several small stores that were owned by the Venetian and were expected to close to make room for The Palazzo.[12]
