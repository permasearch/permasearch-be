In July 1941 Mieczysław Słowikowski (codenamed "Rygor"—Polish for "Rigor") set up "Agency Africa", one of World War II's most successful intelligence organizations.[22] His Polish allies in these endeavors included Lt. Col. Gwido Langer and Major Maksymilian Ciężki (prewar heads, respectively, of Poland's Biuro Szyfrów, Cipher Bureau, and of its German section, B.S.-4, which broke Germany's Enigma ciphers).[18]  The information gathered by the Agency was used by the Americans and British in planning the amphibious November 1942 Operation Torch[23] landings in North Africa.  These were the first large-scale Allied landings of the war, and their success in turn paved the way for the Allies' Italian campaign.
