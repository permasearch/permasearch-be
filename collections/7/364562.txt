Italian singer Laura Pausini also released an Italian language cover of the song, titled "She (Uguale a lei)". The song was recorded for a Barilla TV spot. The lyrics of the song were adapted by Pausini herself, and are therefore different from the lyrics of Aznavour's Italian-language version of his hit.[24] It was also released as a digital single on 8 March 2006, but was not featured on any of Pausini's studio albums.[25] However, she recorded a new version of the song, included in her greatest hits album 20 - The Greatest Hits.
