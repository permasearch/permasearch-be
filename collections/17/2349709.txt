In "Cat's Cradle", Melissa returns to Rosewood and runs into Spencer at The Brew. In a brilliant display of passive aggression they discuss Melissa's interview, her potential position in San Francisco or London, along with Wilden's murder, and the fact that Melissa thinks they both need to get out of town. Later, Hanna finds what seems to be a cast of Melissa's face at Hector Lime's studio. Marin, alongside Aria and Emily, investigate the origins of the Alison Mask. Melissa claims she was questioned by Detective Gabriel Holbrook about Wilden, but doesn't know how helpful she was since she didn't really talk to him after high school.
