A grey tabby tom with blue eyes, Jay's Wing is a cat training to be a sharpclaw (warrior) of the ancients that lived at the lake before the four Clans. In Long Shadows, Jayfeather is taken back in time by Fallen Leaves, and walks in Jay's Wing's pawsteps.[26]  Jay's Wing/Jayfeather asks questions that confuse most of the Ancients. He helps Fallen Leaves's tribe decide to leave the lake by telling the leader, Furled Bracken, about a dream he had, one about the mountains the Tribe of Rushing Water lives in. He never truly had that dream, but rather had visited the mountains himself. After the beginning of the journey, Rock calls Jayfeather back and tells him it is time to return to ThunderClan. He reincarnated as Jayfeather, which is why when Jayfeather went back in time, he becomes Jay's Wing.
