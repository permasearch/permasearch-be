Creatures of the Night is the tenth studio album by American heavy metal band Kiss, released in 1982. It is the band's last for Casablanca Records, the only label for which Kiss had recorded up to this point. The album was dedicated to the memory of Casablanca founder and early Kiss supporter Neil Bogart,[1] who had died of cancer during the recording sessions. It is also the band's last album recorded with Ace Frehley credited as an official member (until 1998's Psycho Circus), and its first album with Vinnie Vincent as the initially uncredited lead guitarist (Vincent would later be credited but not featured on the cover of the 1985 reissue of the album). It was also the band's last album to feature the band with their trademark makeup until Psycho Circus was released.
