"Every Picture Tells a Story" was used in the Cameron Crowe movie Almost Famous in a scene where main characters William and Penny walk through the halls of a hotel.[2][12]  It was also included on the soundtrack of the video game Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost and Damned.  The song was also referenced in Jayne Anne Phillips' short story "What It Takes to Keep a Young Girl Alive."[6]  While the story's character Sue is lying in bed in the dark "Rod Stewart, scratchy and loud, combed his hair in a thousand different ways and came out looking just the same."[6]  Greil Marcus uses the reference to the song in "What It Takes to Keep a Young Girl Alive" to muse on what makes a good record and why "Every Picture Tells a Story" is a good record, i.e., a good record is one that "entering a person's life, can enable that person to live more intenselyâ€”as, whatever else it does, 'Every Picture Tells a Story' does for Jayne Anne Phillips' Sue."[6]
