While the idea of national symbols was strange to the Japanese, the Meiji Government needed them to communicate with the outside world. This became especially important after the landing of U.S. Commodore Matthew Perry in Yokohama Bay.[17] Further Meiji Government implementations gave more identifications to Japan, including the anthem Kimigayo and the imperial seal.[18] In 1885, all previous laws not published in the Official Gazette of Japan were abolished.[19] Because of this ruling by the new cabinet of Japan, the Hinomaru was the de facto national flag since no law was in place after the Meiji Restoration.[20]
