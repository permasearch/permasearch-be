During the Safavid dynasty (1501–1736), a dish called Berian (Nastaliq script: بریان پلو‬) was made with lamb or chicken, marinated overnight – with yogurt, herbs, spices, dried fruits like raisins, prunes or pomegranate seeds – and later cooked in a tannour oven. It was then served with steamed rice.[50]
