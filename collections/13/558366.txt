Many  species of Bombus, including the group sometimes called Psithyrus (cuckoo bumblebees), have evolved M端llerian mimicry, where the different bumblebees in a region resemble each other, so that a young predator need only learn to avoid any of them once. For example, in California a group of bumblebees consists of largely black species including B. californicus, B. caliginosus, B. vandykei, B. vosnesenskii, B. insularis and B. fernaldae. Other bees in California include a group of species all banded black and yellow. In each case, M端llerian mimicry provides the bees in the group with a selective advantage.[31] In addition, parasitic (cuckoo) bumblebees resemble their hosts more closely than would be expected by chance, at least in areas like Europe where parasite-host co-speciation is common; but this too may be explained as M端llerian mimicry, rather than requiring the parasite's coloration to deceive the host (aggressive mimicry).[32]
