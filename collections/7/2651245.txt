Balto (1919 â€“ March 14, 1933) was a mostly black with some white[1] Siberian husky and sled dog who led his team on the final leg of the 1925 serum run to Nome, in which diphtheria antitoxin was transported from Anchorage, Alaska, to Nenana, Alaska, by train and then to Nome by dog sled to combat an outbreak of the disease.[2] Balto was named after the Sami explorer Samuel Balto. Balto died of natural causes at age 14.
