Humpty Dumpty's theory, of two meanings packed into one word like a portmanteau, seems to me the right explanation for all. For instance, take the two words "fuming" and "furious." Make up your mind that you will say both words, but leave it unsettled which you will say first â€¦ if you have the rarest of gifts, a perfectly balanced mind, you will say "frumious."[11]
