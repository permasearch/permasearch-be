A birth pool is a specially designed vessel containing water for women to immerse themselves in for pain relief during labour. Birth pools work on the same principle as a bathtub, but are distinct from them[8] due to buoyancy and freedom of movement, factors deemed to be important in labour.[9] A birth pool can either be permanently installed or portable. Getting into a pool of water for labour is often called water birth because some women choose to remain in the water for birth as well.
