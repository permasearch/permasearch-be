T. H. Foley made the first medals from 1912 until they went out of business in 1915.[35] The eagle pendant and scroll were of die struck bronze washed with silver. Early versions were made with a short double knot and later ones with a long double knot. Only 338 of these medals were issued, making them the rarest version. Some Foleys were issued with a drop ribbon– the ribbon was extended, folded through the bar mount on the scroll, then dropped behind the eagle pendant and cut in a swallowtail. The first drop ribbon style medal was issued to the fourth Eagle Scout– Sidney Clapp, a 31-year-old Scoutmaster from West Shokan, NY.[34]
