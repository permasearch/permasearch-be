The 2015 Petit Le Mans was shortened to 7 hours, 51 minutes after being under one weather delay earlier in the race; after a safety car with slightly over two hours remaining, the race was abandoned after 179 laps because of weather conditions related to Hurricane Joaquin and related heavy rains in the Southeastern United States.
