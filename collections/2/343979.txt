The word "smog" (a portmanteau of "smoke" and "fog") is used to describe several forms of air pollution commonly found in urban and industrialized areas.[5][6] There are several ways to define and categorize types of smog, with some sources defining two main types of smog: smoky "London"-style smog and hazy "Los Angeles"-style smog.[7]
