Troy Nixey narrated the film at a screening at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International.[9] The initial release date was scheduled for January 21, 2011.[10] Due to the sale of Miramax by Disney on December 3, 2010 (but Disney kept the pre-2010 Miramax Films library), the release was put on hold until the sale was finalized.[11] The film was released on August 26, 2011.[12]
