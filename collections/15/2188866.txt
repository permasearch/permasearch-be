On 17 June 2014, a water park was opened, Parque Warner Beach.[1] The €8.5 million park spans 30,000 square metres (320,000 sq ft) and features two wave pools, a lazy river and two water play areas.[2] Like parts of the original amusement park, Parque Warner Beach is themed around Looney Tunes and Hanna Barbera characters.[1]
