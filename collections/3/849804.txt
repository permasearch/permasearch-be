The songs that appear on the soundtrack are in most cases alternate (live) and studio recordings that do not appear in the film. The alternate version of "Lost Inside of You" that actually appears in the movie, was finally released in 1991 as part of the 4-CD Barbra Streisand Anthology "For The Record". The only thing missing from the movie version is the final piano melody which is intact in this version.
