Under Part II, Article 46 of the New Hampshire Constitution, the Attorney General is appointed by the Governor with approval of the Council. The Attorney General serves a term of 4 years, as required by RSA 21-M:3, which is two years longer than the term of the Governor. The Attorney General and their Deputy must be "admitted to the practice of law in New Hampshire" and also "be qualified by reason of education and experience."[1]
