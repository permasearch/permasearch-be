Actinic keratosis is very common, with an estimated 14% of dermatology visits related to AKs.[74] It is seen more often in fair-skinned individuals,[29] and rates vary with geographical location and age.[75] Other factors such as exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation,[76] certain phenotypic features, and immunosuppression can also contribute to the development of AKs.
