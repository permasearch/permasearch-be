Mr. Boston noted to himself that this was his first date with New York - and his first date with a black woman. They went on a horse-drawn carriage ride and had a dinner outside by a lake, with a harpist playing music nearby. New York told Mr. Boston that she found him "way more attractive." In the limo ride on the way home, they fed each other treats, then began kissing.
