George took up darts at the age of 30, and quickly improved, winning the first tournament he entered[5] and making his first appearance at the World Masters less than a year later.[2] He has won several major tournaments, including the News of the World Championship in 1979 and 1986, the Butlins Grand Masters in 1979 and 1980, the North American Open in 1978 and the Nations Cup in 1980, as part of an England triples team with Tony Brown and John Lowe. George's News of the World victory in 1979 came without dropping a single leg, the only player to do so.
