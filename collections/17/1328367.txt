Many other legitimate Nihon jujutsu Ryu exist but are not considered koryu (ancient traditions). These are called either Gendai Jujutsu or modern jujutsu. Modern jujutsu traditions were founded after or towards the end of the Tokugawa period (1868) when more than 2000 schools (ryu) of j큰jutsu existed. Various traditional ryu and ryuha that are commonly thought of as koryu jujutsu are actually gendai j큰jutsu. Although modern in formation, very few gendai jujutsu systems have direct historical links to ancient traditions and are incorrectly referred to as traditional martial systems or ryu. Their curriculum reflects an obvious bias towards Edo j큰jutsu systems as opposed to the Sengoku j큰jutsu systems. The improbability of confronting an armor-clad attacker is the reason for this bias.
