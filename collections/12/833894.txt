After West Germany were unexpectedly eliminated in the first round of Euro 1984, Franz Beckenbauer returned to the national team to replace Derwall as coach.[31] In the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, West Germany had a slow start to the tournament thanks partly to the hot climate and high altitude- conditions that were for the most part foreign to nearly all of the European teams. In the warm, rainy aridity and high altitude of Queretaro they drew with Uruguay 1-1, were beaten 2-0 by a flying Denmark side and beat Scotland 2-1, finishing runner up behind Denmark in their group. They then traveled to the intense heat and humidity of Monterrey to face Morocco, which they won 1-0 and then to face the hosts Mexico. After a goalless draw, West Germany won on penalties 5-4, and they would then travel to the tropical heat, rain and altitude of Guadalajara to face a strong Michel Platini-led French side- a rematch between the two sides after a classic duel during the previous World Cup in Spain. West Germany held their nerve to beat the French 2-0, and they then traveled to the 7,380 ft altitude of Mexico City to face a Diego Maradona-led Argentina in the final at the famous Azteca Stadium. Argentina took a 2-0 lead but Karl-Heinz Rumenigge and Rudi Voller tied the game in the second half, but Argentina scored a 3rd in the 85th minute and West Germany finished as runners-up for the second consecutive tournament.[32][33] In Euro 1988, West Germany's hopes of winning the tournament on home soil were spoiled by the Netherlands, as the Dutch gained revenge of their loss in 1974 by beating them 2â€“1 in the semifinals.[34]
