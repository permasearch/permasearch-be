The next two and a half years for Fleetwood Mac turned out to be the most challenging and far more difficult. In the three albums they released in this period, they constantly changed line-ups. In September 1972, the band added guitarist Bob Weston and vocalist Dave Walker, formerly of Savoy Brown and Idle Race.[25] Bob Weston was well known for playing slide guitar and had known the band from his touring period with Long John Baldry. Fleetwood Mac also hired Savoy Brown's road manager, John Courage. Fleetwood, The McVies, Welch, Weston, and Walker recorded the band's seventh studio album, Penguin, which was released in January 1973. After the tour, the band fired Walker, because his vocal style and attitude did not fit well with the rest of the band.
