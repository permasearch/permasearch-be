Bank of Ireland, the country's oldest banking institution are Leinster's primary sponsors appearing in the front of their shirt, their sleeves, the top back of their shirt and the front right of their shorts. The Bank of Ireland symbol appeared on Leinster's front right and front left collars. On occasion the team will wear a shirt adorned with the logo of another sponsor due to a promotion run annually by the bank offering up the sponsorship space to an Irish business by way of a competition to win the right to become sponsor for a day.[57] During the 2013–14 season the contest was won by Dublin-based meat wholesaler Gahan Meats[58] and for 2014–15 the shirt sponsorship winners were accounting software provider Big Red Cloud.[59] The sponsorship prize package is valued at €50,000 and attracts hundreds of companies keen to be shortlisted each year.[60] The left of Leinster's back shorts had Bank of Ireland between 2009 and 2013 where it was replaced by Bank of Ireland's Twitter address right up until 2015 where it was replaced by Laya Healthcare.
