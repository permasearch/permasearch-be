It was designed to be carried in a coat pocket or kept on a night-stand, and many have survived to the present day in good condition, having seen little actual use.[38] Numerous copies of this design were made during the late 19th century in Belgium, with smaller numbers also produced in Spain, France and the USA.[39] They remained reasonably popular until the Second World War, but are now generally sought after only as collectors' pieces, since ammunition for them is for the most part no longer commercially manufactured.
