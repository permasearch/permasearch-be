In the season 13 episode "Blame It on Lisa", The Simpsons visit Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. In the week following the episode's original broadcast, it faced intense controversy involving the country of Brazil, most specifically the Rio de Janeiro Tourist Board (Riotur). The board claimed that the city was portrayed as having rampant street crime, kidnappings, slums and a rat infestation.[154][155] The tourist board asserted that the show "went too far" and undermined an $18m (Â£12.5m) advertising campaign to attract visitors to the city.[154] Fernando Henrique Cardoso, then the president of Brazil, stated that the episode "brought a distorted vision of Brazilian reality."[156][157] By April 9, Riotur, was preparing to sue the producers and Fox, for damage to its international image and loss of revenue. The issue threatened to become a diplomatic incident.[156] Upon knowledge of an impending lawsuit, the show's producers contacted Fox lawyers, who informed them that a city could not technically sue for defamation.[158] In response, executive producer Brooks apologized, stating "we apologize to the lovely city and people of Rio de Janeiro".[159] Jean commented that it was "one of the biggest controversies in the history of the show".[158]
