OK, we've been running this for 3 1/2 weeks and it appears there is a strong consensus on question #1, that being to not use cquotes in this article. This has been a recurring question; I consider that this finally settles it unless overturned by another review of this extent. With that decided, I think there is no real remaining dispute on question #2 ("What shall we do here?")....it is just an open question, and I'd recommend the normal talk process to work on that.
