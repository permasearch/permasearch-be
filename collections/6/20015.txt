In 2014 MBAUP delivered 6 G 300 professional lwb cab chassis for new prototype fire fighting vehicles in Victoria Australia. Commencing late 2015 a "fire pack" version of the G300 lwb cab chassis will be delivered for the first of more than 300 of the "Ultra Light Fire Tankers". The Fire pack includes factory fitted reinforced front winch bar and recovery points (2)rated to 50 kn, 100 amp power supply to the rear of the vehicle, fire protected fuel, electrical and brake lines and a tow bar and rear recovery points as well as enhanced rear body mounts to handle the continuous high weight, extreme operating environment and strength for the industry leading Falling Object Protection System (FOPS) that is installed on the vehicles. The fire pack and ULT have been developed jointly by Mercedes and fire vehicle specialists from the Victorian government department responsible for fire management on public land, to meet the need for an extremely capable, off-road, small (4500Â kg), fire truck. The proven toughness of the G Klasse platform combined with an innovative fire vehicle body has set a new standard for the Australian forest fire industry.
