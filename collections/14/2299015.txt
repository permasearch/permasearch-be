Also called the Shadow Phoenix is the primary antagonist of the second season. He is an ancient being from the beginning of when all things were created. In the 4Kids dub, he was created when a man sought to control the shadow fire and merged with it. The Shadow Phoenix is the diametrical opposite of the Dragon, and like the Dragon, he is very powerful. The dragon is the source of energy and light while the Shadow Phoenix absorbs energy and magic, making his essence the opposite of the Dragon's Flame. He is the cause of the destruction of Domino, since the Ancestral Witches were his servers who acted upon his orders. After the Ancestral Witches were defeated, the Lord of the Templars of Roccaluce defeated Lord Darkar and sent him into a deep slumber from which he woke up at the beginning of the second season, possibly by the reappearance of the Dragon Flame in the magical universe. He kidnapped the pixies, rescued the Trix from their prison and used the Codex and Bloom's Dragon Flame to open a portal to the Realm of the Relix. The Shadow Phoenix nearly succeeded in his plot to claim the Ultimate Power and rule the magical universe, but in the end, Darkar was defeated by all six Winx Club members and was destroyed for good. He is voiced by Jason Griffith in the 4Kids dub and by Michael Dorn in the Nickelodeon dub.
