Portugal's representative, Salvador Sobral drew attention to the European migrant crisis by turning up to the first semi-final winners' press conference in an "S.O.S. Refugees" shirt.[185] "If I'm here and I have European exposure, the least thing I can do is a humanitarian message", Sobral said. "People come to Europe in plastic boats and are being asked to show their birth certificates in order to enter a country. These people are not immigrants, they're refugees running from death. Make no mistake. There is so much bureaucratic stuff happening in the refugee camps in Greece, Turkey and Italy and we should help create legal and safe pathways from these countries to their destiny countries", he added, earning a round of applause.[186] Later on, EBU ordered a ban so that he could not wear it for the remainder of the contest.[187] The EBU explained that Sobral's jumper was used as a means of "political message," which violates the rules of the contest.[187] However, Sobral argued in his winning press conference that it was not political, but a message of humanitarianism.[188]
