The role was originated on July 30, 1987, by Cyndi James Gossett on a recurring basis. Gossett last appeared as Lexie on February 20, 1989.[4] In 2011, an error listing Sheila DeWindt Wills as having portrayed Lexie was corrected by James Reynolds, who portrays Abe Carver: Sheila did not portray Lexie, she portrayed the role of nurse, Joan Hopkins, from 1982-83. The error occurred when Wills was mixed up with the second actress to portray Lexie, Angelique deWindt Francis (both having similar surnames).[5] Francis portrayed the character from March 31, 1989, until August 2, 1990, and again from March 9 to December 12, 1992. Shellye Broughton appeared for two episodes on January 28 and 29, 1993, with Ren√©e Jones taking over on February 2, 1993, and remaining until the character's exit.
