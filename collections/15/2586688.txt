Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Lloyd George, as well as future Prime Minister Winston Churchill were in attendance for the match.[22] The press billed the match as England versus Wales, and noted that the Welsh fans included high numbers of woman as well as mothers with babies. There were special trains laid on for the Cardiff fans, which began arriving at Paddington train station from 4am onwards.[20] The Metropolitan Railway put on additional trains to commute fans from Baker Street station to Wembley Park; one every two minutes. Between 11am to kick off, 30,000 fans per hour travelled this route;[19] some 100,000 fans were expected to arrive at the ground.[23] The Welsh fans made special excursions across London; some travelled to St. Paul's Cathedral, where they sang Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau. Other fans went to The Cenotaph, Whitehall, where they dressed it in Welsh colours to honour the veterans of the First World War.[19]
