The Supreme Court's 1873 Slaughterhouse Cases decision[65] contained the statement that "The phrase, 'subject to its jurisdiction,' was intended to exclude from its operation children of ministers, consuls, and citizens or subjects of foreign states born within the United States."[66]  However, since the Slaughterhouse Cases did not deal with claims of birthright citizenship, this comment was dismissed in Wong Kim Ark[67] and later cases as a passing remark (obiter dictum) lacking any force as a controlling precedent.[68][69]  As to whether the Wong Kim Ark was correct on this point or not, modern scholars are divided.[70][71]
