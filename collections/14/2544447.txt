The 1985½ model received a facelift (less chrome, restyled tail lamps, flush headlights), and the 1.6 L engine was replaced with a 1.9 L. GT models featured a high output engine with revised intake manifold, cylinder head and a real header available only with a manual transmission. The Lynx was retired for 1987, but was replaced by the Mazda 323-derived Tracer model. [This Mazda platform was revamped in 1989 and debuted as the 1990 Mazda Protege. The updated platform would form the basis for the next generation (1990–1996) Escort/Tracer.]
