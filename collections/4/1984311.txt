The car is spartan, although it features inflatable lumbar support and adjustable seats. Along with the absence of exterior door handles, the vehicle lacks side windows and a roof. Although a soft top cover was available, it was designed primarily for indoor vehicle storage. Side curtains of fabric and clear plastic operated by zippers can be inserted into the door and hand-bolted when needed. All of these decisions were made to reduce weight. The battery is located in the sealed compartment over the rear wheels to increase rear-end weight and traction. The car shipped with a tonneau cover and video tape on soft-top assembly (the soft top is removable and folds to fit in the trunk). In 1994 the car came, for the first time since release with several options available to the buyer. These included air conditioning, adjustable suspension, larger diameter wheels to accommodate larger brakes, and a fiberglass hardtop for the roof.
