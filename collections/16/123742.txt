Clearwater Beach is characterized by white sand beaches stretching for 2.5 miles (4Â km) along the Gulf and sits on a barrier island. It has a full marina on the Intracoastal Waterway side and is linked on the south by a short bridge to another barrier island called Sand Key, where Sand Key Park is located.
