In reviewing the new retail format, a reporter for The Motley Fool wrote that the new stores were "closer to a combination of a fruit stand, convenience store, and a restaurant than a traditional grocery store"[182] while a MarketWatch reporter called them "hipster havens" due to their use of high tech as a cost cutting and efficiency measure.[183] Most reviews were very positive although a few customers said that they miss talking to a person when placing food orders via tablets.[184]
