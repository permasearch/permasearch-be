The National Lacrosse League (NLL) is a men's professional box lacrosse league in North America. Headquartered in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, the NLL currently has nine teams: five in the United States and four in Canada.[1] Unlike other box lacrosse leagues which play in the summer, the NLL plays its games in the winter and spring, from December to June. Each year, the playoff teams battle for the Champion's Cup. The NLL has averaged between 9,800 and 10,700 spectators per game each year since 2004.[2]
