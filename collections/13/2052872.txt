where s was the angle of first minimum in seconds of arc, a was the radius of the aperture in inches, and the wavelength of light was assumed to be 0.000022Â inches (560 nm; the mean of visible wavelengths).[3] The Rayleigh criterion for barely resolving two objects that are point sources of light, such as stars seen through a telescope, is that the center of the Airy disk for the first object occurs at the first minimum of the Airy disk of the second. This means that the angular resolution of a diffraction-limited system is given by the same formulae.
