Pick n Pay is the second largest supermarket chain store in South Africa, established in 1967. It can also be found in other regions of southern Africa, such as Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Namibia, Swaziland, and had plans to open in Malawi but has yet to do so. The founder of the chain was Jack Goldin, a native of Obeliai, Lithuania who moved to South Africa when the Nazis invaded his town. Raymond Ackerman purchased three Pick n Pay supermarkets in Cape Town from Goldin, and served as executive chairman until his retirement in 2010. His eldest son, Gareth, is the current chairman.[4]
