In India, the outbreak of the Seven Years' War in Europe renewed the long running conflict between the French and the British trading companies for influence. The war spread beyond Southern India and into Bengal, where British forces under Robert Clive recaptured Calcutta from the Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah, a French ally, and ousted him from his throne at the Battle of Plassey in 1757. In the same year, the British also captured the French settlement in Bengal at Chandernagar.[111]
