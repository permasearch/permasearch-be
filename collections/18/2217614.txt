The buildup and onset of World War II encouraged the development and production of special vehicles for military purposes in the 1930s. Auto Union became an important supplier of vehicles to Germany's armed forces.[6] Following the outbreak of war, civilian production was interrupted in May 1940. After this, the company produced exclusively for military purposes.[6]
