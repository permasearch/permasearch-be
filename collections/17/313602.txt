Michael Engler directed the pilot episode, which was written by Steve Franks.[57] The following three episodes were developed by Franks,[58][59][60] who returned to write the season's tenth episode, "From the Earth to the Starbucks",[61] as well as co-authoring the season finale with James Roday.[62] Andy Berman, who would often present scripts which were a few dozen pages too long, wrote the third, eleventh, and twelfth episodes for the season.[55] Executive producers Kerry Lenhart and John J. Sakmar collaborated to write the seventh and fourteenth episodes, with assistance from Douglas Steinberg on the latter.[63][64] Script editor Anupam Nigam also wrote two episodes.[65] William Rabkin, who would later write a series of novels for the series,[66] collaborated with Lee Goldberg to write the ninth episode.[67]
