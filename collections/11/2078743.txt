Factoring as a fact of business life was underway in England prior to 1400, and it came to America with the Pilgrims, around 1620.[30] It appears to be closely related to early merchant banking activities. The latter however evolved by extension to non-trade related financing such as sovereign debt.[31] Like all financial instruments, factoring evolved over centuries.

These also drove and were driven by modifications of the common law framework in England and the United States.[32]
