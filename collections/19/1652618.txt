While diving, the emperor penguin's oxygen use is markedly reduced, as its heart rate is reduced to as low as 15â€“20 beats per minute and non-essential organs are shut down, thus facilitating longer dives.[15] Its haemoglobin and myoglobin are able to bind and transport oxygen at low blood concentrations; this allows the bird to function with very low oxygen levels that would otherwise result in loss of consciousness.[35]
