Occasionally there may be a twist to the Detour format. Season 25 introduced a "Blind Detour" where competitors were only given the name of their tasks and the destination in the clue to decide from, rather than a short description of the tasks also provided in the envelope. Season 26 featured a "Roulette Detour", where the detour choice was determined by a spin of a roulette wheel (with Red leading to one task and Black leading to the other).
