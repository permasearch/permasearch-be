The idea for Ski Cross originated with Jim "Too Tall" Essick, one of the founders of Recreational Sports Marketing (RSM), in the late 1980's. Essick wanted to bring the excitement of motocross to skiing, in order to make ski races more exciting for spectators. The idea was pitched to several corporations, but unfortunately none wanted to sponsor the concept at the time. Years later, one of the companies that had been pitched to—Swatch Watch—used the idea in one of their films, exchanging skis for snowboards and calling it "boarder cross." Eventually similar events were staged with skis and, thus, skier cross was born.
