The ascent of Creag Nay 57°22′N 4°25′W﻿ / ﻿57.36°N 4.41°W﻿ / 57.36; -4.41 presented issues of curling tracks, poor terrain and steep ascents. It was decided a rack and pinion system would be most effective. Flexible cogged belt was stuck on a wooden baton which was glued to the centre of a track. This engaged with a cog wheel fitted on the axle of the Silver Lady. The navvies completed the construction successfully, albeit the wet climatic conditions interfering with the adhesive. Testing with a supplied gear wheel proved successful but unfortunately there was no testing with a real locomotive before the first train came to pass. When tried operationally it was found that while successfully causing the locomotive to climb the gradient the centre tooth belt was set too high meaning the locomotive was not properly resting on both rails and having an extreme propensity to toppling over. The belt was therefore ripped out and an improvised winch system based on an electric drill used to assist the locomotive up the slope.
