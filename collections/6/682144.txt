The first submarine that did not rely on human power for propulsion was the French Navy submarine Plongeur, launched in 1863, and equipped with a reciprocating engine using compressed air from 23 tanks at 180 psi.[26] In practice, the submarine was virtually unmanageable underwater, with very poor speed and maneouverability.[14]
