This was also the first Grand Slam tournament since the 2009 French Open in which Murray, Nadal and Djokovic all failed to reach the semifinals, and the first time since 2004, that no player will be able to reach all 4 quarterfinals in a year. With his win over Murray, Querrey became the first American man to reach a Grand Slam semifinal since Andy Roddick at the 2009 Wimbledon Championships. For the first time since the 2005 Australian Open, David Ferrer was not seeded at a Grand Slam and the first time since the 2004 US Open that fellow Spaniard Guillermo García López did not play at a Grand Slam, ending his streak of 50 consecutive Grand Slam appearances.[6]
