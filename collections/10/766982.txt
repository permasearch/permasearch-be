The phrase Anyone for tennis? is thought to have originated from George Bernard Shaw's 1914 play Misalliance, in which Johnny Tarleton asks "Anybody on for a game of tennis?"[1] This phrase is often used to typify a particular genre of drawing room comedy about the leisured upper class.[citation needed]
