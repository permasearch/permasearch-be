In California, Highway 1 named the Pacific Coast Highway or the "PCH" runs along the coast from Leggett, California (north of San Francisco) south through Big Sur to Los Angeles before terminating in Orange County. PCH runs along the coast while Pacific Highway runs inland. An old freeway section of U.S. Route 101 parallel to Interstate 5 near the San Diego International Airport is known as 'Pacific Highway' and is now locally maintained. It also runs through the North County of San Diego.
