Unions and radical organisations including anarchist groups and socialist and communist parties have kept the international May Day tradition alive with rallies and demonstrations. In 1919 the left mounted especially large demonstrations, and violence greeted the normally peaceful parades in Boston, New York, and Cleveland and a number of people were killed.[24][25] In Milwaukee, an annual commemoration takes place at the site of the killing of seven workers during an 8 hour march.[15] Some of the largest examples of this occurred during the Great Depression of the 1930s, when hundreds of thousands of workers marched in May Day parades in New York's Union Square.
