Adrian Brown and Victor Henri laid the groundwork for the discoveries in enzyme kinetics that Michaelis and Menten are known for.[4] Brown theoretically envisioned the mechanism now accepted for enzyme kinetics, but did not have the quantitative data to make a claim.[4] Victor Henri made significant contributions to enzyme kinetics during his doctoral thesis, however he lacked noting the importance of hydrogen ion concentration and mutarotation of glucose. The goal of Henri’s thesis was to compare his knowledge of enzyme-catalysed reactions to the recognized laws of physical chemistry.[2] Henri is credited with being the first to write the equation that is now known as the Michaelis-Menten equation. Using glucose and fructose in the catalytic reactions controlled by maltase and invertase, Leonor Michaelis was the first scientist to distinguish the different types of inhibition by using the pH scale which did not exist in Henri’s time.[2]
