Touching the names of the dead on memorials was common gesture of grieving in the inter-war period; sometimes mourners would also kiss the names.[176] Visitors to the memorials on the Western front would often photograph or trace on paper the relevant names on the memorials, taking these reminders back with them to their homes.[177] By contrast, the naming of the dead played a less significant role in Italy, where formal lists of the war dead were not established until the mid-1920s; local communities compiled their own lists, used to produce local memorial plaques, but the national lists remained inaccurate for many years.[178]
