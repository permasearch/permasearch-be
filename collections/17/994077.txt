GamePro's review stated that "Beautifully polished graphics and game-play refinements enhance the already-awesome action that has put PGA Tour at the top of the leaderboard." They particularly praised the detailed digitized backgrounds and the new Ball Lie window, saying it adds a new layer of complexity to lining up shots.[11] A reviewer for Next Generation lauded the game's realistic digitization of the players and backgrounds, selection of courses, new features, and addition of an arc meter to help control backspin. He summarized that "Other Genesis golf games have looked better (like the first Genesis golf game, Arnold Palmer Golf), but none maintain the depth of play or the true PGA experience like PGA III has captured." He gave it four out of five stars.[12]
