Hasdrubal, the son of Mago, was elected as "king" eleven times, was granted a triumph four times (the only Carthaginian to receive this honour â€“ there is no record of anyone else being given similar treatment by Carthage) and had died of his battle wounds received in Sardinia.[95] Carthage had engaged in a 25-year struggle in Sardinia, where the natives may have received aid from Sybaris, then the richest city in Magna Graecia and an ally of the Phocaeans. The Carthaginians faced resistance from Nora and Sulci in Sardinia, while Carales and Tharros had submitted willingly to Carthaginian rule.[96] Hasdrubal's war against the Libyans failed to stop the annual tribute payment.[97]
