A "major consequence"[59] of the typewriter's development was the entrance of women into the clerical work force.[60] Although women were already employed in factories and certain service industries in the 1880s, the typewriter facilitated an influx of women into office settings.[61] Before the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) established the first typing school in 1881,[62] women were trained by the manufacturer and their typing services provided to customers along with the machine.[58] The expansion of correspondence and paper work that demanded the efficiency of typewriters, however, also created demand for additional clerical workers. The low wages accepted by women—often 50% (or less) of those paid to a man—made them more attractive economically to businesses when filling the new positions. As typing and stenography positions could pay up to ten times more than those in factories, women were attracted in large numbers to office work.[63] In 1874, less than 4% of clerical workers in the United States were women; by 1900, the number had increased to approximately 75%.[64] Before his death, Sholes remarked of the typewriter, "I do feel that I have done something for the women who have always had to work so hard. This will enable them more easily to earn a living."[25]
