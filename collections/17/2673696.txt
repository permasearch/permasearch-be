North Karnataka's history[2][3] and culture date back to prehistoric times. The earliest Stone Age find in India was a hand ax at Lingasugur, in Raichur district. Sangankal Hills in the Bellary district, which is known as the earliest village settlement of South India,[4] dates back to the Neolithic period. Iron weapons from 1200Â BC, found at Hallur in Dharwad district, demonstrate that North Karnataka used iron earlier than northern India.[5] Prehistoric sites in North Karnataka include rock shelters in Bellary, Raichur and Koppal districts with red paintings[6] which include figures of wild animals. The paintings are done in such a way that the walls of caves are not facing northwest, so the northwest monsoon does not affect them. These rock shelters are found at Kurgod, Hampi in Bellary district and Hire Benakal, near Gangavati in the Koppal district. Burial chambers using granite slabs (known as dolmens) are also found; the best examples are the dolmens of Hire Benakal and Kumati in Hadagali Taluk.
