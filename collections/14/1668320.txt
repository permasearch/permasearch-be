Dawn is tired of always being on a team with her brothers, so she joins a ballet class with Mae; however, the boys believe that she needs them, so they also join the class. Dawn confronts them after class at Get Sporty and they get into a fight about who needs who, leading the boys to quit. A talented ballerina in the class, Eiffel, says that she needs the boys to make her look good and tells Dawn not to come back to class without them. Mae tries to stick up for Dawn, but the girls kick her out, too. Meanwhile, Tom and Anne are thinking of ways to make their 10% sale a success and realize that the last time the sale was a hit was the same year that Anne was pregnant with the quadruplets as people felt sympathy for her, so they decide to make it look like Anne is having another baby to hopefully make more money. They keep the charade up until Anne has a talk with Dawn about honesty, leading her to feel guilty about lying to the customers and refuses to keep lying, despite Tom's thoughts on the subject. In the end, Nicky, Ricky, and Dicky find three more boys to take their places in ballet class, much to Dawn and May's relief, and Tom and Anne decide to use their first idea to promote the sale by dressing up Squishy Paws as a sailor dog.
