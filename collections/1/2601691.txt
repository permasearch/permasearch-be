The films poke fun at the outrageous plots, rampant sexual innuendo, and two dimensional stock characters characteristically associated with 1960s spy films, as well as the clichÃ© of the ultra-suave super spy. Contrary to the handsome, super-smooth leading men of the James Bond genre, Austin Powers is not conventionally attractive (he is especially known for his bad teeth), although female characters in the films seem to find him irresistible.
