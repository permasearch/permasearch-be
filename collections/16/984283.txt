Opposition to homosexuality in China originates in the medieval Tang Dynasty, attributed to the rising influence of Christian and Islamic values,[145] but did not become fully established until the late Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China.[146] The Chinese Psychiatrists' Association removed homosexuality from the list of mental illnesses in April 2001.[147][148] However, as openly gay scriptwriter and teacher Cui Zi'en points out, "In the West, it's frowned on to criticize homosexuals and even more to make them feel different", says Cui Zi'en, contrasting it with Chinese society which, "is changing, but there'll always be people who'll feel disgust".[149]
