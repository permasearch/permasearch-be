On 17 March 1649, a French expedition of 203 men from Martinique, led by Jacques Dyel du Parquet who had been the Governor of Martinique on behalf of the Compagnie des Iles de l'Amerique (Company of the Isles of America) since 1637, landed at St. Georges Harbour and constructed a fortified settlement, which they named Fort Annunciation.[3] By 1700, Grenada had a population of 257 French (whites) and 53 coloureds with 525 African slaves to work on 3 sugar estates and 52 indigo plantations.[4]
