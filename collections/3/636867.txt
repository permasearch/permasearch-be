Dave Heaton of PopMatters described the song as a "song of rebirth" with a "fairly complex" narrative.[15] He summarized the content of the lyrics, writing "[i]t starts in the past, at the start of a relationship, and then lets us know it’s a flashback. They’re sitting on the couch reminiscing. It then jumps back to the beginning and steps us through the couple’s years together, but all the while shifting perspective, jumping between their separate memories."[15] James Dinh of MTV noted that the song "features an uplifting country/pop melody and a big chorus" and it talks about "the wonders of being in a happy relationship after surviving a rocky past."[16] Priya Elan of The Guardian believed that "Mine" depicts "a stop-start relationship between a normal guy and girl".[17] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly interpreted the song's message to be about "young love blossoming — in this specific case, young college love."[18]
