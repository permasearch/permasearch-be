In addition, many education systems in Canada have established different courses with varying intensity in order to curtail to a pupil's desired future. Ontario has gone the furthest with this idea, establishing two different streams in their secondary education system. The university stream includes courses that will prepare students for future studies at university, while the college stream is more applied and less intense, preparing individuals for the future pursuit of a college degree. Universities require these advanced courses for admission, while colleges will admit pupils from either stream.
