In the extra-cellular environment of maturing enamel, an excess of fluoride ions alters the rate at which enamel matrix proteins (amelogenin) are enzymatically broken down and the rate at which the subsequent breakdown products are removed.[2][12] Fluoride may also indirectly alter the action of protease via a decrease in the availability of free calcium ions in the mineralization environment.[12] This results in the formation of enamel with less mineralization. This hypomineralized enamel has altered optical properties and appears opaque and lusterless relative to normal enamel.[2]
