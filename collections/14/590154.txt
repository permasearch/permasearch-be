Throughout Jurassic Park, he makes several predictions based on chaos theory about the consequences and ultimate failure of attempting to control nature, which often turn out to be correct. During his time on the island, Malcolm is seriously injured during the initial tyrannosaur attack. He survives and is brought back to the visitor's center, and spends the remainder of the novel bedridden, usually under the influence of high doses of morphine, continuing to comment on the Park's inherent flaws and impending collapse. Although he is declared dead at the end of the novel, in the sequel, he explains that the declaration was premature. Thanks to timely intervention by surgeons from Costa Rica, he survives the ordeal, but ends up with a permanent leg injury, requiring a cane to walk. In the film adaptation, Malcolm does not use a cane.
