This is an advanced type of reversing camera that does not require the use of cables between the camera itself and the display. It functions remotely. Wireless rear-view cameras usually have separate sources of power from the display.[10] The cameras are usually powered by the same power source as the brake and thus switches on automatically when one engages the reverse gear. Majority of these backup cameras usually come with a transmitter (near the camera) and a receiver (near the display) for relaying the signals and live images. Some models such as the Pearl RearVision backup camera, which is made by Pearl Automation, use solar energy for power.The display for these types of backup camera can be powered from the cigarette socket on the car's dashboard. Some of the displays are also integrated on the rear-view mirror thereby giving it a multipurpose function. Some models also sync directly with one's phone using an app which then acts as the display. The main advantage of this type of backup camera is that it is extremely easy to install and rarely requires the help of professional when doing it. The installation of these cameras also do not interfere with a car's look as minimal to no drilling or laying of wires is required. However, this comes at a cost as some of these wireless cameras are quite expensive.
