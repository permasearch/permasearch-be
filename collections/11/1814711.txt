The descriptive statistic       (   x   −  μ   )   T      Σ   − 1   (   x   −  μ  )     {\displaystyle {\sqrt {({\mathbf {x} }-{\boldsymbol {\mu }})^{\mathrm {T} }{\boldsymbol {\Sigma }}^{-1}({\mathbf {x} }-{\boldsymbol {\mu }})}}}   is known as the Mahalanobis distance, which represents the distance of the test point       x     {\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} }}   from the mean      μ    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\mu }}}  . Note that in case when     k = 1   {\displaystyle k=1}  , the distribution reduces to a univariate normal distribution and the Mahalanobis distance reduces to the absolute value of the standard score.
