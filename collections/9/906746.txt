Among members of the Royal Family throughout history, Diana remains one of the most popular, and continues to influence the principles of the Royal Family and its younger generations.[289][290] She was a major presence on the world stage from her engagement to the Prince of Wales in 1981 until her death in 1997, and was often described as the "world's most photographed woman".[20][291] She was noted for her compassion,[292] style, charisma, and high-profile charity work, as well as her ill-fated marriage to the Prince of Wales.[293] Her former private secretary described her as an organised and hardworking person, and pointed out that the Princess's husband was not able to "reconcile with his wife's extraordinary popularity",[294] a viewpoint supported by biographer Tina Brown.[295] He also said that she was a tough boss who was "equally quick to appreciate hard work", but could also be defiant "if she felt she had been the victim of injustice".[294] Paul Burrell, who worked as a butler for the Princess, remembered her as a "deep thinker" capable of "introspective analysis".[296] She was often described as a devoted mother to her children,[20][297] who are influenced by her personality and way of life. In the early years, Diana was often noted for her shy nature,[289][298] as well as her shrewdness, funny character, and smartness.[290] Those who communicated with her closely describe her as a person who was led by her heart.[20] The Princess was also said to have a strong character, because she entered the Royal Family as an inexperienced girl with little education, but could handle their expectations, and overcome the difficulties and sufferings of her marital life.[144]
