The cervical canal is a pathway through which sperm enter the uterus after sexual intercourse,[18] and some forms of artificial insemination.[19] Some sperm remains in cervical crypts, infoldings of the endocervix, which act as a reservoir, releasing sperm over several hours and maximising the chances of fertilisation.[20] A theory states the cervical and uterine contractions during orgasm draw semen into the uterus.[18] Although the "upsuck theory" has been generally accepted for some years, it has been disputed due to lack of evidence, small sample size, and methodological errors.[21][22]
