Fear of being buried alive is the fear of being placed in a grave while still alive as a result of being incorrectly pronounced dead. The abnormal, psychopathological version of this fear is referred to as taphophobia (from Greek τάφος - taphos, "grave, tomb"[1] and φόβος - phobos, "fear"[2]), which is translated as "fear of graves".[3]
