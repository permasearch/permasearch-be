Stella Kaminsky (nÃ©e Lindquist, formerly Wingfield; Polly Bergen) is Lynette's mother. She used to be an abusive mother, who frequently beat her girls. She used to get drunk and abuse drugs very often, and also bring strange men over to their house. She was almost always absent, so Lynette had to take care of her little sisters and make them go to school. Stella had breast cancer when she was younger.
