Part One: The discovery of a flayed face in a Whitechapel gallery sparks the start of a killing spree where the victims are being found with no faces, fingerprints and the skin having been sliced from their back. The first victim, a Russian gangster, was in the midst of attacking a young girl when he was murdered, but the girl describes the killer as having an elderly female appearance. Could the killer really be an old lady? Or is the killer disguising himself with masks of his previous victims, or possibly even something more sinister?
