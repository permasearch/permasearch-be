On 17 January 2014 Thurston was announced as 2013's Golden Boot Award winner following his prominence in Australia's World Cup and Queensland's State of Origin successes. It was his second Golden Boot in three years.[85] Thurston played in the 2014 Anzac Test at five-eighth, kicking 5 goals in a man-of-the-match performance in Australiaâ€™s 30-18 victory at the Sydney Football Stadium.[86] In Round 10 against the Sydney Roosters, Thurston played his 200th club match for the Cowboys, scoring a try and kicking 7 goals in the 42-10 win at 1300SMILES Stadium.[87] Thurston went on to play five-eighth for Queensland in the 2014 State of Origin series. Despite Queensland losing both Game 1 at home and Game 2 away in Sydney as well as the 2014 Origin Series, Thurston broke Mal Meninga's record of 161 points as 'Top Point-Scorer in State of Origin' when he kicked his 2nd penalty goal in the 1st half of Game 2 in the Maroons 6-4 loss.[88][89] In Game 3, Thurston retained his position at five-eighth kicking all 6 goals in Queensland's 32-8 win over New South Wales at Suncorp Stadium.[90] Following the 2014 State of Origin Series, Thurston switched from five-eighth to halfback in Round 19 against the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks in the Cowboys 36-18 win at Remondis Stadium.[91] Thurston continued playing at halfback throughout the back end of the season, up to the Cowboys Finals Week 2 controversial match against the Sydney Roosters at the Sydney Football Stadium. Thurston inspired the Cowboys to comeback from 30-0 down after 34 minutes to even at 30-30 after 56 minutes, scoring the Cowboys third try in the comeback. After the Roosters five-eighth James Maloney kicked a field goal to give the Roosters a 31-30 lead at the 75th minute, Thurston scored a try that was disallowed by the video referee after the ball came forward off the arm of Cowboys five-eighth Robert Lui when winger Kyle Feldt threw an offload to him. The Cowboys lost the match 31-30, meaning the Cowboys season ended controversially for the third year in a row.[92] The switch to halfback following the Origin series, Thurston produced a lot of great and strong playing performances every week until their elimination from the finals, winning 8 from 10 games while playing in the halfback position. Thurston finished off the 2014 NRL season with him playing in 24 matches, scoring 11 tries kicking 93 goals and kicking 4 field goals for the Cowboys.
