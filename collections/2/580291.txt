Searching for water, food, or mates, the painted turtles travel up to several kilometers at a time.[67] During summer, in response to heat and water-clogging vegetation, the turtles may vacate shallow marshes for more permanent waters.[67] Short overland migrations may involve hundreds of turtles together.[62] If heat and drought are prolonged, the turtles will bury themselves and, in extreme cases, die.[68]
