While it is technically illegal in most states and territories of Australia to be drunk and disorderly, most Australian police are relatively lenient about public intoxication. They generally transport the IP ("Intoxicated Person") to his or her residence or temporary detention at a police station or other welfare establishment until the person is sober.
