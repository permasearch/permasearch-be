Tagging gained popularity due to the growth of social bookmarking, image sharing, and social networking websites.[2] These sites allow users to create and manage labels (or "tags") that categorize content using simple keywords. Websites that include tags often display collections of tags as tag clouds,[5] as do some desktop applications.[6] On websites that aggregate the tags of all users, an individual user's tags can be useful both to them and to the larger community of the website's users.
