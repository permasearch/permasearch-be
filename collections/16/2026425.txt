After the 2014 season, Banister interviewed with the Houston Astros as a candidate to fill their managing vacancy, following the firing of Bo Porter.[21] The Astros instead hired A. J. Hinch.[34] He also interviewed with the Texas Rangers, and was a finalist for the position along with Rangers' interim manager Tim Bogar and pitching coach Mike Maddux.[35] On October 16, 2014, the Rangers named Banister their new manager. He signed a three-year contract with an option for a fourth season.[36][37] Jon Daniels, the Rangers' general manager, indicated that Banister will help the Rangers to incorporate analytics into their baseball decisions.[31]
