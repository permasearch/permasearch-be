The MacDill-based 12th and 15th Tactical Fighter Wings were subsequently designated as the 836th Air Division. The 836th AD was committed to provide one hundred sorties in the planned first strike. They were to also press napalm and rocket attacks against surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites at Mariel and Sagua La Grande as well as the airfields at Santa Clara, Los Banos and San Julien.
