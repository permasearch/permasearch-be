The song was incredibly successful in Europe and Oceania, reaching the top spot in Australia and New Zealand, number 2 in the United Kingdom and Ireland, the Top 5 in Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands, and the Top 10 in Germany, Switzerland, Denmark and Belgium. It also reached number 8 in Brazil. Despite this, however, its success initially didnâ€™t translate to the United States, where it only peaked at number 40. It received fame after being used in the soundtrack to Rugrats in Paris: The Movie and even more so after it became a ubiquitous sports anthem at stadiums and arenas throughout the world, based largely on the efforts of a sports marketing company hired by the song's producer, Steve Greenberg.
