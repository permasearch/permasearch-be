The use of kbd as positive in connotation does also appear in the Hebrew Bible. In Genesis 13:2, Abraham is described as very "heavy" in the context of his material wealth and importance and other figures to whom positive adjectives such as "heroic" or "glorious" are attached, are also described as kbd ("heavy").[4] Kbd is also used to refer to the "heaviness" of God, and in this case it is most commonly translated as referring to his "glory".[4] God's glory (kabhodh: Septuagint dÃ³xa) was visible fire[5] It is occasionally used also of the soul or spirit in man[6]
