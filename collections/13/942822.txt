In July 2012, an episode of the PBS series History Detectives recounted the story of New Jersey resident Dawn Peterson, who claimed the Fender Stratocaster Dylan played at Newport was in her possession. She explained that Dylan had left the guitar on a plane piloted by her father, Victor Quinto, in 1965. In the program, vintage-instrument specialist Andy Babiuk is convinced the guitar in question is the one played at Newport. Lyrics of songs in the guitar case are identified as Dylan's work by Dylan memorabilia collector Jeff Gold. Dylan attorney Orin Snyder denied the authenticity of the guitar in a statement: "Bob has possession of the electric guitar he played at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965." Snyder added, "He did own several other Stratocaster guitars that were stolen from him around that time, as were some handwritten lyrics."[22]
