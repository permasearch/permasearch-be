Unrecognized tribes in the United States are organizations of people who claim to be historically, culturally or genetically related to historic Native American Indian tribes but who are not officially recognized as indigenous nations by the United States federal government, which has a direct relationship with sovereign nations, or by individual states under their separate legislative processes, or by recognized indigenous nations.
