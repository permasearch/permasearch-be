The actions taken by Serena in this episode, however, were mainly criticized. Enid Portuguez from Los Angeles Times said, "Her judgment has been more than impaired lately." He goes on to say, "If it weren't for the wolves that caused Trip's Range Rover to swerve", he was sure that Serena would actually have accepted being Tripp's secret mistress. He gave a negative review to Blake Lively's performances in the episode, by saying in other words that Serena's accident "was the only head injury I have ever cheered for." He also said that when it comes to Lily and Rufus's problems in their marriage, he would expect "a showdown between Rufus and Dr. Van der Woodsen".[5]
