A needs assessment is a part of planning processes, often used for improvement in individuals, education/training, organizations, or communities. It can refine and improve a product such as a training or service a client receives. It can be an effective tool to clarify problems and identify appropriate interventions or solutions.[2] By clearly identifying the problem, finite resources can be directed towards developing and implementing a feasible and applicable solution.[3] Gathering appropriate and sufficient data informs the process of developing an effective product that will address the groups needs and wants.[4] Needs assessments are only effective when they are ends-focused and provide concrete evidence that can be used to determine which of the possible means-to-the-ends are most effective and efficient for achieving the desired results.[5]
