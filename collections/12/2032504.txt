The national colours of Canada (French: Couleurs nationales du Canada) were declared by King George V in 1921 to be red and white[1] and are most prominently evident on the country's national flag. Red is symbolic of England and white of France, the colours having been used representatively by those countries in the past.[2] The maple is one of the national symbols and red is the first leaf colour after spring budding & also the autumn colour of maple leaves.[3]
