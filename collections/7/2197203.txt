In addition to its usual purpose as an edible vegetable, cabbage has been used historically as a medicinal herb for a variety of purported health benefits. For example, the Ancient Greeks recommended consuming the vegetable as a laxative,[42] and used cabbage juice as an antidote for mushroom poisoning,[83] for eye salves, and for liniments used to help bruises heal.[84] In De Agri Cultura (On Agriculture), Cato the Elder suggested that women could prevent diseases by bathing in urine obtained from those who had frequently eaten cabbage.[42] The ancient Roman nobleman Pliny the Elder described both culinary and medicinal properties of the vegetable, recommending it for drunkennessâ€”both preventatively to counter the effects of alcohol and to cure hangovers.[85] Similarly, the Ancient Egyptians ate cooked cabbage at the beginning of meals to reduce the intoxicating effects of wine.[86] This traditional usage persisted in European literature until the mid-20th century.[87]
