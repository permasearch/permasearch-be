A JuD official reported on 25 July that a 30-member medical team of its "Muslim Medical Mission" will apply for visas to India in order to treat the injured Kashmiri civilians and will seek help of Pakistan's government in getting the visas. The mission's president also threatened to hold demonstrations if the Indian government denied visas to it.[312] The Indian Embassy in Islamabad did not allow the team to enter its premises when they went there to apply for visa on 26 July. However, the team was able to apply for a visa through the Internet and courier.[313] A caravan of the JuD bringing relief material for the Kashmiris was stopped on 2 August by Pakistani security forces at Chakothi. The organisation declared that they would not leave unless India accepted the relief material.[314]
