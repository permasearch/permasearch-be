(According to a November 2014, separatist estimate, which is roughly in line with the estimate of the Ukrainian government) in November 2014 over 50% of the total Donetsk oblast population, around 1,870,000 people, lived in separatist controlled territory.[23] Although the rebels do not have control of most of Donetsk Oblast, this number is relatively high since the DPR has been controlling major urban areas and cities like Donetsk and Horlivka.[23] As of 17 June 2015, it is estimated that around half of the people living in separatist controlled territory are retired pensioners.[121]
