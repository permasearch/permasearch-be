Piracy "became one of the most common male occupations" for Africans and African-Americans in the early 19th century. Black sailors filled about one-fifth of the population at various sea havens. Becoming a pirate offered a choice of other occupations for African-Americans that could improve their conditions.[18]:4, 2, 69 "Africans and African Americans both free and enslaved were numerous and active on board pirate vessels."[1]:54 Some chose piracy because the only other option was slavery.[18]:12–13 Some black pirates were escaped slaves. Boarding a pirate vessel became a way to escape to the Atlantic North undetected. Escaped slave Frederick Douglass disguised himself in "sailor's garb," and "was able to travel undetected to the North and his freedom."[19]:26 As crewmen, blacks made up part of the "pirate vanguard."[1]:54–55 They also worked the seafaring trades of "ship building, caulking, and sail making."[19]:25
