In Slovenia, Kurentovanje is also the biggest and best known carnival.[27] There are several more local carnivals usually referred to as Laufarija. In Hungary, and the Hungarian-speaking territories, it is called Húshagyókedd (hu)[28] (literally the Tuesday leaving the meat) and is celebrated by fancy dress and visiting neighbours.
