As of the fourth quarter in 2016, there is a commercial rebranding campaign set out to rebrand the downtown area of Panama City, Florida to "Harrison" or "Harrison Historic Downtown Panama City." There is currently ongoing backlash to this rebranding attempt from the area's merchants. Harrison Ave. is the road (thoroughfare) that runs through downtown Panama City, Florida.
