Between November 1923 and April 1954, there were a total of 35 executions in the state.[22]  In the 1920s, execution was relatively common for murderers.[18] In the absence of a local executioner, the Irish government retained the pre-independence custom of having a British hangman come to Mountjoy Prison to perform executions.[9] There was local opposition to this, and in the 1940s an Irishman sent to Britain as apprentice to Albert Pierrepoint was deemed to lack "the character to be an executioner".[23][24] 55 men and women were also sentenced to death in that time period but ultimately received a reprieve. Thirteen were sentenced for murdering their newborns, and 42 for other types of murder.[25]
