"Tears Don't Fall" is one of Bullet for My Valentine's most popular songs and is often regarded as one of the band's greatest songs. Since the release of The Poison, it has become a staple to their live set and usually draws in the most crowd response, most notably during the bridge and guitar solo. It was featured in the band's three DVDs: The Poison: Live at Brixton, Rock am Ring 2006, and Scream Aim Fire: Live at London Alexandria. Tears Don't Fall (Part 2), a new version of the old song has been put up on the band's 4th studio album Temper Temper.
