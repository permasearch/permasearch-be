Madden NFL 19 features "real player motions," allowing players to push blockers to gain more yards while running and make realistic cuts up-field after the catch, as well as take part in interactive touchdown celebrations for the first time since Madden NFL 09 including team celebrations, which were made legal by the NFL for the 2017 season.[3] There were also changes to the Ultimate Team mode, introducing three vs three online matchups as well as a  "Solo Battles" game mode, a leaderboard-driven reward system that measures players' performances in daily single-player challenges.[6] The game will also feature a sequel to Longshot, Madden NFL 18's single-player story-driven mode, with more focus on football gameplay and NFL-related events.[7]
