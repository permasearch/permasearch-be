Without a proper ordering or permutations in the matrix, the factorization may fail to materialize.  For example, it is easy to verify (by expanding the matrix multiplication) that      a  11   =  l  11    u  11     {\textstyle a_{11}=l_{11}u_{11}}  . If      a  11   = 0   {\textstyle a_{11}=0}  , then at least one of      l  11     {\textstyle l_{11}}   and      u  11     {\textstyle u_{11}}   has to be zero, which implies that either L or U is singular. This is impossible if A is nonsingular (invertible). This is a procedural problem. It can be removed by simply reordering the rows of A so that the first element of the permuted matrix is nonzero. The same problem in subsequent factorization steps can be removed the same way; see the basic procedure below.
