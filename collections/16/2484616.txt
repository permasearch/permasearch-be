Thomas Collins (Mike O'Neill), Phil Collins' other son, made his first appearance in Season 7's episode, "The Mustard Tiger". He drives a 1967 "RS Camaro". He is very protective of his brother Jacob, always trying to keep him away from the trouble he believes will result from associating with Julian. He is later revealed as an aggressive brute, pushing Ricky up to trailer walls, grabbing Julian's collar, and fighting with Sam Losco.
