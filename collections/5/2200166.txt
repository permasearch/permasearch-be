The Badgers undertook trip to New Zealand and Australia where they played five games against New Zealand and Australia professional teams.[1] The 12-day trip began August 12, 2017 and helped determine the roster as the Badgers look to replace four departing seniors from last year.[2] The Badgers won four of the five games they played on the trip. A different player led Wisconsin in scoring in each of the games and none of them was first-team All-Big Ten forward Ethan Happ, who did average 12.0 points, 6.4 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 2.4 steals.[3] Coach Greg Gard was impressed by the balanced scoring of his team on the trip.[4]
