Galaxy Quest went on to achieve cult status through the years, particularly from Star Trek fans for its affectionate parody, but also to more mainstream audiences as a comedy film of its own.[5][6][7] Several former cast and crew members of Star Trek also went on to praise the film.[8] It was included in Reader's Digest's list of The Top 100+ Funniest Movies of All Time in 2012, while Star Trek fans voted it the seventh best Star Trek film of all time in 2013.[5][6][9][10][11]
