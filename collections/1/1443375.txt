For thousands of years, present-day central North Dakota was inhabited by indigenous peoples, who created successive cultures. The historic Mandan Native American tribe occupied the area long before Europeans arrived. They spoke the Hidatsa language.[9] The Hidatsa name of Bismarck is mirahacii arumaaguash ("Place of the tall willows");[10] the Arikara name is ituhtaáwe [itUhtaáwe].[11]
