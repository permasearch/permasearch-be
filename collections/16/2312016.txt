"Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst" is a song by American hip hop recording artist Kendrick Lamar, from his major label debut studio album Good Kid, M.A.A.D City (2012). The song, which appears as the tenth track on the album, was released as an ordinary album track. However, it is one of Lamar's lengthier songs, clocking in at twelve minutes and three seconds. The song is actually split into two parts throughout the track, the first part notably titled "Sing About Me", which is about exactly seven minutes, and the second part notably titled "I'm Dying of Thirst", is approximately two minutes and fifty-seconds. There is a skit in between the two parts and another one right after the second section.
