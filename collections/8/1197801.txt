Madagascar not only contains two radically different climatic zones, the rainforests of the east and the dry regions of the west,[2] but also swings from extended drought to cyclone-generated floods.[134] These climatic and geographical challenges, along with poor soils, low plant productivity, wide ranges of ecosystem complexity, and a lack of regularly fruiting trees (such as fig trees) have driven the evolution of lemurs' immense morphological and behavioral diversity.[19][2][36][98] Their survival has required the ability to endure the persistent extremes, not yearly averages.[134]
