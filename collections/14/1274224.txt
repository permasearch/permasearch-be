A wizard of Fairy Tail, Mest Gryder (メスト・グライダー, Mesuto Guraidā) uses a memory alteration charm to erase his memories of being in the guild to infiltrate the Magic Council for Fairy Tail's benefit even though Makarov Dreyar disapproves.[ch. 213,416] He joins the Magic Council as an intelligence operative named Doranbalt (ドランバルト, Doranbaruto, also "Doranbolt") and eventually re-infiltrates Fairy Tail to dig up dirt on the guild for his own interests.[ch. 213,223] In addition to his memory-altering spell, he is also capable of using the Direct Line (瞬間移動 (ダイレクトライン), Dairekuto Rain, Japanese text translates as "Teleportation") spell, which allows him to teleport himself to various locations at will. Disguising himself as Mystogan's disciple, Mest participates in the guild's S-Class qualification trial on Sirius Island with Wendy Marvell as his partner.[ch. 202] After Grimoire Heart is defeated by Fairy Tail, Mest eventually becomes sympathetic towards the guild, and is distraught at being unable to save them from Acnologia.[ch. 223, 248] Seven years later, Mest is one of the few survivors to escape Tartaros's bombing of the Council, and releases the Oración Seis from prison in exchange for information on Tartaros, which he uses to help Fairy Tail. After the battle, he discovers his original identity, retires from the service, and rejoins the guild.[ch. 438]
