Paramount Pictures distributed the earliest films from 1919 to 1921. Margaret J. Winkler distributed the shorts from 1922 to 1925, the year when Educational Pictures took over the distribution of the shorts. Sullivan promised them one new Felix short every two weeks.[13] The combination of solid animation, skillful promotion, and widespread distribution brought Felix's popularity to new heights.[14]
