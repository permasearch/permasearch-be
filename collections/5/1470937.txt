In contrast to the Catholic Church, the Cathars had but one sacrament, the Consolamentum, or Consolation. This involved a brief spiritual ceremony to remove all sin from the believer and to induct him or her into the next higher level as a perfect.[25] Unlike the Roman Catholic sacrament of Penance, the Consolamentum could be taken only once.
