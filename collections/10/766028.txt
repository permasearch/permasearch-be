Pratityasamutpada, also called "dependent arising, or dependent origination", is the Buddhist theory to explain the nature and relations of being, becoming, existence and ultimate reality. Buddhism asserts that there is nothing independent, except the state of nirvana.[302] All physical and mental states depend on and arise from other pre-existing states, and in turn from them arise other dependent states while they cease.[303]
