HSTs operating with Great Western Railway and Virgin Trains East Coast will be replaced on their current duties by Class 800/801/802 trains by 2020. Twenty-six sets each with four or five carriages are to move from Great Western Railway to Abellio ScotRail and be refurbished with controlled emission tanks and plug automatic doors. They will operate on services from Edinburgh and Glasgow to Aberdeen and Inverness.[73][74][75] An unrefurbished set was delivered to Craigentinny TMD for crew training in September 2017.[67]
