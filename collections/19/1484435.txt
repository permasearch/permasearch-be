Also in Series Four, Alfred is still caught up in the downstairs "love square". He is in love with Ivy, who is in love with Jimmy, while Daisy is in love with Alfred and determined to break them up. It takes Alfred too long to realize that Daisy was the better match, and only tries to approach her when he comes back to the Abbey after leaving for his cooking course. Daisy initially tried to avoid seeing Alfred at all, but eventually speaks to him and wishes him well as a friend. In the Christmas Special, she receives a letter from Alfred, implying that they keep in touch.
