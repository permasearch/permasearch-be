Not only the federal government was involved, but also the provinces, who were in engaged in an era of "province building" (expanding the reach and importance of the provincial governments) around this time.  The prototypical example is undoubtedly Hydro-Qu√©bec, founded in 1944 and now Canada's largest electricity generator and the world's largest producer of hydro-electricy.  It is widely seen as a symbol of modern Quebec, helping to create the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s where French-speakers in Quebec rose to positions of influence in the industrial economy for the first time, and Quebec nationalism emerged as a political force.  This model followed by SaskPower in 1944 and BC Hydro in 1961.  Other areas provinces were active in included insurance (Saskatchewan Government Insurance, 1945)
