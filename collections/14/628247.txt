In the 13th century, mendicant orders were founded by Francis of Assisi and Dominic de Guzm√°n which brought consecrated religious life into urban settings.[220] These orders also played a large role in the development of cathedral schools into universities, the direct ancestors of the modern Western institutions.[221] Notable scholastic theologians such as the Dominican Thomas Aquinas worked at these universities, his Summa Theologica was a key intellectual achievement in its synthesis of Aristotelian thought and Christianity.[222]
