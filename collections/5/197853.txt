A charge     q   {\displaystyle q}   located at       r  0      {\displaystyle \mathbf {r_{0}} }   can be described mathematically as a charge density     ρ (  r  ) = q δ (  r −  r  0    )   {\displaystyle \rho (\mathbf {r} )=q\delta (\mathbf {r-r_{0}} )}  , where the Dirac delta function (in three dimensions) is used. Conversely, a charge distribution can be approximated by many small point charges.
