The Treaty of Greenville (1795) was the first to cede Native American land in what became the state of Indiana and made it easier for colonial settlers to reach territorial lands north of the Ohio River.[12] Under its terms, the American government acquired two-thirds of present-day Ohio, a small tract of land in what would become southeastern Indiana, the Wabash-Maumee portage (near the present-day site of Fort Wayne, Indiana), and early settlements at Vincennes, Ouiatenon (in present-day Tippecanoe County, Indiana, and Clark's Grant, (near present-day Clarksville, Indiana, along the Ohio River.[13] In exchange, the Indians received goods valued at $20,000 and annuity payments.[14] Most of the remaining territory, including a large portion of present-day Indiana, remained occupied by native tribes, but the tribes living along the Wabash-Maumee portage had to relocate. The Shawnee removed east to Ohio; the Delaware established villages along the White River; and the Miami at Kekionga moved to the Upper Wabash and it tributaries.[15]
