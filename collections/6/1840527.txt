A case report is generally considered a type of anecdotal evidence.[2] Given their intrinsic methodological limitations, including lack of statistical sampling, case reports are placed at the foot of the hierarchy of clinical evidence, together with case series.[3] Nevertheless, case reports do have genuinely useful roles in medical research and evidence-based medicine.[4] In particular, they have facilitated recognition of new diseases and adverse effects of treatments.[5] (For example, recognition of the link between administration of thalidomide to mothers and malformations in their babies was triggered by the report of a particular case.)[6] Case reports have a role in pharmacovigilance.[5] They can also help understand the clinical spectrum of rare diseases, as well as unusual presentations of common diseases.[4] They can help generate study hypotheses, including plausible mechanisms of disease.[4] Case reports may also have a role to play in guiding the personalization of treatments in clinical practice.[4]
