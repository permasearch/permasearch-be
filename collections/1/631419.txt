Barbas, the Demon of Fear who was previously vanquished by the Charmed Ones, is reconjured by the Tribunal; he later partners with Gideon in the finale.[88] Once the parents become alerted to and begin looking for the influence threatening the future, Gideon manages (by improvising) to make the Halliwells believe Wyatt is going to be made evil by the hosts of a demonic reality TV show, which involves killing witches. After those threats are vanquished, Gideon kills his henchman, Sigmund, who has assisted him in deceiving everyone but is about to tell everything to the Charmed Ones.[89] Gideon sends Leo and Chris, followed by Paige and Phoebe, into a mirror dimension where Evil rules, to get them out of his way. In the evil world, the good Barbas advises that Gideon has been behind this all along. As Gideon's evil counterpart is caught trying to kill Wyatt, the Phoebes and Paiges of both worlds try to vanquish him, and the balance between Good and Evil shifts.[90] The Good world becomes too good, which affects Piper and then, via a spell she writes while under Barbas' influence, Phoebe and Paige. Leo manages to turn them back to normal and, after Chris dies by Gideon's hands, Leo avenges his death, killing Gideon and restoring the balance in the process.[91]
