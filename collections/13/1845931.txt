The etymology of Cadmus' name remains uncertain.[9] Possible connected words include the Semitic triliteral root qdm signifies "east" (In Hebrew, qedem means "front", "east"; the verb qadam (Syriac: ܩܕܡ‎) means "to be in front"),[10][11] and the Greek kekasmai (<*kekadmai) "to shine".[note 1] Therefore, the complete meaning of the name might be: "He who excels, from the east".[13]
