In a few short days after this rejection, Mr Collins' sentiments are quickly transferred to Elizabeth's friend Charlotte Lucas, who encourages his regard because she seeks to improve her own social position (and does not wish to remain a spinster). Since Collins has very good prospects, Charlotte is determined to gain his favour.[7] Her plan works well. A few days after this Elizabeth hears that Charlotte is now engaged to Mr Collins. Upon hearing this news from Charlotte herself, Elizabeth declares it impossible and wonders how it is that someone could find Mr Collins less than ridiculous, let alone choose to marry him. This engagement takes place rather quickly and later, Mr Collins comes to visit the Bennets with his new wife to pay their respects.
