There might even be an earlier cry of “independence,” much earlier than Bonifacio’s 1895. In the evening of January 20, 1843, some Filipino soldiers of the Tayabas regiment did a kind of coup d’etat and took Fort Santiago and struck fear on the Spanish authorities at Malacañang. Although they lost, here is the report of the French consul at that time: "... the rebels were heard to cry out to their countrymen to rise in arms and fight for independence. This was the first time that word, independence, had been uttered in the Philippines, as a rallying cry. It is a milestone, Your Excellency, on the road to freedom."[7]
