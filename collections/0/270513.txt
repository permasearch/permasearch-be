Orogeny is the primary mechanism by which mountains are built on continents.[citation needed] The word "orogeny" comes from Ancient Greek (ὄρος oros, "mountain" + γένεσις genesis for "creation, origin").[3] Though it was used before him, the term was employed by the American geologist G.K. Gilbert in 1890 to describe the process of mountain building as distinguished from epeirogeny.[4]
