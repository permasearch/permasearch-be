Infantile botulism shows geographical variation. In the UK, only six cases have been reported between 1976 and 2006,[101] yet the U.S. has much higher rates: 1.9 per 100,000 live births, 47.2% of which are in California.[102] While the risk honey poses to infant health is small, taking the risk is not recommended until after one year of age, and then giving honey is considered safe.[103]
