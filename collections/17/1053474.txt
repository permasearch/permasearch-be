While Ravenscroft claimed to have written the riff for Baker Street, the almost exact same riff had actually been written 10 years earlier by someone else. The Sax riff from the 1968 Steve Marcus Jazz song "Half A heart" is almost identical. Gary Burton, a musician friend of Steve Marcuses said that Ravenscroft must have heard the original sax riff before he replicated it on Baker Street. [16]
