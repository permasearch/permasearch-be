Historians consistently consider Peter and Paul to have been martyred in Rome under the reign of Nero[41][42][43] in 64, after the Great Fire of Rome which, according to Tacitus, the Emperor blamed on the Christians.[44][45] In the second century Irenaeus of Lyons, reflecting the ancient view that the church could not be fully present anywhere without a bishop, recorded that Peter and Paul had been the founders of the Church in Rome and had appointed Linus as bishop.[46][47]
