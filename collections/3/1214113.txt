By the 1970s, the centrality of art psychology in academy began to wane. Artists became more interested in psychoanalysis[10] and feminism,[11] and architects in phenomenology and the writings of Wittgenstein, Lyotard and Derrida. As for art and architectural historians, they critiqued psychology for being anti-contextual and culturally naive. Erwin Panofsky, who had a tremendous[peacockÂ term] impact on the shape of art history in the US, argued that historians should focus less on what is seen and more on what was thought.[12][13] Today, psychology still plays an important role in art discourse, though mainly in the field of art appreciation.[3]
