Crohn's disease also increases the risk of cancer in the area of inflammation. For example, individuals with Crohn's disease involving the small bowel are at higher risk for small intestinal cancer. Similarly, people with Crohn's colitis have a relative risk of 5.6 for developing colon cancer.[181] Screening for colon cancer with colonoscopy is recommended for anyone who has had Crohn's colitis for at least eight years.[182] Some studies suggest there is a role for chemoprotection in the prevention of colorectal cancer in Crohn's involving the colon; two agents have been suggested, folate and mesalamine preparations.[183] Also, immunomodulators and biologic agents used to treat this disease may promote developing extra-intestinal cancers.[184]
