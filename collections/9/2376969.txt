Queen's Counsel are appointed by the provincial Cabinet on the advice of the Attorney General of British Columbia. No more than 7% of the bar of British Columbia can be awarded the designation. Before making the recommendation to Cabinet, the Attorney General is required by statute to consult with the Chief Justice of British Columbia, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, and two benchers (directors) of the Law Society of British Columbia, one of whom is usually the president of the Law Society. A recipient must have at least five years' standing at the bar of British Columbia.[53] In practice, the Attorney General appoints an advisory committee which includes these officials and also the Chief Judge of the Provincial Court, the president of the British Columbia Branch of the Canadian Bar Association and the deputy attorney general.[54] The Attorney General is automatically appointed as Queen's Counsel on taking office.[55] In 2016, the province designated forty lawyers as Queen's Counsel, from a group of 179 nominees.[54][56]
