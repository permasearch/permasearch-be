The Mughals had significant Indian Rajput and Persian ancestry through marriage alliances, as emperors were born to Rajput and Persian princesses.[2][3] Only the first two Mughal emperors, Babur and Humayun, were fully Central Asian, whereas Akbar was half-Persian, Jahangir was half-Rajput and quarter-Persian, and Shah Jahan was three-quarters Rajput.[4]
