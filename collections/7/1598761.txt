"She's Leaving Home" was recorded during the sessions for the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The day before McCartney wanted to work on the song's score, he learned that George Martin, who usually handled the Beatles' string arrangements, was not available. McCartney contacted Mike Leander, who did it in Martin's place. This was the first time a Beatles song was not arranged by Martin. Martin was hurt by McCartney's actions, but he produced the song and conducted the string section, in a session on 17 March 1967 that generated six takes.[10] The harp was played by Sheila Bromberg, the first female musician to appear on a Beatles record.[11][12]  Three days later, McCartney's lead vocal and Lennon's backing vocal were recorded, with the two singing together on each of two vocal tracks, their voices overlapping to match the narrative.[10]
