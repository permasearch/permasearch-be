By the late 19th century, the U.S. had several interests in the western Pacific to defend; namely, access to the Chinese market, and its colonies – the Philippines and Guam – which the U.S. had gained as a result of the Spanish–American War (1898).  After Japan's victories in the Sino-Japanese War (1894–95) and in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904, the U.S. began to regard Japan as a potential threat to its interests in the western Pacific.[2]  This antagonism was intensified by Japan's objections to an attempt to annex Hawaii to the U.S. (1893)[3] and by Japan's objections to discrimination against Japanese immigrants both in Hawaii (1897) – on this occasion, Japan sent the cruiser Naniwa to Honolulu, Hawaii[4][5] – and in California (1906, 1913).[6]  As a result, the U.S. Navy began to draft, as early as 1897, war plans against Japan, which were eventually code-named "War Plan Orange".  The war plan of 1911, which was drafted under Rear Admiral Raymond P. Rodgers, included an island-hopping strategy for approaching Japan.[7]
