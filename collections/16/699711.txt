The case of the Bali Nine Australian heroin traffickers convicted in Indonesia in 2005 resulted in six death sentences being imposed either at trial or on appeal. Four of these were struck down on further appeal. In January 2015, Indonesian President Joko Widodo refused to grant clemency for Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, the two remaining Australians facing death sentences after their convictions as the orchestrators of the enterprise.[136] The Australian Government pleaded with Indonesia not to execute the two Australians and some Australian tourists chose to boycott Bali in protest.[137] Prime Minister Tony Abbott called for Indonesia not to forget Australia's billion dollars worth of assistance after the Aceh tsunami in 2004.[138] Sukumaran and Chan were executed on 29 April 2015. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott recalled the Australian Ambassador to Indonesia and suspended ministerial contact for about six weeks.[139]
