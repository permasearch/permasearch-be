Warband is a casual constructed format in which decks (colloquially called "warbands") have a minimum size of 40 cards. Furthermore, Warband is a singleton format, and the main deck may only contain up to 3 rare/mythic cards ("captains") and up to 9 uncommon cards ("lieutenants"), in addition to any number of common cards. Warband can be played with any cardpool, but is primarily played with Standard or Legacy cardpools. Warband is intended to be inexpensive and accessible, whilst allowing for complex gameplay with large card sets.[36]
