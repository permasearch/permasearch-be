During the 1970s, Toyota produced the Toyota Crown in a pillarless two-door hardtop version.[25] Nissan followed suit with the Nissan Cedric and Nissan Gloria in 4-door sedan and 2-door hardtop body styles with the latter "rendered as a premium quality personal car."[26] Subaru introduced a new compact coupe as a genuine two-door hardtop with the Subaru Leone in 1971.[27] The pillarless hardtop models were more expensive and luxurious than the sedan versions.
