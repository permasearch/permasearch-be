Although Skype is a commercial product, its free version is used with increasing frequency among teachers and schools interested in global education projects.[175] For example, Skype is being used to facilitate language exchange: Students in different parts of the world are paired off, and each is a native speaker of the language that the other wishes to learn. In conversations over Skype, they alternate between the two languages.[176][177][178][179]
