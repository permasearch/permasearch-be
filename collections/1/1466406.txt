In the books, the potion changes the drinker's voice to match that of the target, as well as any disabilities such as poor eyesight or amputations. The films contradict this point, probably for the sake of character clarity: Harry and Ron retain their own voices after using the potion in Chamber of Secrets; the same is true in Deathly Hallows â€“ Part 1 during the scene of the seven Potters and while infiltrating the Ministry.
