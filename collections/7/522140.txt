The Tenderloin Housing Clinic has offered important social services to the poor of this neighborhood for decades. According to its director, Randy Shaw, the clinic's "mission is to prevent tenant displacement, preserve and expand the city's low cost housing stock and to provide comprehensive legal assistance to low income tenants. The Clinic is successful in fulfilling this mission by providing free legal services, securing SRO units through the Master Lease program and offering comprehensive support services to our clients."
