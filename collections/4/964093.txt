There are several parking buildings for car-owned people working in downtown. Taxi cabs are also available for people working in downtown. Because it is the leading business district in the metropolis, it sometimes experience traffic congestion. The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority is responsible for traffic regulation in the metropolis. In 1995, they implement road space rationing called Unified Vehicular Volume Reduction Program to reduce the traffic congestion. In Makati, they implement the number coding to all road vehicles from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. with window hours of 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., except on expressways.
