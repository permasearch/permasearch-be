Although much emphasis is placed on retaining possession of the ball and dictating play, Guardiola's teams are recognised for pressing off the ball. Players press and harry the opposition collectively in an attempt to win back possession of the ball. This collective press is only conducted in the starting third of the opposition's pitch where less space exists and defenders and/or the goalkeeper may not be as good dribbling or passing the ball as a midfielder. At Barcelona, this was referred as the "six-second rule", in that the team should aim to win back possession of the ball within six seconds as this was the time when opposition players may still be out of position following turnover of possession and most susceptible to being dispossessed or forced into a mistake.[158] If possession of the ball was not won back within six seconds, players would abandon the collective press to conserve energy and revert to compact positions with men behind the ball to make it hard for the opposition to break them down.[159] The 'six-second rule' has largely been omitted after he left Barcelona however the principle of swiftly winning the ball back following a turnover of possession remains at Bayern Munich and Manchester City.[160] This pressing tactic has influenced the tactical approach of other managers such as Mauricio Pochettino and Jurgen Klopp[161] as well as those in other sports such as rugby.[162][154]
