The Romans, who traditionally traced their lineage to Troy, took a highly negative view of Achilles.[76] Virgil refers to Achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of men,[77] while Horace portrays Achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children.[78] Other writers, such as Catullus, Propertius, and Ovid, represent a second strand of disparagement, with an emphasis on Achilles' erotic career. This strand continues in Latin accounts of the Trojan War by writers such as Dictys Cretensis and Dares Phrygius and in Beno√Æt de Sainte-Maure's Roman de Troie and Guido delle Colonne's Historia destructionis Troiae, which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the Matter of Troy until the 17th century.
