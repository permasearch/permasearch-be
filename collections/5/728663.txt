The show has received mixed reviews. Critics have compared it to The O.C. and Dawson's Creek, but with a more masculine appeal,[44][45][90][91][92] and a significant number of fans have debated the relative merits of One Tree Hill versus The O.C.. Lucas and Ryan Atwood have been noted for their similarities in being brooding blond male leads in a new environment, having a wealthy nemesis and falling in love with the nemesis's popular girlfriend (Peyton/Marissa Cooper). Comparisons have also been made between Brooke and Summer Roberts for being dark-haired vixens and best friends of the popular female lead. Chad Michael Murray was originally chosen for the part of Ryan Atwood[93] and had guest-starred on Dawson's Creek as a minor character, which led to One Tree Hill referencing Dawson's Creek in the first episode.[44] "Where Dawson's was about relationships, especially between boys and girls, One Tree Hill tries to be about masculinity, especially as negotiated through sports", wrote Tracy McLoone of PopMatters,[44] who predicted that, despite this, it would probably be pinned as a girl's show. "This doesn't mean boys won't watch it, just that they won't talk about it."[44] Allison McCracken of flowtv.org, on the other hand, called it a "boy soap opera", saying, "The new boy-centered soap employs 'feminine' generic serial elements to explore male adolescence and relationships between males, often focusing around brothers or fathers & sons",[45] and, "The boy soap is as pleasurable a text for female viewers as television offers today."[45]
