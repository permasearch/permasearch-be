Leslie Poles Hartley CBE (30 December 1895 â€“ 13 December 1972) was a British novelist and short story writer. Although his first fiction was published in 1924, his career was slow to take off. His best-known novels are the Eustace and Hilda trilogy (1944-7) and The Go-Between (1953). The latter was made into a film in 1971, as was his 1957 novel The Hireling in 1973.
