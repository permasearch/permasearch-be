In December 2005, the White House announced the intention to renovate the aging Press Briefing Room and cramped press corps offices.[4] On August 2, 2006, the final briefing was held, and President George W. Bush hosted several previous press secretaries at a closing ceremony and there was some hesitation and concern about whether the press would be allowed to return to the White House.[5][6] In the interim the White House Conference Center was used as temporary location for press conferences.
