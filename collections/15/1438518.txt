The state is famous for its vast reserves of crude oil and natural gas. It was perhaps the richest and most important section of the African zone of the British Empire. Rivers State has two major oil refineries, two major seaports, airports, and various industrial estates spread across the land. More than 60% of the countryâ€™s output of crude oil is produced in the state. Other natural resources found within its boundaries are silica sand, glass sand and clay.[17]
