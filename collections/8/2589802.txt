In December 2014, the Premier Service was renamed to be the Business Class Service in an attempt by Arriva Trains Wales to make the service more appealing to those travelling to and from Cardiff to work. Ticket prices remain the same and are still sold as first class, and the restaurant service remains although tablecloths and antimacassars have been removed to promote a more work-like environment.[32]
