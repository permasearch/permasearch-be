In October 1998, Nokia overtook Motorola to become the best-selling mobile phone brand,[26] and in December manufactured its 100 millionth mobile phone.[27] Nokia's mobile phones became highly successful in Europe, Africa, Asia and Oceania. They were also one of the pioneers of mobile gaming due to the popularity of Snake, which came pre-loaded on many products. The 3310 is one of the company's most well-known products. Nokia also created the best-selling mobile phone of all time, the Nokia 1100, in 2003.
