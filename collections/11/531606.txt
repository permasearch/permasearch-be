The brothers Mark, Rasaan and Marquis Scott of the group AKNU (A Kind Never Understood) performed the Bruno Mars version when they auditioned for The X Factor USA in 2013. They received three "Yes" votes from the judges, with Simon Cowell remarking "I actually could watch this whole audition all over again... I loved it that much".
