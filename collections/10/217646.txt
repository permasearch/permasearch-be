Crosby supported the Bowery Mission in Manhattan for two decades, beginning in November 1881.[268][269] The Bowery Mission welcomed the ministry of women and she worked actively, often attending and speaking in the evening meetings.[235] She addressed large crowds attending the anniversary service each year until the building was razed in a fire in 1897.[270] She would also recite a poem which she'd written for the occasion, many of which were set to music by Victor Benke, the Mission's volunteer organist from 1893â€“97.[271] Among the songs that she and Benke collaborated on were six published in 1901: "He Has Promised", "There's a Chorus Ever Ringing", "God Bless Our School Today", "Is There Something I Can Do?", "On Joyful Wings", and "Keep On Watching".
