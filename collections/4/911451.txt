Wally arranges for Beaver to ride on the team bus to a track meet, but Beaver, who didn't ask for the favor, has made a previous date with Larry. In the aftermath, Wally threatens to never do any favors for Beaver again. Later, Beaver and Larry take the planned jaunt to Friends Lake, where two older boys give them a stolen rowboat and flee. The police arrive and Beaver's story about the two older boys is given little credence. When Beaver is unable to get a hold of Ward or June, he tearfully turns to Wally. At the police station, Wally names the two older boys based upon Beaver's description. Later, the police call Wally with the news that the guilty boys were taken into custody, and Beaver and Larry are cleared of charges. Ward and June are sitting right there and want an explanation. Ward goes easy on the boys since they were able to use the situation to patch up their differences.
