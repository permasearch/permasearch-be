In July 1941, de Havilland was reunited with Flynn for their eighth movie together, Raoul Walsh's epic They Died with Their Boots On. The film is loosely based on the courtship and marriage of George Armstrong Custer and Elizabeth "Libbie" Bacon.[136] Flynn and de Havilland had a falling out the previous year‍—‌mainly over the roles she was being given‍—‌and she did not intend to work with him again.[137] Even Flynn acknowledged, "She was sick to death of playing 'the girl' and badly wanted a few good roles to show herself and the world that she was a fine actress."[138] After she learned from Warner that Flynn had come to his office saying he needed her in the film, de Havilland accepted.[128] Screenwriter Lenore Coffee was brought in to add several romantic scenes, and improve the overall dialogue.[128] The result is a film that includes some of their finest work together.[139] Their last appearance on screen is Custer's farewell to his wife.[140] "Errol was quite sensitive," de Havilland would later remember, "I think he knew it would be the last time we worked together."[140] Flynn's final line in that scene would hold special meaning for her: "Walking through life with you, ma'am, has been a very gracious thing."[141] They Died with Their Boots On was released on November 21, 1941, and while some reviewers criticized the film's historical inaccuracies, most applauded the action sequences, cinematography, and acting.[142] Thomas M. Pryor of The New York Times found de Havilland "altogether captivating".[143] The film went on to earn $2,550,000 (equivalent to $42,400,000 in 2017), Warner Bros' second-biggest money-maker of that year.[144]
