Tom's whiny half-brother, who also lives with Aunt Polly and Mary. He behaves well but enjoys getting Tom into trouble and tattles on Tom. He appears to be around nine years old, and lies; he also seems to annoy Tom frequently. He is always on Aunt Polly's "good side" while Tom is on Aunt Polly's "bad side".
