In port after port, citizens in the thousands turned out to see and greet the fleet. In 1908, the Great White Fleet visited Monterey, California, from 1â€“4 May. The nearby Hotel Del Monte in Del Monte, California, hosted a grand ball for the officers of the fleet. Years later, the Del Monte was taken over by the U.S. Navy in 1942 for use as the Del Monte Pre-Flight School for pilots and after World War II the Naval Postgraduate School was relocated there.
