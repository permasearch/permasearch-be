Cain has noted that people of different temperament who become involved in personal relationships—possibly drawn to one another by a sense that each completes the other[29]—can encounter misunderstanding and conflict.[14] After a day's work an introvert may need to quietly recharge, while the extrovert may find the introvert's withdrawal hurtful; conversely, the extrovert may want to jointly socialize with others, which the introvert may find exhausting.[14][29] Cain advises, first, a mutual understanding of where the other party is coming from; and second, balancing their respective needs for socializing and for solitude in a practical compromise in how the couple connects and how the couple jointly socializes with others.[14][29]
