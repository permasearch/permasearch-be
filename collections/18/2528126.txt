The main trim levels of the pre-facelift Focus Mk 2 in the United Kingdom are listed below. For other countries, the range is either a cut down version of this list (e.g., for New Zealand) or it is almost completely different altogether (e.g., for South Africa, which uses trim levels Ambiente, Si and Trend, or Australia, which continues to use the old CL/LX/Zetec/Ghia trim levels)
