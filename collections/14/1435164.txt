In the pilot episode, "My Late Lamented Friend and Partner", Marty is murdered in a hit-and-run during an investigation, but he returns immediately as a ghost, whom only Jeff (and the occasional psychic) can see, to help Jeff bring his murderer to justice. In helping Jeff with his case, Marty stays out of his new grave for too long and is cursed to walk the Earth for 100 years. Seeing the advantages of having a ghost at the detective agency, Marty stays as an invisible partner, playing the key role in helping Jeff solve crime thereafter, also meaning that he can see his widow, Jeannie, who works as a secretary at the agency every day.
