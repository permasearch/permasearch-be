In the movie, Denethor's death is significantly altered. Denethor attempts to burn himself and Faramir to death in the domed Stewards' tomb in the city's graveyards. Gandalf then knocks Denethor off the pyre with a staff procured from a nearby guard, while Pippin throws Faramir down off the pyre. As Pippin is trying to put out the hem of Faramir's tunic, Denethor attacks him. At that moment, Gandalf rears his horse Shadowfax on his hind legs, and knocks Denethor into the burning funeral pyre. Denethor then, in a final glance among the flames, realizes that his son is still alive. Seconds later, Denethor is engulfed in flames, runs to the tip of the promontory of Minas Tirith, casts himself from it and falls to his death.
