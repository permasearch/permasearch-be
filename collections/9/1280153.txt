During the first decade of his professional career, Woods was the world's most marketable athlete.[150] Shortly after his 21st birthday in 1996, he signed endorsement deals with numerous companies, including General Motors, Titleist, General Mills, American Express, Accenture, and Nike, Inc. In 2000, he signed a 5-year, $105 million contract extension with Nike, which was the largest endorsement package signed by a professional athlete at that time.[151] Woods' endorsement has been credited with playing a significant role in taking the Nike Golf brand from a "start-up" golf company earlier in the previous decade to becoming the leading golf apparel company in the world and a major player in the equipment and golf ball market.[150][152] Nike Golf is one of the fastest growing brands in the sport, with an estimated $600 million in sales.[153] Woods has been described as the "ultimate endorser" for Nike Golf,[153] frequently seen wearing Nike gear during tournaments, and even in advertisements for other products.[151] Woods receives a percentage from the sales of Nike Golf apparel, footwear, golf equipment, golf balls,[150] and has a building named after him at Nike's headquarters campus in Beaverton, Oregon.[154]
