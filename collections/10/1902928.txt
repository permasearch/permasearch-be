The laugh track was also used on some prime time animated television series, starting with The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show (ABC, 1959–61; NBC, 1961–64), but only used it for the first four episodes of the series (see its controversy below). Hanna-Barbera followed suit and utilized a full laugh track for its prime-time shows up to 1970, including The Flintstones (ABC, 1960–66), Top Cat (ABC, 1961–62), and The Jetsons (ABC, 1962–63). Hanna-Barbera's mid-summer sitcom, Where's Huddles? (CBS, 1970), also used a laugh track. Midday programming, like The Banana Splits Adventure Hour (NBC, 1968–70), gradually followed suit. From 1968 to 1983, most comedic cartoons produced for the Saturday morning genre were fitted with a laugh track, beginning with Filmation's The Archie Show in 1968. Rankin-Bass, DePatie–Freleng Enterprises (DFE) and Hanna-Barbera adopted the practice through 1983; Filmation's Gilligan's Planet (CBS, 1982–83) was the final series to include a laugh track.
