Earlier hypotheses of the epidemic's origin have varied. Some hypothesized the flu originated in East Asia.[28] Claude Hannoun, the leading expert on the 1918 flu for the Pasteur Institute, asserted the former virus was likely to have come from China, mutating in the United States near Boston and spreading to Brest, France, Europe's battlefields, Europe, and the world using Allied soldiers and sailors as main spreaders.[29] He considered several other hypotheses of origin, such as Spain, Kansas, and Brest, as being possible, but not likely.
