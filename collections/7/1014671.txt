Isolated seamounts and those without clear volcanic origins are less common; examples include Bollons Seamount, Eratosthenes Seamount, Axial Seamount and Gorringe Ridge.[7] If all known seamounts were collected into one area, they would make a landform the size of Europe.[8] Their overall abundance makes them one of the most common, and least understood, marine structures and biomes on Earth,[9] a sort of exploratory frontier.[10]
