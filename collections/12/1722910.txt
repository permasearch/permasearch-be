The Detour was a choice between Columns or Kilos. In Columns, teams traveled to Binbirdirek Cistern and find four columns using a map with coordinates. On the columns were numbers for the combination to open a padlocked box which contained their next clue. In Kilos, teams traveled to the Yeni Mosque, located at the old Jewish quarter of Eminönü, and found a man with a box of scales. Using one of the scales, teams had to weigh enough people on the street until they reached a total of 2,500 kilograms (5,500 lb). Once done, teams had to return their scale and show their weights to the man to receive their next clue.
