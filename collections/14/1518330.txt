Repartition orders can be imposed on offenders under the age of 18. However, this order cannot be made in combination with a custodial sentence, Community Service order or an Action Plan Order. An order will require the offender to make reparation, as specified in the order, to a person or person who were victims of the offence, or were otherwise affected by it, or to the community at large. The order is for a maximum of 24 hours and the reparation order must be completed under supervision within three months of its imposition. An order for direct reparation to a victim can only be made with that person's consent.
