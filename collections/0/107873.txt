The series is about a boy named Malcolm and his dysfunctional family.[3][4] The show stars Frankie Muniz as Malcolm, the third of four and later five boys, his brothers, and their parents, Lois (Jane Kaczmarek) and Hal (Bryan Cranston). Their first child, Francis (Christopher Masterson), was sent away to military school, leaving his three younger brothers at home, Reese (Justin Berfield), Malcolm, and Dewey (Erik Per Sullivan) with Malcolm being the middle child still living at home. In season four, the character Jamie (James and Lukas Rodriguez) was added to the show as the fifth son of Hal & Lois. The show's early seasons centered on Malcolm dealing with the rigors of being an adolescent and enduring the eccentricities of his life. Later seasons gradually explored the other members of the family and their friends in more depth, including others such as Craig Feldspar, Lois' coworker at the Lucky Aide drugstore, Malcolm's friend Stevie Kenarban, and Stevie's dad Abe.
