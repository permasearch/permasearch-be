On the other hand, Steve Austin has taken exception to the notion that Sting was not a profitable wrestler.[186] Reflecting on Sting in the early 1990s, veteran wrestler Kevin Nash said: "There weren't many draws in WCW at that point, but he was one of them".[188] Former WCW booker Mike Graham asserted that Sting was a television ratings success during the Monday Night Wars,[189] while fellow booker Kevin Sullivan said of Sting's rivalry with Ric Flair: "If I needed to draw a rating, Sting and Flair always drew. It was like [Muhammad] Ali and [Joe] Frazier".[160] The inaugural Clash of the Champions event in 1988, which aired opposite the WWF's WrestleMania IV and was headlined by Sting vs. Flair, generated a record-setting 5.6 rating on TBS.[190] The pair also main-evented The Great American Bash 1990, which was the NWA's biggest pay-per-view success up to that point.[187]
