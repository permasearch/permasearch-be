Williams said he had remained sober since mid-2008, but started drinking again after the media attention. On January 12, 2011, after a lengthy one-on-one talk with TV psychologist "Dr. Phil" McGraw, Williams admitted to drinking alcohol heavily again and agreed to go to Origins Recovery Center,[27] a drug rehab facility in Texas arranged by McGraw.[28] He had also made the commitment to attend alcohol rehabilitation courses.[29] Williams checked himself out of the rehab facility after 12 days.[30]
