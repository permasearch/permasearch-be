Chief Justice Reynato Puno noted that the model for Amparo was borrowed from Mexico: the right of Amparo is a Mexican legal procedure to protect human rights.[7] Of Mexican origin, thus, “Amparo” literally means “protection” in Spanish.[8] de Tocqueville’s "Democracy in America" had been available in Mexico, in 1837 and its description of  judicial review practice in the U.S. appealed to many Mexican jurists.[9] Mexican justice Manuel Crescencio Rejón, drafted a constitutional provision for his native state, Yucatan, which empowered jurists to protect all persons in the enjoyment of their constitutional and legal rights.  This was incorporated into the 1847 national constitution.[10][11] The great right proliferated in the Western Hemisphere, slowly evolving into various fora. Amparo became, in the words of a Mexican Federal Supreme Court Justice, Mexico’s “task of conveying to the world’s legal heritage that institution which, as a shield of human dignity, her own painful history conceived.”[12][13]
