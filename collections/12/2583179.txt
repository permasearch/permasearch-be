By June 9, Brent crude was at $47.67, down 12 percent from May 25, and WTI was at $45.44, down 11 percent, with limits on production not having the expected effect as supplies continued to rise.[307] OPEC actually increased production and on June 14, Brent crude fell to $48.25 and WTI to $45.94.[308] Excessive worldwide supplies and high U.S. production led to the fourth straight down week as Brent crude finished June 16 at $47.37 and WTI rose to $44.74, a day after oil reached its lowest level in six months. Prices rose slightly with news that although American producers added rigs for a record 22 weeks, the rate of increase was slowing, and that some countries were starting to export less.[309]
