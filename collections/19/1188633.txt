In the Ming Dynasty about 650 years ago, rhinoceros were confined to Yunnan and Guizhou, and by the Qing Dynasty to only Yunnan.[247] The Qing government limited the hunting of rhinos to only officials, and some 300 horns were harvested between 1900 and 1910.[247] The collapse of the Qing Dynasty in 1911 allowed individuals to hunt the animal.[247] The last Sumatran rhino was killed in 1916, the last Indian rhino in 1920 and the last Javan rhino in 1922.[247]
