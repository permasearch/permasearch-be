In October 2016, three months after the UN recognition of Czechia, The Guardian reported that the new name was hardly in use, even on official Czech government websites.[48] On 22 May 2017, a Forbes contributor released an opinion blog stating that "Czechia has won the Czech Republic name debate" and that "If youâ€™re feeling petulant, it's the Czech Republic. If you want to be cool, it's Czechia", referring to the significant progress that had been made for the shorter name in the preceding year.[49] On 1 June 2017, the geographical department of the Faculty of Sciences of Charles University in Prague organised a special conference to assess the progress of the name Czechia.[50]
