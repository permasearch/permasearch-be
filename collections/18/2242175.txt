Hari Dhillon plays consultant general surgeon Michael Spence, who first appears in the episode "Unfinished Symphony" - series ten, episode six of the programme.[156] Dhillon describes his character as: "kind of the counterpoint to Ric Griffin. So he's just a little bit lippy; if he's thinking it, it's out of his mouth, and a total straight shooter, very direct."[11] Michael is married to anaesthetist Annalese Carson.[157] His storylines see him cheat on his wife with nurse Donna Jackson,[158] with Dhillon explaining: "(H)e's kind of a serial womaniser.[11] [...] The trouble is, Michael had an affair at another hospital. He left because he wanted a clean slate. Essentially he wants to flirt - it's in his nature.[159] With the introduction of the character, a new private ward was annexed to the hospital, known as HolbyCare.[55]
