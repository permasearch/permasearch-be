Manx people living in the UK were commonly grouped by the 2001 census under "White British". The extremely high ratio of "come-overs" to "natives" has brought with it changes in terms of culture, identity and speech. Manx people have also made a significant contribution elsewhere through migration. The Manx have a long tradition of moving to Liverpool for work, hence, a significant proportion of Liverpudlians are of Manx ancestry, among them Paul McCartney of The Beatles.[4] A lot of Manx people emigrated to the United States, notably to Cuyahoga County and Lake County, Ohio.[5]
