After the trouble between worker unions at the Maruti Suzuki Plant in India, plans are being made to transfer the building plant to Indonesia, as most of the orders are from that country. The versions of that county's Ertiga is also different. It has five versions, the GA (standard), GL (more equipped than GA), GX (mid-range), Elegant (GX with aerokit and interior luxuries), and Sporty (GX-based limited edition with special body kit, similar to Suzuki Swift Sport). All version comes in 5-speed manual or 4-speed auto, while GA only have manual option. In January 2013, Ertiga with double blower AC was introduced. Though was based from Swift, the second AC blower was placed on the interior platform like other pickup-based MPVs, such as the Toyota Kijang Innova or the Isuzu Panther, unlike another non-pickup-based MPV such as Nissan Grand Livina which its second AC blower was placed in rear console box. On May 2013, Ertiga with automatic transmission was introduced for GL & GX type.
