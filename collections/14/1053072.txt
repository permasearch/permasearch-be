Throughout his reign, Ernest had been known for his extravagance and womanizing; as he grew older, Ernest enjoyed gossip and was "now a thoroughly disreputable old rouÃ© who enjoyed the outrage provoked by his actions", leading Vicky to declare that her uncle "was his own enemy".[53] His behavior and manner of dress increasingly became a joke for younger generations.[55] His great-niece Marie of Edinburgh would later describe Ernest as "an old beau, squeezed into a frock-coat too tight for his bulk and uncomfortably pinched in at the waist', sporting a top hat, lemon coloured gloves, and a rosebud in his lapel".[55] He put on weight and though on paper his wealth was large, he was still constantly in debt.[53]
