In Unicode, the em dash is U+2014 (decimal 8212). In HTML, one may use the numeric forms &#8212; or &#x2014;; there is also the HTML entity &mdash;. In TeX, the em dash may normally be input as a triple hyphen-minus (---). On any Mac, most keyboard layouts map an em dash to ⌥ Opt+⇧ Shift+-. On Microsoft Windows, an em dash may be entered as Alt+0151, where the digits are typed on the numeric keypad while holding the Alt key down. In the X Window System, it may be entered using the compose key by pressing the compose key and three hyphens. In Microsoft Word, the standard shortcut is ctrl+alt+number pad hyphen. But in this or any other word processing app, one can also easily create custom shortcuts, such that, for example, ctrl+alt+hyphen keeps the fingers near the home row.
