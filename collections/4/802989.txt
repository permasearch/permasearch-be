In 2012, Kansas saw a large number of wind projects completed making it among the largest and fastest growing wind energy markets.[citation needed] At the end of 2014 the total capacity sits at 2,967 MW.[1][63] Kansas has high potential capacity for wind power, second behind Texas. The most recent estimates are that Kansas has a potential for 950 GW of wind power capacity. Kansas could generate 3,900 TW·h of electric power each year, which represents more than all the electric power generated from coal, natural gas and nuclear combined in the United States in 2011.[64]
