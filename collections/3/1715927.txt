Prison officials had not observed any signs that Hernandez was at risk for suicide, so he was not put on around-the-clock watch.[90] Upon completion of the autopsy by the medical examiner, the death was officially ruled a suicide. At the request of his family, Hernandez's brain was released to Boston University to be studied for signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive degenerative disease found in people who have had a severe blow or repeated blows to the head, including football players who suffer concussions.[91] His lawyer-agent, Jose Baez, disputed any claim of suicide and stated that he would initiate his own investigation of the death.[92]
