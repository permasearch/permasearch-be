Since Alice Comedies in the 1920s, Walt Disney Animation Studios has produced a series of prominent short films, including the Mickey Mouse cartoons and the Silly Symphonies series. Many of these shorts provided a medium for the studio to experiment with new technologies that they would use in their filmmaking process, such as the synchronization of sound in Steamboat Willie (1928),[18] the integration of the three-strip Technicolor process in Flowers and Trees (1932),[26] the multiplane camera in The Old Mill (1937),[38] the xerography process in Goliath II (1960),[272] and the hand-drawn/CGI hybrid animation in Off His Rockers (1992),[273] Paperman (2012),[234] and Get a Horse! (2013).[240]
