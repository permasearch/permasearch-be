However, the majority of inmates have been sent there because they have an extensive history of committing violent crimes against corrections officers and fellow inmates in other prisons, up to and including murder. These inmates are kept in administrative segregation. They are confined in a specifically designed single-person cell for 23 hours a day. They are removed under restraint (handcuffed, shackled or both), on a 24-hour clock (i.e., their one-hour time out of their cell may occur at any time of the day or night). The hour outside of the cell is for showering, exercise, and with privileges, a phone call. Their diet is restricted to ensure that the foods they are served (in their cell) can't be used to harm themselves, or to create unhygienic conditions in their cell.
