On a trip to the nearest village for supplies, Curtin meets another American named James Cody (Bruce Bennett), who follows Curtin back to their camp. They tell Cody that they are hunters, but he sees through their lies and tells them he knows they are looking for gold and wants to join them. This sets up a debate about what to do with Cody. Rather than give him a share of the future production of the mine, the men decide to kill Cody. Just as the three confront him with pistols and prepare to kill him, the bandits reappear, crudely pretending to be Federales. After a tense vocal exchange regarding proof, a gunfight with the bandits ensues, in which Cody is killed. A real troop of Federales appears and chases the bandits away.
