American surveyors use a decimal-based system of measurement devised by Edmund Gunter in 1620. The base unit is Gunter's chain of 66 feet (20 m) which is subdivided into 4 rods, each of 16.5 ft or 100 links of 0.66 feet.  A link is abbreviated "lk,"  and links "lks" in old deeds and land surveys done for the government.
