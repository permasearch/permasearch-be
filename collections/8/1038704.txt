After the taxes, there are different opinions on how to spend their income. Some destine one-ninth of it for alms.[34] Others divide this income (after taxes) into four portions. One fourth is destined for common expenses, the second for liberal works of a noble mind, the third for alms, and the fourth for being kept in reserve.
