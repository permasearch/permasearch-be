The national coinages introduced in Belgium (1832), Switzerland (1850), and Italy (1861) were based on Franceâ€™s bimetallic currency. These countries joined France in a treaty signed on 23 December 1865 which established the Latin Monetary Union(LMU).[11]  Greece joined the LMU in 1868 and about twenty other countries adhered to its standards.[13]  The LMU effectively adopted bimetallism by allowing unlimited free coinage of gold and silver at the 15.5 to 1 rate used in France, but also began to back away from bimetallism by allowing limited issues of low denomination silver coins struck to a lower standard for government accounts.[14]  A surplus of silver led the LMU to limit free coinage of silver in 1874 and to end it in 1878, effectively abandoning bimetallism for the gold standard.[14]
