Musician Daniel Rossen, one of the two lead vocalists of the band Grizzly Bear, covered "Too Little Too Late" live in concert in February 2009.[95] Rossen aimed to deliver the cover "very seriously, as if he really meant all those lyrics".[96] Stereogum described Rossen's rendition as "great, dusty and hazy and hooky".[96] Sam Willett of Consequence of Sound reviewed Rossen's version as "a killer cover" that has been arranged "into a simultaneously soothing and haunting collage of echoing harmonies and guitar textures."[41] According to The Guardian music critic Jude Rogers, the cover was part of the band's effort to make their live performances more enjoyable to audiences "when you're a man in your late 20s who can't hide behind a persona."[22] The company Wavegroup did a cover of the song for the game Karaoke Revolution Presents: American Idol Encore. In late October 2007, Daniel Rossen of Grizzly Bear recorded a version of the song in honor of bandmate Ed Droste's 29th birthday.[97]
