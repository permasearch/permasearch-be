In Hinduism, incarnation refers to its rebirth doctrine, and in its theistic traditions to avatar.[10] Avatar literally means "descent, alight, to make one's appearance",[11] and refers to the embodiment of the essence of a superhuman being or a deity in another form.[12] The word also implies "to overcome, to remove, to bring down, to cross something".[11] In Hindu traditions, the "crossing or coming down" is symbolism, states Daniel Bassuk, of the divine descent from "eternity into the temporal realm, from unconditioned to the conditioned, from infinitude to finitude".[13] An avatar, states Justin Edwards Abbott, is a saguna (with form, attributes) embodiment of the nirguna Brahman or Atman (soul).[14]
