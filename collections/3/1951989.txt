In the 2011 season, KKR drastically revamped their squad. Former captain and icon player Sourav Ganguly was not purchased in the January auction. This led to protest rallies, signature campaigns throughout the country and abroad along with stadium protests by various fan groups, such as No Dada No KKR,[28] which received both national and international press attention.[29][30][31] The team appointed Gautam Gambhir, who was bought for a record-breaking $2.4 million as skipper.[32] Yusuf Pathan was also picked up for a whopping $2.1 million.[32] Other international names who were added include Shakib Al Hasan, Brad Haddin, Jacques Kallis, Brett Lee, Ryan ten Doeschate, Eoin Morgan and James Pattinson. Haddin was replaced by Mark Boucher mid-season due to injury.[32]
