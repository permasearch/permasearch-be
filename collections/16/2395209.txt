Benedict was the son of a Roman called John, and was born and raised in Rome around the vicinity of the Theatre of Marcellus.[1] A Cardinal-deacon before his election, Benedict was renowned for his learning, for which his contemporaries gave him the additional name of Grammaticus.[2] He was also a Notarius and had taken part in the deposition of Pope John XII and the subsequent election of Pope Leo VIII.
