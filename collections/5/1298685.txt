Peruvian historian Basadre states that one of Peru's reasons for signing the treaty was to impede a Chile-Bolivia alliance against Peru that would have given to Bolivia the region of Arica (the vast majority of Bolivian commerce went through Peruvian ports of Arica before the war) and transferred Antofagasta to Chile.[28] These Chilean offers to Bolivia, to change allegiance, were made several times even during the war[29] and also from the Bolivian side at least six times.[28]
