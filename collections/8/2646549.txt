Much of the inter-war period saw economic recession or stagnant growth, making fund-raising more challenging. Partially as a result, many memorial projects had to be cut back or altered due to lack of money.[158] The final size of Douaumont had to be cut in size by a third when fund-raising slowed.[159] Proposals to turn the planned Imperial War Museum into a grand memorial for the war dead were shelved due to lack of funds.[160]
