The Commonwealth of Australia at the federal level, and most state and territory governments, began in 1994 to replace the title of Queen's Counsel and appointment by letters patent with the title Senior Counsel (SC) as an honorific conferred by the legal profession. There is no difference in status between a Queen's Counsel and a Senior Counsel.[29]
