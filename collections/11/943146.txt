The great popularity of the song in the Anglophone world has led many of its audience to believe that it is an Austrian folk song or even the official national anthem.[4] Austria's official anthem is in fact "Land der Berge, Land am Strome" and the anthem used from 1929 until the Anschluss was "Sei gesegnet ohne Ende." The edelweiss is a popular flower in Austria and was featured on the old 1 Schilling coin. It can also now be seen on the 2 cent Euro coin. The flower is protected in Austria and illegal to pick. An "edelweiss" is also worn as a cap emblem by certain Austrian Army and the German Gebirgsj√§ger (mountain troopers) units stationed in the nearby Bavarian Alps.[5]
