From cosmological arguments, relic background neutrinos are estimated to have density of 56 of each type per cubic centimeter and temperature 7000190000000000000♠1.9 K (6977272370002790000♠1.7×10−4 eV) if they are massless, much colder if their mass exceeds 6978160217648700000♠0.001 eV. Although their density is quite high, they have not yet been observed in the laboratory, as their energy is below thresholds of most detection methods, and due to extremely low neutrino interaction cross-sections at sub-eV energies. In contrast, boron-8 solar neutrinos—which are emitted with a higher energy—have been detected definitively despite having a space density that is lower than that of relic neutrinos by some 6 orders of magnitude.
