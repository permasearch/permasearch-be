Nana returns in Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa. She also becomes the leader of an army of tourists left stranded by the penguins' schemes. She again crosses paths with Alex, then fights him, and wins again, although Alex puts up much more of a fight this time (although Alex confesses to his friends that he actually only did it to distract her to get her bag, making Nana's victory unofficial). She often hits Alex and loves her handbag. At the end of the film, Alex gives Makunga Nana's handbag. When she sees Makunga holding it, she kicks him in the groin, steps on his foot, whacks his hand with a ruler, digs her hand into his ear, arm-burns him, and spanks him before dragging him off the reserve by his ear. According to the DVD commentary, she took Makunga back to New York with her in a kitty cage.
