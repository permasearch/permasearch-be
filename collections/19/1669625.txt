In the episode "Captain Parmenter, One Man Army," it is revealed that all of the soldiers (troopers) of "F Troop" have been at Fort Courage for at least twenty months, meaning they spent at least part of the Civil War there.[7] They are so incompetent that when they are formed into a firing squad in the episode titled "The Day They Shot Agarn" all of their shots miss Agarn despite the fact they are standing only a few yards from him.[8] The most common running gag through both seasons of the series (shown in every first season opening except for the pilot episode) involves the fort's lookout tower. Every time the cannon is fired in salute the lit fuse burns out. Corporal Agarn or Private Dobbs then steps up and kicks the cannon's right wheel, collapsing the cannon and causing it to fire off target. The cannonball strikes a support leg of the lookout tower, bringing it crashing to the ground along with the trooper in it (in the opening credits, this coincides with the line in the lyrics, "Before they resume with a bang and a boom.") In one episode, an arrow brings the tower crashing down,[9] and in another Parmenter yanks down the tower with a lasso.[10] In another episode, musical instruments being played loudly cause the tower to collapse.[3] The fort water tower is also a frequent victim of this sort of gag.
