The song was featured in the twenty-first episode of the third season of the American musical television series Glee. The studio and show version was cut down to 3:50, with the removal of the baseball broadcast and some musical breaks between lines, and it was performed to joyous and raucous applause. It was met with critical acclaim from audiences and critics and went on to become a commercial success.
