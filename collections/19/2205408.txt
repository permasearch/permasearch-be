After first publication, the hymn was popular and was sung by both the Union and Confederate soldiers in the American Civil War.[1][2] The hymn also became popular among British revivalists,[8] and within public schools in England.[1] As a result of the images of Christian militarism in the hymn, some people object to the hymn, and some people do not stand to sing it.[9][10][11] The hymn was excluded from a more politically correct volume of The Presbyterian Hymnal published in June 1990, in order not to offend handicapped people.[12]
