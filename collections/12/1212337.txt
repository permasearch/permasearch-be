At the start of the second quarter, the Lakers got back in the game by scoring 11 straight points to take a two-point lead over Boston.[28] The lead proved to be brief, however, as Rajon Rondo and Kevin Garnett scored two-pointers to regain control of the game.[28] Nevertheless, the Lakers continued to score points, with Ron Artest hitting 3 of his 4 free throws in the quarter to maintain a four-point deficit.[28] Before the second quarter concluded, Paul Pierce sunk a pair of free throws to end the first half with a 40â€“34 Celtics lead.[28]
