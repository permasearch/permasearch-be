No two humans are genetically identical. On average, in DNA sequence, each human is 99.9% similar to any other human.[1][2] Even monozygotic twins (who develop from one zygote) have infrequent genetic differences due to mutations occurring during development and gene copy-number variation.[3] Differences between individuals, even closely related individuals, are the key to techniques such as genetic fingerprinting.
