Zeldin declined numerous offers to purchase the Tam O'Shanter.[8] Billionare Howard Hughes attempted to purchase the Tam O'Shanter at some point, initially offering $3 million. However, Hughes was late in delivering the money, and Zeldin subsequently raised the price to $6 million. When Hughes was late again in delivering the money, Zeldin called off negotiations.[8][12] The Carousel Motel became the Sand Dunes Motel in 1973, and was demolished in 1998.[5] In 1990, the Imperial 400 became a Days Inn. In 1996, it became the Vagabond Inn.[5]
