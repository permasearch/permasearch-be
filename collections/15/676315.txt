In October 1957, Little Richard embarked on a package tour in Australia with Gene Vincent and Eddie Cochran. During the middle of the tour, he shocked the public by announcing his decision to follow a life in the ministry.[59] Little Richard later explained that during a flight from Melbourne to Sydney that he had seen the plane's red hot engines and felt angels were holding it up.[60] During the Sydney performance, Little Richard saw a bright red fireball flying across the sky above him and was deeply shaken.[60] He took the event, later revealed as the launching of the first artificial Earth satellite Sputnik 1, as a sign from God to repent from performing secular music and his wild lifestyle and enter the ministry.[59] Returning to the states ten days early, Little Richard later learned that his original return flight had crashed into the Pacific Ocean solidifying his belief he was doing as God wanted.[61] After a performance at the Apollo Theater and a recording session with Specialty later that month, Little Richard enrolled at Oakwood College in Huntsville, Alabama, to study theology.[62][63] Fueling his decision to leave the music business was Little Richard's feeling that he hadn't received proper remuneration from Specialty.[64] Upon ending his contract with Specialty in 1959, Little Richard reluctantly agreed to relinquish any royalties for his material.[65] In 1958, he formed the Little Richard Evangelistic Team, traveling across the country to preach.[66] A month after his conversion, while speaking at an evangelical convention in November 1957, Little Richard met Ernestine Campbell, a secretary from Washington, D.C. He married her on July 11, 1959.[67]
