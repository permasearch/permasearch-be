Dopaminergic antipsychotics affect dopamine neurons by binding to postsynaptic dopamine receptors, where they function as receptor antagonists;[76] in contrast, ADHD stimulants are indirect agonists of postsynaptic dopamine receptors;[76] in other words, these stimulants increase levels of synaptic dopamine which then binds to postsynaptic receptors.[76] Stimulants increase the concentration of synaptic dopamine by activating certain presynaptic receptors (i.e., TAAR1) or by blocking or altering the function of reuptake transporters (e.g., DAT, VMAT2) in the presynaptic neuron.
