At the centennial EICMA motorcycle show, Yamaha officially unveiled a new generation of R1.[12] It is similar to MotoGP's 2005–Present YZR M1. Yamaha claims a wet weight of 199 kg (439 lb)[13] The new bike has an electronics package that includes a sophisticated Traction Control (TCS) and Slide Control System (SCS), antiwheelie Lift Control System (LIF), linked antilock brakes, Launch Control System (LCS), Quick Shift System (QSS), and selectable power modes. The Slide Control System on the Yamaha YZF-R1 is the first on a production motorcycle.[14][15] Information is fed to the bike through a six-axis gyro (Inertial measurement unit) and other sensors over 100 times a second.[15] Power delivery is tapered through manipulation of the throttle butterfly and ignition and fuel cuts.[16] Engine changes include shortened bore-to-stroke ratio, larger airbox, a finger-follower valve system, and fracture split titanium conrods.[14] It comes standard with magnesium wheels. Information is presented to the rider through a user-customizable thin-film display.[14]
