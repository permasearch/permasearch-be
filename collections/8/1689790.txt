John 1:1-18 calls Jesus the Logos (Greek λόγος), often used as "the Word" in English translations.[54] The identification of Jesus as the Logos which became Incarnate appears only at the beginning of the Gospel of John and the term Logos/Word is used only in two other Johannine passages: 1 John 1:1 and Revelation 19:13. It appears nowhere else in the New Testament.[55][56][57][58]
