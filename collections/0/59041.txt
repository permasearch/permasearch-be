Sheila Carter is a fictional character from The Young and the Restless and The Bold and the Beautiful, American soap operas on the CBS network. Created by William J. Bell, the role was introduced in 1990 — by Edward J. Scott — under the portrayal of Kimberlin Brown, who portrayed the role for many intervals on both soaps until 2006. That same year, Michelle Stafford took over the role, after Sheila had plastic surgery to look like Phyllis Summers. Brown returned to the role of Sheila on The Bold and the Beautiful, beginning on June 9, 2017.
