One of a senior cadet's "most cherished possessions" are his Senior Boots.[39] Only seniors are allowed to wear these knee-high riding boots, and most consider receiving their boots to be a rite of passage.[39] All Senior Boots are custom-made to fit the cadet and are a dark tan to brown color.[40] Students wear their Senior Boots for the first time after Final Review as juniors while saluting the outgoing seniors. Final review is the last activity that Corps members participate in as a unit. This full military review takes place at the end of the spring semester on Simpson Drill Field, and is in two parts. The entire Corps march past a reviewing stand, which consists of high-ranking military and university officials, for inspection. The Corps then returns to their dorms to change into the uniforms they will wear the following year, with the juniors donning their Senior Boots. The freshmen, sophomores, and juniors then march in formation past the reviewing stand, which is now filled with the senior cadets, saluting their former leaders.[41]
