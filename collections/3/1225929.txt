Following Jocasta and Hayden's eviction, it became clear to Frankie that he was losing support in the house. Nicole and Christine won the BB Tourn-eye-ment HOH competition. At the Nomination Ceremony, Nicole nominated Caleb and Frankie, with Frankie being her target. Caleb asked to be nominated so he could throw the Battle of the Block in an attempt to backdoor Frankie. Christine nominated Zach and Donny for eviction. At the Battle of the Block competition Moving the Chain, Caleb, saying he would not help Frankie, sat down along the sidelines, as he, along with Nicole, believed Frankie was responsible for Amber's eviction. In this competition, the duos had to work together ten times to maneuver a ball sitting on a ledge to roll into designated holes by moving chains. The winners got to go on a tailgating trip, the Dallas Cowboys Experience with the official HoH of the week. Zach and Donny started out well, but in the end, Frankie single-handedly won the BOB, with no help from Caleb, dethroning Nicole and making Christine the official HoH for the week all in one fell swoop, leaving Zach and Donny on the block, with Zach the new official target of the week. After Frankie fought against Zach, he decided to tell his secret about his famous sister, Ariana Grande in order to buy himself more time to mend the bridges that he broke. The veto competition, OTEV the Pissed-Off Penguin featured a waterfall and a giant penguin (voiced by Gilbert Gottfried). In a musical-chairs type set-up, participants had to retrieve drink cards named after the HouseGuest that the penguin called out. Zach won and took himself off the block. Rather than face the anger of the Detonators, Christine put up Nicole as a replacement nominee after Caleb, Cody, and Derrick told her that in another scenario, if Frankie won the veto, then Nicole was going to backdoor her. On Day 56, Nicole was evicted by a unanimous 6-0 vote, becoming the third member of the Jury.
