Allosaurus tendagurensis was found in Kimmeridgian-age rocks of Tendaguru, in Mtwara, Tanzania.[75] Subsequent studies classified it as a non-coelurosaurian tetanuran, either a megalosaurid or carcharodontosaur.[76][77] Although obscure, it was a large theropod, possibly around 10 meters (33 feet) long and 2.5 metric tons (2.8 short tons) in weight.[5]
