The poem serves to contrast Coleridge and Wordsworth.[7] In particular, the poem expresses Coleridge's feelings about his own mind and poetic career. He discuses how he hoped to become great when younger and then how he believes that his ability to write poetry has vanished. Coleridge would have struggled to write To William Wordsworth while Wordsworth did not have such experiences. The praise of Wordsworth also contradicted many of Coleridge's personal feelings at the time, which included jealousy.[8] The poem's emphasis on Wordsworth's greatness is without any jealousy while attacking Coleridge's self in a personal and unhealthy manner.[9]
