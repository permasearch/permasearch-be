Induced lactation, also called adoptive lactation, is the process of starting breastfeeding in a woman who did not give birth.[63] This usually requires the adoptive mother to take hormones and other drugs to stimulate breast development and promote milk production. In some cultures, breastfeeding an adoptive child creates milk kinship that built community bonds across class and other hierarchal bonds.[63]
