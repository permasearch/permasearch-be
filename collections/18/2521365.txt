Rowan is a weak and timid boy, with a strong heart and mind but a frail, sickly body and a love for the gentle Bukshah. He is an oddity in Rin, the people of which value physical strength, chest hair and courage, and is looked down upon by all those that feel ashamed that he does not live up to his late father's reputation. He is designated the role of the Keeper of the Bukshah, a domesticated form of cattle. In Rowan of Rin, he proves himself to be the greatest hero of all the villagers; when his six brave, strong companions fall to the hazards of the forbidden Mountain, Rowan perseveres, faces the great Dragon, and escapes. In doing so, he saves the town by relieving the Dragon of its crippling wound; the Dragon then resumes melting the ice around its cave, causing the stream to flow down to the village.
