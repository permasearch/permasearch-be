Following late local programming, the main New Year's Rockin' Eve broadcast begins at 11:30 p.m. ET/PT; some stations may tape delay this segment in order to correspond to the local time zone. Since the 2016-17 edition, the live coverage from Times Square has been followed by live coverage of festivities in the Central Time Zone from New Orleans, including Jackson Square's fleur-de-lis drop.[5] After the conclusion of live coverage, the special continues into "Part 2", which features the remainder of the Hollywood concert segments. Part 2 runs into the early morning hours, and has run as late as 3:00 a.m. ET/PT in the past.[8][9][10]
