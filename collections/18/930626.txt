In this voyage, Ming China would also forcibly settle the enmity that existed between it and Java.[38] Java was ruled by successive Majapahit kings, who had acted defiantly towards Ming China since the Hongwu reign.[24] During the civil war between 1401 and 1406, the King of West Java had killed 170 personnel of a Chinese embassy[b] when they came ashore on his rival's territory at East Java.[38] The Taizong Shilu 23 October, 1407, entry recorded that the Yongle Emperor summoned the Javanese ambassadors.[38] It stated that he accused Java of begging for forgiveness, because Ming China was mobilizing its army to punish them.[38] It also noted that he demanded 60,000 ounces of gold and ordered them to reflect on the situation in Annam (Vietnam), which had recently been invaded by Chinese armies.[38] This happened after the second expedition had been ordered and probably before it had left.[38] The Chinese received and accepted their payment and their apology.[42] They would continue to monitor their activities during subsequent voyages.[42]
