For the first time, Ford markets the Edge in European markets (as part of the company's "One Ford" ideology); it sits above the Ford Kuga. Gasoline engines are not sold in Europe; instead this market receives a pair of turbo-charged Duratorq diesel engines as used in other Ford Europe products such as the Ford Mondeo. Both engines are mated to an all-wheel drive system as standard; there is no option for two-wheel drive. The two engines are rated at 180 hp and 210 hp. Which output the customer receives is entirely dependent on the transmission choice, with a 6-speed manual as standard mated to the 180 hp unit. A 6-speed PowerShift dual-clutch transmission automatic option is available, mated to the 210 hp unit.
