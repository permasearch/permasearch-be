Dragon Quest XI started development in 2013.[11][12] Initially, the team considered making the game fully open world, but decided against that as it would have led to issues telling its story.[13] The PlayStation 4, Microsoft Windows, and Nintendo Switch versions use the Unreal Engine 4 game engine and had developmental assistance from ORCA Inc, while the 3DS version had assistance from Toylogic Inc.[3][14] In January 2016, series creator Yuji Horii stated that the story was nearly finished and that the game's intro section was playable.[15] In April 2017, Square Enix held a special presentation for the game, where the release date for the PlayStation 4 and 3DS versions of the game were revealed to be July 29, 2017.[16][17][18] The same month, Sony Interactive Entertainment and Nintendo unveiled special editions of their PlayStation 4 Slim and New Nintendo 2DS XL hardware for Japan to tie into the game.[19]
