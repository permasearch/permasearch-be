The Undergraduate Medicine and Health Sciences Admission Test (UMAT /ˈʊmɒtɪ/ Um-mati) was a test administered by the Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER) in Australia and New Zealand to assist in the selection of domestic students into certain health science courses including most Medical (MBBS or MBChB or MD) and Dentistry (BDSc or BDS) courses, as well as other health science courses such as physiotherapy and optometry. The UMAT was used for domestic applicant selection into undergraduate courses only; applicants for graduate courses must sit the GAMSAT and international applicants must sit the ISAT instead. Each year, the UMAT was held on a single day in two sessions (morning and afternoon), typically during either late July or early August in test centers located in major cities in Australia and New Zealand, as well as a select few other global cities. The nature of the UMAT is quite different from typical high school examinations or university examinations; academic excellence does not necessarily equate to an outstanding UMAT result.[1][2] As of 2019, the UMAT was replaced by the University Clinical Aptitude Test (UCAT)[3], a test similar to UKCAT.
