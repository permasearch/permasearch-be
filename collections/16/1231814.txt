Scott feels like he let the Red Team down by being the first to fall, but without Dolvett this week, he is determined to lead his team to victory by example. The White Team is worried about only having Jen for one day and don't want to let her down. Over at Comeback Canyon, Bob has created an obstacle course to challenge Matt and Gina. The course is a team effort, which means Matt can't just do everything on his own and must learn to work with a partner. Gina is working on not being anxious and afraid, and Bob wants her to be confronted by scary exercises to prove to herself how strong she is. Both model and mom step up and impress Bob with their hard work and collaboration. Unfortunately, only one can stay. Bob talks about the two contenders, saying Matt lost 16 pounds last week, so he could be at a disadvantage, while Gina lost so little the past two weeks, she may have an advantage. Gina is up first and loses a mere three pounds. Matt needs to lose five or more pounds to keep his comeback alive. Matt steps on the scale and only loses two pounds, meaning Gina is safe for another week! Matt walks out with his head held high and considers this experience a blessing. He vows that the next time America sees him, he will have his six-pack abs back. At Last Chance Workout, Jen returns to whip the White Team into shape before weigh-in. She calls it the Only Chance Workout, and pushes them harder than ever. Jessie has the Blue Team work with punching bags that weigh the amount they have each lost since coming to the ranch. The players cannot believe they used to carry around all that weight and feel incredible about their progress thus far.
