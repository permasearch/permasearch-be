By 1954, Manna Dey became popular among musical circle across film industries of various Indian languages. He became nationally famous after release of Do Bigha Zamin (1953) where two of the songs sung by him and composed by Salil Choudhury became hits. Salil Choudhury worked with Dey from 1953 to 1992 in Hindi films and made Dey sing even in Bengali and Malayalam films right from the late 1950s to early 1990s. His association with Shankar-Jaikishan and producer Raj Kapoor had begun while working for Awara, but their combination became famous while working together for Boot Polish in 1954. The trio worked in many films together from 1954-1971 whose musical scores were appreciated, irrespective of their box-office fate, like Shree 420, Chori Chori, Mera Naam Joker, Parvarish, Dil Hi to hai, Awara, Sriman Satyavadi, Kal Aaj aur Kaal, Abdullah etc.. The Raj Kapoor- Manna Dey combination produced superhits (both music and film, the only exception being Mera Naam Joker where the songs were chartbusters but the film was a flop) and was a pair to reckon with. While Mukesh sang the slow pathos for Raj Kapoor, Manna Dey sang the fast peppy ones, the classical numbers, the romantic duets (in case one analyses Manna Dey has sung more than 95% of Raj Kapoor's superhit duets) and the naughty numbers. Manna Dey has the rare distinction of doing playback for both father and son - Raj Kapoor and Randhir Kapoor (In fact Manna Dey later sang for Rishi Kapoor in Zamane ko dikhana hai). C. Ramchandra worked with Dey very first time in Insaniyaat in 1955 and then recorded songs with Dey consistently even in the 1960s in films like â€“ Tallaq (1959), Navrang, Paigham, Stree (1961), Veer Bhimsen etc.
