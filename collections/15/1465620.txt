Sarah Crompton, for The Telegraph, asserts that "Cumberbatch is utterly credible as a man who lives entirely in his cerebellum with little regard for the world outside, make Sherlock the perfect depiction of Holmes for our times".[5] Radio Times writer David Brown agreed, stating that adaptation has the "heartbeat of Conan Doyle's original".[6] Crompton further argues that the frequent allusions to the Holmes canon shows how Sherlock "revels in its own cleverness".[5] Chris Harvey, also for The Telegraph, wrote, "We'll be lucky if there's a drama that's as much fun all year, so explaining that it was good, seems somehow superfluous".[24] The Guardian's Sam Wollaston says that Conan Doyle's original story has "been Moffatised as well as modernised. He starts off parallel but then wanders off left and right, into international terrorism and CIA plots and complicated conspiracy theories. It's very complicated, I find at times."[4] Wollaston later called it "a bit of a confusing mish-mash".[25] In its otherwise positive review, Digital Spy's Morgan Jeffery suggests that "the resolution to the 'Scandal' case is perhaps a little too far-fetched".[26]
