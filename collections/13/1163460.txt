The park has served as a central location for recreation since it was first built. It currently houses a miniature golf course, five playgrounds, an outdoor swimming pool, soccer fields, basketball courts, and an oval running track.[7]  The park also retains its original lagoon, a wide variety of trees, and the original Jenney designed stone bridge.[7][8]  The greenhouse that attracted visitors from throughout the city was torn down in 1905.[9]  The statue of Czech patriot, Karel Havlíček Borovský, by Joseph Strachovsky was moved to Solidarity Drive on today's Museum Campus in the vicinity of the Adler Planetarium in 1981.[9] Chicago's 2016 Olympic bid included plans to host the Olympic cycling competitions in this park, including a velodrome and a BMX course.[10] Beginning in 2015, the park is the new home of the Riot Fest.[11]
