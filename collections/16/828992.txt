Some isotopes/nuclides are radioactive, and are therefore referred to as radioisotopes or radionuclides, whereas others have never been observed to decay radioactively and are referred to as stable isotopes or stable nuclides. For example, 14C is a radioactive form of carbon, whereas 12C and 13C are stable isotopes. There are about 339 naturally occurring nuclides on Earth,[7] of which 286 are primordial nuclides, meaning that they have existed since the Solar System's formation.
