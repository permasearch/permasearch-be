The adventures are mentioned twice in The Silver Chair, which was released before The Horse and His Boy but which takes place chronologically after that story. At this point, Lucy and Edmund still retain their memories of their time on Earth, as evidenced by Lucy's retelling of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, although by the end of their time in Narnia, none of the Pevensies remember Earth until crossing back through the wardrobe (as seen in Lion). In the later book The Last Battle, Corin, Cor (or Shasta), Aravis, Bree and Hwin all appear in the great reunion.
