Aguilera's first take on more artistic control was expressed in the 2001 Moulin Rouge! cover of Labelle's "Lady Marmalade", which also saw the contribution of Pink, Mya and Lil Kim.[45] Originally opposed by RCA executives for being "too urban" and "too Rockwilder and Missy", Aguilera insisted on recording the song.[43] "Lady Marmalade" topped the Billboard Hot 100 for five weeks based on airplay alone, becoming the first airplay-only track in history to remain on the chart's top spot for more than one week.[46][47] It earned a Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 2002 ceremony.[48] Later in 2001, an album titled Just Be Free containing demo tracks recorded by Aguilera in 1994 and 1995 was released by Warlock Records without Aguilera's permission. She subsequently filed a suit against Warlock Records and the album's producers to stop the release.[49] The two parties came to a confidential settlement to release the album, in which Aguilera lent out her name, likeness, and image for an unspecified amount of damages.[50]
