Notaries have no other powers: notably (as emphasized by official publications) they may not certify copies of documents (for instance, "I hereby certify that this is a true and correct copy...," is beyond the authority of a New York State notary). However, a notary may sign a form of affidavit on a copy where the document's custodian signs and swears to the authenticity of the document (usually a government issued picture ID). This can suffice as a "notarized copy" in most instances, but is not a certified copy. A notary cannot prepare legal documents, offer any advice, or review documents for legality (even offering an opinion as to whether a document needs notarization is considered to be "practicing law without a license" in New York); and they may not solemnize marriages. Further, a notary is not needed to witness a will: in New York, two witnesses, who do not need to be notaries, must attend the will signing ceremony and be able to attest to the mental competence of the testator. A notary may, however, notarize a self-proving affidavit signed by the maker of the will and the two witnesses, which will facilitate the proof of the will in probate.
