The use of lac dye goes back to ancient times. It was used in ancient India and neighbouring areas as wood finish, skin cosmetic and dye for wool and silk.[4][5][9] In China it is a traditional dye for leather goods. Lac for dye has been somewhat replaced by the emergence of synthetic dyes,[9] though it remains in use, and some juices, carbonated drinks, wine, jam, sauce, and candy are coloured using it.[11]
