During halftime at a televised football game, L.A. Stallions running back Billy Cole (Billy Blanks) receives a phone call from a mysterious man named Milo (Taylor Negron), who warns him to win the game or he will be assassinated. Cole ingests PCP and, in a drug-induced rage, brings a gun onto the field, shooting three opposing players to reach the end zone. Cole then shoots himself in the head. Meanwhile, private investigator Joe Hallenbeck (Bruce Willis), a disgraced former Secret Service agent, who at one time was a national hero for saving the president from an assassination attempt, discovers that his wife Sarah (Chelsea Field) is having an affair with his best friend and business partner, Mike Matthews (Bruce McGill). Mike gives Joe an assignment to act as bodyguard for a stripper named Cory (Halle Berry). Mike is then killed by a car bomb outside Joe's house.
