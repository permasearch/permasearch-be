Interest in determining whether there were any generalities in behavior began in the 1920s and 30s.[1] Gordon Allport and Henry Murray both supported the idea of a consistent personality with occasional situational influences.[2] Allport noted that "traits become predictable to the extent that identities in stimulus situations are predictable."[3] Others like Edward Thorndike viewed behavior as a composition of responses an individual has to situations.[1]
