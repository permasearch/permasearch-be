Lightoller launched Boat 6 at 1:10; it was photographed as it approached Carpathia, revealing it to have had 28 people aboard, though it had a capacity of 65.[30] Denver millionairess Margaret "Molly" Brown was among lifeboat number 6's most prominent occupants, along with Washington, D.C. writer and feminist Helen Churchill Candee, and English suffragettes Edith Bowerman and her mother Mrs. Edith Chibnall. Brown did not board voluntarily but was picked up by a crewman and dropped bodily into the boat as it was being lowered. Quartermaster Robert Hichens was placed in charge of the craft along with lookout Frederick Fleet. While being lowered, pleas from women in the boat for additional oarsmen forced Lightoller to solicit the crowd on deck for anyone who had sailing experience. Major Arthur Godfrey Peuchen of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club volunteered, shimmying down the falls (ropes) into the boat.[39] Peuchen was the only male passenger whom Second Mate Lightoller permitted to board a lifeboat.
