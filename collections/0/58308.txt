Nintendo claims that the design of the Pro Controller is an “enhanced version” of the Classic Controller and "offers a richer experience".[8] Certain games with flexible control schemes, such as Call of Duty: Black Ops II and Trine 2: Director's Cut, are also compatible with the Classic Controller. The Wii U Pro Controller is not compatible with previous-generation Wii games.[9]
