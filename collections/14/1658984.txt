Some time after the events of the previous film, Alice awakens in the now-ruined White House, after being betrayed once again by Wesker. While she is searching for survivors, the Red Queen appears and tells Alice she must return to the Hive in Raccoon City within 48 hours, where the Umbrella Corporation has developed an airborne antivirus, which can kill every organism infected by the T-virus, before the remainder of humankind is wiped out. When asked why she is betraying her creators, the Red Queen says that she will explain once Alice arrives at The Hive. Alice destroys a giant mutated flying creature to escape Washington, D.C.
