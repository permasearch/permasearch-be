The FTAAP is more ambitious in scope than the Doha round, which limits itself to reducing trade restrictions. The FTAAP would create a free trade zone that would considerably expand commerce and economic growth in the region.[29][31] The economic expansion and growth in trade could exceed the expectations of other regional free trade areas such as the ASEAN Plus Three (ASEAN + China, South Korea and Japan).[32] Some criticisms include that the diversion of trade within APEC members would create trade imbalances, market conflicts and complications with nations of other regions.[31] The development of the FTAAP is expected to take many years, involving essential studies, evaluations and negotiations between member economies.[29] It is also affected by the absence of political will and popular agitations and lobbying against free trade in domestic politics.[29][33]
