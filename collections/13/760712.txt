In April 2013, The Best of Both Worlds was re-released as a single feature in 1080p (1.33:1 ratio), edited together as a single film on Blu-ray disc.[3] In this version, the short summary of Part I at the start of Part II is removed and there is no second opening credits montage.[3] The 90-minute single also has some special features and audio commentary available for the episode.[4] One reviewer said it was better than some of the Star Trek theatrical films.[4]
