Often laboratory studies with rats are conducted to examine the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear responses.[22] In 2004, researchers conditioned rats (Rattus norvegicus) to fear a certain stimulus, through electric shock.[23] The researchers were able to then cause an extinction of this conditioned fear, to a point that no medications or drugs were able to further aid in the extinction process. However the rats did show signs of avoidance learning, not fear, but simply avoiding the area that brought pain to the test rats. The avoidance learning of rats is seen as a conditioned response, and therefore the behavior can be unconditioned, as supported by the earlier research.
