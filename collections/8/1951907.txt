Harold described her character as "feisty" and said she has got a lot of attitude.[6] Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy, labelled Lola "rebellious", while the BBC said she is "a troublesome teen" and a "petite bombshell."[6][13] BT described the character as "EastEnders' new tearaway and Billy's wayward granddaughter" and said "It seems Lola isn't exactly the butter-wouldn't-melt type. Surprise, surprise. Billy and Julie leave when Lola tells Billy she's not interested in the fact that he's her granddad, or that her dad's dead. What a lovely young lady."[14] Virgin Media also branded Lola a troublemaking, teen tearaway and said she was "a chip off the Mitchell block."[15] They added that she is a "blonde babe."[16] Chris Hooton from the Metro branded Lola as "mischievous."[17]
