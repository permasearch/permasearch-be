Paulie was the winner, thereby making his Category 4 teammates also immune from this week's eviction and, much to the dismay of the 8 Pack, postponing their plan of evicting Frank. Despite being enemies the previous week, Tiffany, Frank, and Bridgette formed an alliance after being outcasts in the House. They planned on targeting Paulie's alliance with Zakiyah, Nicole, and Corey for running the House in the past weeks. Paulie proceeded to nominate Natalie and Tiffany for eviction, shifting the target back on Tiffany.
