Theron's casting as the lead was announced in May 2015,[6] while James McAvoy was announced that October. In November, John Goodman was reported as also being in talks to join the film.[12][13] It was originally hoped that David Bowie would play a part in the film, although he turned down the offer shortly before his death.[14] To prepare for the role, Theron worked with eight personal trainers, who "basically made [her] puke every single day."[15] During the process, Theron cracked her teeth from clenching her jaw and had to get them fixed in surgery.[15] She also bruised a rib during her training.[16] As Theron's training for the movie overlapped with Keanu Reeves' training for John Wick Chapter 2, the two developed a competitive relationship, which included sparring together.[17]
