The Bornean orangutan population declined by 60% in the past 60 years and is projected to decline by 82% over 75 years. Its range has become patchy throughout Borneo, being largely extirpated from various parts of the island, including the southeast.[80] The largest remaining population is found in the forest around the Sabangau River, but this environment is at risk.[82]
