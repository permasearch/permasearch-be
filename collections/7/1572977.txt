Harrison and Dylan wrote at least one other song together during Thanksgiving 1968:[47] "When Everybody Comes to Town", subsequently renamed "Nowhere to Go".[48][49] Dylan also showed Harrison "I Don't Want to Do It", which, like "Nowhere to Go", Harrison would later consider for inclusion on All Things Must Pass but discard.[50][51][nb 5] As for Dylan's future output, songs such as "I Threw It All Away" on Nashville Skyline (1969) showed a more complex musical structure than before, a departure from his usual three-chord compositions.[55]
