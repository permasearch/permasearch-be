The attacker can compute ENCk1(P) for all values of k1 and DECk2(C) for all possible values of k2, for a total of 2k1 + 2k2 (or 2k1+1, if k1 and k2 are the same size) operations. If the result from any of the ENCk1(P) operations matches a result from the DECk2(C) operations, the pair of k1 and k2 is possibly the correct key. This potentially-correct key is called a candidate key. The attacker can determine which candidate key is correct by testing it with a second test-set of plaintext and ciphertext.
