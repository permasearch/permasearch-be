In November 2015, MIT Professor David Mindell discussed the Air France Flight 447 tragedy in the opening segment of an EconTalk podcast dedicated to the ideas in Mindell's book, Our Robots, Ourselves: Robotics and the Myths of Autonomy (2015).[257] Mindell said that the crash illustrated a "failed handoff," with insufficient warning, from the aircraft's autopilot to the human pilots.[258]
