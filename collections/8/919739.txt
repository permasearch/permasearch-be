In 2012, GoCompare launched the 'Saving the Nation' campaign starring Evans again as Gio Compario. Evans made adverts in the series with Sue Barker, Stuart Pearce, Ray Mears, Louis Spence, and most famously Professor Stephen Hawking with all of them trying to kill him and thus save the nation from his singing about GoCompare.[13]
