Subsequent work on measuring belief in a just world has focused on identifying multiple dimensions of the belief. This work has resulted in the development of new measures of just-world belief and additional research.[2] Hypothesized dimensions of just-world beliefs include belief in an unjust world,[32] beliefs in immanent justice and ultimate justice,[33] hope for justice, and belief in one's ability to reduce injustice.[34] Other work has focused on looking at the different domains in which the belief may function; individuals may have different just-world beliefs for the personal domain, the sociopolitical domain, the social domain, etc.[28] An especially fruitful distinction is between the belief in a just world for the self (personal) and the belief in a just world for others (general). These distinct beliefs are differentially associated with positive mental health.[35]
