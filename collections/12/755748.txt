Conga: an adaptation of comparsa music and dance for social dances. Eliseo Grenet may be the person who first created this music,[13]p408 but it was the Lecuona Cuban Boys who took it around the world. The conga became, and perhaps still is, the best-known Cuban music and dance style for non-latins.
