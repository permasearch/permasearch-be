The Siege of Bexar was the longest Texian campaign of the Texas Revolution, and according to Barr, it was "the only major Texian success other than San Jacinto".[63] According to Barr, of the 780 Texians who had participated in some way in the battle, between 30 and 35 were wounded, with 5 or 6 killed.[62] Historian Stephen Hardin places the Texian casualties slightly lower, with 4 killed and 14 wounded.[64] The losses were spread evenly amongst Texas residents and newcomers from the United States.[62] Although some Texians estimated that as many as 300 Mexican soldiers were killed, historians agree that it likely that a total of 150 Mexican soldiers were killed or wounded during the five-day battle.[62][64] About two-thirds of the Mexican casualties came from the infantry units defending the plazas.[65] To celebrate their victory, Texian troops threw a fandango on the evening of December 10.[62] Governor Henry Smith and the governing council sent a letter to the army, calling the soldiers "invincible" and "the brave sons of Washington and freedom".[64] After the war, those who could prove they had participated in this campaign were granted 320 acres (130 ha) of land. Eventually, 504 claims were certified.[66] At least 79 of the Texians who participated later died at the Battle of the Alamo or the Goliad Massacre,[67] and 90 participated in the final battle of the Texas Revolution, at San Jacinto.[66] The Texians confiscated 400 small arms, 20 cannon, and supplies, uniforms, and equipment.[65] During the siege, Cos's men had strengthened the Alamo mission, and the Texians chose to concentrate their forces within the Alamo rather than continue to fortify the plazas.[66]
