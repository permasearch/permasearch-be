Inadequate housing contributed to racial unrest and health problems. However, the lack of development also preserved buildings from the 1870â€“1910 building boom, and Harlem as a result has many of the finest original townhouses in New York. This includes work by many significant architects of the day, including McKim, Mead, and White; James Renwick; William Tuthill; Charles Buek; and Francis Kimball.
