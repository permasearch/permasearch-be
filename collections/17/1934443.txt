For a boolean function of     n   {\displaystyle n}   variables       x  1   , â€¦ ,  x  n      {\displaystyle {x_{1},\dots ,x_{n}}}  , a product term in which each of the     n   {\displaystyle n}   variables appears once (in either its complemented or uncomplemented form) is called a minterm. Thus, a minterm is a logical expression of n variables that employs only the complement operator and the conjunction operator.
