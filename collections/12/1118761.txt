Another cause of paresthesia may be direct damage to the nerves themselves, i.e., neuropathy, which itself can stem from injury or infection such as frostbite or Lyme disease, or may be indicative of a current neurological disorder. Neuropathy is also a side effect of some chemotherapies (see Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy).[6] Benzodiazepine withdrawal may also cause paresthesia as the drug removal leaves the GABA receptors stripped bare and possibly malformed. Chronic paresthesia can sometimes be symptomatic of serious conditions, such as a transient ischemic attack, or autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis or lupus erythematosus.[citation needed] Exposure to environmental toxins, chemicals used in water treatment and fluoroquinolones can also cause paresthesia.[7] Stroke survivors and those with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) may experience paresthesia from damage to the central nervous system.
