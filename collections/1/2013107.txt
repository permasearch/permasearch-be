Muhammad's first revelation was an event described in Islam as taking place in 610 AD, during which the prophet Muhammad was visited by the archangel Gabriel, who revealed to him the beginnings of what would later become the Holy Quran. The event took place in a cave called Hira, located on the mountain Jabal an-Nour, near Makka.
