The Soviet forces were apparently unprepared despite numerous warnings from a variety of sources.[45] They suffered much damage in the field because of mediocre officers, partial mobilization, and an incomplete reorganization.[46] The hasty pre-war forces expansion and the over-promotion of inexperienced officers (owing to the purging of experienced officers) favored the Wehrmacht in combat.[47][pageÂ needed] The Axis's numeric superiority rendered the combatants' divisional strength approximately equal.[d] A generation of Soviet commanders (notably Georgy Zhukov) learned from the defeats,[49] and Soviet victories in the Battle of Moscow, at Stalingrad, Kursk and later in Operation Bagration proved decisive.
