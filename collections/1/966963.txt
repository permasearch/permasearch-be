The editorial staff did not oppose Starlin's plans to kill major characters, which he believes was partly because Anderson did not share many of the details with his peers.[15] They did, however, limit which of "their" characters could have roles in the story. For example, X-Men editor Bob Harras only allowed Cyclops and Wolverine to appear. The rest of the X-Men cast were shown to have died off-panel or were otherwise omitted.[20] This hesitancy was due in part to the relative newness of summer crossover events.[16][note 2]
