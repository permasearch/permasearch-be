Units of length were systematized by Edward II who in 1324 defined the inch as being three barleycorns, the foot as twelve inches, the yard as three feet, the perch five and half yards and the acre as being an area four perches in width by forty perches in length.[1] Apart from the ell (45 inches or 114.3 cm) which continued to be used in the cloth trade and the chain which was introduced by Edmund Gunter in 1620, these units formed the basis of the units of length of the English system of measurement. The units were however redefined many times – during Henry VIII's time standard yards and ells made of brass were manufactured, during Elizabeth I's time these were replaced with standards made of bronze and in 1742, after scientific comparisons showed a variation of up to 0.2% from the mean, a definitive standard yard was proposed (but not manufactured).[2]:122–123[10]
