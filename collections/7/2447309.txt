I-82 begins southeast of Ellensburg, Washington, at a trumpet interchange with I-90, the state's major east–west freeway.[12] I-82 travels south in a concurrency with US 97, which continues northwest along I-90 around Ellensburg, and intersects State Route 821 (SR 821) at Thrall on the south edge of the Kittitas Valley.[4] The freeway ascends the Manastash Ridge, traveling southeast around the Yakima River Canyon, where SR 821 runs as a meandering scenic byway. Here, I-82 also forms the western edge of the Yakima Firing Range, a military training and exercise facility that stretches across the plateau to the Columbia River Gorge. The facility also included a National Security Agency outpost with large satellite dishes used for government surveillance.[13] The freeway reaches its highest point at Vanderbilt Gap, 2,672 feet (814 m) above sea level and only 300 feet (91 m) lower than Snoqualmie Pass on I-90, and begins its southwesterly descent into Yakima County.[14][15]
