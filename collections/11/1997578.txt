"Clocks" is an alternative rock song, with elements of psychedelic rock.[5] It features a repeating piano melody and a minimalist, atmospheric soundscape of synthesizers, drums, electric guitar, and bass guitar. Martin applied an ostinato, with emphasis that imitates a three against two polyrhythm, as well as a descending scale on the piano chord progression, which switches from major to minor chords.[6][7] "Clocks" also includes a sparse string arrangement in selected sections of the song, to add to its atmosphere.[4][8]
