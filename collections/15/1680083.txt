Little House on the Prairie is an autobiographical children's novel by Laura Ingalls Wilder, published in 1935.[4] It was the third novel published in the Little House series, continuing the story of the first, Little House in the Big Woods (1932), but not related to the second. Thus, it is sometimes called the second one in the series, or the second volume of "the Laura Years".[3][a]
