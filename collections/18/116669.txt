In the early stages of recording his fifth studio album,[12] Timberlake also served as the executive music producer for the soundtrack to the film Trolls.[13] The uptempo disco-pop track was written and produced by Timberlake, Max Martin and Shellback.[14][15][16] Entertainment Weekly described the song as a "funky mix of disco and pop."[17] For The A.V. Club it is a "a soul-pop sugar rush tweaked for maximum dance grooves."[18] "Can't Stop the Feeling!" is written in the key of C major with a tempo of 113 beats per minute. The song follows a chord progression of C – Am7 – Fmaj9 – Am7, and Timberlake's vocals span two octaves, from E4 to E6.[19] The track features a "jazzy", uptempo beat and a falsetto chorus.[20]
