In May 2017, General Mills announced they would be promoting 10,000 boxes of cereal that contain only marshmallow pieces.[17] In order to win one of the coveted boxes, consumers would need to purchase a specially-marked box of regular Lucky Charms with a code on the inside panel. The code would be entered into an official website to see if the consumer is the winner of one of the 10,000 novelty boxes produced. The sweepstakes will run through December 2017.[18][19]
