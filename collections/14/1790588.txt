In 2011, the adjacent Luna Park took over management of the Cyclone.[9][10] As of JuneÂ 2016[update] it cost $10 to ride and the "reride" policy has been eliminated. In 2012, Luna Park started a major refurbishment of the Cyclone, which is planned to take five years and take place during the off season, allowing for regular-season operation. The refurbishment was done by Great Coasters International.
