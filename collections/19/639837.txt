Scarfe also drew the illustrations for their 1979 album The Wall and provided animation for the subsequent 1980-1981 concert tour in support of that album.[10] In 1982, he worked on the film version of The Wall, although he and Roger Waters fell out with director Alan Parker during the latter stages of editing.[12] As well as the artwork, Scarfe contributed 15 minutes' worth of elaborate animation to the film, including a sequence depicting the German bombing campaign over England during World War II, set to the song "Goodbye Blue Sky". Some of the animated footage was not original to the film, having been produced for and used in the 1980-81 concert tour, as well as being featured in the 1979 music video for "Another Brick in the Wall: Part 2".[citation needed]
