Over the course of the American Revolution, the Convention Army was marched across the colonies. First they were marched to Massachusetts and remained there for a year, then in 1778 they were moved to Virginia where they remained for two years, and then in 1780 they were moved north and gradually dispersed to different states, cities, and towns until the remainder of the war. The marches themselves were brutal on the soldiers, but their lives generally improved once they got to their destinations. The main reasons why Congress forced the Convention Army to march across America was for security and for financial reasons. Once resources became scarce in the state of Massachusetts, Congress ordered them to be moved into the southern states. The war effort was very different in the north than it was in the south. In 1780, it had become difficult to provide the British and German prisoners of war and their guards with food in the south and their presence there had become a security risk. British had started their official campaigns in the south and this brought about the risk of insurrection among the POWS, and so the Convention army was ordered to be marched back among the northern states and dispersed.[32]
