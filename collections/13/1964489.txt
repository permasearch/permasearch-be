Current research works on the endoscopic collection of dimensional 3D-data, such as using laser triangulation or the approach of structured light projection. Depending on the optics used, inner geometries can be measured with accuracies in the low Âµm region. Other emerging endoscope technologies are emerging that measure additional optical properties of light, such as optical polarization,[32] optical phase,[33] and hyperspectral endoscopy, which records images at many different wavelengths.[34]
