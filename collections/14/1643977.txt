Pakistan has an installed electricity generation capacity of 25,100 MW in 2017.[2] The average demand is 22,000 MW and the shortfall was between 5,000 and 6,000 MW. Oil (35.2 per cent), hydel (29.9 per cent), gas (29 per cent), and nuclear, solar and imported (6 per cent) are the principal sources. In the next 10 years, peak electricity demand is expected to rise by four to five per cent, which is roughly 1,500 MW. This dismal forecast is due to a lopsided energy mix, diminishing indigenous fuel reserves, increasing circular debt and transmission hold-ups. Pakistan has almost exhausted its gas reserves. Imported oil's price hikes affect the budget and its constant supply cannot be guaranteed. Pakistan has the potential to meet these energy challenges through hydroelectric power, but there are political and environmental issues in building dams. Rationality demands reducing reliance on oil and going for alternatives. The development of alternatives does not happen overnight. Pakistan will have to rely on imported fuels for the interim period at a huge cost. LNG is difficult to import, using coal has environmental issues, using shale gas also has environmental issues attached with it, and wind power has transmission network challenges.[3] With total estimated coal reserves of over 186bn tonnes, Pakistan ranks sixth among coal-rich countries. Yet, coal's potential has not been exploited adequately.[4]
