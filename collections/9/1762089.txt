In 1941, the company became the largest manufacturer of automatic water heaters in the United States.[8] During World War II, much of the company's efforts went towards wartime production, including building ships and aircraft parts.[4][8] In 1954, Rheem brought the introduction of "glass-lining", which coated the interior of a water heater tank with porcelain to extend the life of the tank.[8] One of the most significant events came in 1956 with the introduction of "Rheemaire" central air conditioning and heater systems for homes. This eventually became one of the company's primary business areas.[8] In 1959, Rheem purchased the Ruud Manufacturing Company.[8][11]
