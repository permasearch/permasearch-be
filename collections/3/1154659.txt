In the first series, the Azores, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Madeira, Martinique, Réunion, and the Canary Islands, overseas territories of the eurozone member states, which also use the euro, are shown under the map in separate boxes. Cyprus and Malta were not shown on the first series because they were not in the EU in 2002, when the banknotes were issued, even though they joined the Eurozone in 2008. The map did not stretch as far east as Cyprus, while Malta was too small to be depicted: the minimum size for depiction was 400 km2.[12] However, both Cyprus and Malta are depicted on the Europa series note.[35]
