As Charlene was unable to successfully follow up the success of "I've Never Been to Me" - her only subsequent Hot 100 entry "Used to Be" (a duet with Stevie Wonder) stalled outside the Top 40 (at #46) - she remains a high-profile one-hit wonder: on the 2002 VH1 special 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders, "I've Never Been to Me" by Charlene was ranked at #75.[4]
