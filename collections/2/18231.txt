The U.S. state of Indiana is split between Eastern and Central time zones. The official dividing line has moved progressively west from its original location on the Indiana–Ohio border, to a position dividing Indiana down the middle, and finally to its current location along much of the Indiana–Illinois border. Being on the western frontier of the Eastern time zone resulted in opposition from many in the state to observing daylight saving time for decades.[1] The 2005 decision by the Indiana General Assembly to implement daylight saving time remains controversial.
