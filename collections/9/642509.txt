As an example, we consider Spanish, a language with two noun genders: masculine and feminine.[20] Among other lexical items, the definite article changes its form according to the gender of the noun. In the singular, the article is: el (masculine),[21] and la (feminine).[22] Thus, nouns referring to male beings carry the masculine article, and female beings the feminine article (agreement).[23]
