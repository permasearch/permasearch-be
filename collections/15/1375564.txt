Limited overs cricket formats require that each team can bat for a sufficient number of overs in order for a result to be possible. As of 2016 this stands at 20 overs in One Day International cricket and five overs in Twenty20 cricket. If each team is able to face at least this number of overs a result is possible and can be calculated using the Duckworthâ€“Lewis method or other competition rules.
