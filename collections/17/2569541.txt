Fantasia 2000 first opened in IMAX theatres for a four-month run from January 1 to April 30, 2000, becoming the first animated feature-length film shown in the format.[86][92] A temporary 622-seat theatre costing almost $4 million was built in four weeks for its Los Angeles run as Disney was unable to reach an agreement to show the film exclusively at the city's sole IMAX theatre at the California Science Center.[60][93] After opening at 75 theaters worldwide, the film grossed over $2.2 million in 54 cinemas in North America in its opening weekend, averaging $41,481 per theater,[94] and $842,000 from 21 screens in 14 markets.[95] It set new records for the highest gross for any IMAX engagement and surpassed the highest weekly total for any previously released IMAX film.[96] Its three-day worldwide gross surpassed $3.8 million, setting further records at 18 venues worldwide.[97] Fantasia 2000 grossed a worldwide total of $21.1 million in 30 days,[98] and $64.5 million at the end of its IMAX run.[99]
