Conservative researchers have argued that income inequality is not significant because consumption, rather than income should be the measure of inequality, and inequality of consumption is less extreme than inequality of income in the US. Will Wilkinson of the libertarian Cato Institute states that "the weight of the evidence shows that the run-up in consumption inequality has been considerably less dramatic than the rise in income inequality," and consumption is more important than income.[287] According to Johnson, Smeeding, and Tory, consumption inequality was actually lower in 2001 than it was in 1986.[288][289] The debate is summarized in "The Hidden Prosperity of the Poor" by journalist Thomas B. Edsall.[290] Other studies have not found consumption inequality less dramatic than household income inequality,[278][291] and the CBO's study found consumption data not "adequately" capturing "consumption by high-income households" as it does their income, though it did agree that household consumption numbers show more equal distribution than household income.[292]
