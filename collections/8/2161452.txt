The National Service Scheme primarily stands for channelising the student youth for building the nation. The youth in all ages has been in the vanguard of progress and social change. On 18 October 2006 NSS CET (with unit no. 147) was inaugurated. NSS is now the most active organisation in the college. NSS cet is now capable of conducting even more than 25 programmes a year in midst of a busy academic schedule. Also from a bunch of students at the time of formation, the number of NSS volunteers is now more than a hundred. Also NSS cet is now an established one with a website and a special room for its activities.http://www.nsscet.org Last year NSS even came up with an Alumni section, a rare thing for an organisation in college. As part of the new requirement of A.P.J.Kalam Technological University, a new unit of NSS was started
