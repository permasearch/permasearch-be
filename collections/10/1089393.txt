The Bills and Dolphins did not meet again until Week 15 in the 2017 season.[1][38] During the game, which also carried playoff implications, Bills running back LeSean McCoy topped 10,000 career rushing yards, becoming just the 30th NFL running back to do so.[39] Buffalo won 24â€“16 as Dolphins quarterback Jay Cutler threw three interceptions.[40] Two weeks later, a fight ensued after a Dolphins touchdown in the fourth quarter that led to multiple ejections.[41] After staving off a Dolphins comeback, the Bills clinched their first playoff berth in 18 years with a win in Miami, along with a Cincinnati Bengals victory over the Baltimore Ravens.[42]
