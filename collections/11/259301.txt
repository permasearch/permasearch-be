Florida's football program competed for its first several seasons as an independent before joining the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association in 1912. They moved to the Southern Conference in 1922, then left with a dozen other schools to establish the new Southeastern Conference (SEC) in 1932. UF is currently one of fourteen member institutions in the SEC, and the Florida football team has competed in the SEC Eastern Division since the league began divisional play in 1992.
