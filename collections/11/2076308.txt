There are several processes that can yield npOx as an oxidation product without the involvement of free O2. One or more of those processes may have dominated on Mars, since atmospheric modeling over geologic time scales indicates that free O2 (generated mostly via the photodissociation of H2O)[12] may have always been a trace component with a partial pressure not exceeding 0.1 ÂµPa.[13]
