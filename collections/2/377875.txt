Computer modeling is an example of alternative testing methods; using computer models of chemicals and proteins, structure-activity relationships can be determined, and chemical structures that are likely to bind to, and interfere with, proteins with essential functions, can be identified.[16] This work requires expert knowledge in molecular modeling and statistics together with expert judgment in chemistry, biology and toxicology.[16]
