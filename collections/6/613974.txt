One day Cisely confides in Eve the secret of why she's been so moody. She tells the story that one night, after their parents had a vicious argument, Cisely went to comfort her father and he, when drunk, attempted to molest her. Enraged, Eve seeks a local witch, Elzora (Diahann Carroll), to commission a voodoo spell to put a fatal curse on her father. While on her way to visit the witch, Eve runs into Lenny Mereaux and questions him about his teaching job that keeps him away from home. In the conversation, she alludes to a possible tryst between his wife Matty and her father.
