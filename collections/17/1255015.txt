Soon, in July 1762, barely six months after becoming emperor, Peter commits the political error of retiring with his Holstein-born courtiers and relatives to Oranienbaum, leaving his wife in Saint Petersburg. On July 8 and 9, the Leib Guard revolts, deposes Peter from power, and proclaims Catherine the new monarch. The bloodless coup d'Ã©tat succeeds and Catherine becomes the new empress, and thus the Catherinian Era and the Golden Age of the Russian Empire begins.
