In the Battle of Hexi (121 BC), the Han forces had inflicted a major defeat to the Xiongnu.[37] Emperor Wu desired to place firm control over the Hexi Corridor and decided to launch a large military offensive to purge the Xiongnu from the area.[34] The campaign was undertaken in 121 BC by General Huo Qubing.[38] Departing from Longxi that year, General Huo Qubing led light cavalry through five Xiongnu kingdoms, conquering the Yanzhi and Qilian mountain ranges from the Xiongnu.[24]
