The CW (and before that, its co-predecessor The WB) carried The Daily Buzz for its small-market cable- and multicast-only affiliate group (as well as its mainly cable-only predecessor) from 2002 to 2014, in lieu of a national program; that program was also mainly syndicated to affiliates of The CW and MyNetworkTV (and predecessors The WB and UPN) as well as several independent stations until its abrupt cancellation in April 2015. Generally since then, outside of a few select CW and MyNetworkTV affiliates, stations usually program paid programming, a local extension of a Big Three sister station's morning newscast during national morning shows, or as Sinclair Broadcast Group has done since July 2017, returned to programming for children under the KidsClick block.
