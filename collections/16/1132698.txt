Australia was forced to bowl in the foggy dew, but still shortened Sri Lanka's chances with quick dismissals of the openers, as Sri Lanka slumped to 2/23.[10] Then De Silva came into the crease and played "on the biggest occasion of his life, played with quite wonderful judgment".[11] He scored 107 from 124 balls, only the 3rd ever century in the World Cup final, and partnered with Asanka Gurusinha and Arjuna Ranatunga, to take Sri Lanka to what ended up an easy victory. De Silva was awarded the well-deserved Man of the Match.[10]
