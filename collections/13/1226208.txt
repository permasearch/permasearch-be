In 1988, Sean and Tiffany finally married in the Quartermaine mansion. During the wedding ceremony, Tiffany's real name came out: Elsie Mae Crumholz. Sometime after the wedding, the Cartel began working in Port Charles, and they poisoned Tiffany in order to blackmail Sean into giving them information on Robert's investigation into the Cartel. The Cartel's evil plans eventually fell apart and Tony Jones was able to cure Tiffany's illness. When Tiffany's sister Cheryl Stansbury died in a car accident, Sean and Tiffany went to Phoenix to get Cheryl's baby son Lucas. Lucas had been adopted by Bobbie, after Cheryl was told that her baby died. When Bobbie discovered that Lucas was actually Cheryl's son and the baby hadn't died, she kept quiet about it, so that she could keep him. Cheryl eventually found out the truth and got Lucas back, however Cheryl left Lucas to Bobbie and Tony in her will, under the assumption that Tiffany didn't want children. This infuriated Tiffany and she took Bobbie to court to gain custody of Lucas.
