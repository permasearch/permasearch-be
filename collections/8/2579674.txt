On August 6, 1838, non-Mormons in Gallatin tried to prevent Mormons from voting,[103] and the election-day scuffles initiated the 1838 Mormon War. Non-Mormon vigilantes raided and burned Mormon farms, while Danites and other Mormons pillaged non-Mormon towns.[104] In the Battle of Crooked River, a group of Mormons attacked the Missouri state militia, mistakenly believing them to be anti-Mormon vigilantes. Governor Lilburn Boggs then ordered that the Mormons be "exterminated or driven from the state".[105] On October 30, a party of Missourians surprised and killed seventeen Mormons in the Haun's Mill massacre.[106]
