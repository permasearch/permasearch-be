HSG should never be performed on pregnant women. Complications of the procedure include infection, allergic reactions to the materials used, intravasation of the material, and, if oil-based material is used, embolisation. Air can also be accidentally instilled into the uterine cavity by the operator, thus limiting the exam due to iatrogenically induced filling defects. This can be overcome by administering the Tenzer Tilt, which will demonstrate movement of the air bubbles to the non-dependant portion of the uterine cavity.
