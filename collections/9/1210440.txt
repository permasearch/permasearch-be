The vehicle then quickly moves into another room and halts into a sudden stop, nearly "crashing" into a wall, causing scarab beetles to "burst out" from the walls in front and at the sides. Then the vehicle drops backwards and turns in a 180 degree circle and Imhotep warns the riders: "You will never find the book. Your end shall be my beginning. Behold your fate. YOUR SOULS ARE MINE!". At this instant, riders are accelerated from 0 to 40 miles per hour (64Â km/h) in a matter of seconds. The vehicle accelerates up a hill as it goes through Imhotep's skull and drops through various turns past projections of mummies.
