Jeremy Davies was cast in the role because of the "tremendous intelligence that seems to emanate from him"[1] and was one of the writer-producers' favorite character actors. Davies was critically praised for his performance and critics were generally disappointed by the character's death in season five. UGO.com named him one of the best TV nerds.[2]
