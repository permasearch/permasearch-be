The wedding dress was designed by the British designer Clare Waight Keller under the aegis of the fashion house Givenchy.[43] It was made of "double-bonded silk cady cushioned by an underskirt in triple silk organza" and had a boat neckline, long sleeves and sweeping train.[44][45] The silk veil was 16 feet (4.9Â m) long and was embroidered with 55 flowers, representing the 53 countries of the Commonwealth,[44][46] as well as Wintersweet, which grows in front of Nottingham Cottage, where she and Harry live, and the California Poppy, the state flower of California.[47] It was secured by a diamond bandeau tiara, made in 1932 for Queen Mary and lent to Markle by Queen Elizabeth II.[44][48] The centre brooch had been a wedding gift from the County of Lincoln in 1893. The tiara is a platinum band, made up of eleven sections, a detachable centre brooch with interlaced opals and diamonds.[49] The shoes were also from Givenchy, and had a pointed couture design.[44]
