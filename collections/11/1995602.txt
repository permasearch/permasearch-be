The genome of a positive-sense ssRNA virus usually contains relatively few genes, usually between three and ten, including an RdRP.[2] Coronaviruses have the largest known RNA genomes, up to 32 kilobases in length, and likely possess replication proofreading mechanisms in the form of a proofreading exoribonuclease, non-structural protein 14, that is otherwise not found in RNA viruses.[6]
