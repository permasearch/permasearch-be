Tobacco is an agricultural product acting as a stimulant triggering complex biochemical and neurotransmitter disruptions.[1] Its main ingredient is nicotine and it is present in all cigarettes.[1] Early tobacco usage was for medical cures and religious purposes.[2] In the 1990s, cigarette usage became increasingly popular when it was sold in mass amounts.[3] The popularity of smoking increased and in 1964, the Surgeon General of the United States wrote a report concerning the dangers of cigarette smoking.[4] In the United States, for the past 50 years efforts have been made so that the public should be aware of the risks of tobacco usage.[5]
