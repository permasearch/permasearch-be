A Cell Broadcast Centre (CBC), a node which is a source of SMS-CB, is connected to a base station controller (BSC) in GSM networks or to a radio network controller (RNC) in UMTS networks via standardized interface over TCP/IP. The BSC-CBC interface is described in 3GPP standard TS 48.049; however, non-standard implementations exist. The RNC-CBC interface is described in 3GPP standard TS 25.419. A CBC sends SMS-CB messages, a list of cells where messages are to be broadcast, and the requested repetition rate and number of times they shall be broadcast to the BSC/RNC. The BSC's and RNC's responsibility is to deliver the SMS-CB messages to the base station (BTSs) and NodeBs, which handle the requested cells.
