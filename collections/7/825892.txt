In approaching Morse's costume, Foley "looked at all of her comic appearances and really wanted to try to bring elements of the look from the comics into the costume that we're doing now for the show...but we had to change it, obviously, for practicality, because it had to fit into our world. It had to have a kind of tactical feeling to it too so that it made sense in our universe. She's got rivets that are in the straps across her chest, and those are there as a tribute to the buttons that go down the side of her [most recent comics] costume". The character's comics costume is traditionally navy blue and white, which was changed to navy blue and grey for the series.[84] Three sets of the costume were produced; two for Palicki to wear, and one for her stunt double. Foley used "lots of stretch panels" and leather to ensure freedom of movement in the character's many action sequences.[85]
