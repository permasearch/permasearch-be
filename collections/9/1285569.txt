Since X-ring chains are self lubricating(Internally) and have low friction, they are more durable and require less maintenance. However still, maintenance is required - especially on the outside of the X-rings, as they are very sensitive to damage. Special care must be taken in cleaning as they have complex construction and rubber rings can be damaged by solvent.[1][3]
