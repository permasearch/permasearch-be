Two years later, Caesar's clan is at war with the human military faction known as Alpha-Omega. The apes have captured four soldiers led by Preacher, and the gorilla named Red (a follower of Koba), who have joined the humans along with the other apes, after being disillusioned with Caesar's leadership, in fear of retaliation from Caesar due to their betrayal. Caesar's clan hides in Muir Woods, and Caesar offers the humans peace if the apes are left alone. Learning that Alpha-Omega follows the leadership of a mysterious Colonel, Caesar makes plans to relocate the clan across the desert, not wanting to suffer any more ape casualties after Koba's wrath on San Francisco. The night before their journey, Alpha-Omega launches an assault on the ape home and Caesar's wife Cornelia and eldest son Blue Eyes are slaughtered by the Colonel, leaving only Caesar's youngest son Cornelius alive.
