On April 14, 2010, the four surviving members of Mother Love Bone reunited for the first time (with friend and fellow Seattle musician Shawn Smith serving as frontman for the night) as part of a sold-out "Brad and Friends" evening at Seattle's Showbox. The songs featured were part of the band's core repertoire from their early days, including "Stardog Champion," "Holy Roller," "Gentle Groove" and a cover of the Argent song "Hold Your Head Up," a favorite encore from the band's early club days around Seattle.
