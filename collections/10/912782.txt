During the prohibition era the waters of the South Coast were a popular smuggling route in for alcohol.[12] Largely forgotten in the later parts of the 20th Century, with increased security at the Mexicoâ€“United States border smuggling has increased;[12] during the 2011 fiscal year, more than 200 smuggling vessels were observed.[12] Most of the vessels attempt to off load their cargo of drugs and/or illegal immigrants in San Diego County,[13] however destinations are as far north as the California Central Coast.[12] Often, vessels used for smuggling operations are abandoned upon making landfall.[14]
