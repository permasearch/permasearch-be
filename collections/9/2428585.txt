Due to the promise of exchange, timeshares often sell regardless of the location of their deeded resort. What is not often disclosed is the difference in trading power depending on the location, and season of the ownership. If a resort is in Hawaii or Southern California, it will exchange extremely well depending on the season and week that is assigned to the particular unit trying to make an exchange. However, timeshares in highly desirable locations and high season time slots are the most expensive in the world, subject to demand typical of any heavily trafficked vacation area. If you happen to own a timeshare in Palm Springs, California in the middle of July or August for example, your trading power is greatly diminished, because those looking to come to a resort at a time when the temperatures are in excess of 110 degrees Fahrenheit are few.
