The UMA group conducts its work in the Kantara Initiative [6] and has also contributed a series of Internet-Draft specifications to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as an eventual home for UMA standardization work. To this end, the WG has contributed several individual Internet-Drafts to the IETF for consideration. One of these, a specification for OAuth dynamic client registration,[7] served as input for the more generalized mechanism ultimately developed for OAuth.[8]
