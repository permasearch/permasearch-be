An important number of African states were transformed into instruments of colonial rule, especially by the British, most notably in the case of the Hausa emirated and the Yoruba city states of Nigeria, the Ashanti in Ghana, the Ganda and other Interlacustrine kingdoms in Uganda, the Lozi in Barotseland, the Tswana chiefdoms, and the Swazi and Lesotho kings. The bridge between pre- and postcolonial state formation in Africa at first may have been seen as frail.
