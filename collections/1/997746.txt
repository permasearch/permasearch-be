The declaration is similar to the particulars of claim filed in a combined summons and must therefore contain all the essential averments of the cause of action. It will set out in detail the nature of the claim, the conclusions of law that the plaintiff is entitled to make from the facts, and a prayer setting out the relief to be claimed.[68] If the plaintiff's claim consists of a number of claims, each claim should be dealt with separately in the details referred to above.
