A classically trained actor and a native of the Bronx, New York, Richardson first gained recognition as one of only eight U.S. high school students selected for the National Foundation for the Arts' "Arts '82" program. As a result of this, he earned a scholarship to Syracuse University and a spot on a PBS special directed by John Houseman.
