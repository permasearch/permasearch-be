After all iCANdidates have performed, the iCANdidates rank the acts through their smartphone â€” 3 points for the first place, 2 for second, and 1 for third; they may not vote for their own act. Once the iCANdidates have finished voting, the audience votes for the act they liked best. The act with the most votes from the audience receives 3 points. The audience vote is only valid if the majority of the audience voted (51%).
