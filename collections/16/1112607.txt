Green sea turtles migrate long distances between feeding sites and nesting sites; some swim more than 2,600 kilometres (1,600Â mi) to reach their spawning grounds. Beaches in Southeast Asia, India, islands in the western Pacific, and Central America are where Green sea turtles breed.[6] Mature turtles often return to the exact beach from which they hatched. Females usually mate every two to four years. Males, on the other hand, visit the breeding areas every year, attempting to mate.[62] Mating seasons vary between populations. For most C. mydas in the Caribbean, mating season is from June to September.[22] The French Guiana nesting subpopulation nests from March to June.[34] In the tropics, green turtles nest throughout the year, although some subpopulations prefer particular times of the year. In Pakistan, Indian Ocean turtles nest year-round, but prefer the months of July to December.[46]
