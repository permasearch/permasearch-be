"Best Thing I Never Had" also received a few mixed and negative reviews. Amos Barshad of New York magazine wrote that the ballad borrows more heavily from Beyonc√©'s own 2006 single "Irreplaceable", and that "[this] can't be a bad thing". However, he noted that "this time in language ('Sucks to be you right now') agreeable to a nation of tweens and in a manner agreeable to anyone who likes yelping along in unison to ascendant pop choruses."[47] David Amidon of PopMatters wrote that lines like "showed your ass" and "it must suck to be you" exemplify lame lyrics. He concluded that, "[listeners] are wondering how such lame lyrics could be sung with such earnestness."[59] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote that the most interesting thing about "Best Thing I Never Had" is the curious image evoked by the chorus' lyric, noting that everything seemed fine until "the protagonist's former amorata 'showed your ass'".[60] Music Week's Ben Cardew commented that its 1980s sound is "not a highlight".[61] A negative review came from Al Shipley of The Village Voice who wrote that "Best Thing I Never Had" and "Party" were "among the album's worst and most unrepresentative songs".[62]
