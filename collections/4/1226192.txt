Stavros Cassadine was first introduced to the series in November 1983, as he attempted to reclaim his "wife" Laura Spencer from her long-time love Luke Spencer. Over a year earlier, Stavros had arranged for Laura's abduction, having become completely obsessed with her. After telling Laura that Luke had died, Stavros took Laura to an island, where he married and raped her, the latter event resulting in the conception of their son, Nikolas. Jealous over her son's obsession with Laura, Stavros' mother, Helena helped Laura escape from his captivity. Stavros, however, managed to track Laura down, and following an encounter with Luke, fell down a flight of stairs, broke his neck, and died.
