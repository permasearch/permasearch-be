In December 2006, Deer released records obtained from the Legal Services Commission, showing that it had paid Â£435,643 in undisclosed fees to Wakefield for the purpose of building a case against the MMR vaccine.[77] Those payments, The Sunday Times reported, had begun two years before publication of Wakefield's paper in The Lancet.[67] Within days of Deer's report, Wakefield dropped all his libel actions[78] and was ordered to pay all defendants' legal costs.[79][80]
