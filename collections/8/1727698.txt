Research indicates that performance in conjunctive visual search tasks significantly improves during childhood and declines in later life.[65] More specifically, young adults have been shown to have faster reaction times on conjunctive visual search tasks than both children and older adults, but their reaction times were similar for feature visual search tasks.[36] This suggests that there is something about the process of integrating visual features or serial searching that is difficult for children and older adults, but not for young adults. Studies have suggested numerous mechanisms involved in this difficulty in children, including peripheral visual acuity,[66] eye movement ability,[67] ability of attentional focal movement,[68] and the ability to divide visual attention among multiple objects.[69]
