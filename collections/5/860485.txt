In December 2012, West Ham were named as the preferred bidder for the stadium with a separate operator co-ordinating community and sporting use, as well as concerts and events.[150] Leyton Orient's bid was rejected due to its commercial viability and the bid from Intelligent Transport Services, in conjunction with Formula One, was rejected for having too much speculation and uncertainty in their business plan.[151] However, with so much public money going into the stadium and its redevelopment, the BBC learned that David Gold and David Sullivan must share any profits they make if they sell the club.[152][153] West Ham were given three months to improve the terms of their deal or lose the stadium; with Johnson going with plan B without football.[151] The two parties seemed to find common ground in February 2013, with West Ham, reportedly, agreeing to paying £2.5 million in rent per year. They additionally promised to pay back any extra cost for the roof and seats within ten years.[154][155] Gold stated at the beginning of March that a deal could be complete by the middle of the month.[156] On 22 March 2013, West Ham United secured a 99-year lease deal, with the stadium planned to be used as their home ground from the 2016–2017 season.[157] In July 2013, UK Athletics received a 50-year deal for the use of the stadium.[158] UK Athletics will have access to the stadium every year from the last Friday in June until the end of July.[159]
