A loanword from the Japanese  (うま味), umami can be translated as "pleasant savory taste".[7] This neologism was coined in 1908 by Japanese chemist Kikunae Ikeda from a nominalization of umai (うまい) "delicious". The compound 旨味 (with mi (味) "taste") is used for a more general sense of a food as delicious.[8][9][10]
