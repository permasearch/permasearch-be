There are two police departments guarding the city, the Police of the City of Monterrey (locally known as the Policía Regia),[20] dependent of the municipal government, and the State Public Safety.[21] The Policía Regia protects the city's downtown and main areas, while the State Public Safety is in charge of the farthest areas. Since the attack to the Casino Royale in 2011, the security has been reinforced by military and federal police.[22]
