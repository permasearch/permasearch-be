Chest pain is a common symptom encountered by emergency medical services. Aspirin increases survival in people with acute coronary syndrome and it is reasonable for EMS dispatchers to recommend it in people with no recent serious bleeding.[25] Supplemental oxygen was used in the past for most people with chest pain but is not needed unless the oxygen saturations are less than 94% or there are signs of respiratory distress.[26][25] Entonox is frequently used by EMS personnel in the prehospital environment.[27] However, there is little evidence about its effectiveness.[25][28]
