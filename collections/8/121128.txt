In March 2016, Kid Cudi performed at McDowell Mountain Music Festival in Phoenix, Arizona.[141] In an early April 2016 interview with Billboard, when asked about Man on the Moon III, Cudi responded with: "I came up with Man on the Moon when I was a young man. People change their vibe! We can follow the same template and do the five-act split. Sonically, I’m still going to be where I’m at. Honestly, I was ready to live up to the obligation and do 'Man on the Moon III. I haven’t been dicking around. I was planning on doing it after Speedin' Bullet. But the Speedin’ Bullet response tore me up. It made me realize what’s most important. I’m getting back on the bike again and doing what I do best: me."[142] On April 22, 2016, Kid Cudi announced he would be releasing a new studio album, slated for a summer unveiling.[143]
