The world's most expensive grand piano sold at auction is a specially designed D-274 named Steinway Alma Tadema;[34] it sold for $1.2 million in 1997 at Christie's in London,[35] breaking Steinway's own 1997 price record of $390,000.[36] The D-274 was built in 1883-87 and designed by Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema. It is displayed at the art museum Clark Art Institute.[37] In 2006, Steinway recreated an exacting replica of this piano.[35]
