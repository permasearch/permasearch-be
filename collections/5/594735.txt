Individuals may legally change their name through the state and territory governments of Australia according to state or territory laws and regulations via agencies generally titled "Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages".[30] Exceptions exist for some states such as restricted persons (e.g. jail inmate)[31] and in some states, changes may only be made once a year.[32]
