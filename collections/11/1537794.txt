The A.V. Club writer Leonard Pierce said "94 Meetings" was a particularly strong episode that focused equally on the show's premise and developing the relationships between characters. He particularly praised Susan Yeagley, but said Tom Haverford was underused, and felt the scenes between Ann and Mark were lacking.[3] New York magazine writer Steve Kandell said it was a fast-paced and funny episode, calling the jokes about the complaining residents "rapid-fire scenes". Kandell criticized Mark, who he said has been resorted to boring "straight-man services", and said he did not mind that Paul Schneider was leaving the series.[1] Kona Gallagher of TV Squad appreciated that the episode reintroduced the fact that Leslie once was in love with Mark, and criticized the show for ignoring that fact all season. Gallagher also criticized the fact that a historic building could so easily be damaged and demolished, which he called unrealistic.[11]
