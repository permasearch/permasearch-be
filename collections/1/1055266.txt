On April 11, 1997, MGM bought Metromedia's film subsidiaries (Orion Pictures, The Samuel Goldwyn Company, and the Motion Picture Corporation of America) for US$573Â million, substantially enlarging its library of films and television series and acquiring additional production capacity.[67] The deal closed in July of that year.[68] This catalog, along with the James Bond franchise, was considered to be MGM's primary asset.[69][70] In the same year, MGM's long-running cable television series, Stargate SG-1, first aired.[71] Kerkorian bought out Seven Network the following year.[72]
