After mating, sheep have a gestation period of about five months,[77] and normal labor takes one to three hours.[78] Although some breeds regularly throw larger litters of lambs, most produce single or twin lambs.[7][79] During or soon after labor, ewes and lambs may be confined to small lambing jugs,[80] small pens designed to aid both careful observation of ewes and to cement the bond between them and their lambs.[16][25]
