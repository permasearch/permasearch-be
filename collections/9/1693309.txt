Each plane carried 60 tonnes of relief materials including foodstuffs, medicines, power generators and tents. Two other aircraft will leave on Monday with 120 tonnes of relief materials, in addition to a field hospital provided by Qatari Red Crescent (QRC) to deliver medical aid to the affected people. The Standing Committee of Emergency, Rescue, Relief and Humanitarian Aid, headed by Lekhwiya, undertook the task of preparing the relief materials and coordinating with the concerned authorities.
