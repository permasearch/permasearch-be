The history of Hawaii describes the era of human settlements in the Hawaiian Islands. That history begins sometime between 124 and 800 CE, with some theories dating the earliest Polynesian settlements to the 10th or even 13th century. Around 1200, Tahitian explorers found and began settling the area.[inconsistent] This began the rise of the Hawaiian civilization. It remained isolated from the rest of the world for another 500 years.
