"I Keep Forgettin' (Every Time You're Near)" (also known as "I Keep Forgettin'") is a song by American singer-songwriter Michael McDonald, from his debut album If That's What It Takes. It was written by McDonald and Ed Sanford. Its similarity to the earlier song "I Keep Forgettin'", by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, recorded by Chuck Jackson, resulted in Leiber and Stoller also being given a songwriting credit.
