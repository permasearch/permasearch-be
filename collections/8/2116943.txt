In 1872, copper ​1⁄4, ​1⁄2, 1 and 5 cents coins dated 1870 were introduced, followed in 1892 by silver 10, 25 and 50 cents. Production of the ​1⁄4 cent ceased in 1904. The large, copper 5 cents coin was replaced in 1909 by a much smaller cupro-nickel coin which was square with rounded corners. In 1919, the fineness of silver used was reduced from .800 to .550.
