Los Angeles has plenty of sunshine throughout the year, with an average of only 35 days with measurable precipitation annually.[73] The coastal region around Los Angeles has a climate that is comparable to coastal areas of southeastern Spain such as Alicante or Elche, in temperature range and variation, in sunshine hours and as well as annual precipitation levels.
