The term 80/20 is only a shorthand for the general principle at work.  In individual cases, the distribution could just as well be, say, nearer to 80/10 or 80/30.  There is no need for the two numbers to add up to the number 100, as they are measures of different things, (e.g., 'number of customers' vs 'amount spent').  However, each case in which they do not add up to 100%, is equivalent to one in which they do. For example, as noted above, the "64/4 law" (in which the two numbers do not add up to 100%) is equivalent to the "80/20 law" (in which they do add up to 100%).  Thus, specifying two percentages independently does not lead to a broader class of distributions than what one gets by specifying the larger one and letting the smaller one be its complement relative to 100%.  Thus, there is only one degree of freedom in the choice of that parameter.
