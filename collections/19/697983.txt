The descendants of the Acadians, expelled during the French and Indian War, are dispersed in the Maritime Provinces of Canada, and in Maine and Louisiana in the United States, with small populations in Ch√©ticamp, Nova Scotia and the Magdalen Islands. Some also went to France.[citation needed] This expulsion has been remembered on July 28 each year since 2003.
