Will finds Tessa and finally allows himself to break down and mourn her death. Tessa then awakens in his arms and reveals that she tricked the Magister into believing that she was dead by changing just before she pretended to stab herself; she changed into a gunshot victim she had previously changed into before with The Dark Sisters, which meant that the woman's blood poured down Tessa's chest, looking like she had wounded herself. The other Shadowhunters return, after killing de Quincey, who laughed at them for mistaking him for The Magister. After Thomas and the others are buried, Tessa thanks Charlotte for her hospitality, but assumes that she is going to be asked to leave. Instead, Charlotte asks Tessa to stay, a request which she accepts. Tessa goes to Will wanting to have a serious relationship after he confirmed his feelings for her in the Sanctuary, but he cruelly says that they will not have any relationship, also pointing out the fact that as a warlock, she is not able to bear children. Tessa is horrified because this is the first time that she has heard this, and runs away from Will. Jem finds and comforts her, saying that although she feels that she is unlovable because she is not human, "the right man would not care," subtly declaring his feelings for her (Jem is completely unaware of the complicated romantic relationship between Tessa and Will). Tessa gratefully accepts Jem's comfort, but does not completely realize the sincerity behind his words. The story concludes with a deeply distressed Will turning up at Magnus Bane's house asking for help.
