Critical reception for Mr. Krabs was positive after the series' debut but has been mixed as the show progressed. Critics have offered praise toward his portrayal as a single father to Pearl but criticized a perceived exaggeration of his greed throughout the series' run. The character has been featured in a variety of merchandise, including plush toys, collectible figures, and video games. He also appears in the 2004 feature film The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie and its 2015 sequel, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water.
