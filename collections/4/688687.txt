East of Yerba Buena Island, the bay to Oakland was spanned by a 10,176-foot (3.102Â km) combination of double cantilever, five long-span through-trusses, and a truss causeway, forming the longest bridge of its kind at the time.[22] The cantilever section was longest in the nation and third-longest anywhere.[28]
