The game is typically initiated with both the players uttering the rhyme "One, two, three, four, I declare a thumb war", passing their thumbs over each other in time with this rhyme.[7] The rhyme is sometimes extended with "Five, six, seven, eight, try to keep your thumb straight." or "Five, six, seven, eight. This should be a piece of cake." [8] In South America, the starting song is "Ã©sta es la pulseada china" ("this is the Chinese arm wrestling"), with the same thumb dance as in English.
