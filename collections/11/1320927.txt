Over the following days, Houthi and allied army forces encircled Aden[173][174] and hemmed in Hadi's holdouts, although they encountered fierce resistance from the embattled president's loyalists and armed city residents. They began pressing into the city center on 29 March despite coalition airstrikes and shelling from Egyptian Navy warships offshore.[175] On 2 April, the compound that has been used as a temporary presidential palace was taken by the Houthis,[176] and fighting moved into the central Crater and Al Mualla districts.[177]
