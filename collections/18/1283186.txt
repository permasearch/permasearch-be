While the original Xbox sold poorly in Japan, selling just 450,000 by November 2011[54], the Xbox 360 sold almost as poorly, selling only 1.5 million units from 2005 to 2011.[36] Edge magazine reported in August 2011 that initially lackluster and subsequently falling sales in Japan, where Microsoft had been unable to make serious inroads into the dominance of domestic rivals Sony and Nintendo, had led to retailers scaling down and in some cases discontinuing sales of the Xbox 360 completely.[55] The significance of Japan's poor sales might be overstated in the media in comparison to overall international sales.[56]
