He much endured on ocean's stormy wave, Intent his followers, and himself to save, In vain:—they perish'd by their guilt undone; Fools! who devour'd the bullocks of the Sun— The God, in vengeance for his cattle slain, In their return destroy'd them on the main. Daughter of Jove! deign thou to us disclose, Celestial Muse, a portion of their woes.
