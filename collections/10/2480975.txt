On 23 October 1991, in the first leg of the second round of the UEFA Cup, Celtic lost 5–1 to Swiss side Neuchâtel Xamax as Egyptian striker Hossam Hassan ran amok against the Celtic defence by scoring four goals,[91][92] one of the worst European defeats in the club's history. In the return leg at Celtic Park, Celtic could only manage a 1–0 victory and crashed out of the tournament 5–2 on aggregate.[93]
