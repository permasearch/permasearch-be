Theoretical models suggest that the CNO cycle is the dominant source of energy in stars whose mass is greater than about 1.3 times that of the Sun.[1] The proton–proton chain is more prominent in stars the mass of the Sun or less. This difference stems from temperature dependency differences between the two reactions; pp-chain reaction starts at temperatures around 7006400000000000000♠4×106 K[2] (4 megakelvins), making it the dominant energy source in smaller stars. A self-maintaining CNO chain starts at approximately 7007150000000000000♠15×106 K, but its energy output rises much more rapidly with increasing temperatures.[1] At approximately 7007170000000000000♠17×106 K, the CNO cycle starts becoming the dominant source of energy.[3] The Sun has a core temperature of around 7007157000000000000♠15.7×106 K, and only 7000170000000000000♠1.7% of 4He nuclei produced in the Sun is born in the CNO cycle. The CNO-I process was independently proposed by Carl von Weizsäcker[4] and Hans Bethe[5] in 1938 and 1939, respectively.
