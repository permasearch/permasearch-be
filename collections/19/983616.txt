Leander has been described as having a strange playing style by Andre Agassi.[60] He varies his play as the match goes on; he is one of the best volleyers and a talented dropshotter.[61] His volleying techniques were learnt from former Indian player Akhtar Ali.[62] He hits a one-handed backhand, which he drives only seldom, preferring instead to slice when returning serve or rallying from his backhand.
