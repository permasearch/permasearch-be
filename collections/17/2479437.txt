In the 1990s, Baltar appears in the Maximum Press comic book series, still pursuing the Galactica, after having been freed by Commander Adama in exchange for bartering his knowledge of the Cylons. Due to licensing issues, his likeness is not based on John Colicos. In the comic, he is more muscular and appears to have cybernetic arms.[citation needed]
