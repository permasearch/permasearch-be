Common side effects include heartburn and a rash.[4] Compared to other NSAIDs it may have fewer side effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding.[5] It increases the risk of heart failure, kidney failure, and liver failure.[4] At low doses, it does not appear to increase the risk of heart attack; however, at higher doses it may.[5] Ibuprofen can also result in worsened asthma.[5] While it is unclear if it is safe in early pregnancy,[4] it appears to be harmful in later pregnancy and therefore is not recommended.[6] Like other NSAIDs, it works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins by decreasing the activity of the enzyme cyclooxygenase.[4] Ibuprofen might be a weaker anti-inflammatory than other NSAIDs.[5]
