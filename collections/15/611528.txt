In addition, Pixar also created a short film titled George & A.J., written and directed by storyboard artist Josh Cooley. This shows what the two Shady Oaks retirement home workers did after Carl left with his house. It was initially available for purchase at the iTunes Store and then was later posted to DisneyÂ·Pixar's Facebook and YouTube pages.[61][62]
