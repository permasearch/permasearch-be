In Patriot Games, Greer comes to Ryan and asks him to rejoin the CIA permanently as an analyst to help track down the terrorists. He declines initially, only to accept it after a failed ULA attack on the Ryans mildly wounds his pregnant wife, but severely injures his daughter outside her school. Later, while Ryan hosts the Prince and Princess of Wales at his waterfront home on Chesapeake Bay, south of Annapolis in Maryland, the IRA conducts another attack against him, which Ryan, the Prince, and close friend, Navy Commander Robert Jackson foil. Following the incident and arrests of the ULA members and Miller (whom Ryan nearly executes with his Browning Hi Power), Ryan is taken to the Naval Academy hospital, where he arrives just in time for the birth of Jack Ryan Jr., his second child.
