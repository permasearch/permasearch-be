The Friday Fast is a Christian practice of abstaining from animal meat on Fridays that is found most frequently in the Eastern Orthodox,[1] Roman Catholic, Anglican and Methodist traditions.[2] According to Pope Peter of Alexandria, the Friday fast is done in commemoration of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ on Good Friday.[1] Abstinence is colloquially referred to as "fasting" although it does not necessarily involve a reduction in the quantity of food.
