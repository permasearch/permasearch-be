Under the teaching of Christoph Willibald Gluck, Maria Antonia developed into a good musician. She learned to play the harp,[13] the harpsichord and the flute. She sang during the family's evening gatherings, as she had a beautiful voice.[17] She also excelled at dancing, had "exquisite" poise, and loved dolls.[18]
