However, on many recently made coats and jackets, the lapel is made without the loop required, which would normally sit on the reverse of the lapel, beneath the buttonhole. Sometimes, the lapel buttonhole is in the "keyhole" shape, as opposed to the traditional straight cut,[3] or is not even pierced through, in which case the boutonniÃ¨re may be pinned onto the jacket lapel, although this may be considered unsightly[1] and continued pinning could eventually damage the cloth or silk facing.
