The original civic robe for the Mayor of Sydney in 1842 was purple, trimmed with ermine and worn with a court dress hat. The current robes worn by the Lord Mayor and Deputy Lord Mayor are black, trimmed with ermine, and worn with bicorne hat, lace jabot and white gloves. They are worn rarely and only at major civic functions.[2] Recently, it has become the custom not to wear the robes.
