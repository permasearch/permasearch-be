Where even the use of surrounding circumstances does not provide "sufficient certainty"[119]—where, that is, there is ambiguity in the narrow sense—and there is still no substantial balance in favour of one meaning over another; where, in other words, the case is one "of 'ambiguity' as opposed to mere 'uncertainty,'"[123][127] then "recourse may be had to what passed between the parties on the subject of the contract."[128] The court may also refer to evidence of the parties' negotiations: the way they acted in carrying the contract out. The court should use outside evidence as conservatively as possible, but use it if necessary to reach what seems to be sufficient certainty as to the meaning.[128] The court is still not allowed, however, to hear evidence as to what the parties subjectively thought the disputed term meant.
