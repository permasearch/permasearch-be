"Eldorado" was set to music by several 19th-century composers, including the Americans Charles Sanford Skilton, Edgar Stillman Kelley, and the British composer Richard Walthew, and for the London choir by Joseph Harold Hinton. In 1993 Eldorado, along with Hymn and Evening Star, was adapted by Jonathan Adams (composer) as Three Songs from Edgar Allan Poe for SATB chorus and piano. The better-known composer John Adams also composed an Eldorado symphony.
