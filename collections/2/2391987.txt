By 1777, the Thirteen Colonies' rebellion was entering its third year. The British General John Burgoyne's surrender at the Battle of Saratoga (October 1777) signalled that the struggle against the American colonies was likely to prove longer and more costly than London had expected. British defeat had raised the prospect of French intervention and of a European war.[13] The British government of Prime Minister Lord North, fearful of war with France, sought reconciliation with the American colonies and was willing to grant a fair measure of autonomy to this end, but what would have been enough in 1775 would no longer suffice by 1778. North had no intention of offering independence, but in the wake of Saratoga and with the prospect of a French alliance, the Americans were unlikely to agree to lesser terms.[14]
