Sonny's attempt to hide in a sea of identical robots is loosely based on a similar scene in "Little Lost Robot".[19] The robot-model designation "NS" was taken from the same story. Sonny's dreams of a Robot Messiah and the final scene of the film, in which he becomes that savior of Robot-kind, resemble similar images in "Robot Dreams". V.I.K.I.'s motivation is an extrapolation of the Three Laws that Asimov explored in "The Evitable Conflict", "Robots and Empire", "Foundation and Earth" and ". . . That Thou Art Mindful of Him", as well as several other stories. The positronic brains of Sonny and his fellow robots first appeared in the story "Catch That Rabbit". Detective Spooner having Robotic prosthetics, due to his injuries in the car crash, alludes to the short story "Segregationist". Sonny's struggle and desire to understand humanity resembles that of the robot protagonist in "The Bicentennial Man".
