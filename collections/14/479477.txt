The importance of the battle to Marines today is demonstrated in pilgrimages made to the island, and specifically the summit of Suribachi.[76] Marines will often leave dog tags, rank insignia, or other tokens at the monuments in homage.[77] Iwo Jima Day is observed annually on 19 February in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts[78] with a ceremony at the State House.
