The theoretical foundations of Odissi trace to the ancient Sanskrit text Natya Shastra, its existence in antiquity evidenced by the dance poses in the sculptures of Odissi Hindu temples,[1][7] and archeological sites related to Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism.[8][9] The Odissi dance tradition declined during the Islamic rule era,[10] and was suppressed under the British Rule.[11][12] The suppression was protested by the Indians, followed by its revival, reconstruction and expansion since India gained independence from the colonial rule.[9]
