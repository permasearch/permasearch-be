Apple Maps uses vector graphics, which allows the application to use less data than competitor Google Maps.[49] The map has four available layers: regular map, satellite view, hybrid view (a combination of regular and satellite view), and public transit view.[22] The main provider of map data is TomTom, but data is also supplied by Automotive Navigation Data, Hexagon AB, Intermap Technologies, OpenStreetMap, and Waze.[50] Apple renewed their agreement with TomTom in 2015.[51] TomTom is the parent company of Tele Atlas, which is also used by Apple Maps' competitor, Google Maps.[19] The satellite imagery comes from DigitalGlobe.[50] iPhones located in China use data from AutoNavi instead.
