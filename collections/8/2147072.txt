With the death of Abdullah, Sultan placed his grandson, Muhammed bin Saqr, as Wali of Sharjah. However, Khalid bin Sultan, a son of Sultan's, disputed his rule and in 1859, Sharjah was divided between the two. Sultan was by now in his dotage and took no active role in the conflict over Sharjah, which was eventually settled when Khalid shot Mohammed and threw his body into a well in the desert in late 1860.[3]
