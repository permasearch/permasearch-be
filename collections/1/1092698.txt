The problem of elucidating the human microbiome is essentially identifying the members of a microbial community which includes bacteria, eukaryotes, and viruses.[10] This is done primarily using DNA-based studies, though RNA, protein and metabolite based studies are also performed.[10][11] DNA-based microbiome studies typically can be categorized as either targeted amplicon studies or more recently shotgun metagenomic studies. The former focuses on specific known marker genes and is primarily informative taxonomically, while the latter is an entire metagenomic approach which can also be used to study the functional potential of the community.[10] One of the challenges that is present in human microbiome studies, but not in other metagenomic studies is to avoid including the host DNA in the study.[12]
