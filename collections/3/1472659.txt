Acquired in 1801, Allahabad asides from its importance as a pilgrimage centre, was a stepping stone to the agrarian track upcountry and the Grand Trunk Road. It also potentially  offered sizeable revenues to the Company. Initial revenue settlements began in 1803.[47] Allahabad was a participant in the 1857 Indian Mutiny,[48] when Maulvi Liaquat Ali unfurled the banner of revolt.[49] During the rebellion, Allahabad, with a number of European troops,[50] was the scene of a massacre.[13]
