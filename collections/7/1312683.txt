The leader of the church is the President of the Church, and church members regard him as a prophet, seer, and revelator. He is often referred to by members of the church as "the Prophet" because the President is thought to hold the same divine calling as biblical prophets. The President's responsibility is primarily over the church as a whole. Church members believe his stewardship also extends to all humanity as the Lord's chosen mouthpiece. He is entitled to guide the church through revelation, acting as God's spokesman. With the death of church president, Thomas S. Monson, on January 2, 2018,[127] there is currently no First Presidency. Consistent with an established pattern, it is anticipated the First Presidency will be reconstituted soon after memorial services are held for Monson.[128]
