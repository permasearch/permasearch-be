Deborah Myers, in the 2007 remake, is the mother of Judith and Michael Myers, as well as the biological mother of Laurie Strode (nÃ©e Angel Myers). She is played by Sheri Moon Zombie. Deborah does not know that her son is mentally unstable, nor that he kills animals as a habit. While working at a strip club, Michael kills her abusive boyfriend, Ronnie, Judith, and Judith's boyfriend, Steve. After this, Michael is put into custody and Deborah later witnesses him attacking and killing a nurse. When she returns home, Deborah commits suicide by shooting herself while watching old home movies of Michael, resulting in Laurie's adoption by the Strodes. Her role in Halloween II is slightly larger than her previous one. In the film, she appears as an apparition with a white horse, and is only seen through Laurie and Michael's visions.
