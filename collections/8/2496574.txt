Media response to "Oh No" was mixed. Rock Sound writer Andy Biddulph claimed that the song's experimental style is "typical of one of the most groundbreaking albums this genre has seen for years",[2] while Eleanor Goodman of Metal Hammer also hailed it as "testament to the band's truly evolutionary spirit".[17] On the other hand, Exclaim! critic Bradley Zorgdrager criticised "Oh No", claiming that it feels "even more misplaced coming after one of the more guitar-driven numbers, 'Blasphemy.'"[4] Reviewing the Royal Albert Hall show for The Independent, Steve Anderson described "Oh No" as "almost Robyn-esque thudding electro", claiming that it "illustrat[ed] what a bizarre journey" the band had taken to that point.[18]
