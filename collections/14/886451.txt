After the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, the map of Bangladesh was removed from the flag as it had difficulty for rendering the map correctly on both sides of the flag. Artist Quamrul Hassan was asked to report on the design, color, shape and explanation. On 17 January 1972, the new design was made the official national flag of Bangladesh.[3]
