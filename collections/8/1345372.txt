Jay (Ed O'Neill) pushes Phil (Ty Burrell) to go out with him and fly his new model plane, a Vought F4U Corsair. While Phil gets his moment with Jay, the encounter does not end up as he wishes: Jay buzzes Phil with the plane and as the credits roll, the model plane crashes into Phil's nose. Jay takes Phil back home and claims that he hit him by accident but Claire (Julie Bowen) does not believe him and makes him apologize to Phil.
