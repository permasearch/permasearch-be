The New Apostolic Church sees itself as the re-established worker of salvation and continuation of the first Apostolic Church, thus constituting the only true church established by Jesus Christ. New Apostolic Christians believe in the Triune God: God the Father, the Creator of the world; the Son, Jesus Christ the Son of Man, personified God, redeemer and Head of the Church; and the Holy Spirit, who guides the church by His revelations, gives knowledge to the believers and acts universally. In this, NAC hardly differs from other Trinitarian churches.
