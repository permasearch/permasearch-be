The cathedral borders the main plaza of the old and well-preserved city. Legend has it that the remains of the apostle James were brought to Galicia for burial. In 813, according to medieval legend, the light of a bright star guided a shepherd who was watching his flock at night to the burial site in Santiago de Compostela.[1] This site was originally called Mount Libredon and it's physical topography leads prevalent sea borne winds to clear the cloud deck immediately overhead.[2][citation needed] The shepherd quickly reported his discovery to the bishop of Iria, Bishop Teodomiro.[3] The bishop declared that the remains were those of the apostle James and immediately notified King Alfonso II in Oviedo.[3] To honour St. James, the cathedral was built on the spot where his remains were said to have been found. The legend, which included numerous miraculous events, enabled the Catholic faithful to bolster support for their stronghold in northern Spain during the Christian crusades against the Moors, but also led to the growth and development of the city.[4]
