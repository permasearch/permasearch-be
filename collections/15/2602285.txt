Prior to the release of the television series, an original tie-in novel taking place in 2255, one year prior to the pilot, was announced. The novel titled Star Trek Discovery: Desperate Hours sees Burnham face the challenge needed in being a first officer upon recent promotion. The synopsis describes Burnham's journey as "To save thousands of innocent lives, Burnham must infiltrate the alien ship. But to do so she needs to face the truth of her troubled past, and seek the aid of a man she has tried to avoid her entire lifeâ€”until now."[50] She also works with her foster brother Spock, who visits the Shenzhou along with Captain Pike.[51]
