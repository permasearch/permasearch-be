In music, a diminished triad ( Play (help·info)), also known as the minor flatted fifth (m♭5), is a triad consisting of two minor thirds  above the root — if built on C, a diminished triad would have a C, an E♭ and a G♭.[3] It resembles a minor triad with a lowered (flattened) fifth. It can be represented by the integer notation {0, 3, 6}.
