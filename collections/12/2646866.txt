Abortion is legal in all U.S. states, and every state has at least one abortion clinic.[58][59] However, various states have laws on abortion, some of which refer to it as feticide. On March 6, 2006, South Dakota Governor Mike Rounds signed into law a pro-life statute that made performing abortions a felony, which was subsequently repealed in a November 7, 2006, referendum.[60] On February 27, 2006, Mississippi's House Public Health Committee voted to approve a ban on abortion, and that bill died after the House and Senate failed to agree on compromise legislation.[61] Several states have enacted "trigger laws" which "would take effect if Roe v. Wade is overturned".[62] North Dakota HB 1572 or the Personhood of Children Act, which passed the North Dakota House of Representatives on February 18, 2009, but was later defeated in the North Dakota Senate, aimed to allocate rights to "the pre-born, partially born", and if passed, would likely have been used to challenge Roe v. Wade.[63] On February 15, 2012, the Virginia House of Delegates passed House Bill 1 in a vote of 66-32, that effectively outlaws all Virginia abortions by declaring that the rights of persons apply from the moment sperm and egg unite. It also passed a second bill in a 63-36 vote, that requires women to have a transvaginal ultrasound before undergoing abortions.[64]
