The consort of the President of the Philippines bears the gender-neutral title of First Spouse (Filipino: Unang Kabiyák), and among other duties, is host(ess) of Malacañan Palace. The title is genderless as many Philippine languages lack grammatical gender, and because there have been presidential consorts of both sexes.
