In the valleys a dense coniferous forest is dominated by various species of spruce, pine and fir. Living up to its name, the wilderness is prime grizzly bear habitat and has some of the most dense populations of the species anywhere in the lower 48 states. Black bears are more common however and there is a sizable number of black bears that are cinnamon colored here, which are often mistaken for grizzlies. Other mammals found in the wilderness include lynx, wolverine, mule deer, elk, moose, mountain goat, and bighorn sheep. There are few lakes in the wilderness, but over 500 miles (800Â km) of named streams and rivers.
