CRA regulations give community groups the right to comment on or protest banks' purported non-compliance with CRA.[7] Such comments could help or hinder banks' planned expansions. Groups at first only slowly took advantage of these rights.[40] Regulatory changes during the Clinton administration allowed these community groups better access to CRA information and enabled them to increase their activities.[4][35][97]
