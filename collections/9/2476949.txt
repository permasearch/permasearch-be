Founded in 1999,[1] the BrainPop websites display animated, curriculum-based content that supports educators and are intended to be fun and motivational for students to watch.[5][6] The sites' movies cover the subjects of science, social studies, English, mathematics, engineering & technology, health, and arts and music. Since 2007, the movies have been closed captioned. The sites also access a wide variety of educational games. BrainPop is used in more than 25% of U.S. schools[3] and in many schools outside the U.S., as well as by parents, homeschoolers and others.[7] The company was founded by Avraham Kadar, M.D., an immunologist and pediatrician, to explain medical concepts to his young patients using animation.[8][9] As of 2011, BrainPop hosted more than 11 million unique visits each month, from thousands of schools and individuals worldwide.[9] BrainPop uses an in-house team of educators, animators and writers to produce and continually update the sites, incorporating teacher and parent input.[8][10]
