Texas is the only state besides Oklahoma to have a bifurcated appellate system at the highest level.[5] The Texas Supreme Court hears appeals involving civil matters, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals hears appeals involving criminal matters.[5] Sometimes, the dividing line is murky, especially with respect to jurisdiction in mandamus and habeas corpus cases. See, e.g. Justice Willet's dissent in In re Reece, 341 S.W.3d 360 (Tex. 2011) (orig. proceeding).[6] Unlike its counterpart in Oklahoma, the Texas Supreme Court is not really supreme when it comes to a jurisdictional ping-pong or tug-of-war between the two high courts because both are co-equal.
