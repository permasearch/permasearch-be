Extensive economic improvements took place during the Japanese South Pacific Mandate of 1914 to 1945. The island was practically run by a few missionaries who converted the population; Willard Price, when he visited in the 1930s, reported that the island had no jail, there had been no murders in sixty years, and alcohol and tobacco were unheard of.[11] The island was fortified by the Japanese during World War II, but no battles occurred on Kosrae. The Japanese garrison commanded by Lieutenant-General Yoshikazu Harada consisted of 3,811 IJA men including a company of tanks and 700 IJA men.[12] Tunnel bunkers that have multiple entrances were dug into the island's interior peaks and most can still be explored today.
