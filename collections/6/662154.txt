The Rams remained solid contenders in the 1970s, winning seven straight NFC West championships between 1973 and 1979. Though a strong team, the Rams lost the first four conference championship games they played in that decade, twice to Minnesota (1974, 1976) and twice to Dallas (1975, 1978) and failed to win a Super Bowl.[14]
