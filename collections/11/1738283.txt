The bill amends Section 5 of the Marriage Act to define marriage in Australia as the union of "2 people".[143] It also removes the ban on overseas same-sex marriages being recognised in Australia, including ones that occurred before the expected law change.[144] Additionally, the bill includes protections for religious celebrants, ministers of religion and bodies established for a religious purpose, to not be obligated to perform or provide services and facilities to marriages they objected to.[143] The bill passed the Senate by 43 votes to 12 on 29 November 2017. Several amendments to the bill proposed by conservative Coalition MPs, designed to increase protections and exemptions offered to individuals and businesses opposed to same-sex marriage, were defeated.[145][146][147] The bill passed the House of Representatives without amendment on 7 December 2017.[148][149] The bill then received royal assent from the Governor-General on 8 December 2017, becoming a formal Act of Parliament.[150] It went into effect on 9 December 2017.[2] Same-sex marriages lawfully entered into overseas became recognised from that date,[2] and the first weddings under the amended law occurred (after the normal one-month waiting period) from 9 January 2018.[151][152][153] Within a week of the legislation's passing, at least one same-sex couple, married under the laws of another country, had applied for a divorce.[154] Several same-sex couples successfully applied for an exemption from the one-month waiting period between completing a notice of intended marriage form and the wedding ceremony,[155] and the first legal same-sex wedding under Australian law was held on 15 December 2017, with further weddings occurring the following day.[156][157][158]
