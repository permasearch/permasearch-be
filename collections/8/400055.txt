Without propulsive power and on emergency electric power, the ship "shifted position only by means of inertia and the rudders"[33] and continued north from Le Scole until well past Giglio Porto.[34] Captain Schettino has said various instruments were not functioning.[35] Reports differ whether the ship listed to port soon after the impact and when she began listing to starboard.[36][37] At 22:10, the vessel turned south. The vessel was then listing to starboard, initially by about 20°, coming to rest by 22:44[38] at Punta del Gabbianara in about 20 metres[39] of water at an angle of heel of about 70°. Captain Schettino attributes the final grounding of the ship at Punta del Gabbianara to his own effort to manoeuvre the ship there.[40] In contrast, on 3 February, the chief of the Italian Coast Guard testified that the final grounding of the ship at Punta del Gabbianara may not have been related to any attempts to manoeuvre the ship[41] and the ship may have drifted simply due to the prevailing winds that night.[42]
