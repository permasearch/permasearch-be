The songs instrumental was described by Rap-Up as a "bouncy piano-laced beat".[4] DJBooth.net described the beat as "soft keyboard chords that transition well into the hook where a low bass and snare set the pace for Sean's first verse."[5] Sean revealed he originally rejected the beat but gave it a chance after pressurings by the song's producer No I.D.. The song's melody is sampled from the 1988 New Edition hit "Can You Stand the Rain".[6]
