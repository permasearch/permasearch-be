Reviewing for Den of Geek, Delia Harrington gave the premiere a rating of 3/5. She opined that Roy's inclusion in the season made his "moving sendoff" with Thea from last season feel "cheap" and that she remained "cautious" about the flashforward structure, but said that the episode was "solid" nonetheless. She concluded, "The Arrow Season 7 premier manages to both wipe the slate clean and nod in the direction of the show's early glory."[49] IGN's Jesse Schedeen wrote, "Arrow's Season 7 premiere kicks off the most significant status quo change in the series' history. Some of these sweeping changes are already working in the show's favor." He gave the episode a rating of 7.1/10, adding, "Arrow's seventh season has a promising start, though the premiere drags whenever Oliver Queen isn't the focus."[50] Both Chancellor Agard of Entertainment Weekly and Allison Shoemaker of The A.V. Club gave the premiere a "B" grade and noted a comparison to ABC's Lost, with Agard praising Amell and Rickards' performances.[51][52] Shoemaker explained that the episode "revisits a lot of familiar territory, but it breaks new ground for Arrow while having its priorities in precisely the right place. It’s the beginning of a new era for Arrow, and whether you credit this episode’s success to either focus or flash-forwards, it’s a promising start."[52]
