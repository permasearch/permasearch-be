Many methods have been developed for influencing the stereoselectivity of the Diels–Alder reaction, such as the use of chiral auxiliaries, catalysis by chiral Lewis acids,[39] and small organic molecule catalysts.[5] Evans' oxazolidinones,[40] oxazaborolidines,[41][42][43] bis-oxazoline–copper chelates,[44] imidazoline catalysis,[45] and many other methodologies exist for effecting diastereo- and enantioselective Diels-Alder Reactions.
