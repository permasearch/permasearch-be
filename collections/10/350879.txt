The executive branch is headed by an elected mayor, who serves as the chief executive of both the city and Marion County. Joe Hogsett, a Democrat, is the 49th and current mayor of Indianapolis. The mayor appoints deputy mayors, department heads, and members of various boards and commissions. The City-County Council of Indianapolis and Marion County is the legislative body and consists of 25 members, all of whom represent geographic districts. The council has the exclusive power to adopt budgets, levy taxes, and make appropriations. It can also enact, repeal, or amend ordinances, and make appointments to certain boards and commissions. The city's annual budget is $1.1 billion.[240] The judicial branch consists of a circuit court, a superior court with four divisions and 32 judges, and a small claims court.[3] The three branches, along with most local government departments, are based in the City-County Building.
