Churches were not commonly furnished with permanent pews before the Protestant Reformation.[2] The rise of the sermon as a central act of Christian worship, especially in Protestantism, made the pew a standard item of church furniture.[3] Hence the use or avoidance of pews could be used as a test of the high or low character of a Protestant church: describing a mid-19th century conflict between Henry Edward Manning and Archdeacon Hare, Lytton Strachey remarks with characteristic irony, "Manning had been removing the high pews from the church in Brighton, and putting in open benches in their place. Everyone knew what that meant; everyone knew that the high pew was one of the bulwarks of Protestantism, and that an open bench had upon it the taint of Rome".[4]
