[       ╲    m  r ╲      ]     {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}^{\diagdown }m_{r\diagdown }\end{bmatrix}}}   and       [       ╲    k  r ╲      ]     {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}^{\diagdown }k_{r\diagdown }\end{bmatrix}}}   are diagonal matrices that contain the modal mass and stiffness values for each one of the modes. (Note: Since the eigenvectors (mode shapes) can be arbitrarily scaled, the orthogonality properties are often used to scale the eigenvectors so the modal mass value for each mode is equal to 1. The modal mass matrix is therefore an identity matrix)
