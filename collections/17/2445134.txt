There are two main types of firefighter: wholetime and retained. Wholetime firefighters work full-time in the fire service. Retained firefighters are on call for long periods (at least 70 hours a week) to respond to incidents.[44] They are paid a salary for the time they spend on call and a greater amount for each incident they respond to, on average 2 or 3 per week. Many have jobs outside of the fire service. Large town fire stations have wholetime crews, while small rural ones are usually staffed only by retained firefighters. Voluntary firefighters are now rare: the only voluntary units now in operation are the Peterborough Volunteer Fire Brigade[45] and the Borth Voluntary Fire Unit (near Aberystwyth, Wales).[46]
