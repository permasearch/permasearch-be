The actors in the film were chosen by a team of crewmen headed by the casting director Chris Feihofer.[2] Gary Tunnicliffe wanted Doug Bradley to reprise his role as the lead cenobite known as Pinhead[9] but Bradley refused, criticizing Dimension Films for the perceived quality of the Hellraiser sequels. After Tunnicliffe pleaded with him, Bradley again declined to accept the role after he learned that he would have to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to obtain the screenplay.[28] The NDA was meant as a countermeasure, to avoid Doug publicly disparaging the script should he dislike it. The NDA was not tailored specifically for Bradley, but was rather a template re-used from another film with all of the titles replaced with "Hellraiser: Judgment".[26] In an interview with Bloody-Disgusting, Bradley addressed the topic, saying "I’m not really in a position to comment on Judgment, having been prevented from reading the script. For the moment I only have Gary [Tunnicliffe]’s comments to go by. He certainly talks a good game: let's wait for the proof of the pudding. It's depressing that, as with Revelations, this again seems to be happening to save Dimension from losing the franchise rights."[30] Tunnicliffe alleged that Dimension Films had suggested that he himself play the role after previously depicting Pinhead in the fan film No More Souls, but Tunnicliffe declined in fear of fan backlash.[26] Paul T. Taylor was later cast in the role of Pinhead, with Tunnicliffe playing the Auditor. He described Taylor as "a classically trained stage and film actor who brings a great physical presence and more than a hint of Peter Cushing and Ralph Fiennes." In addition, it was announced that Mike Jay Regan would reprise his role as the Chatterer from the previous films, with Heather Langenkamp also portraying a character in the film.[5]
