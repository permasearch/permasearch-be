After the News International phone hacking scandal in 2011, there are ongoing discussions about amending the law to define "smart" phones (i.e. those with Internet browsers and other connectivity features) as computers under the Act. This amendment may also introduce a new offence of making information available with intent, i.e. publicly disclosing a password for someone's phone or computer so that others can access it illegally.[14]
