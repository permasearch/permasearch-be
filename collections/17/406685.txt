This album was included among a group of 15 DualDisc releases that were test marketed in two cities: Boston and Seattle. The test market DualDisc version of the album is rare. In 2005 the DualDisc version was reissued in a more widely distributed version. The original test market version differs from this common version in both packaging elements and in the design of the back of the inlay card.
