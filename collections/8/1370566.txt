The Legend of Korra was co-created and produced by Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino (together referred to as "Bryke" by fans,[26] in reference to "shipping" naming conventions) at Nickelodeon Animation Studios in Burbank, California. To illustrate the length of the production process (about 10 to 12 months per episode)[27] and the overlap of the various phases, Konietzko wrote in July 2013 that their team was already developing the storyboards for the first episode of Book 4 while the last episodes of Book 2 were not yet finished.[28]
