The new version of the song was recorded on February 1, 2010, in a session lasting 14 hours.[7] Eighty-five musicians were reportedly involved in the song's recording,[8] which was held in the same place as the original, at Henson Recording Studio on La Brea Avenue in Los Angeles, California.[9] Also similar to the 1985 process, some of the participating musicians were already in Los Angeles to attend an awards ceremony: the 52nd Grammy Awards.[10] Jones said of the recording session, "It was a big challenge. It takes a serious army and serious emotional architecture. I've never seen such a diverse group of people, and they came for the right reasons."[7] The recording process brought together diverse artists, with the oldest being 83-year-old Tony Bennett and the youngest being 9-year-old Ethan Bortnick.[11][12]
