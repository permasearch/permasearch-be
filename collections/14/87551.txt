The positive reviews continued through the rest of the season. Of Tabitha and Napoleon's "Scars" routine about angry clowns, Lythgoe called the piece "stunning" and Michaels described it as "hip-hop theater".[149] After the episode aired, Dance Spirit magazine wrote "Tabitha and Napoleon are on FIRE this season!"[150] The Los Angeles Times echoed this comment stating that season seven had been "Nappytabs' best season".[151] On the Top 3 performance episode, after their "Power" routine danced by eventual champion Lauren Froderman and "All-Star" tWitch, Michaels commented "Nappytabs what a season you have had, my God. It's been like home run after home run after home run..."[152] Shankman echoed this comment on the finale by calling Tabitha and Napoleon "the MVPs of the season".[153] Four of their routines—"Fallin'", "Scars", "Battle for the Beat", and "My Chick Bad"—were chosen as "Judges' Favorite" during the season seven finale broadcast.[154] Due to an injury sustained by Alex Wong, "Outta Your Mind" was not picked as a judge's favorite. Instead, it was performed by tWitch and special guest Ellen DeGeneres as a tribute to Alex just before Lauren Froderman was declared the winner of season seven.[154]
