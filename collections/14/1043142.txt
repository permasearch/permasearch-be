Chinese corporate statutes mandate that domestic and foreign internet companies doing business in Mainland China cooperate with its Great Firewall efforts.  Companies are responsible for the content that they put on their websites as well as the content that users post on their website. This helps China promote self-censorship, making their censoring job less difficult, and allowing them to keep being a state that licenses all their media.[52]
