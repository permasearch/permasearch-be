Goodnight Vienna followed in 1974 and was also successful, reaching number eight in the US and number 30 in the UK.[135] Featuring musical contributions from Lennon, Elton John and Harry Nilsson, the album included a cover of the Platters' "Only You (And You Alone)", which peaked at number six in the US and number 28 in the UK, and Hoyt Axton's "No No Song", which was a US number three and Starr's seventh consecutive top-ten hit.[136] The John-written "Snookeroo" failed to chart in the UK, however, when issued there as the second single from the album.[137] During this period Starr became romantically involved with Lynsey de Paul.[138] He played tambourine on a song she wrote and produced for Vera Lynn, "Don't You Remember When", and he inspired another De Paul song, "If I Don't Get You the Next One Will", which she described as being about revenge after he missed a dinner appointment with her because he was asleep in his office.[138]
