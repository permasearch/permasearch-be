In 2015, McDonald’s met further controversy around Mexican stereotypes when it attempted to promote its McBurrito in Mexico. The advertisement was a picture of the burrito with the words, “Tamales are a thing of the past. McBurrito Mexicana also comes wrapped.” The ad was revealed just a day after la Día de la Candelaria, a holiday many celebrate with eating tamales, a traditional Mexican dish eaten during most holidays. The Tex-Mex burrito was perceived by many as an insult to one of Mexico's most traditional and popular meals.[11]
