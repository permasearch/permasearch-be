Swelling, deformity, tenderness, and loss of wrist motion are normal features on examination of a person with a distal radius fracture.  "Dinner fork" deformity of the wrist is caused by dorsal displacement of the carpal bones (Colle's fracture). Reverse deformity is seen in volar angulation (Smith's fracture). The wrist may be radially deviated due to shortening of the radius bone.[4] Examination should also rule out a skin wound which might suggest an open fracture, usually at the side.[4] Tenderness at an area with no obvious deformity may still point to underlying fractures. Decreased sensation over the thenar eminence can be due to median nerve injury. Swelling and displacement can cause compression on the median nerve which results in acute carpal tunnel syndrome and requires prompt treatment.  Very rarely, pressure on the muscle components of the hand or forearm is sufficient to create a compartment syndrome.[4]
