The liturgical communities in western Christianity that derive their rituals from the Roman Missal, including those particular communities which use the Roman Missal itself (Roman Catholics), the Book of Common Prayer (Anglicans and Episcopalians), Evangelical Lutheran Worship (Evangelical Lutheran Church in America), Lutheran Service Book (Lutheran Churchâ€“Missouri Synod), and The United Methodist Book of Worship (The United Methodist Church), use the Apostles' Creed and interrogative forms of it in their rites of Baptism, which they consider to be the sacrament of initiation into the Church.
