Womack interprets the lyric to "Fixing a Hole" as "the speaker's search for identity among the crowd", in particular the "quests for consciousness and connection" that differentiate individuals from society as a whole.[137] MacDonald characterises it as a "distracted and introverted track", during which McCartney forgoes his "usual smooth design" in favour of "something more preoccupied".[140] He cites Harrison's electric guitar solo as serving the track well, capturing its mood by conveying detachment.[140] Womack notes McCartney's adaptation of the lyric "a hole in the roof where the rain leaks in" from Elvis Presley's "We're Gonna Move".[141] The song deals with McCartney's desire to let his mind wander freely and to express his creativity without the burden of self-conscious insecurities.[142][nb 18]
