Afterward, Churchill told a huge crowd in Whitehall: "This is your victory." The people shouted: "No, it is yours", and Churchill then conducted them in the singing of "Land of Hope and Glory". In the evening he made another broadcast to the nation asserting the defeat of Japan in the coming months.[428] The Japanese surrendered on 15 August 1945.

The plan was rejected by the British Chiefs of Staff Committee as militarily unfeasible.[429]
