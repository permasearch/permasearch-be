The third Experience single, "The Wind Cries Mary" backed by "Highway Chile", was released in the UK on May 5, 1967, while "Purple Haze" occupied the number three spot in the charts.[130] The management's decision to release the single while the previous one was still present in the UK charts was unorthodox, as was the choice of "The Wind Cries Mary", which differed greatly from "Purple Haze".[130] Stamp recalled: "We did that on purposeÂ ... We wanted musically to show who this person was."[130] Egan wrote: "It alerted the public to the fact that the so-called Wild Man of Borneo was capable of songs of delicacy and sensitivity."[117] "The Wind Cries Mary" reached number six in the UK in May.[41]
