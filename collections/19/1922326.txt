Hours after successfully killing General Shepherd, Price and a critically wounded Soap evacuate with Nikolai to a Russian loyalist safe-house in Himachal Pradesh, but soon encounter enemy forces sent by Makarov to kill them. They are extracted from the region with the help of Yuri, a man with a common grudge against Makarov. Meanwhile, an American four-man Delta Force team, call-signed Metal, manages to repel Russian Forces in New York City by blowing up the Russian spectrum jamming tower on top of the Wall Street Stock Exchange and hijacking an Oscar II-class submarine to launch cruise missiles at the Russian Navy, forcing an emergency withdrawal from the East Coast by the Russians.
