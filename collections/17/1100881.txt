FRPA and the HOEA require students sign a release before their student records will be provided to third parties (e.g.: to parents and employers tec.). This legislation does allow schools, however, to release information without student approval for the purpose of institutional audit, evaluation, or study, student aid consideration, institutional accreditation, compliance with legal subpoenas or juvenile justice system officers[104] or in order to comply with laws requiring identification of sex offenders on campus.[26] Institutions may also disclose information to student guardians if the student is declared a dependant for tax purposes (FERPA).
