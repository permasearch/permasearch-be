A large number of Christians lived in the northern part of the peninsula (it was part of the so-called "Manchurian revival")[30] where Confucian influence was not as strong as in the south.[9] Before 1948 Pyongyang was an important Christian centre: one-sixth of its population of about 300,000 people were converts. Following the establishment of the communist regime in the north, an estimated more than one million Korean Christians resettled to South Korea to escape persecution by North Korea's anti-Christian policies.[10]
