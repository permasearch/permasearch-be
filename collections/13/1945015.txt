Water expands as it heats and contracts as it cools. A water-loop hydronic system must have one or more expansion tanks in the system to accommodate this varying volume of the working fluid. These tanks often use a rubber diaphragm pressurised with compressed air. The expansion tank accommodates the expanded water by further air compression and helps maintain a roughly constant pressure in the system across the expected change in fluid volume. Simple cisterns open to atmospheric pressure are also used.
