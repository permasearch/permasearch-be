Charles, Prince of Wales was appointed a Knight of the Order of Australia (AK) on 14 March 1981.  As he is the heir to the Australian throne but not an Australian citizen, this would have required the award to be honorary.  To overcome this issue, his appointment was created by amendment to the constitution of the Order of Australia by special letters patent signed by the Queen, on the recommendation of Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser.[31]
