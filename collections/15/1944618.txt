Anaphylactoid reactions occur rarely,[3][4][5] but can occur in response to injected as well as oral and rectal contrast and even retrograde pyelography. They are similar in presentation to anaphylactic reactions, but are not caused by an IgE-mediated immune response. Patients with a history of contrast reactions, however, are at increased risk of anaphylactoid reactions.[6][7] Pretreatment with corticosteroids has been shown to decrease the incidence of adverse reactions.[8][9]
