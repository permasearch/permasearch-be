The record-setting ball was consigned to an auction house on August 21.[131] Bidding began on August 28 and closed with a winning bid of US$752,467 on September 15 after a three phase online auction.[132] The high bidder, fashion designer Marc Ecko, created a website to let fans decide its fate.[133] Subsequently,[134] Ben Padnos, who submitted the (US) $186,750 winning bid on Bonds's record-tying 755th home run ball also set up a website to let fans decide its fate.[135] Of Ecko's plans, Bonds said "He spent $750,000 on the ball and that's what he's doing with it? What he's doing is stupid."[136] 10 million voters helped Ecko decide to brand the ball with an asterisk and send it to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.[137] Padnos sold 5-year ads on a website, www.endthedebate.com, where people voted by a two-to-one margin to smash the ball.[138]
