Regulations governing shareholder resolutions vary from country to country. In the United States, they are determined primarily by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates mutual funds and applies the 1940 Act[28] and by the Department of Labor, which regulates certain plans and applies ERISA.[29]
