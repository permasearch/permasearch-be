The Samcor corporate logo was oval-shaped, similar to the Ford logo. Initially, both monochrome and colour versions were used. The colour version consisted of three horizontal bands of orange, white and blue with "SAMCOR" on the middle band. These were the main colours used on the old South African national flag pre-1994. After the introduction of the new national flag, the colour logo was dropped and only the monochrome version used.
