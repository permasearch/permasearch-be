Dixon's first job was at Ladbrokes,[9] although she aspired to become a PE teacher after leaving college.[9] After completing a diploma course in sports studies,[9] she had planned to take up a place at Loughborough University,[10] but whilst at dance classes in London she was approached by a talent scout from a production company.[11] Whilst travelling back home on the train she was approached by another scout who was forming a group and asked if she was interested.[11]
