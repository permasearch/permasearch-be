The points classification is the third oldest of the currently awarded jersey classifications.[75] It was introduced in the 1953 Tour de France and was first won by Fritz Sch√§r. The classification was added to draw the participation of the sprinters as well as celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Tour. Points are given to the first 15 riders to finish a stage, with an additional set of points given to the first 15 riders to cross a pre-determined 'sprint' point during the route of each stage.  The point classification leader green jersey is worn by the rider who at the start of each stage, has the greatest number of points.[76]
