Currently in Cambodia, there are professional, institutional, and governmental motivations for both teaching and learning English as a foreign language.[20] Results from studies on Cambodia show that the ability to speak English is an important component required to transform the standard of life for the people of Cambodia. The reason for this is that the people who are able to communicate in English are ones that are more likely to have opportunities to find better occupations with higher pay, as it is used to communicate with international businesses and organizations.[20]
