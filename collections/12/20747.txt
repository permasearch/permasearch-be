Lithium naturally only occurs in traces in biological systems and has no known biological role, but does have effects on the body when ingested.[217] Lithium carbonate is used as a mood stabiliser in psychiatry to treat bipolar disorder (manic-depression) in daily doses of about 0.5 to 2Â grams, although there are side-effects.[217] Excessive ingestion of lithium causes drowsiness, slurred speech and vomiting, among other symptoms,[217] and poisons the central nervous system,[217] which is dangerous as the required dosage of lithium to treat bipolar disorder is only slightly lower than the toxic dosage.[217][218] Its biochemistry, the way it is handled by the human body and studies using rats and goats suggest that it is an essential trace element, although the natural biological function of lithium in humans has yet to be identified.[219][220]
