The vanilloid receptor (VR-1, TRPV1) is a receptor that is found on the free nerve endings of both C and Aδ fibers that responds to elevated levels of heat (>43 °C) and the chemical capsaicin.[9] Capsaicin activates C fibers by opening a ligand-gated ion channel and causing an action potential to occur.[9] Because this receptor responds to both capsaicin and heat, chili peppers are sensed as hot.[9] VR-1 is also able to respond to extracellular acidification and can integrate simultaneous exposure to all three sensory stimuli.[10] VR1 is essential for the inflammatory sensitization to noxious thermal stimuli.[10] A second type of receptor, a vanilloid-like receptor (TRPV2,VRL-1), has a higher threshold of activation regarding heat of about 52 °C and also responds to capsaicin and low pH.[1] Both types of receptors are transmembrane receptors that are closed during resting conditions.[1] When open, these receptors allow for an influx of sodium and calcium which initiates an action potential across the fibers.[1] Both receptors are part of a larger family of receptors called transient receptor potential (TRP) receptors.[1] If damage to these heat transducer receptors occurs, the result can be chronic neuropathic pain caused by lowering the heat pain threshold for their phosphorylation.[8][11]
