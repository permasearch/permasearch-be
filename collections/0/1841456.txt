The Department of Justice reached a settlement of its lawsuit on November 12, 2013. The settlement will require the merged airline to give up landing slots or gates in 7 major airports.[21] Under the deal, the new American is required to sell 104 slots at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and 34 slots at LaGuardia Airport.  An additional requirement is that American sell two gates at O'Hare International Airport, Los Angeles International Airport, Logan International Airport, Dallas Love Field and Miami International Airport.[22]  Some of the slots will be sold to low-cost carriers such as JetBlue and Southwest Airlines.[23]
