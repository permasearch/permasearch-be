No music video was shot for the song, and it received no televised performances as part of promotion. However, the song was used as the promotional musical backdrop for the coverage of the 2013 NBA Playoffs and was used by  lager company Budweiser as part of their global "Made For Music" campaign co-starring Jay-Z. The song was also remixed by mash-up artist DJ Earworm.
