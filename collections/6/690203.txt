Executive producer Allan McKeown fell out with Jimmy Nail during filming, as he felt his ego was out of control at this time and would often ask for his lines to be changed. In his autobiography, Nail said he was glad to be done with filming not just because of Holton's death but he felt the second series lacked the gritty edge of the first series, which is something Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais later said they agreed with. On the audio commentary for series two, Clement said the series was much more contrived in getting and keeping the gang together, and La Frenais said he felt the gang weren't trapped together enough like they were in Germany in the hut. In particular, he felt the Spanish episodes were too luxurious for the gang, and instead of sleeping rough, having arguments, and clashing with the Spanish locals, they spent far too much time just walking around in summer clothes and chilling out, and a few of the characters had their partners tagging along, which made the show much less edgy.
