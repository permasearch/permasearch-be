On 17 November 1988 Kaqusha Jashari and Azem Vllasi were forced to resign from the leadership of the League of Communists of Kosovo (LCK).[83][84][85] In early 1989 the Serbian Assembly proposed amendments to the Constitution of Serbia that would remove the word "Socialist" from the Serbian Republic's title, establish multi-party elections, remove the independence of institutions of the autonomous provinces such as Kosovo and rename Kosovo as the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija.[86][87] In February Kosovar Albanians demonstrated in large numbers against the proposal, emboldened by striking miners.[85][88] Serbs in Belgrade protested against the Kosovo Albanian's separatism.[89] On 3 March 1989 the Presidency of Yugoslavia imposed special measures assigning responsibility for public security to the federal government.[88] On 23 March the Assembly of Kosovo voted to accept the proposed amendments although most Albanian delegates abstained.[88] In early 1990 Kosovar Albanians held mass demonstrations against the special measures, which were lifted on 18 April 1990 and responsibility for public security was again assigned to Serbia.[88][90]
