Aston Villa currently hold the record number of league goals scored by any team in the English top flight; 128 goals were scored in the 1930â€“31 season, one more than Arsenal who won the league that season for the very first time, with Villa runners-up.[77] Villa legend Archie Hunter became the first player to score in every round of the FA Cup in Villa's victorious 1887 campaign. Villa's longest unbeaten home run in the FA Cup spanned 13 years and 19 games, from 1888 to 1901.[78]
