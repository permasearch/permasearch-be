Whittier spent the last few winters of his life, from 1876 to 1892, at Oak Knoll, the home of his cousins in Danvers, Massachusetts.[19] Whittier spent the summer of 1892 at the home of a cousin in Hampton Falls, New Hampshire, where he wrote his last poem (a tribute to Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.) and where he was captured in a final photograph.[20] He died at this home on September 7, 1892,[21] and was buried in Amesbury, Massachusetts.[22]
