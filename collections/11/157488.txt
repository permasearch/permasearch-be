The Latitude D531 was also available, being the cheapest Latitude available at the time due to using AMD processors and cutting back on a few features. It was essentially a D830 with no PC Card slot, no trackpoint, an option for a 14" screen (If this was chosen it would have a similar wider bezel as on the earlier D5xx series machines), an AMD-based motherboard. DVD Drives, Screen Assemblies (If the laptop was ordered with the 15" screen), RAM, and Hard Drives/Caddies were interchangeable.
