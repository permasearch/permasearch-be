University of Southern Mississippi professor, Dr. Suzanne Mckee-Waddell[14] conceptualized the idea of digital composition. It is the ability to integrate multiple forms of communication technologies and research to create a better understanding of a topic. In order to reach this result, an individual must use intellectual and practical skills. Digital technology impacted the way educators teach in the classroom. Educators turn to technology to stay up to date with current events. With the use in technology rising over the past decade, educators are not eliminating the traditional foundation in education, but merely enhancing it with digital literacy through a variety of curriculums. There are several platforms created for different purposes. For writing tools, Google Docs have allowed students to work together on projects. Prezi is a website that allows individuals to create presentations with more of a creative twist. Easybib allows individuals to cite any source through a generation in any given format. Educators have even turned to social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Edmodo, and even Instagram to communicate and share ideas with one another. New standards have been put into place as digital technology has augmented classrooms. As technology evolves, so does the learner. Digital composition keeps educators and students connected through modern teaching techniques.
