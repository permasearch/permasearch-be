Presided over by Judge Julius Hoffman (no relation to Hoffman, about which he joked throughout the trial[20]), Abbie Hoffman's courtroom antics frequently grabbed the headlines; one day, defendants Hoffman and Rubin appeared in court dressed in judicial robes, while on another day, Hoffman was sworn in as a witness with his hand giving the finger. Judge Hoffman became the favorite courtroom target of the Chicago Seven defendants, who frequently would insult the judge to his face.[21] Abbie Hoffman told Judge Hoffman "you are a 'shande fur de Goyim' [disgrace in front of the gentiles]. You would have served Hitler better." He later added that "your idea of justice is the only obscenity in the room."[21]  Both Davis and Rubin told the Judge "this court is bullshit."  When Hoffman was asked in what state he resided, he replied the "state of mind of my brothers and sisters".
