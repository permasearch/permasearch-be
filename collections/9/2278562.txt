In his 2011 State of the Union address, President Barack Obama set the goal for the U.S. to become the first country to have one million electric vehicles on the road by 2015.[16] Considering the actual slow rate of PEV sales, since mid-2012 several industry observers have concluded that this goal is unattainable.[17][18][19] In January 2016, with only about 40% of Obama's goal achieved by the end of 2015, Secretary of Energy, Ernest Moniz, said that the one million goal may not be reached until 2020.[20] Industry analysts forecast that the goal could be achieved in 2018.[21][22] Cumulative plug-in sales achieved the 500,000 unit milestone in August 2016.[21] The Governor of California, Jerry Brown, issued an executive order in March 2012 that established the goal of getting 1.5 million zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) on California roads by 2025.[23][24][25] In September 2014, the Charge Ahead California Initiative set the additional goal to have at least 1 million zero-emission vehicles and near-zero-emission vehicles in California by January 1, 2023.[26]
