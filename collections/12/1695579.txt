The decimal numeral system (also called base-ten positional numeral system, and occasionally called denary) is the standard system for denoting integer and non-integer numbers. It is the extension to non-integer numbers of the Hinduâ€“Arabic numeral system.[1] The way of denoting numbers in the decimal system is often referred to as Decimal notation.[2]
