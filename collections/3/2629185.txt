The French word conscience generally means "conscience", "consciousness", "awareness",[2] or "perception".[3] Commentators and translators of Durkheim disagree on which is most appropriate, or whether the translation should depend on the context.  Some prefer to treat the word 'conscience' as an untranslatable foreign word or technical term, without its normal English meaning.[4] In general, it does not refer to the specifically moral conscience, but to a shared understanding of social norms.[5]
