Prior to Sony's involvement, the game was pitched to Microsoft, which rejected it for its themes of child abduction.[13] At E3 2006, developer Quantic Dream revealed Heavy Rain: The Casting, a technology demonstration running on the PlayStation 3.[14] It was created in less than three months, including the game engine, script, casting, motion capture, and R&D. The demonstration, though not intended for the public eye, made its appearance at Sony's behest.[15] Impressed with the actress involved, writer and director David Cage gave AurÃ©lie Bancilhon the part of Lauren Winter.[12][16]
