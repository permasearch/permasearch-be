To maintain control and improve administration, various schemes to divide the work of the Roman Emperor by sharing it between individuals were tried between 286 and 324, from 337 to 350, from 364 to 392, and again between 395 and 480. Although the administrative subdivisions varied, they generally involved a division of labour between East and West. Each division was a form of power-sharing (or even job-sharing), for the ultimate imperium was not divisible and therefore the empire remained legally one stateâ€”although the co-emperors often saw each other as rivals or enemies.
