Ibn Rushd's full, transliterated Arabic name is "ʾAbū l-Walīd Muḥammad Ibn ʾAḥmad Ibn Rushd".[2][3] Sometimes, the nickname al-Hafid ("The Grandson") is appended to his name, to distinguish him from his similarly-named grandfather, a famous judge and jurist.[4] "Averroes" is the Medieval Latin form of "Ibn Rushd"; it was derived from the Spanish pronunciation of the original Arabic name, wherein "Ibn" becomes "Aben" or "Aven".[5] The Latinized name is also spelled in some instances as "Averroës", "Averrhoës" or "Averroès", with varying accents to denote that the "o" and "e" are separate vowels and not an "œ" digraph.[6] Other forms of the name include "Ibin-Ros-din", "Filius Rosadis", "Ibn-Rusid", "Ben-Raxid", "Ibn-Ruschod", "Den-Resched", "Aben-Rassad", "Aben-Rasd", "Aben-Rust", "Avenrosdy", "Avenryz", "Adveroys", "Benroist", "Avenroyth" and "Averroysta".[7]
