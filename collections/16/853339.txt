Further critiques have emerged from feminist, constructionist and discourse-analytical sources.[132][133][134] Key to these is the issue of power.[133][135] In this regard there is a concern that clients are persuaded—both inside and outside the consulting room—to understand themselves and their difficulties in ways that are consistent with therapeutic ideas.[121][133] This means that alternative ideas (e.g., feminist,[136] economic,[137] spiritual[138]) are sometimes implicitly undermined.[139] Critics suggest that we idealize the situation when we think of therapy only as a helping relationship—arguing instead that it is fundamentally a political practice, in that some cultural ideas and practices are supported while others are undermined or disqualified, and that while it is seldom intended, the therapist–client relationship always participates in society's power relations and political dynamics.[121][140][141] A noted academic who espoused this criticism was Michel Foucault.[142][143][144]
