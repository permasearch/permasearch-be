The very phrase "every sperm is sacred" has become almost proverbial in the field of animal[4] and human sexuality and reproduction.[5] This extends to such areas as cloning, where the song is used to criticize anti-cloning activists who argue that every embryo or fertilized egg is sacred.[6] Pro-choice activists have sung the song outside abortion clinics to ridicule their opponents,[7] legal scholars have alluded to it in discussions of women's reproductive rights,[8] and it is used generally to do what has been described as "[exposing] the absurdity of the anti-choice argument when taken to its extreme."[9]
