The programme has had three main theme tunes, the first similar to the original theme for the BBC's Saturday Kitchen Live. The theme tune has been modified on several occasions since the launch during revamps but until 2011 had remained similar to the original theme. In January 2011, a new upbeat theme tune was introduced in a retro jazzy 1960s style.
