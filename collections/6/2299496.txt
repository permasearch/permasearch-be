Texas Woman's University in Denton, Texas has a replica which was purchased from the Louvre and shipped from Paris in 1982. This replica is actually a replacement of the original 1929 replica given to commemorate Armistice Day and the defeat of autocracy.[28]  A replica of the statue sits overlooking the Veterans area of the Skylawn Memorial Park in San Mateo, California.[29]
