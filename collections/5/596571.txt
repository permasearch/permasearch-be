In the Senate, a revised version of the BBL, known as the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region Law (Senate Bill No. 2894[11]), was presented on August 11, 2015[12] after lengthy deliberations on the BBL in the Committee on Local Government,[12] and was due for interpellation on August 17, 2015.[13] Due to the length and complexity of the bill, however, the Senate temporarily deferred the period of interpellation for the bill.[14] The 16th Congress went on recess without passing the bill on February 2, 2016.[15]
