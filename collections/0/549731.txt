Many scholars, such as O'Rourke, gather from the writing of Shakespeare that Antonio is gay and in a relationship with Bassanio. Lines by Antonio such as "my person … lie[s] all unlocked to your occasions," (MOV 1.1.146) seem to allude to a sexual dimension in Antonio's love for Bassanio. However, there is also evidence that the two shared a strictly fraternal, familial bond, as indicated by the line "Bassanio, your most noble kinsman …" (MOV 1.1.60) Other scholars maintain that all attempts to read Shakespeare's characters as gay or straight in terms of the modern understanding of the word are culturally and historically flawed.
