Earlier, Hawkeye had been irritated with B.J. for his apparent inability to say "goodbye" as the two would probably never see each other again. Just before B.J. rides off for the last time, he says to Hawkeye that though he will try to find him once they get back to the states, he left Hawkeye a note just in case. The chopper takes off and as it gains altitude, Hawkeye sees that B.J. has arranged a large number of stones to read "GOODBYE" on the helipad. Upon seeing that, he smiles, knowing that B.J. was capable of saying goodbye after all, and the chopper flies away from what is left of the 4077th for the last time. The original theme song "Suicide is Painless" (from the 1970 film) is then played in its entirety.
