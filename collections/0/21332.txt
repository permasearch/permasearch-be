Since the codec, operating at 5.6 kbit/s, requires half the bandwidth of the Full Rate codec, network capacity for voice traffic is doubled, at the expense of audio quality. It is recommended to use this codec when the battery is low as it may consume up to 30% less energy[citation needed]. The sampling rate is 8Â kHz with resolution 13 bit, frame length 160 samples (20 ms) and subframe length 40 samples (5 ms).
