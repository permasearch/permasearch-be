There are two alternative ways to earn an NCARB Certificate, the Broadly Experienced Architect (BEA) and the Broadly Experienced Foreign Architect (BEFA) programs. Earning an NCARB Certificate through one of these alternatives is not accepted by all jurisdictions. Architects interested in earning the NCARB Certificate through one of these programs should verify acceptance with the jurisdiction in which they wish to be licensed prior to pursuing certification.[8]
