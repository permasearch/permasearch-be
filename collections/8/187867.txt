The Chinook tribe, which is not federally recognized, who live near the lower Columbia River, call it Wimahl in the Chinookan language,[45] and it is Nch’i-Wàna to the Sahaptin-speaking peoples of its middle course in present-day Washington.[46] The river is known as swah'netk'qhu by the Sinixt people, who live in the area of the Arrow Lakes in the river's upper reaches in Canada.[47] All three terms essentially mean "the big river".
