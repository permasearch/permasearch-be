There are many local pubs (izakaya) and cafes that serve Okinawan cuisine and dishes, such as goya champuru (bitter melon stir fry), fu champuru (wheat gluten chanpuru), and tonkatsu (tenderized, breaded, fried pork cutlet). Okinawan soba is the signature dish and consists of wheat noodles served hot in a soup, usually with pork (rib or pork belly). This contrasts with the mainland soba, which is buckwheat noodles. Rafute, which is braised pork belly, is another popular Okinawan dish. American presence on the island has also led to some creative dishes such as taco rice, which is now a common meal served in bentos, and common use of spam.
