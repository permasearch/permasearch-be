Note: An alternate ending was shown after a rerun on October 15, 2016, which features Super President Kickbutt announcing the new protectors of Hiddenville: The Thundermans. Most importantly, she promotes the addition of Phoebe and Max as "The Thunder Twins", causing an argument to break out between them on who would be whose sidekick.
