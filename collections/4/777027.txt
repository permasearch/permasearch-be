Chess Records, run by brothers Leonard and Phil Chess, was probably the most famous of the Chicago record labels to feature or promote the blues.[5] Musician and critic Cub Koda even described Chess Records as "America's greatest blues label." It was active from 1950â€“1969 when the brothers sold the company. Most solo artists also did double duty as session musicians on the records of others.
