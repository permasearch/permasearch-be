After 2003, front-row tickets to their sold-out concerts in the US were scalped for US$500.[38] The group responded by reducing the number of seats sold per transaction, in order to keep prices down and avoid further tickets scalping.[115] In 2008, the group found themselves in the midst of what The Daily Telegraph called a "ticketing scandal";[115] scalpers tried to sell a A$19 ticket on eBay for almost A$2,000 and a set of three tickets for A$315 for concerts in Melbourne, and a group of three tickets to a Wiggles UNICEF charity concert in Sydney had a price tag of A$510. The tickets were taken off eBay and voided.[115]
