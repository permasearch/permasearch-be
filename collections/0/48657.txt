The Louisiana Purchase Treaty was signed on 30 April by Robert Livingston, James Monroe, and Barb√© Marbois in Paris. Jefferson announced the treaty to the American people on July 4. After the signing of the Louisiana Purchase agreement in 1803, Livingston made this famous statement, "We have lived long, but this is the noblest work of our whole lives... From this day the United States take their place among the powers of the first rank."[36]
