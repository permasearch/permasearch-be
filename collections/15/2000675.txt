Detectives Winters and Jaruszalski investigate when a woman who is four months pregnant is hit by a car. They learn that Rebecca Townley (Rebecca Mader) was having an affair with US Congressman Thomas Nelson (John Hickey), and in order to prevent his wife finding out, was living with his employee, Adam Yarborough (Rob Benedict). The detectives soon discover that Nelson's wife, a seriously ill cancer patient, paid Rebecca's ex-husband, Robert Forrester (Michael Mosley) to kill Rebecca after she discovered her husband's deceit.
