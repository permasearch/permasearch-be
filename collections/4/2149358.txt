Although the ride has three trains, only two are in use at any time. The third train will usually be in "rehab" and will be switched out with one of the other trains during the duration of the year. Each train is usually rehabbed during the year. After the 2016 refurbishment, the trains were replaced with Great Coasters International's Millennium Flyer trains.
