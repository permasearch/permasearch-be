The film's found footage technique received near-universal praise by many and, though not the first to employ it, has been declared a milestone in film history due to its critical and box office success.[58] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a total of four stars, and called it "an extraordinarily effective horror film".[48] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called it "a groundbreaker in fright that reinvents scary for the new millennium".[59] Todd McCarthy of Variety said, "An intensely imaginative piece of conceptual filmmaking that also delivers the goods as a dread-drenched horror movie, The Blair Witch Project puts a clever modern twist on the universal fear of the dark and things that go bump in the night."[60] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave a grade of "B", saying, "As a horror picture, the film may not be much more than a cheeky game, a novelty with the cool, blurry look of an avant-garde artifact. But as a manifestation of multimedia synergy, it's pretty spooky."[61]
