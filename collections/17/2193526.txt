Bacteria have developed several ways of killing phagocytes.[107] These include cytolysins, which form pores in the phagocyte's cell membranes, streptolysins and leukocidins, which  cause neutrophils' granules to rupture and release toxic substances,[113][114] and  exotoxins that reduce the supply of a phagocyte's ATP, needed for phagocytosis. After a bacterium is ingested, it may kill the phagocyte by releasing toxins that travel through the phagosome or phagolysosome membrane to target other parts of the cell.[100]
