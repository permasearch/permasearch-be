Don Crump, Don Giffin, and Steve Stavro were named executors of Ballard's estate.[76] Stavro succeeded Ballard as chairman of Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. and governor of the Maple Leafs.[77] Cliff Fletcher was hired by Giffin to be the new general manager, although this was opposed by Stavro, who told Fletcher that he wanted to install his own man.[78] Fletcher immediately set about building a competitive club by hiring Pat Burns as the new coach, and by making a series of trades and free agent acquisitions, such as acquiring Doug Gilmour and Dave Andreychuk, which turned the Leafs into a contender.[79] Assisted by stellar goaltending from minor league call-up Felix Potvin, the team posted a then-franchise-record 99 points, and the eighth-best overall record in the NHL.
