In November 1988, Dalí entered the hospital with heart failure; a pacemaker had been implanted previously. On 5 December 1988, he was visited by King Juan Carlos, who confessed that he had always been a serious devotee of Dalí.[88] Dalí gave the king a drawing, Head of Europa, which would turn out to be Dalí's final drawing.
