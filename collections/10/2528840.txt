Most clinical officers first acquire a basic Diploma in Clinical Medicine and Surgery (or Community Health) before enrolling for the degree, although this is not a requirement. High School graduates are also enrolled directly into the programme which lasts at least four years. Graduates must then complete an internship year before they are registered as qualified clinical officers.
