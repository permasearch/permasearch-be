Archaeologists have identified thirteen ballcourts for playing the Mesoamerican ballgame in Chichen Itza,[50] but the Great Ball Court about 150 metres (490 ft) to the north-west of the Castillo is by far the most impressive. It is the largest and best preserved ball court in ancient Mesoamerica.[42] It measures 168 by 70 metres (551 by 230 ft).[51]
