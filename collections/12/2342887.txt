One unsuccessful attempt to modify UHMWPE was by blending the powder with carbon fibres. This reinforced UHMWPE was released clinically as "Poly Two" by Zimmer in the 1970s.[1] The carbon fibres had poor compatibility with the UHMWPE matrix and its clinical performance was inferior to virgin UHMWPE.[1]
