Ken is born and raised in Coronation Street, Weatherfield, Lancashire, on 9 October 1939. He is the eldest son born to Frank (Frank Pemberton) and Ida Barlow (Noel Dyson). An intelligent pupil, Ken attends grammar school after passing his 11-plus exam and in 1957 wins a university scholarship; he lives with his parents and brother David (Alan Rothwell) in Weatherfield while studying and gains a second class honours degree in History and English. Being educated and politically minded, Ken differs from his family and neighbours. This is a source of friction between Ken and his father Frank, who believes Ken is trying to distance himself from his working-class roots. When Ken writes a scathing newspaper article about his uneducated neighbours in Weatherfield, Frank and the community are outraged. In 1961, Ken's mother dies in a motor accident. Ken turns down a teaching post to support his father but he and Frank continue to clash until Frank leaves in 1964. David and Frank's deaths, in 1970 and 1975 respectively, leave Ken as the sole surviving Barlow.
