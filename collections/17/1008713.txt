Pickering was born in Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire. He was first attracted to acting aged 8 when he saw an audition sign for The Sound of Music and said to his father "I wouldn't mind doing that." Although he did not get the part, he was keen to get involved, and joined the National Youth Music Theatre.[1] When he was 12, one of the theatre's directors, Jeremy James Taylor, put him forward for the part of Young Masbath in Sleepy Hollow, directed by Tim Burton.[1] He also attended South Hunsley Secondary School.
