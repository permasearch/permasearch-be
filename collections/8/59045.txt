In 2009, reports speculated that Brown would reprise the role again on The Bold and the Beautiful,[9] which was followed by more rumors speculating a return to The Young and the Restless.[10] "I actually got a call from [B&B head writer and executive producer] Brad Bell a while back asking if I'd be interested in coming back, and I said, 'Sure!' The thing with daytime is that the storylines are [written] so far in advance, you just never know when [you might be needed]," Brown said at the time.[10] When asked where her alter-ego may be "hiding out", Brown said: "I am still getting healthy from my car accident. Right now, Sheila is hiding out in North Carolinaâ€”playing golf. But don't worry: Sheila always comes back!"[10]
