The school housed about 450 students. For three school years, these students attended Compton Elementary (K-2) and Austell Intermediate (3-5). The new Clarkdale Elementary opened in mid-August 2012 near Cooper Middle School (although the Federal Emergency Management Agency declared the original site acceptable[9]), while the previous building awaited demolition, a delay which the local neighborhood complained about.
