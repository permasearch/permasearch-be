Reaction from groups have been mixed. The journal Leonardo noted some feminists' negative reaction to her design; though males were identifying with their feminine side through Croft, she reinforced unrealistic ideals about the female body.[196] Australian feminist scholar Germaine Greer criticised her as an embodiment of male fantasies.[197] In 1996 Electronic Gaming Monthly argued that rather than altering the state of women in games, Croft simply continued the trend of female characters in video games being large-breasted and scantily clad in an effort to appeal to the predominately male gaming audience, which had the overall impact of teaching gamers to see women as sex objects.[198] PlayStation Magazine staff commented that Croft could be seen as either a role model for young independent girls or the embodiment of a male adolescent fantasy,[199] though they later stated that the character does little to attract female demographics and was obviously designed with a male audience in mind.[99] The editors also criticised Core Design's hypocritical attempts to downplay the character's sex appeal in public statements while releasing advertisements that prominently featured Lara Croft's sexuality.[68] Graphic artist Heather Gibson attributed the "sexism" to participation from Eidos's marketing department.[12]
