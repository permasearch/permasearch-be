Meanwhile, Native American tribes debated whether to continue the war or sue for peace while they had the advantage.  A grand council was called, and several nations met at the confluence of the Auglaize and Maumee Rivers.[19] Alexander McKee represented British interests and arrived in late September.  For a week in October, pro-war factions, especially Simon Girty, the Shawnee, and Miami, debated moderate factions, especially the Six Nations represented by Cornplanter and Red Jacket.[20]  The Council agreed that the Ohio River must remain the boundary of the United States, that the forts in the Ohio Country must be destroyed, and that they would meet with the United States at the Lower Sandusky River in Spring 1793.[21] [Note 2]
