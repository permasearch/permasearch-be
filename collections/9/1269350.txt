The next day, America's Care Package was delivered, with Scott winning the power of choosing the type of Veto to be played for this week. He had the choice of the Diamond Power of Veto, which would allow the holder to veto a nominee and also choose the replacement nominee, the Boomerang Power of Veto, which allows the holder to veto both of the nominees on the block, and the Double Power of Veto, which puts two vetos up for grabs, meaning that there would be two Power of Veto holders.
