Barely escaping with his life, Henry reaches Talmberg and warns its lord, Sir Divish, and his friend, Sir Hanush of Leipa, of the attack on Skalitz. Sir Divish and Hanush take pity on Henry after his ordeal, and later are greeted by the Skalitz survivors, led by Sir Radzig, who have snuck out during a storm. Henry is devastated by the fact his parents have not been properly buried, and sneaks out of Talmberg against Sir Divish's orders back to Skalitz. Henry swears revenge on the man who murdered his parents, but is immediately outnumbered and defeated by a group of bandits and their leader, who also takes with him the commissioned sword. Henry is rescued by another Skalitz girl, Theresa, and Talmberg's Captain Robard, who finishes burying Henry's parents and safely transports him to the town of Rattay.
