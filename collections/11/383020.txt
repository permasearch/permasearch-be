Horses have a great sense of balance, due partly to their ability to feel their footing and partly to highly developed proprioceptionâ€”the unconscious sense of where the body and limbs are at all times.[75] A horse's sense of touch is well developed. The most sensitive areas are around the eyes, ears, and nose.[76] Horses are able to sense contact as subtle as an insect landing anywhere on the body.[77]
