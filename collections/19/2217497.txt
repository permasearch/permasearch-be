38 Spesh and Kool G Rap first worked together in 2014 when they released the DJ Premier-produced cut entitled "The Meeting," which is also featured on this album. They would not finish their entire project however, until 2018. The project was first announced by 38 Spesh on social media on April 1, 2018.[2] A digital soft release of Son of G Rap occurred on July 6, 2018 as a limited release on websites Bandcamp, YouTube and Hip Hop DX[3], but a worldwide release is scheduled for July 20, 2018[4] which will include all major streaming sites as well as physical platorms. The project features vocals from 38 Spesh on all 15 tracks and vocals from Kool G Rap on 9 songs. Considered an homage to the impact Kool G Rap has made on the culture of Hip Hop and a passing of the torch to the younger artist 38 Spesh, the style of the album is East Coast Hip Hop[5]
