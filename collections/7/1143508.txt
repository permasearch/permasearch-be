In 2015 illegal deforestation of the Amazon was on the rise again for the first time in decades, this was largely a result of consumer demand for products like palm oil.[17] As consumer pressure increases, Brazilian farmers clear their land to make more space for crops like palm oil, and soy [18] Also studies done by Greenpeace showed that 300 billion tons of carbon, 40 times the emissions from fossil fuels released into the atmosphere annually by deforestation.[19] In addition to the carbon release associated with deforestation, NASA has estimated that if deforestation levels proceed, the remaining worlds forests will disappear in about 100 years.[19] The Brazilian government adopted a program called RED (United Nations Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation Program) in order to help prevent deforestation.[20] The RED program has helped more than 44 countries across Africa with the development of education programs and has donated more than 117 million to the program.[20]
