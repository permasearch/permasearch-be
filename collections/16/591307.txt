The base XL was the "work truck" trim level of the F-Series Super Duty. Its standard features included a manual transmission, an AM/FM stereo with two front door-mounted speakers, a heater and blower, vinyl-trimmed seating surfaces with bench seats, steel wheels with black center hubs, black front and rear bumpers, a black "egg-crate" front grille, and manual windows and door locks. Optional features that were offered on this trim level included cloth-trimmed seating surfaces or vinyl-and-cloth-trimmed seating surfaces, power windows and door locks, an AM/FM stereo with cassette player (later, a single-disc CD player instead of a cassette player) and four speakers, chrome front and rear bumpers as part of an XL Decor Group, an automatic transmission, and air conditioning.
