A few engineering proposals have been made for such direct air capture, but work in this area is still in its infancy.[29][30] A pilot plant has operated in British Columbia, Canada since 2015. An economic study of this plant in 2018 estimated the cost at US$94-$232 per tonne of atmospheric CO2 removed. This estimate has decreased compared to a 2011 study that estimated that direct air capture would cost $600 per tonne.[31]
