Since July 2010, UK publisher Cinebook has been publishing English language editions of ValÃ©rian. These began at a rate of one volume every six months. However, as the cinematic release of Luc Besson's film Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets approached, the rate increased to one every three months.[44] Fourteen volumes had been published by the end of 2016.
