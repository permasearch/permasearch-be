Music & Media wrote about the song: "It's that contrast between the superbly sophisticated cover of the Lover Speaks' 1986 soul hit and the weird intermezzo of talking and hysterical laughing that makes it so irresistible. At the playlist meeting of Metro Radio Group/Newcastle it grew on the attendants after a few spins. Recalls head of music Liz Elliott, "Because she mostly only cuts original material, at first nobody realised it was a cover. Then we all admitted how cleverly she has adjusted the song to her own style."[21]
