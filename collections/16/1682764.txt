The passenger cabins (or capsules) are mounted on the wheel's outboard rim and are individually rotated by electric motors to smoothly maintain a horizontal cabin floor throughout each full rotation.[13] Preliminary designs anticipated 32 passenger cabins, each with a 40-passenger capacity[14] â€”with the final design accommodating 28 40-person cabins and a total capacity of 1,120 passengers.[7][15]
