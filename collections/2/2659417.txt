The cartoon revolves around the eponymous "Salad Fingers", a thin, green, mentally troubled being who inhabits a desolate world with three lifeless, scruffy finger puppets. The first seven episodes of Salad Fingers were shown back-to-back in Australia at the 2007 Sydney Underground Film Festival at the Factory Theatre, along with a variety of other animated short films, during the "Re-Animation" session.[5]
