Cannabis has been illegal since it was added to the country's Confidential Restricted List in 1923 under the Narcotics Drug Act Amendment Bill after a vague reference to a "new drug" during a late night session of the House of Commons on 23 April 1923.[14] According to one government official, cannabis was outlawed after the Director of the Federal Division of Narcotic Control returned from League of Nations meetings where the international control of cannabis was broached.[15]:49 Cannabis did not begin to attract official attention in Canada until the later 1930s, and even then it was minimal;[15]:51 the first seizure of cannabis by Canadian police was not until 1937.[15]:48 Commercial cultivation of industrial hemp was forbidden in 1938.[16] Between 1946 and 1961, cannabis accounted for only 2% of all drug arrests in Canada.[15]:112
