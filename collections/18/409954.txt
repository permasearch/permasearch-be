As of 2014[update], the country has only two rail links, one a 75 km line from Kheyrabad to the Uzbekistan border and the other a 10 km long line from Toraghundi to the Turkmenistan border. Both lines are used for freight only and there is no passenger service as of yet. There are various proposals for the construction of additional rail lines in the country.[170] In 2013, the presidents of Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan attended the groundbreaking ceremony for a 225 km line between Turkmenistan-Andkhvoy-Mazar-i-Sharif-Kheyrabad. The line will link at Kheyrabad with the existing line to the Uzbekistan border.[171] Plans exist for a rail line from Kabul to the eastern border town of Torkham, where it will connect with Pakistan Railways.[172] There are also plans to finish a rail line between Khaf, Iran and Herat, Afghanistan.[173]
