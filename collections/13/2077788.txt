Pietersen's Achilles injury began flared up ahead of England's first Twenty20 match, against the Netherlands not long after.[193] In Pietersen's absence, England incurred a historic loss against the Dutch.[194] He returned for the second match against Pakistan and top scored with 58 off 38 balls and hit 3 sixes (one of which was measured at over 100m) in the 48 run victory,[195] he also top scored in the three run win over India later in the competition.[196] Despite missing the first match Pietersen ended the tournament as England's leading runscorer with 154 at an average of 38.50.[197]
