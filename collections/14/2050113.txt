The common house martin was first described by Linnaeus in his Systema Naturae in 1758 as Hirundo urbica,[2] but was placed in its current genus, Delichon, by Thomas Horsfield and Frederic Moore in 1854.[3] Delichon is an anagram of the Ancient Greek term χελιδών (chelīdōn), meaning "swallow",[4] and the species name urbicum (urbica until 2004, due to a misunderstanding of Latin grammar) means "of the town" in Latin.[5]
