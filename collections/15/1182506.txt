The current Carlton guernsey is plain navy blue, emblazoned with a white CFC monogram (which stands for "Carlton Football Club") on the front, and white numbers on the back. Other than changes to the font of the monogram, this has been Carlton's guernsey continually since 1909.[19] The club has worn navy blue in its uniform since 1871, when colour of the team's caps was changed from orange/yellow.[20] The club's on-and-off field apparel have been manufactured by Nike since 1998.[21][22]
