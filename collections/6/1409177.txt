Metolachlor is a popular herbicide in the United States.[3]   As originally formulated metolachlor was applied as a racemate, a 1:1 mixture of the (S)- and (R)-stereoisomers. The (R)-enantiomer is inactive, and modern production methods afford only (S)-metolachlor, thus current application rates are far lower than original formulations.
