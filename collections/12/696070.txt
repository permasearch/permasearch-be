where       [    M    ]   ,   {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}},}         [    C    ]   ,   {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}C\end{bmatrix}},}   and       [    K    ]     {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix}}}   are symmetric matrices referred respectively as the mass, damping, and stiffness matrices. The matrices are NxN square matrices where N is the number of degrees of freedom of the system.
