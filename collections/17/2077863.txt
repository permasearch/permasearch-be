West German's Eintracht Frankfurt stood between West Ham and a cup final appearance. In the first-leg in West Germany, Frankfurt played their reserve goalkeeper, Peter Kunter, a part-time player who is also a dentist. He was beaten after only nine minutes by Graham Paddon's 30 yards (27 m) shot. Frankfurt scored two goals through Willi Neuberger and Wolfgang Kraus to take a 2–1 lead to London.[21] West Ham won 3–1 in the home leg. Two from Trevor Brooking and one from Keith Robson were enough to give the tie 4–3 to West Ham with a goal for Frankfurt's Klaus Beverungen. Goalkeeper Mervyn Day won particular praise from the manager for his saves in the first half.[21]
