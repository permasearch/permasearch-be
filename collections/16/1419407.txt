In November 2013, Josh Stanley said that Charlotte's web was 0.5% THC and 17% CBD,[19] and that it "is as legal as other hemp products already sold in stores across Utah, including other oils, clothing and hand creams, but is illegal, federally, to take across state lines."[78] The legalities of selling the product to people who transport it across state lines is complicated, with difficulties for both the sellers and transporters. Regardless of state laws in Colorado and Utah which would allow the practice, it is still a Federal offense to transport hemp products across state lines.[79][80] In September 2014, the content was measured at 0.3% THC.[81]
