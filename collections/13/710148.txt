All in Together Now was never signed to a record label. See, me, GZA, and ODB had a crew called FOI: Force of the Imperial Master, nah mean? We made a song, called "All in Together Now", which became famous on tapes throughout Brooklyn, Downtown Staten Island, New York, all the way down to Miami. I remember Biz Markie, when he was famous and I wasn't famous, and he was like: "Yo! I heard that shit! Your song with Ason Unique and The Specialist." I was the Scientist. So we never got signed as a group back then. We never had a serious record deal under that title.[11]
