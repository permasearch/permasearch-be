On May 5, Good Magic entered the 2018 Kentucky Derby, going off as the sixth betting choice at odds of 9.7-1 in a field of 20. The favorite was Justify, winner of the Santa Anita Derby. The track was muddy after exceptionally heavy rain throughout the day so the start was seen as critical. Good Magic broke well and settled a few lengths behind a fast early pace set by Promises Fulfilled and Justify. As they rounded the final turn, Promises Fulfilled dropped back while Good Magic shifted to the outside and started to make up ground on Justify. He closed to within a length and a half at the top of the stretch before Justify again pulled away, eventually winning by two-and-a-half lengths. Good Magic tired in the final strides but still hung on for second against a fast closing Audible.[22][23]
