There is a debate going on regarding who to include in the "Written by" field. According to the template, only the "primary writers" are included. The disagreement is over whether to include "story by" credits as well. I know what my personal feelings on the matter are (see Talk:Arrow (TV series)#Written by credit for that specific discussion), but what is the overall belief when it comes to using this template?  BIGNOLE  (Contact me) 03:42, 6 October 2012 (UTC)
