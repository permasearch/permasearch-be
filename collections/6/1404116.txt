Coyotes are presently the most abundant livestock predators in western North America, causing the majority of sheep, goat, and cattle losses.[143] For example, according to the National Agricultural Statistics Service, coyotes were responsible for 60.5% of the 224,000 sheep deaths attributed to predation in 2004.[144] The total number of sheep deaths in 2004 comprised 2.22% of the total sheep and lamb population in the United States,[145] which, according to the National Agricultural Statistics Service USDA report, totaled 4.66 million and 7.80 million heads respectively as of July 1, 2005.[146] Because coyote populations are typically many times greater and more widely distributed than those of wolves, coyotes cause more overall predation losses. The United States government agents routinely shoot, poison, trap, and kill about 90,000 coyotes each year to protect livestock.[147] An Idaho census taken in 2005 showed that individual coyotes were 5% as likely to attack livestock as individual wolves.[148]
