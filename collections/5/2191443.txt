One of the first priorities of the Duke of Bourbon was to find a bride for the King, to assure the continuity of the monarchy, and especially to prevent the succession to the throne of the Orleans branch of the family, the rivals of his branch.[21] The 21-year-old Marie Leszczyńska, daughter of Stanisław I, the deposed king of Poland, was chosen. The marriage was celebrated in September 1725 when the king was 15. Between 1727 and 1737, she gave the king ten children, eight girls and two boys, of whom one survived: the Dauphin Louis (1729-1765) The birth of a long-awaited heir, which ensured the survival of the dynasty for the first time since 1712, was welcomed with celebration in all spheres of French society. In 1747 the Dauphin married Maria Josephina of Saxony, who gave birth to the last three Kings of France: Louis XVI, Louis XVIII, and Charles X.[22]
