Islamic democracy is a political ideology that seeks to apply Islamic principles to public policy within a democratic framework. Islamic political theory specifies three basic features of an Islamic democracy: leaders must be elected by the people, subject to sharia and committed to practicing "shura", a special form of consultation practiced by Muhammad, which one can find in various hadiths, with their community.[1] Countries which fulfill the three basic features include Afghanistan, Iran, and Malaysia. Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are examples of countries that do adhere to the principles of Islamic democracy. The expression of Islamic democracy is different in the Muslim majority countries, as sharia interpretations vary from country to country, and the use of sharia is more comprehensive in countries in which sharia forms the basis for state laws.
