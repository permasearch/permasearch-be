Tim Conrad, a mid-level financial analyst at a Los Angeles equity firm, comes up with a way to get wealthy Swiss businessman Martin Mueller as a client. Impressed by Tim's ingenuity, his boss Lance Fender says Tim is a candidate for a promotion but wants to get to know him better. He invites him to a "dinner for winners" in which he must find and bring an eccentric person with a special talent; the winner earns a trophy and the executive that brought him or her gets glory. Tim deduces that it is more of a "dinner for idiots" rather than winners, and the partygoers will be mocked.
