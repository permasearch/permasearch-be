After Jimmy denies Dandy’s request to join the troupe, Gloria, with the intent of consoling her son, mistakes a demented, serial killer clown, named Twisty (John Carroll Lynch) (the one responsible for the recent crimes that have plagued the town), as a stray circus performer and brings him back to surprise Dandy as his playmate. When Dandy peeks in Twisty's belongings, however, the latter knocks him down and runs away back to his dwelling in the woods, where he has several kidnapped children for his plans, which consist of winning their attention back from the freaks by keeping them "safe" from their parents. Dandy follows Twisty and forms an allegiance with him after discovering the clown’s intentions.
