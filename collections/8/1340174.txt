Fannie Mae makes money partly by borrowing at low rates, and then reinvesting its borrowings into whole mortgages and mortgage backed securities. It borrows in the debt markets by selling bonds, and provides liquidity to mortgage originators by purchasing whole loans. It purchases whole loans and then securitizes them for the investment market by creating MBS that are either retained or sold.
