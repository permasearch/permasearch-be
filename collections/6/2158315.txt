The Vaikhanasas are associated with the Pāñcarātra, but regard themselves as a Vedic orthodox sect.[206][222] Modern Vaikhanasas reject elements of the Pāñcarātra and Sri Vaishnava tradition, but the historical relationship with the orthodox Vaikhanasa in south India is unclear.[citation needed] The Vaikhanasas may have resisted the incorporation of the devotic elements of the Alvar tradition, while the Pāñcarātras were open to this incorporation.[221][full citation needed]
