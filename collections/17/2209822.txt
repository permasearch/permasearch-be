In its first few seasons, the show presented lighthearted themes, such as love stories and lost loves; during the 1980s, such topics as domestic violence had still not been accepted in Mexican society. In the 1990s, themes acquired a grittier look, including cases of rape, incest, child abuse, prostitution, LGBT discrimination and domestic violence. The show became a stage for social reform in Mexico. With these changes, the show was usually first in line to discuss topics that were often kept out of the public eye.
