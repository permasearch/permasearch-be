Since the current US version began in 1999, Family Feud has used a single sudden question in certain situations. The 1999-2003 four-round format matches that end tied after four rounds are sent to a sudden-death playoff. The two families send the fifth member for a face-off. Since the 2003-2004 season, if neither family scores 300 after four rounds (three in 2009-10), the same playoff is implemented. The family must give the answer most frequently provided by the survey to win.
