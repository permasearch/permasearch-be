The severity of this matter continues to rise as fashion magazines directed at females, subtly promote thinness and diet practices, and are heavily relied on by teenagers for beauty and fashion advice. Seventeen magazine in particular, recorded one of the highest number of articles devoted to appearances, leading to 69% of girls stating it influenced their ideal body shape[38]. In addition, 50% of advertisements featured also used beauty appeal to sell products[39]. With the high number of publications featuring articles promoting unhealthy weight loss, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported an astounding 90% of teenage girls voiced the need to change their appearances[40], while 81% of 10 year olds were already afraid of being fat[40]. As a result, many argue that fashion and media’s powerful role on body image and self-perception, will spiral into eating disorders, According to a survey by the Manchester Metropolitan University, “self-esteem and views of body image suffered after the participants were shown magazine pictures of models, [suggests] that media portrayal of images can prolong anorexia and bulimia in women and may even be a cause of it”[21].
