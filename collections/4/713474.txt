The condition affects 0.1%â€“0.2% of the population,[24] and occurs equally in both males and females. Alopecia areata occurs in people who are otherwise healthy and have no other skin disorders.[6] Initial presentation most commonly occurs in the late teenage years, early childhood, or young adulthood, but can happen at any ages.[8] Patients also tend to have a slightly higher incidence of conditions related to the immune system, such as asthma, allergies, atopic dermatitis, and hypothyroidism.
