By 20 February 2012, the tanks in the forward part of the ship, which had held about two-thirds of the fuel, had been emptied,[169] but the following day defuelling was suspended because of poor weather conditions.[170] On 3 March 2012, salvage workers cut a hole in the ship for access to the engine room, the location of the remaining fuel.[171] On the morning of 12 March, defuelling operations resumed[172] and were completed on 24 March.[173][174]
