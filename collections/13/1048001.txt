IGN listed Bellatrix Lestrange as their tenth top Harry Potter character, and IGN's Joe Utichi listed Bellatrix as his fourth favourite Harry Potter character, calling her the "most pitiable" of Voldemort's servants.[20][21] In NextMovie.com's Harry Potter Mega Poll, Bellatrix was voted as the No.Â 1 villain in the series.[22] Novelist Stephen King notes that Bellatrix being called a "bitch" by Molly after she tries to kill Ginny was "the most shocking bitch in recent fiction", and that it shows how adult the books had become.[23]
