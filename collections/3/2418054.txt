A common misconception is that the NP in "NP-hard" stands for "non-polynomial" when in fact it stands for "Non-deterministic Polynomial acceptable problems".[4] Although it is suspected that there are no polynomial-time algorithms for NP-hard problems, this has not been proven.[5] Moreover, the class P in which all problems can be solved in polynomial time, is contained in the NP class.[6]
