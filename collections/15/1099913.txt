Vogue magazine first used the term brassiere in 1907,[6][7] and by 1911 the word had made its way into the Oxford English Dictionary.[8] On 3 November 1914, the newly formed U.S. patent category for "brassieres" was inaugurated with the first patent issued to Mary Phelps Jacob.[9][10] In the 1930s brassiere was gradually shortened to bra.[4]
