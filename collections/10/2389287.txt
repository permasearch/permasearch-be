The House of Representatives has met in the Parliament Buildings located in Wellington, the capital city of New Zealand, since 1865. It normally consists of 120 Members of Parliament (MPs), though sometimes more due to overhang seats. 71 MPs are elected directly in electorate seats and the remainder are filled by list MPs based on each party's share of the party vote. MƒÅori were represented in Parliament from 1867, and in 1893 women gained the vote.[2] New Zealand does not allow sentenced prisoners to vote.[3] Although elections can be called early, each three years the House is dissolved and goes up for reelection.
