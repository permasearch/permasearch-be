On 4 December 1922, Charles Stewart, Superintendent of Indian Affairs, and Duncan Campbell Scott, Deputy Superintendent of the Canadian Department of Indian Affairs traveled to Brantford to negotiate a settlement on the issues with the Six Nations. After the meeting, the Native delegation brought the offer to the tribal council, as was customary under Haudenosaunee law. The council agreed to accept the offer, but before they could respond, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police conducted a liquor raid on the Iroquois' Grand River territory. The siege lasted three days[111] and prompted the Haudenosaunee to send Deskaheh to Washington, DC, to meet with the charg√© d'affaires of the Netherlands asking the Dutch Queen to sponsor them for membership in the League of Nations.[112] Under pressure from the British, the Netherlands reluctantly refused sponsorship.[113]
