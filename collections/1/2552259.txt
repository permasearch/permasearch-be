The Bakur Manuscript reports him as having said: "All Musalmans should unite together, considering the annihilation of infidels as a sacred duty, and labour to the utmost of their power, to accomplish that subject."[148] Soon after the Treaty of Mangalore in 1784, Tippu gained control of Canara.[149] He issued orders to seize the Christians in Canara, confiscate their estates,[150] and deport them to Seringapatam, the capital of his empire, through the Jamalabad fort route.[151] However, there were no priests among the captives. Together with Fr Miranda, all the 21 arrested priests were issued orders of expulsion to Goa, fined Rs 200,000, and threatened death by hanging if they ever returned.[148]
