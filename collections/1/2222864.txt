The Fulcrum character introduced early in Star Wars Rebels was always understood to be Ahsoka.[14] Filoni, who serves as executive producer and co-creator of Rebels, worked with Lucas on identifying what Ahsoka would know about Anakin's fate.[10] Filoni also collaborated with executive producer Simon Kinberg and season one executive producer Greg Weisman on developing Ahsoka's role as a Rebel agent.[10]
