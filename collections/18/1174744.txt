After Jack Benny, Nelson continued to work in sitcoms in similar roles, most notably in The Hank McCune Show and I Love Lucy. In fact, Nelson appeared as various characters during all seasons of I Love Lucy (most notably game show host Freddie Fillmore) before beginning the recurring role as the character Ralph Ramsey, after the Ricardos moved to Westport, Connecticut in 1957. He further appeared in The Addams Family in the 1960s, and Sanford and Son during the 1970s.[citation needed]
