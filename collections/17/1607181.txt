Early Christian observance of both the spiritual seventh-day sabbath and a Lord's Day assembly is evidenced in Ignatius's letter to the Magnesians ca. 110.[13][18] The Pseudo-Ignatian additions amplified this point by combining weekly observance of spiritual seventh-day sabbath with the Lord's assembly.[19] If Pseudo-Ignatius dates as early as 140, its admonition must be considered important evidence on 2nd-century sabbath and Lord's Day observance.[20] According to classical sources, widespread seventh-day sabbath rest by gentile Christians was also the prevailing mode in the 3rd and 4th centuries.[21][22]
