The episode contains several pop culture references. The title of the episode "For Whom the Sleigh Bell Tolls" is a parody of the novel, For Whom the Bell Tolls and the Metallica song inspired by the novel. The action sequence and bloody themes were slightly modeled after the film 300.[3] When Bob Todd is teaching Roger moonshining, Roger jumps over barrels of moonshine, similar to the Donkey Kong video games.[7] Frosty the Snowman appears in Santa's army, which is a reference to the cave-troll scene in Moria from The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. The elves are wrangling Frosty in with a collar and chains almost exactly like the scene from Fellowship. When Jeff confronts Santa, he stabs him with the polar bear helmet from the film The Golden Compass.[8] When Santa arrives and finds them the song 'Carol of the Bells' by August Burns Red plays.
