Wander’d so long at sea; what course he ran By winds and tempests driven from his way: That saw the cities, and the fashions knew Of many men, but suffer’d grievous pain To save his own life, and bring home his crew; Though for his crew, all he could do was vain, They lost themselves by their own insolence, Feeding, like fools, on the Sun’s sacred kine; Which did the splendid deity incense To their dire fate. Begin, O Muse divine.
