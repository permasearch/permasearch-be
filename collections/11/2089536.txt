Economically, the Negro has become a slave of debt, says Du Bois.  He goes on to describe the economic classes consist of the "submerged tenth" of croppers, 40% are metayers or "tenant on shares" with a chattel mortgage, 39% are semi-metayers and wage-laborers, while 5% are money-renters, and 6% freeholders.  Finally, du Bois states only 6% "have succeeded in emerging into peasant proprietorship," leading to a "migration to town," the "buying of small homesteads near town."[3]:123,128,132
