The name Boötes was first used by Homer in his Odyssey as a celestial reference point for navigation,[5] described as "late-setting" or "slow to set", translated as the "Plowman".[6] Exactly whom Boötes is supposed to represent in Greek mythology is not clear. According to one version, he was a son of Demeter,[7] Philomenus, twin brother of Plutus, a ploughman who drove the oxen in the constellation Ursa Major.[8] This is corroborated by the constellation's name, which itself means "ox-driver" or "herdsman."[9] The ancient Greeks saw the asterism now called the "Big Dipper" or "Plough" as a cart with oxen.[1] This influenced the name's etymology, derived from the Greek for "noisy" or "ox-driver".[10] Another myth associated with Boötes tells that he invented the plow and was memorialized for his ingenuity as a constellation.[11]
