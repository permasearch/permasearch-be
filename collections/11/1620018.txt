The Act provided a dual form of government (a "diarchy") for the major provinces. In each such province, control of some areas of government, the "transferred list", were given to a Government of ministers answerable to the Provincial Council. The 'transferred list' included agriculture, supervision of local government, health, and education. The Provincial Councils were enlarged.
