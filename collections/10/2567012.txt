In the 1980s, wireless technology tended to be only used by touring professionals, but in the 2010s, wireless mics and instrument transmitters has become popular in sound reinforcement. Wireless systems are typically used for electric guitar, bass, and handheld microphones. This lets performers move about the stage during the show or even go out into the audience without the worry of tripping over or disconnecting the cable.
