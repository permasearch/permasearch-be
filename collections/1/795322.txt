where     ω = 2 π ν   {\displaystyle \omega =2\pi \nu }   relates to the oscillation frequency     ν   {\displaystyle \nu }   and B is the magnitude of the field.[7] This means that the spin magnetization, which is proportional to the sum of the spin vectors of nuclei in magnetically equivalent sites (the expectation value of the spin vector in quantum mechanics), moves on a cone around the B field. This is analogous to the precessional motion of the axis of a tilted spinning top around the gravitational field. In quantum mechanics,     ω   {\displaystyle \omega }   is the Bohr frequency[7]     Δ  E   /  ℏ   {\displaystyle \Delta {E}/\hbar }   of the      S  x     {\displaystyle S_{x}}   and      S  y     {\displaystyle S_{y}}   expectation values. Precession of non-equilibrium magnetization in the applied magnetic field B0 occurs with the Larmor frequency
