Guy Lombardo performed "Auld Lang Syne" for the first time in the hotelâ€™s Roosevelt Grill, which was open from 1927 to 1958, and Lawrence Welk began his career at the Roosevelt Hotel in the summers while Lombardo took his music to Long Island. Music was piped live into each room via radio. Hugo Gernsback (of Hugo Award fame) started WRNY from a room on the 18th floor of The Roosevelt broadcasting live via a 125-foot tower on the roof.
