Show creator and producer Nigel Lythgoe, who also judges on the American version of the show, formed the original core judging panel with former Strictly Come Dancing judge Arlene Phillips. Lythgoe and Phillips were the only permanent judges in the audition process for the series, but guest judges Sisco Gomez and Louise Redknapp remained on the panel as permanent judges in the live shows.[6] During the second series, Alexandra Burke featured as a guest judge throughout the auditions and Choreographer camp. John Barrowman also appeared as a guest judge on one live show, during the absence of Lythgoe.
