The Governing Council confirmed this definition in May 2003 following a thorough evaluation of the ECB's monetary policy strategy. On that occasion, the Governing Council clarified that “in the pursuit of price stability, it aims to maintain inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term”.[16] All lending to credit institutions must be collateralised as required by Article 18 of the Statute of the ESCB.[18] The Governing Council clarification has little force in law.
