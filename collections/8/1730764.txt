The game ended with a minor controversy over the final score. With seven seconds (:07) left in the game and Michigan trailing 31-0, Gardner made one last pass attempt. The pass was intercepted by Elijah Shumate and returned for a touchdown, appearing to make the final score 37-0.  During the return, however, officials called a penalty on Notre Dame safety Max Redfield for blocking Gardner, negating the touchdown.
