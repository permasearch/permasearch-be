Damage Control Team No. 8, led by Chief Farrier, were the first responders to any incident on the flight deck. They immediately took action. Farrier, without taking the time to locate and put on protective clothing, immediately attempted to smother the bomb with a PKP fire extinguisher, attempting to delay the fuel fire from spreading and give the pilots time to escape their aircraft.[10] Based on their training, the team believed they had a 10-minute window to extinguish the fire before the bombs casing would melt resulting in a low-order explosion.[25]
