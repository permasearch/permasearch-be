Quantities of atoms are found in different states of matter that depend on the physical conditions, such as temperature and pressure. By varying the conditions, materials can transition between solids, liquids, gases and plasmas.[97] Within a state, a material can also exist in different allotropes. An example of this is solid carbon, which can exist as graphite or diamond.[98] Gaseous allotropes exist as well, such as dioxygen and ozone.
