The Once and Future King contains much deliberately anachronistic humour, affectionate mockery of the source text and commentary on totalitarianism. The work explores human nature regarding power and justice. As the young Arthur becomes king, he attempts to quell the prevalent "might makes right" attitude with his idea of chivalry, even as he foresees the ascendancy of another form of might, namely legal prowess in the courtroom, and, from without, a form of fascism. White's title derives from the inscription that, according to Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, was written upon King Arthur's tomb: Hic iacet Arthurus, rex quondam, rexque futurus or "Here lies Arthur, king once, and king to be."
