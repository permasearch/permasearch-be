Those who survive cancer develop a second primary cancer at about twice the rate of those never diagnosed.[162] The increased risk is believed to be due to the random chance of developing any cancer, the likelihood of surviving the first cancer, the same risk factors that produced the first cancer, unwanted side effects of treating the first cancer (particularly radiation therapy), and to better compliance with screening.[162]
