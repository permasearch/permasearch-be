The variance can then be written as     m +    m  2   r     {\textstyle m+{\frac {m^{2}}{r}}}  . Some authors prefer to set     α =   1 r     {\textstyle \alpha ={\frac {1}{r}}}  , and express the variance as     m + α  m  2     {\textstyle m+\alpha m^{2}}  . In this context, and depending on the author, either the parameter r or its reciprocal α is referred to as the "dispersion parameter", "shape parameter" or "clustering coefficient",[13] or the "heterogeneity"[12] or "aggregation" parameter.[7] The term "aggregation" is particularly used in ecology when describing counts of individual organisms. Decrease of the aggregation parameter r towards zero corresponds to increasing aggregation of the organisms; increase of r towards infinity corresponds to absence of aggregation, as can be described by Poisson regression.
