Richards found "the theme of Deathlok [to be] about deep, internal conflict, and that's what we're bringing with this [version]."[123] After returning late in the second season, Richards looked back, and felt that his initial awkwardness and reluctance with the character and the costume reflected Peterson's own journey becoming Deathlok. He also noted that when the character says "Mike Peterson is dead", "the only way that line could have meaning [is] if it were not true. I always think of Mike Peterson being at the core of this character, and whatever happens as a result of that, is all Mike Petersen."[122]
