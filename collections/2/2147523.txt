In May 1972,[2] the 1973 model year Hilux was released as the RN20. Nicknamed the "ロケハイ　(RokeHi) a Portmanteau of Rocket Hilux", a more comfortable interior was specified along with exterior updates. A 2.25 m (7.4 ft) "long bed" was an option for the first time in North America, although such a version had been available worldwide since April 1969.[2] This received the "RN25" chassis code.[5] The 2.0 liter 18R engine was available in Japan as well, also with an available three-speed automatic transmission. The 2.0-litre automatic only managed a 136.1 km/h (84.6 mph) top speed in a period South African road test, in spite of a claimed 89 kW (121 PS).[6]
