The impeachment trial in the Illinois State Senate began on January 26, 2009.[113][115]  Blagojevich boycotted attending his own hearings, referring to them as a kangaroo court.[116][117] Neither the governor nor his lawyer was present in Springfield, Illinois on the first day of the trial. Blagojevich spent the day in New York City making media appearances on a myriad of shows including Good Morning America and The View.[118][119] In his absence, a "not guilty" plea was automatically entered on his behalf.[120] On the same day, in a cable television news interview with Geraldo Rivera, Blagojevich derided the whole process.[117] Lead attorney Ed Genson announced that he was withdrawing from representing Blagojevich, saying "I never require a client to do what I say, but I do require them to at least listen."[121] Blagojevich was in New York again the next day continuing an apparent attempt to upstage the hearings with eleven media appointments at places such as The Early Show, and the Associated Press.[122][123] Blagojevich insisted that unlike Richard Nixon who did not want his tapes heard during Watergate, he wanted his tapes heard in order to reveal the whole truth, which he felt would vindicate him.[123]
