In the aftermath of his landslide re-election, Nixon turned his attention to reorganizing the executive branch in order to centralize power in the White House.[196] His plans were disrupted as ongoing revelations and investigations related to the Watergate break-in. Though Nixon would continue to be active in foreign affairs during his second term, the fallout from the Watergate scandal (often referred to simply as "Watergate") effectively precluded any major domestic initiatives.[197] Nixon had not known about the Watergate break-in beforehand, but after learning about it he quickly became involved in ordering a cover-up. Nixon and Haldeman pressured the FBI to end its investigation of Watergate, and White House Counsel John Dean sought to ensure the cooperation of the Watergate burglars by promising them money and executive clemency if they did not implicate the White House in the break-in.[198] The Watergate burglars were convicted in January 1973 without admitting to a White House role in the break-in, but members of Congress organized an investigation into Nixon's role in Watergate. As Congressman Tip O'Neill stated, in the 1972 campaign Nixon and his allies "did too many things. Too many people know about it. There is no way to keep it quiet. The time is going to come when impeachment is going to hit this Congress."[199]
