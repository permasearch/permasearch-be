As Cleveland and Cleveland Jr. move back into their old house and Donna, Roberta, and Rallo move in there with them, Cleveland discovers it has been wrecked due to all of the past residents like Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase (as seen in "Spies Reminiscent of Us"), Ryan Reynolds (as seen in "Stewie Goes for a Drive"), and its having once been used as an orphanage. After getting things fixed, the Brown family proceeds with moving in, cleaning up and sorting things. Rallo tries to make friends with Stewie, but Stewie blows him off, calling him a Boondocks rip-off. Chris breaks a vase that belonged to Donna's great-grandmother over Rallo's head. As a result, Donna spanks him, which enrages Lois, who confronts Donna when she finds out. Donna accuses Lois of being a bad parent while Lois accuses her of being a child abuser. They refuse to have anything to do with each other, forbidding their husbands from socializing with each other as well.
