On specifications and standards published by the United States Department of Defense (DoD), requirements with "shall" are the mandatory requirements. (“Must” shall not be used to express mandatory provisions. Use the term “shall.”) “Will” declares purpose on the part of the Government or simple futurity, and “should” and “may” express nonmandatory provisions.[15][16]
