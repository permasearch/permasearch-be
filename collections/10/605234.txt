In Western, English-speaking societies, when there are two people with the same name, for example, Robert Jones and Frederick Jones, in an elementary school class, they may be referred to as R. Jones and F. Jones respectively to avoid confusion. But two Ramans in Tamil Nadu have just the one name each. So the names of their fathers are used as initials instead of a surname. Raman, son of Gopal, would be G. Raman, and Raman, son of Dinesh, D. Raman. This led to the initial system, mostly followed in Tamil Nadu. Most schools automatically add the initials upon enrollment.
