League of Legends is funded through microtransactions using Riot Points (RP), an in-game currency which can be purchased by players in the client store. RP can be used to purchase champions, champion skins, ward skins, summoner icons, emotes, and certain multi-game boosts.  An additional currency, Blue Essence (BE) (known as Influence Points from 2009â€“2017), is earned by playing the game and leveling up.  League of Legends is free-to-play and all in-game purchases with a material effect on game-play may be acquired by either RP or BE; only cosmetic items are locked to RP-only.
