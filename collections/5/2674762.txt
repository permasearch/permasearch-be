Being naturally eutrophic, the lake has been known since early times for its poor water quality. FrÃ©mont noted the "often foul smelling waters" of the lake, and the Applegate Trail was purposely routed away from the lake because the water was "so bad that it might be too dangerous for livestock to drink late in the season".[9]
