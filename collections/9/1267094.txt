In early 1874, Wyatt and Sally moved to the growing cow town of Wichita, where his brother James ran a brothel.[23][better source needed] Local arrest records show that Sally Earp and James' wife, Nellie "Bessie" Ketchum, operated a brothel there from early 1874 to the middle of 1876.[4]  Wyatt may have been a pimp, but historian Robert Gary L. Roberts believes  he more likely was an enforcer, or a bouncer for the brothel.[23] When the Kansas state census was completed in June 1875, Sally was no longer living with Wyatt, James, and Bessie.[32]:14
