In October 2015, it was confirmed that an Annabelle sequel was in development; it was later revealed that the film would be a prequel rather than a sequel.[36] Filming began in June 2016 in Los Angeles.[37] The plot of the film centers on a dollmaker and his wife, whose daughter tragically died twelve years earlier, as they decide to open their home to a nun and several girls from a shuttered orphanage; the dollmaker's possessed creation Annabelle sets her sights on the children and turns their shelter into a storm of horror.[38] Lights Out director David F. Sandberg replaced Leonetti as director, with Dauberman returning to write the script and Safran and Wan returning to produce.[39] The film was released worldwide on August 11, 2017, to critical and commercial success. Most critics found Annabelle: Creation to be a vast improvement over its predecessor.[40]
