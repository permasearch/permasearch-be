Iron Weasel get their personal cutouts made by Simon Craig while he's waiting for them to write a new song and perform it in his studio, but the band hasn't written a song yet. The next day, they visit Simon Craig Records and tell Simon to let off some stress by going to the spa. In return, Simon asks that the band babysit his stepson Charles Albertson aka Chucky, the same Chucky that drove the band crazy in the episode "Slap Goes the Weasel". Chucky tries to convince them he has changed and everyone but Tripp believes him. Chucky pulls a prank and glues all of their hands together so they can't perform, but it inspires Tripp and the song is written in time.
