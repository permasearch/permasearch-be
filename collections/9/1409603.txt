In August 2011, WWE began to phase out the brand extension when they gave Raw the tagline "SuperShow", meaning wrestlers could appear on both Raw and SmackDown.[44] Throughout the original WWE brand extension, the company held 9 draft lotteries total. Starting with Raw's 1,000th episode, airing on July 23, 2012, Raw has removed the "SuperShow" tagline and has extended from two-hours to become a three-hour broadcast, a format that was previously been reserved for special episodes.[45] Superstars such as CM Punk, Alberto Del Rio, Daniel Bryan, Sheamus, The Miz, Dolph Ziggler, Wade Barrett, Ryback, Kofi Kingston and John Morrison were pushed to the spotlight around this period.
