Currently, the House of La Cerda stems into several noble families: the House of the Dukes of Medinaceli, as direct heirs of Fernando and Alfonso la Cerda, and its minor Ducal House of Parcent. From the House of Parcent (dukes since 1916) stem the minor noble houses of the Marquissates of Eguaras (in the House of La Cerda since 1799) and of CaÃ±ada-Honda (created in 1893 for Emilio Drake De La Cerda, grandson of the Count of Parcent)
