The most influential turntable was the Technics SL-1200,[11] which was developed in 1971 by a team led by Shuichi Obata at Matsushita, which then released it onto the market in 1972.[6] It was adopted by New York City hip hop DJs such as Grand Wizard Theodore and Afrika Bambaataa in the 1970s. As they experimented with the SL-1200 decks, they developed scratching techniques when they found that the motor would continue to spin at the correct RPM even if the DJ wiggled the record back and forth on the platter.[11] Since then, turntablism spread widely in hip hop culture, and the SL-1200 remained the most widely used turntable in DJ culture for the next several decades.[9][11]
