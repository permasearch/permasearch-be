Atomic force microscopy is a powerful technique used to study the surface properties of materials. It relies on the interactions that can be observed between the surface of a material and the very fine tip (ideally one atom in diameter) of the AFM. This tip is mounted on a cantilever that will move in certain directions according to the surface’s charge, topography or composition. The information received can provide inside knowledge on the topography of the material, the dimensions of certain particles, the interactions between the different molecules, the mechanical properties of the sample (a bending test can be realized using AFM), as well as other properties such as the electrical and magnetic properties.[6] The resolution of this technique is one of the best you can achieve using microscopy techniques. In fact, unlike other electron microscopy techniques such as SEM, STM and so forth, AFM provides a resolution in the range of Angstrom. This technique is therefore perfect for studying nanomaterials and is sometimes referred to as a single atom resolved technique. Another big advantage of this technique is the minimal sample preparation it requires.[7] The data collection process it relies on is also quite simple. The movements of the cantilever are recorded using a photo detector and a laser that is deflected by the cantilever. These movements induce a change in the voltage of the photodetector which then transforms this signal into an “image”.[8]
