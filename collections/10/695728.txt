In the end, about 25 people were on board when it left the deck under the command of Quartermaster Arthur Bright.[98][99][83] Two first class passengers, Hugh Woolner and Mauritz Håkan Björnström-Steffansson, jumped from A-Deck (which had started to flood) into the boat as it was being lowered, with Björnström-Stefansson landing upside down in the boat's bow and Woolner landing half-out, before being pulled aboard by the occupants.[100][63] Another first class passenger, Frederick Maxfield Hoyt, who had previously put his wife in the boat, jumped in the water immediately after, and was hauled aboard by Woolner and Björnström-Steffansson.[99][100] The number of people on board later increased when about 10–12 survivors were transferred to collapsible D from another boat.[98][99] Carpathia picked up those aboard collapsible D at 7:15 a.m.[45]
