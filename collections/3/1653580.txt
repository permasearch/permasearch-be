The album begins with a number of up-tempo songs before expanding to a variety of tempos for its second half.[1] Vedder attributed the faster and more aggressive songs to the band writing a lot of material that kept getting pared down, with the band leaving behind mid-tempo songs,[8] while Ament suggested that it was because of the band balancing recording and touring which resulted in "physicality ... from being out on the road."[3] The band attempted to create an environment in which McCready and drummer Matt Cameron could play much as they do live.[9] Ament said that there was "a lot of honing of the guitars and vocals in the middle and toward the end," which resulted in the album sounding "more polished."[3] On the overall feeling of the album, Ament said, "The band playing in a room—that came across. There's a kind of immediacy to the record, and that's what we were going for."[3]
