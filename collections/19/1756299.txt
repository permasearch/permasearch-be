The extent of the jurisdiction and application of the Bill of Rights (Tswana: molaotlhomo wa ditshwanelo; Sotho: bili ya ditokelo; Northern Sotho: molao wa ditokelo; Afrikaans: handves van regte; Zulu: umqulu wamalungelo; Southern Ndebele: ivikelamalungelo; Xhosa: usomqulu wamalungelo; Swazi: umculu wemalungelo; Venda: mulayo wa pfanelo dza vhathu; Tsonga: nxaxamelo wa timfanelo) is defined by sections seven and eight, entitled "Rights" and "Application" respectively. Section seven provides that the rights apply to "all people in our country" (although certain rights are limited to citizens) and requires the state (by which is meant government at all levels) to "respect, protect, promote and fulfil" the Bill of Rights. It also notes that the rights in the Bill are subject to the limitations provided for in section thirty-six and elsewhere in the Bill; see Limitations below.
