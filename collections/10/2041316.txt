The samples incorporated to "Fight the Power" largely draw from African-American culture, with their original recording artists being mostly important figures in the development of late 20th-century African-American popular music.[16] Vocal elements characteristic of this are various exhortations common in African-American music and church services, including the lines "Let me hear you say," "Come on and get down," and "Brothers and sisters," as well as James Brown's grunts and Afrika Bambaataa's electronically processed exclamations, taken from his 1982 song "Planet Rock".[16] The samples are reinforced by textual allusions to such music, quoted by Chuck D in his lyrics, including "sound of the funky drummer" (James Brown and Clyde Stubblefield), "I know you got soul" (Bobby Byrd), "freedom or death" (Stetsasonic), "people, people" (Brown's "Funky President"), and "I'm black and I'm proud" (Brown's "Say It Loud â€“ I'm Black and I'm Proud").[16] The track's title itself invokes the Isley Brothers' song of the same name.[16]
