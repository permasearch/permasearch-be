Crime Sorcière (魔女の罪 (クリムソルシエール), Kurimu Sorushiēru, French for "Witch's Crime") is an independent guild formed during the disappearance of Sirius Island. Its stated goal is to root out Zeref, and suppress anyone who attempts to use his power for evil. It acts under the Magic Council's radar. It initially consists of its three founding members—Jellal Fernandez, Ultear Milkovich, and Merudy—as a means of atoning for their lifelong misdeeds.[ch. 263] After Ultear's departure, the guild recruits Brain's followers from the Oración Seis as members.[ch. 339, 416]
