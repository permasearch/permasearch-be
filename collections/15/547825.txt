Anderson was part of the squad which toured Sri Lanka in the winter. The One-Day side completed their first ever series victory in Sri Lanka; Anderson's contribution was four wickets in five matches at an average of 48.25 and tying down Sri Lanka's top order along with Sidebottom and Stuart Broad, although they finished with more wickets at a lower average.[76][77] Despite suffering a bruised left ankle,[78] Anderson was selected for the first Test. Although he bowled economically in the first innings,[79] he was expensive in the second; during the course of the second innings he became only the second bowler in Test cricket to have six boundaries taken off a single over.[80] He finished the match with figures of two wickets for 167 runs[81] and was dropped for the final two Tests; his replacement was debutant Stuart Broad.
