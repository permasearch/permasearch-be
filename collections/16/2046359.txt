The Soviet Union also led the way in the development of the third part of the nuclear triad, SLBM's. They launched the first SLBM, with a R-11FM ballistic missile in 1956, and in 1957 introduced submarines with two R-11FM's in 1957.[48] However, these early submarines had to be surfaced in order launch their missiles. It is in this aspect that the US became the leader when they deployed the first SSBN, USS George Washington (SSBN-598), in 1959 with Polaris A-1 missiles able to be launched underwater. However, the first successful underwater launch of a ballistic missile was in July 1960. It was not until 1963 that the Soviet Union was able to match the US in this regard, with a R-21 missile. There was also a considerable gap between the United States employment of MRVs and MIRVs on SLBM's to that of the Soviet's, which the US had achieved as early as 1964. In 1974, the USSR deployed SS-N-6, the first Soviet SSBN with shrapnel MRV nuclear warheads. Three years later, the Soviet Navy deployed their first SLBM with MIRV warheads, the SS-N-18 missile[45]
