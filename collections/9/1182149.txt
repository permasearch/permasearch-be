For example, if values     { 2 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 5 , 5 }   {\displaystyle \{2,2,4,5,5,5\}}   are drawn from the same distribution, then we can treat this set as an unweighted sample, or we can treat it as the weighted sample     { 2 , 4 , 5 }   {\displaystyle \{2,4,5\}}   with corresponding weights     { 2 , 1 , 3 }   {\displaystyle \{2,1,3\}}  , and we get the same result either way.
