A chemical substance may well be defined as "any material with a definite chemical composition" in an introductory general chemistry textbook.[4] According to this definition a chemical substance can either be a pure chemical element or a pure chemical compound. But, there are exceptions to this definition; a pure substance can also be defined as a form of matter that has both definite composition and distinct properties.[5] The chemical substance index published by CAS also includes several alloys of uncertain composition.[6] Non-stoichiometric compounds are a special case (in inorganic chemistry) that violates the law of constant composition, and for them, it is sometimes difficult to draw the line between a mixture and a compound, as in the case of palladium hydride. Broader definitions of chemicals or chemical substances can be found, for example: "the term 'chemical substance' means any organic or inorganic substance of a particular molecular identity, including â€“ (i) any combination of such substances occurring in whole or in part as a result of a chemical reaction or occurring in nature".[7]
