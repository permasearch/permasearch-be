In June 2008 The Wall Street Journal reported that Franklin Raines, a former CEO of Fannie Mae, received below market rates loans at Countrywide Financial because the corporation considered the officeholders "FOA's". He received loans for over $3 million while CEO of Fannie Mae.[17] On July 16, 2008, The Washington Post reported that Franklin Raines had "taken calls from Barack Obama's presidential campaign seeking his advice on mortgage and housing policy matters."[18] Subsequent attempts to connect Obama's campaign with Franklin Raines were characterized by The Washington Post as "a stretch".[19]
