Performers are first trained in acrobatics, followed by singing and gestures. Several performing schools, all based on the styles of famous performers, are taught. Some examples are the Mei Lanfang school, the Cheng Yanqiu school, the Ma Lianliang school, and the Qi Lintong school.[47] Students previously trained exclusively in the art of performance, but modern performance schools now include academic studies as well. Teachers assess the qualifications of each student and assign them roles as primary, secondary, or tertiary characters accordingly. Students with little acting talent often become Peking-opera musicians.[48] They may also serve as the supporting cast of foot soldiers, attendants, and servants that is present in every Peking-opera troupe.[49] In Taiwan, the Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of China runs a national Peking-opera training school.[50]
