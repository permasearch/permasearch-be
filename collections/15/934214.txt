Multiplayer was released on 3 June 2013 and allows full members both to host and to join maps with up to 8 players. Free members can only join multiplayer if the host allows it. A new set of animations has been also released, together with a new inventory mode, new clothes and some minor changes. Even the website has undergone a full restyle.
