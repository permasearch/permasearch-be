The clustering of the orbits of extreme transneptunian objects and raising of their perihelia is reproduced in simulations that include Planet Nine. In simulations conducted by Batygin and Brown swarms of planetesimals that began with large semi-major axis orbits at random orientations and initially interacting with Neptune were sculpted into collinear groups of spatially confined orbits by a distant planet if it is substantially more massive than Earth and on a highly eccentric orbit. These surviving objects were in orbits that were oriented with their long axes anti-aligned with respect to the massive planet and were roughly co-planar with it. The objects were also found to be in resonance with the massive planet. The resonances included high-order resonances, for example 27:17, and were interconnected, yielding an orbital evolution that was fundamentally chaotic, causing their semi-major axes to vary unpredictably on million-year timescales.[1] The perihelia of these objects were also raised temporarily, producing Sedna-like orbits, before being returned to orbits more typical of typical trans-neptunian objects after several hundred million years.[44] Some of the eTNOs also evolved into orbits perpendicular to the plane of the Solar System.[1]
