Mathematical and computational models are essential for understanding the action potential, and offer predictions that may be tested against experimental data, providing a stringent test of a theory. The most important and accurate of the early neural models is the Hodgkin–Huxley model, which describes the action potential by a coupled set of four ordinary differential equations (ODEs).[i] Although the Hodgkin–Huxley model may be a simplification with few limitations[64] compared to the realistic nervous membrane as it exists in nature, its complexity has inspired several even-more-simplified models,[65][br] such as the Morris–Lecar model[bs] and the FitzHugh–Nagumo model,[bt] both of which have only two coupled ODEs. The properties of the Hodgkin–Huxley and FitzHugh–Nagumo models and their relatives, such as the Bonhoeffer–van der Pol model,[bu] have been well-studied within mathematics,[66][bv] computation[67] and electronics.[bw] However the simple models of generator potential and action potential fail to accurately reproduce the near threshold neural spike rate and spike shape, specifically for the mechanoreceptors like the Pacinian corpuscle.[68] More modern research has focused on larger and more integrated systems; by joining action-potential models with models of other parts of the nervous system (such as dendrites and synapses), researchers can study neural computation[69] and simple reflexes, such as escape reflexes and others controlled by central pattern generators.[70][bx]
