The second, more radical, adaptation involves the selective influx of potassium (K+) ions into the cytoplasm. This adaptation is restricted to the moderately halophilic bacterial order Halanaerobiales, the extremely halophilic archaeal family Halobacteriaceae, and the extremely halophilic bacterium Salinibacter ruber. The presence of this adaptation in three distinct evolutionary lineages suggests convergent evolution of this strategy, it being unlikely to be an ancient characteristic retained in only scattered groups or passed on through massive lateral gene transfer.[2] The primary reason for this is the entire intracellular machinery (enzymes, structural proteins, etc.) must be adapted to high salt levels, whereas in the compatible solute adaptation, little or no adjustment is required to intracellular macromolecules; in fact, the compatible solutes often act as more general stress protectants, as well as just osmoprotectants.[2]
