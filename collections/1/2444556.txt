Classifiers are generally associated with certain groups of nouns related by meaning, such as 条 [條] tiáo for long, thin objects or animals (e.g. ropes, snakes or fish), 把 bǎ for objects with handles (e.g. knives, umbrellas), 张 [張] zhāng for flat objects that can be counted as sheets in English (photographs, fur, etc.). While there are dozens, if not hundreds, of classifiers that exist, which must be memorized individually for each noun, a majority of words use the general classifier 个 [個] gè. Many nouns that are associated with other classifiers can also use gè if the speaker chooses. The classifiers for many nouns appear arbitrary. The noun 桌子 zhuōzi "table" is a zhāng noun probably because a table-top is sheet-like, while 椅子 yĭzi "chair" is a bǎ noun probably a chair is moved by lifting something like a handle, although another word for chair or stool, 凳子 dèngzi, is a gè  noun.
