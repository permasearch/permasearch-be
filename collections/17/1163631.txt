The sessions took place partly at Apple Studios in London, but mostly at Harrison's home studio, FPSHOT, according to Voormann.[78][94][nb 6] Apple Studios, together with its Savile Row, London W1 address, received a prominent credit on the Living in the Material World record sleeve, as a further sign of Harrison's championing of the Beatles-owned recording facility.[94][98] At the weekends during these autumn months, Hopkins recorded his own solo album, The Tin Man Was a Dreamer (1973), at Apple,[85] with contributions from Harrison, Voormann and Horn.[99][100] Voormann has described the mood at the Friar Park sessions as "intimate, quiet, friendly" and in stark contrast to the sessions he, Harrison and Hopkins had attended at Lennon's home in 1971, for the Imagine album.[96] Keltner recalls Harrison as having been focused and "at his peak physically" throughout the recording of Living in the Material World,[101] having given up smoking and taken to using Hindu prayer beads.[102]
