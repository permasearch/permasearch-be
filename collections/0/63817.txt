StarLink is a genetically modified maize, containing two modifications: a gene for resistance to glufosinate, and a variant of the bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) protein called Cry9C.[2] Cry9C had not been used in a GM crop prior to StarLink, causing heightened regulatory scrutiny.[3] StarLink's creator, Plant Genetic Systems, which later became Aventis CropScience during the time of the incident,[4]:15â€“16 had applied to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to market StarLink for use in animal feed and in the human food supply.[4]:14 However, because the Cry9C protein lingers in the digestive system before breaking down, the EPA had concerns about its allergenicity, and PGS did not provide sufficient data to prove that Cry9C was not allergenic.[5]:3 As a result, PGS split its application into separate permits for use in food and use in animal feed only.[3][6] StarLink was approved by the EPA for use in animal feed only in May 1998. After the incident the company at first tried to get the application for human consumption approved, and then withdrew the product entirely from the market.[4]:15
