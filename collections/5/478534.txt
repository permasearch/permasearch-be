Reports usually come in the form of sturdy hardcover books with most of the design elements on the spine (the part that a lawyer would be most interested in when searching for a case).  The volume number is usually printed in large type to make it easy to spot.  Gold leaf is traditionally used on the spine for the name of the report and for some decorative lines and bars.
