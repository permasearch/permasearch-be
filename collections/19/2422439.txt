Today I moved the pictures of anhydrous copper sulfate to a gallery at the bottom. The vast majority of readers will be seeking information on the pentahydrate. Also the mineral forms are more esoteric than anything seriously impacting the everyday world. But in case anyone objects, that's what happened and all can be reversed or discussed. --Smokefoot (talk) 21:43, 4 December 2016 (UTC)
