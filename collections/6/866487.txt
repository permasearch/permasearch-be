Some of the fastest modern tests for whether an arbitrary given number     n   {\displaystyle n}   is prime are probabilistic (or Monte Carlo) algorithms, meaning that they have a small random chance of producing an incorrect answer.[125] For instance the Solovay–Strassen primality test on a given number     p   {\displaystyle p}   chooses a number     a   {\displaystyle a}   randomly from     1   {\displaystyle 1}   to     p − 1   {\displaystyle p-1}   and uses modular exponentiation to check whether      a  ( p − 1 )  /  2   ± 1   {\displaystyle a^{(p-1)/2}\pm 1}   is divisible by     p   {\displaystyle p}  .[c] If so, it answers yes and otherwise it answers no. If     p   {\displaystyle p}   really is prime, it will always answer yes, but if     p   {\displaystyle p}   is composite then it answers yes with probability at most 1/2 and no with probability at least 1/2.[126] If this test is repeated     n   {\displaystyle n}   times on the same number, the probability that a composite number could pass the test every time is at most     1  /   2  n     {\displaystyle 1/2^{n}}  . Because this decreases exponentially with the number of tests, it provides high confidence (although not certainty) that a number that passes the repeated test is prime. On the other hand, if the test ever fails, then the number is certainly composite.[127] A composite number that passes such a test is called a pseudoprime.[126]
