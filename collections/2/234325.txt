Rose is used by Davies as an introduction to the shows mythos and fantasy elements. He later underlined similarities between Rose and Gwen Cooper —the leading lady he created for Torchwood — describing both as "the ordinary person who stumbles into something extraordinary and finds herself their equal."[54] Like her successor Martha, Rose is from London; Brett Mills from the University of East Anglia makes the assumption that this is because characters from the capital of the country are "relatable to all British people" because they are seen as "neutral".[55] Rose is introduced alongside a supporting cast in the form of her boyfriend Mickey and mother Jackie which James Chapman cites as "evidence of Davies' attempt to create a social context for the companion".[56] Davies states that the inclusion of these two characters was part of his desire to "make her real" and to "give her a life".[57] He later stated that in giving Rose a mother, a boyfriend and a "sad story with her father" the character has "her own mythology, to match the Doctor."[58] Lindy A. Orthia observes that Rose, like the other companions in Davies' era of Doctor Who, is "drawn from a cosmopolitan vision" in her case because of her class background. Orthia contends that whilst working-class companions had featured previously in the show "none were unskilled workers nor chronically under- or unemployed like Rose, Jackie and Donna".[59] Looking back at the two characters, Davies felt Jackie to be someone who is "holding Rose back" right from the first episode due to her suggestions her daughter be content with menial employment.[60] Piper states that this causes Rose to resent her mum somewhat, although she loves her.[57]
