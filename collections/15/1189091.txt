The Libertarian Party nominated Ed Clark for President and David Koch for Vice President. They received almost one million votes and were on the ballot in all 50 states plus Washington, D.C. Koch, a co-owner of Koch Industries, pledged part of his personal fortune to the campaign. The Libertarian Party platform was the only political party in 1980 to contain a plank advocating for the equal rights of homosexual men and women as well as the only party platform to advocate explicitly for "amnesty" for all illegal non-citizens.[17] The platform was also unique in favoring the repeal of both the National Labor Relations Act and all state Right to Work laws.[17] Clark emphasized his support for an end to the war on drugs.[18] He advertised his opposition to the draft and wars of choice.[19]
