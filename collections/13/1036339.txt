Canadian advertising of Maxwell House has differed. In the early 1980s, actor Ricardo Montalban promoted Maxwell House in commercials with the theme "Morning and Maxwell House." In 1985, the company switched to more upbeat 'Me and Max' campaigns with the common tagline "Hugga Mugga Max" and "Good to the last drop."
