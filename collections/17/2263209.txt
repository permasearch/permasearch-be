In the United States, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) has issued guidelines for these procedures, and the FDA has a number of guidelines as well. There are boards in countries outside of the US which have the same regulations. However, egg donation agencies in the U.S. can legally choose whether to abide by ASRM regulations or not.
