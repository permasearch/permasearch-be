A controversy developed when Kumar Sangakkara called the toss. The toss came up as heads, but the match referee Jeff Crowe did not hear the call over the crowd. It was decided that there would be a re-toss.[14] Sangakkara called heads as the coin was spun the second time. He won the re-toss and elected to bat.[15]
