In November 1970, several days after scoring his 100th goal in all competitions for Cardiff during a 2â€“1 victory over French side Nantes in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup,[12] Toshack completed a transfer to Liverpool. The club had made several previous offers for Toshack that had been rejected however, the Cardiff City board stated that they had left the decision up to the player who chose to move clubs. Cardiff manager Scoular and board member George Edwards both opposed the transfer but were unable to convince chairman Fred Dewey to block the move.[16]
