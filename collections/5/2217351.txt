The English zoologist Edward Bagnall Poulton, author of The Colours of Animals (1890) discovered the countershading of various insects, including the pupa or chrysalis of the purple emperor butterfly, Apatura iris,[1] the caterpillar larvae of the brimstone moth, Opisthograptis luteolata [a] and of the peppered moth, Biston betularia.[b][2][3] However he did not use the term countershading, nor did he suggest that the effect occurred widely.[4]
