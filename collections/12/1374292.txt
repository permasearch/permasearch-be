AQI MechanicsAn individual score (Individual Air Quality Index, IAQI) is assigned to each pollutant and the final AQI is the highest of these six scores. The final AQI value can be calculated either per hour or per 24 hours. The concentrations of pollutants can be measured quite differently. If the AQI value is calculated hourly, then SO2, NO2, CO concentrations are measured as average per 24h, O3 concentration is measured as average per hour and the moving average per 8h, PM2.5  and PM10 concentrations are measured as average per hour and per 24h.  If the AQI value is calculated per 24h, then SO2, NO2, CO, PM2.5  and PM10 concentrations are measured as average per 24h, while O3 concentration is measured as the maximum 1h average and the maximum 24h moving average. The IAQI of each pollutant is calculated according to a formula published by the MEP.[17]
