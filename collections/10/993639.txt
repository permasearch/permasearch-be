Activation of the dorsorostral region of the nucleus accumbens correlates with increases in wanting without concurrent increases in liking.[30] However, the dopaminergic neurotransmission into the nucleus accumbens shell is not only responsible for appetitive motivational salience (i.e., incentive salience) towards rewarding stimuli, but also for aversive motivational salience, which directs behavior away from undesirable stimuli.[34][35][36] In the dorsal striatum, activation of D1 expressing MSNs produces appetitive incentive salience, while activation of D2 expressing MSNs produces aversion. In the NAcc, such a dichotomy is not as clear cut, and activation of both D1 and D2 MSNs is sufficient to enhance motivation,[37][38] likely via disinhibiting the VTA through inhibiting the ventral pallidum.[39][40]
