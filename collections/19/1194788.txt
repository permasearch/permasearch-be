To augment nearly 100 tmcft water availability for the needs of this link canal, Tso Moriri lake/Lingdi Nadi (a tributary of Tso Moriri lake) waters can be diverted to the Sutlej basin by digging a 9 km long gravity canal to connect to the Ungti Chu river.[27] Ungti Chu river, is a tributary of Sutlej river with its drainage area located in Jammu and Kashmir state. Thus water need not be spared by Punjab state for the needs of this canal.[28]
