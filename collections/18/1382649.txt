No qualification other than a driving licence is legally required to use blue lights; whilst provision has been made to require the drivers of emergency vehicles to have suitable training if they will be driving above the speed limit,[44] this has not yet been brought into force. However most organisations will insist that their drivers are trained in emergency driving techniques.  Police forces, specifically, may have a 'Response' qualification and a 'Pursuit' or 'Advanced' qualification, the latter mainly for traffic and specialised units.
