Successive governments have set target dates by which all NHS Trusts are supposed to have reached Foundation status. In 2011 the 116 Trusts then in the pipeline to make applications were required to sign a formal agreement with a deadline for the application to be made. Board members at a number of Trusts which missed the deadline were sacked.[7] It is now officially admitted that a number of Trusts will never reach Foundation Trusts status and a new organisation the NHS Trust Development Authority was established by the Health and Social Care Act 2012 to supervise Trusts which have not reached Foundation status, of which there were 99 in April 2013, 47 of which were not expected to reach Foundation status.[8]
