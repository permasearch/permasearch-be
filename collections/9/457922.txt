In 2006, the rule making for light trucks for model years 2008â€“2011 included a reform to the structure for CAFE standards for light trucks and gave manufacturers the option for model years 2008-2010 to comply with the reformed standard or to comply with the unreformed standard. The reformed standard was based on the vehicle footprint.[33] The unreformed standard for 2008 was set to be 22.5mpg.
