The completion of the first reactor in 1977 was followed by reactor N. 2 (1978), N. 3 (1981), and N. 4 (1983). Two more blocks, numbered 5 and 6, of more or less the same reactor design, were planned at a site roughly 1 kilometre's distance from the contiguous buildings of the four older blocks. Reactor N. 5 was around 70% complete at the time of block 4's explosion and was scheduled to come online approximately six months later, on 7 November 1986. In the aftermath of the disaster, the construction on N. 5 and N. 6 were suspended, and eventually cancelled in April 1989, just days before the third anniversary of the 1986 explosion.[3] Reactor numbers’ 3 and 4 were second generation units, whereas numbers’ 1 and 2 were first-generation units (like those in operation at Kursk Nuclear Power Plant). Second-generation RBMK designs were fitted with a more secure containment structure visible in photos of the facility.[4]
