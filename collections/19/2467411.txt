The drama begins when Nae-sang's business partner, who has embezzled funds from the company, flees the country and leaves behind a mountain of debts and a horde of angry creditors. Faced with the prospect of going to debtors' prison, Nae-sang frantically collects his family (his wife in the middle of a massage session, his son during an ice hockey match and his daughter who had just arrived from LA) and escapes to the countryside.
