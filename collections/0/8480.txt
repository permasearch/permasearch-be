The song's coda features a change of tempo.[16] In the view of musicologist Walter Everett, the latter section marks a progression on previous Beatles songs that similarly revisit aspects of a composition when ending with a coda. In the case of "Ticket to Ride", the section consists of a repeated refrain similar to the last line of the chorus ("My baby don't care"), played over a constant A major chord and set to the double-time rhythm used in the bridge.[17] Lennon said this closing section was one of his "favourite bits" in the song.[18] He also claimed that "Ticket to Ride" was the first heavy metal record ever made.[13] According to MacDonald, the track's heavy sound may have been influenced by Lennon and George Harrison's first encounter with LSD, the precise date for which varies among Beatles biographers.[19]
