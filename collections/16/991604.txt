On 22 February 2007, Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy were broken away from the French overseas department of Guadeloupe to form new overseas collectivities. As a consequence their EU status was unclear for a time. While a report issued by the French parliament suggested that the islands remained within the EU as outermost regions,[10] European Commission documents listed them as being outside the European Community.[11] The legal status of the islands was clarified on the coming into force of the Lisbon Treaty which listed them as an outermost region.[12] However, Saint Barthélemy ceased being an outermost region and left the EU, to become an OCT, on 1 January 2012.
