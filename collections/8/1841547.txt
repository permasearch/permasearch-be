The anime series has been met with overwhelmingly negative reviews. Nicoletta Browne of THEM Anime Reviews finds several problems with this show, among them being the bland characters, poorly constructed plot, and the cliffhanger ending. She concludes that "the laziness and incompetence on display throughout are just depressing to witness."[30] Suzuki admitted that it was a mistake to have his light novel adapted into an anime.[31]
