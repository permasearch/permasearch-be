Titan is never visible to the naked eye, but can be observed through small telescopes or strong binoculars. Amateur observation is difficult because of the proximity of Titan to Saturn's brilliant globe and ring system; an occulting bar, covering part of the eyepiece and used to block the bright planet, greatly improves viewing.[131] Titan has a maximum apparent magnitude of +8.2,[7] and mean opposition magnitude 8.4.[132] This compares to +4.6[132] for the similarly sized Ganymede, in the Jovian system.
