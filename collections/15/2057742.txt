It is discovered that the Key's protectors had turned the Key into a human biologically related to the Summersâ€”Buffy's new sister Dawn. At the same time, they implanted in her family and friends lifelong memories of her. The Watchers' Council, with which Buffy had previously cut ties, aids in Buffy's research of Glory, and the Council reinstates both her and Giles. Due to problems with her mother, Buffy suspects Dawn may be harming Joyce, but they discover that they were caused by a brain tumor. As a result, Buffy, and especially Joyce, begin to accept Dawn as a true part of the family. Upon learning of Joyce's tumor, Buffy leaves her dorm to take care of her mother.
