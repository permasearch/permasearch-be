In the US, the AABB has regulations for DNA paternity and family relationship testing; however, AABB accreditation is not necessary. DNA test results are legally admissible if the collection and the processing follows a chain of custody. Similarly in Canada, the SCC has regulations on DNA paternity and relationship testing; however, this accreditation is recommended, but not necessary.
