Stephanie is Daisy and Onslow's daughter. Her daughter (Daisy and Onslow's granddaughter) is named Kylie and is christened in the episode “The Christening”. Hyacinth does not approve of the name Kylie, nor that Stephanie is unmarried and has two male partners who she describes as 'hippies' (one of which is apparently Kylie's father, but not even they know which one). Stephanie and Kylie are not seen or mentioned again in the show, although in one episode of Series Two while pushing Daddy in a wheelchair Daisy says it reminds her of when she and Onslow used to push the baby in the pram.
