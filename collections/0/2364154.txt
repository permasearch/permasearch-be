The battle of the Hurtgen ended in a German defensive victory[2][3][4] and the whole offensive was a dismal failure for the allies.[1][18] The Americans suffered 33,000 casualties during the course of the battle, including 9,000 non-combat losses and represented a 25% casualty rate.[1] The Germans had also suffered heavy losses with 28,000 casualties - many of these were non combat and prisoners of war.[5]
