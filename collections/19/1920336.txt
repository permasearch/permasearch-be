Japanese laborers from sugarcane plantations would often start small farms in Kona after their employment contracts expired.[8] By 1922 most coffee production in Hawaii had disappeared except in the Kona district. The great Depression of the 1930s depressed prices, and caused many farmers to default on their debts. After World War II, and another frost in South America, prices rose again in the 1950s. Production peaked in 1957 at over 18 million pounds.[9]
