The show often featured quirky, genre-mocking regular features, including "Stupid Pet Tricks"[47] (which had its origins on Letterman's morning show), Stupid Human Tricks,[48] dropping various objects off the roof of a five-story building,[49] demonstrations of unorthodox clothing (such as suits made of Alka-Seltzer,[50] Velcro[51] and suet), a recurring Top 10 list, the Monkey-Cam[52] (and the Audience Cam), a facetious letter-answering segment,[53] several "Film[s] by My Dog Bob" in which a camera was mounted on Letterman's own dog[54] (often with comic results) and Small Town News,[55] all of which would eventually move with Letterman to CBS.
