"You gonna sing that song about robin's eggs and diamonds?" Bob had asked me on the first day of rehearsals. "Which one?" "You know, that one about blue eyes and diamonds..." "Oh", I said, "you must mean 'Diamonds And Rust,' the song I wrote for my husband, David. I wrote it while he was in prison." "For your husband?" Bob said. "Yeah. Who did you think it was about?" I stonewalled. "Oh, hey, what the fuck do I know?" "Never mind. Yeah, I'll sing it, if you like."
