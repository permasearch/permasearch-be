In the 2017 live-action remake, Maurice is played by Kevin Kline. He remains as an inventor, but makes music boxes to help Belle see the world from the comfort of home in the village of Villeneuve. He fled Paris and settled in the provinces with Belle when she was still a baby to protect the both of them from a plague that took the life of Belle's mother and Maurice's wife. True to the original story, Maurice is imprisoned by the Beast for taking a rose from his garden instead of being caught trespassing in the castle. Maurice returns to Villeneuve to find help, but only Gaston and LeFou are willing to do so. However, Gaston only wanted to help in order to get Maurice's blessing for his marriage to Belle. Knowing that Belle has no interest in marrying Gaston, Maurice refuses her hand, prompting Gaston to leave him to die at the hands of the wolves. The Enchantress, disguised as a villager named Agathe, rescues him and takes him back to Villeneuve. Upon his return, Maurice attempts to have Gaston arrested for attempted murder, but Gaston in turn declares him insane and has him committed to an insane asylum. Belle arrives back in time to vindicate Maurice, but both are locked in the asylum wagon while the whole village goes to kill the Beast. After Maurice and Belle make amends regarding Belle now understanding why Maurice was so overly protective of her, thanks to the Beast, Maurice uses his inventor skills to pick the lock on the wagon, allowing Belle to take Phillipe back to the Beast's castle while Maurice remains behind with the dumbfounded Monsieur D'Arque. At the end of the movie, Maurice is seen painting the ballroom dance as everyone celebrates.
