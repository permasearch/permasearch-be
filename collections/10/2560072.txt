Life in the Iron Mills is one of the earliest American Realist stories published.[3] It was Rebecca Harding Davis's first published work, first appearing anonymously in the April 1861 issue of The Atlantic Monthly.[3] After its publication, it caused a literary sensation with its powerful naturalism that anticipated the work of Émile Zola, Theodore Dreiser and Frank Norris.[3] It was reprinted in the early 1970s by the Feminist Press with a well-known introduction by Tillie Olsen and has continued to be an important text for those who study labor and women’s issues.[1][2] Anticipating post-Darwinian naturalism, Davis's most famous depiction of the redundant, dehumanizing servitude of American labor in Life in the Iron-Mills (initially an anonymous publication) may be American literature's first industrial muckraker. Its graphic probe into ethnicity, vocation, and class also encompasses, according to Pfaelzer, what became Davis's most characteristic subject and theme: strong women and powerlessness.[13]
