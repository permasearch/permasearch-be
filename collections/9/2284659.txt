After his confrontation with the Murderer, Seong-moo quickly returns to Korea and sets out to kill the Murderer and give W a happy ending using Kang Chul’s files on Project W as guides. Seong-moo uses his own face to be the Murderer’s and names him Han Sang-hoon. He also plans to kill Sang-hoon through another villain, Han Cheol-ho, and to end W with a cliffhanger showing Kang Chul seeming to have motives to date Seo-hee.
