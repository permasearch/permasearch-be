Marie Mjolnir (マリー・ミョルニル, Marī Myoruniru) is the death scythe with jurisdiction over Oceania. Her weapon form differs between the manga and anime: in the manga, she takes the form of a small black hammer that can transform into a tonfa, the length of which increases with her wielder's soul wavelength;[ch. 61] in the anime, her weapon form is a large gray tonfa by default.ep. 45 She wears an eyepatch covering her left eye adorned with a lightning-bolt-shaped symbol that is present on her weapon form. She is carefree and absent-minded, and easily gets lost in the basement of DWMA with her poor sense of direction.[ch. 24] She is also lovelorn, having gone through a string of failed relationships with people such as Joe "B.J." Buttataki, and desperately wishes to get married. She chooses to oversee Oceania for the light workload provided by the job, believing it would allow her to focus on settling down with a boyfriend.[ch. 23]
