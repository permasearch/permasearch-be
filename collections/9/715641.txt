The winner, announced in 1957, was JÃ¸rn Utzon, a Danish architect. According to legend the Utzon design was rescued from a final cut of 30 "rejects" by the noted Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen. The runner-up was an entry by firm GBQC of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The grand prize was 5,000 Australian pounds.[23] Utzon visited Sydney in 1957 to help supervise the project.[24] His office moved to Palm Beach, Sydney in February 1963.[25]
