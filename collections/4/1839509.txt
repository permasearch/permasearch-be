There is no consensus about how to define a DKM.[5] PPPs can be understood of both as a governance mechanism and a language game.[1]   When understood as a language game, or brand, the PPP phrase can cover hundreds of different types of long term contracts with a wide range of risk allocations, funding arrangements and transparency requirements. And as a brand, the PPP concept is also closely related to concepts such as privatization and the contracting out of government services.[1][5] When understood as a governance mechanism the PPP concept encompasses at least five families of potential arrangements, one of which is the long term infrastructure contract in the model of the UK's Private Finance Initiative (PFI).[1][5][6] Particular types of arrangements have been favored in different countries at different times.
