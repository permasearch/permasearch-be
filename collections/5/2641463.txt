The original mountain bikes were modified heavy cruiser bicycles used for freewheeling down mountain trails. The sport became popular in the 1970s in Northern California, USA, with riders using older, single-speed balloon tire bicycles to ride down rugged hillsides.[8] Joe Breeze, a bicycle frame builder, used this idea and developed what is considered the first mountain bike.[9]
