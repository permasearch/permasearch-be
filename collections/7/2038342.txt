When Oliver comes to visit, he brings a secret about Jake with him: he cheated on Miley. After Jake arrives, Lilly and Oliver attempt to hide the truth from Miley so she can focus on her holiday sketches. She later finds out when a kid overhears Oliver and Lilly talk about Jake. The kid then blabs it out when Miley is around, leading Oliver to show her the picture of Jake with another girl. After an intense sketch with Jake, Miley finally ends it with him. Meanwhile, Jackson pretends to be Rico's father for two-thousand dollars so he can get money to see Siena modeling in Peru.
