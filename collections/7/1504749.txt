At WrestleMania XXX in 2014, Brock Lesnar defeated The Undertaker to end the streak.[5] A year later at Battleground, Lesnar was about to defeat Seth Rollins for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, when the lights went out and Undertaker attacked Lesnar; Lesnar won the match by disqualification but not the title. After a vicious brawl between the two on Raw, they would face in a rematch at SummerSlam. Undertaker defeated Lesnar in controversial fashion; the timekeeper ringing the bell after seeing the Undertaker supposedly indicating submission; since the referee hadn't see a submission and never stopped the match, the match continued. The confusion allowed Undertaker to surprise Lesnar with a low blow before trapping him in the Hell's Gate submission hold, causing Lesnar to pass out, giving Undertaker the win.[6] At Night of Champions, Lesnar was scheduled to face Undertaker one last time in a Hell in a Cell match at the event. This would be their second, as they faced 13 years ago for the WWE Championship at No Mercy 2002.[7]
