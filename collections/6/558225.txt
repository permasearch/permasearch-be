The gaps of non-state highway along the northern coast were finally filled in by the Legislature in 1951, though the State Department of Public Works was not required to maintain the newly added portions immediately. A short connection from near Rockport to SRÂ 1 at Leggett was also included,[37] as the existing county road north from Rockport to Ferndale had not yet been paved.[38] The Leggett connection became State Route 208.[39] The original routing from Fortuna to near Rockport became State Route 211 and other roads.
