In season 9, Chris returns, having used an alias to trick Haley into hiring him as a new partner at the recording studio. He annoys Alex by telling her latest song isn't good but convinces her to help him make it better. He still refers to himself in the third person and believes both Haley and Alex are attracted to him despite their denials. Chris helps Dan save Nathan by causing a distraction and killing one of the guards, allowing Julian to go home (but Julian stays). Chris runs away after killing the guard leaving Dan (and Julian) doing everything else. He returns after months on the run, convinced the gang who kidnapped Nathan is after him and jarred to discover no one even noticed he was gone.
