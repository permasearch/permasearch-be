In this leg's Roadblock, one member had to attach a sail to an Optimist dinghy, then sail across the bay without being given any prior lessons, and with the boat's rudder removed. Team members had to sail their boat to a set of two buoys, each containing one half of their next clue. If they could grab the two clue halves, they could return to the shore to reunite with their partner and open their next clue.
