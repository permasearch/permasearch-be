Sindh is known for its distinct culture which is strongly influenced by Sufism, an important marker of Sindhi identity for both Hindus (Sindh has Pakistan's highest percentage of Hindu residents)[10] and Muslims in the province.[11] Several important Sufi shrines are located throughout the province which attract millions of annual devotees.
