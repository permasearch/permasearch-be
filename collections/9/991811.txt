After the surprising release of starter Quincy Carter on August 4, he was moved to the backup position behind veteran Vinny Testaverde. On Thanksgiving Day, Testaverde had previously missed practice and was limited with a sore right shoulder, so Henson was given the chance to start his first NFL game. He went 4–12 for 31 passing yards and one interception that was returned for a touchdown in the first half, before leaving the game with the score tied at seven. Head coach Bill Parcells opted to insert Testaverde and the team went on to win the game 21–7. Henson finished the season as a backup with 10 of 18 pass attempts completed for 78 yards and one touchdown.
