Jordan was the only player who studied the opposition, carefully watching game tapes.[10] He and the other Americans enjoyed the opportunity to get to know each other in a casual setting, often playing cards all night and, for Jordan, playing several rounds of golf daily with little rest.[8] Opposing teams were nonetheless overwhelmed by the talent of the American roster, losing by an average of 43.8 points per game. The Dream Team was the first to score more than 100 points in every game. Its 117.3 average was more than 15 points more than the 1960 US team.[29] Johnson later recalled, "I look to my right, there's Michael Jordan ... I look to my left, there's Charles Barkley or Larry Bird ... I didn't know who to throw the ball to!"[8][2] Herlander Coimbra of Angola, the Dream Team's first opponent, recalled that "those guys were on another levelâ€”a galaxy far, far away".[10]
