Black is used for those boxes prepared for government whips and for discretion when boxes are designed for travel. A black box with a red stripe is used specifically for confidential papers only seen by the Prime Minister, his or her Private Secretary, and intelligence officials. This box is known as "Old Stripey" due to the red stripe. Permanent Secretaries, who are civil servants rather than MPs or Lords, have similar boxes but coloured green. These have exactly the same function as the ministerial red boxes. Barrow Hepburn and Gale have also made available despatch boxes in green for members of parliament.
