A second mechanism, CAM photosynthesis, is a carbon fixation pathway that evolved in some plants as an adaptation to arid conditions.[22][23] The most important benefit of CAM to the plant is the ability to leave most leaf stomata closed during the day.[24] This reduces water loss due to evapotranspiration. The stomata open at night to collect CO2, which is stored as the four-carbon acid malate, and then used during photosynthesis during the day. The pre-collected CO2 is concentrated around the enzyme RuBisCO, increasing photosynthetic efficiency. More CO2 is then harvested from the atmosphere when stomata open, during the cool, moist nights, reducing water loss.[citation needed]
