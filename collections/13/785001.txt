Deloris, given the name Sister Mary Clarence as part of her cover, struggles to adapt to austere convent life. However, she befriends several of the nuns, including jolly Sister Mary Patrick, meek Sister Mary Robert, and the elderly deadpan Sister Mary Lazarus, who works as choir director. After Mary Clarence is chastised for sneaking out to a bar, the Reverend Mother assigns her to join the convent choir, who are known to be dreadful, to keep her out of trouble. On her first day, Mary Clarence is elected by Mary Lazarus to become the choir director, after its members learn she has a background in music.
