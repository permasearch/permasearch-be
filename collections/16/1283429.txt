There has been increasing recognition of the extent to which birds engage in play. Juvenile common ravens are among the most playful of bird species. They have been observed to slide down snowbanks, apparently purely for fun. They even engage in games with other species, such as playing catch-me-if-you-can with wolves, otters and dogs.[95] Common ravens are known for spectacular aerobatic displays, such as flying in loops or interlocking talons with each other in flight.[96][97]
