The powers of counties arise from state law and vary widely.[17] In Connecticut and Rhode Island,[18][19] counties are geographic entities, but not governmental jurisdictions. At the other extreme, Maryland counties and the county-equivalent City of Baltimore handle almost all services, including public education, although the state retains an active oversight authority with many of these services.[20]
