Conus medullaris syndrome is an injury to the end of the spinal cord, located at about the T12–L2 vertebrae in adults.[27] This region contains the S4–S5 spinal segments, responsible for bowel, bladder, and some sexual functions, so these can be disrupted in this type of injury.[27] In addition, sensation and the Achilles reflex can be disrupted.[27] Causes include tumors, physical trauma, and ischemia.[33]
