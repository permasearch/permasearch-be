In the Arnold household, money is tight and things get worse when the kitchen stove malfunctions. At work, Jack asks for a raise so he can buy Norma a new stove. To his surprise, he receives not only a raise, but a promotion as well--but there's a catch: Jack's boss is forcing him to travel during Thanksgiving, which leaves Norma in charge of preparing Thanksgiving dinner. Can Jack make it home in time to carve the turkey, or will he have to break a family tradition?
