On August 7, Machado hit a game-winning grand slam against the Angels in the seventh inning. A week later he hit his second grand slam of the season. Four days later, Machado hit a walk-off grand slam against the Angels, his third home run of the game and his seventh career grand slam. It was also his second career three-homer game, joining Chris Davis, Goose Goslin, Eddie Murray and Boog Powell as the only Orioles in franchise history with multiple three-homer games. He also became the first Oriole's player to record multiple 3-grand slam seasons, and just the second player in recorded MLB history with back-to-back seasons of 3+ grand slams. On August 23, he hit a walk-off solo home run, the fourth of his career.
