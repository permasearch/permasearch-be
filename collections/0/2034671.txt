Music Choice (abbreviated as MC) is an American company that programs music and produces music-related content for digital cable television, mobile phone and cable modem users in the United States. Music Choice programs dozens of audio music channels for digital cable subscribers, as well as programs and produces music-related content for on-demand customers with access to Music Choice On-Demand. Music Choice also offers video and audio music programming for cell phone customers through Sprint and AT&T. Music Choice's interactive music video network, SWRV, was started in February 2010 and rebranded in 2013 to Music Choice Play. This is because the "slideshow" to change pictures for each music channel runs at a very low frame rate, allowing for the compression ratio to be very high for the MPEG-2 digital video compression used in the ATSC standard, until 2012. The channels on Music Choice do not include interruptions.
