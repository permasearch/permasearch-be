In 1859 Vannerson's autographed prints were published in McClees' gallery of photographic portraits of the senators, representatives & delegates of the thirty-fifth Congress. His portraiture of Native Americans were part of a systematic effort to document members of treaty delegations who came to Washington, D.C.[93] After the Civil War broke out, operating out of Richmond, Vannerson continued making portraits of famous Confederate general officers, using his preferred method, the "salt" print. He is best known for his portrait photographs of Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and J.E.B. Stuart and Stonewall Jackson. Vannerson closed his business and sold his equipment at war's end.[94]
