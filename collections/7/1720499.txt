Mailsort was a five-digit address-coding scheme used by the Royal Mail (the UK's postal service) and its business customers for the automatic direction of mail until 2012.[1] Mail users who could present mail sorted by Mailsort code and in quantities of 4,000 upwards (1,000 upwards for large letters and packets) receive a discounted postal rate.
