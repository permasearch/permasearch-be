It has a half-life of 10.756 years and a maximum decay energy of 687 keV.[1] It decays into stable, non-radioactive rubidium-85. Its most common decay (99.57%) is by beta particle emission with maximum energy of 687 keV and an average energy of 251 keV. The second most common decay (0.43%) is by beta particle emission (maximum energy of 173 keV) followed by gamma ray emission (energy of 514 keV).[2] Other decay modes have very small probabilities and emit less energetic gammas.[1][3] There are 33 other known isotopes of krypton.
