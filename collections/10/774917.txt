Penny plays a more active role in the series after the 5-year jump between seasons 4 and 5. She learns she is going to be a big sister when Lynette becomes pregnant again in season 6, and becomes jealous of the new baby. In the episode "The Chase" she celebrated her 11th birthday, but Tom and Lynette forgot it, resulting in a birthday dinner with only half the family there, and her cake had the name "Polly" on it. Penny then used her parents' credit card to check herself in a hotel. Lynette discovered this after Penny did not come home from school and after one of Penny's friends gave her mom a note to tell she ran away. When baby Paige is born, Penny has a change of attitude and even helps Lynette babysit Paige in "The Thing That Counts is What's Inside", taking her to school with her. Throughout season eight, Penny helps Lynette try to win Tom back many times.[citation needed]
