In the first century the Romans, having trouble controlling the Brigantes in the Yorkshire Dales, built forts at strategic points. In Craven one fort, possibly named Olenacum,[11] is at Elslack 53°56′27″N 2°06′58″W﻿ / ﻿53.94078°N 2.1160°W﻿ / 53.94078; -2.1160.[12] Through this fort passes a Roman road linking two other forts: Bremetennacum at Ribchester Lancashire and another at Ilkley Yorkshire. Archaeologists describe the road as running north-east up Ribblesdale about 0.6 miles (1 km) east of Clitheroe, then bending eastwards near 53°53′35″N 2°20′29″W﻿ / ﻿53.893°N 2.3413°W﻿ / 53.893; -2.3413, then about 0.6 miles (1 km) north of Barnoldswick to pass into Airedale through the low 144 m (472 ft) pass near Thornton-in-Craven.[13][14]
