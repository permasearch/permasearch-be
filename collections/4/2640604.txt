There are discrepancies between the Bopomofo tables and the pinyin table due to the few standardization differences of a few slight characters between the mainland standard putonghua and the Taiwanese standard guoyu. For example, the variant sounds 挼 (ruá; ㄖㄨㄚˊ), 扽 (dèn; ㄉㄣˋ), 忒 (tēi; ㄊㄟ) are not used in guoyu. Likewise the variant sound 孿 (lüán; ㄌㄩㄢˊ) is not recognized in putonghua, or it is folded into (luán; ㄌㄨㄢˊ).  The reading of 厓 (yái; ㄧㄞˊ) is included in the pinyin table.  However, this reading is only recognized as an old reading (舊讀) in putonghua (contemporary reading: yá; ㄧㄚˊ), while it is standard for several characters in guoyu. A few readings reflect a Standard Chinese approximation of a regionalism that is otherwise never encountered in either putonghua or guoyu.  For instance, 覅 (fiào; ㄈㄧㄠˋ) is a borrowing from Shanghainese (and other dialects of Wu Chinese) that is common enough to be included in most large dictionaries, but is usually labeled as a nonstandard regionalism (方, short for 方言 (topolect)), with the local reading viau [vjɔ], which is approximated in Standard Chinese as fiào.
