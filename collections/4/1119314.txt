Suvorov won 63 major battles and never lost one.[44] He was seriously wounded six times in his military career. Suvorov was always located in the most exposed position on the battlefield, for he wanted to share the same risks and discomforts as his soldiers. He never wore warm clothing during cold winters and always slept on a simple bed of straw. Forming a paternal relationship with his soldiers, he appreciated their courage and endurance and in return Suvorov enjoyed the loyalty, respect and affection of his troops. Suvorovâ€™s guiding principle was to detect the weakest point of an enemy and focus a devastating attack upon that area. He would send forth his units in small groups as they arrived on the battlefield in order to sustain momentum. Suvorov utilized aimed fire instead of repeated barrages from line infantry and applied light infantrymen as skirmishers and sharpshooters. He used a variety of army sizes and types of formations against different foes: squares against the Turks, lines against Poles, and columns against the French.[2]
