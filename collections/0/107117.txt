"It Ain't Over 'til It's Over" is a song recorded, written, and produced by American musician Lenny Kravitz for his second studio album, Mama Said (1991). Released as the album's second single in June 1991, the song is a mid-tempo ballad, musically inspired by Motown, Philly soul, and Earth, Wind & Fire (particularly "That's the Way of the World"). The horn line at the end is performed by the Phenix Horns from Earth, Wind & Fire. "That song just came out one day, and I knew it had a classic vibe. And I still love that song very much today", Kravitz said in an interview for VivaMusic.com in 2000.[1] The line is based on a Yogiism, or quotation from Yogi Berra: "It ain't over 'til it's over."[2] It was Kravitz's first top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 of his career, and his highest peak in the chart. English singer Mutya Buena's 2007 song "Real Girl" contains a sample from "It Ain't Over 'til It's Over".
