As I-80 and US 6 approach Adair, the highways curve slightly to the south to bypass the community. There are two interchanges in Adair; both of the intersecting roads, at one time or another, carried US 6. CR G30, the White Pole Road, was the original alignment of US 6,[6] while CR N54 has not carried US 6 since 1980.[7][8] Further east is an interchange with Iowa 25. About one mile (1.6 km) south of the interchange is Freedom Rock. Each year for Memorial Day, the rock is repainted with a patriotic scene by local artist Ray "Bubba" Sorenson II.[9] Near Dexter, I-80 and US 6 graze the northwestern corner of Madison County.[3] After two miles (3.2 km), the routes enter Dallas County and meet CR F60, another former alignment of US 6.[10]
