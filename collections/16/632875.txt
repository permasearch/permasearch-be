Many people with asthma, like those with other chronic disorders, use alternative treatments; surveys show that roughly 50% use some form of unconventional therapy.[187][188] There is little data to support the effectiveness of most of these therapies.  Evidence is insufficient to support the usage of vitamin C.[189] There is tentative support for its use in exercise induced bronchospasm.[190] In people with mild to moderate asthma, treatment with vitamin D supplementation is likely to reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations.[191]
