Allmusic awarded the album 4Â½ stars stating "Altoist Paul Desmond and baritonist Gerry Mulligan always made for a perfect team during their infrequent collaborations. Both of the saxophonists had immediately distinctive light tones, strong wits, and the ability to improvise melodically. ... the interplay between Desmond and Mulligan is consistently delightful. Highly recommended".[3]
