Development and casting of the new series occurred in secret as Three's Company's eighth season progressed. Fellow cast members Richard Kline, Joyce DeWitt, Priscilla Barnes and Don Knotts were kept out of the loop. During a Christmas hiatus in late 1983 producers auditioned several female leads to play Jack's new love interest Vicky Bradford, and eventually decided upon Broadway actress Mary Cadorette. An embarrassing situation arose when Joyce DeWitt accidentally walked in on the auditions after coming to the studio to set up her dressing room as the holiday hiatus was coming to a close. DeWitt was then informed by the producers that Three's Company would end at the close of the season and would spin-off into Three's a Crowd with Ritter as star. DeWitt, who had been with the show from the beginning and weathered the highly publicized contractual dispute between Suzanne Somers, ABC and series producers, was hurt by the secrecy involved with the series ending and the spin-off. DeWitt and Barnes found it difficult to tape the rest of the season, as both actresses learned that their characters would conclude with the series finale. Kline and Knotts, however, were offered an opportunity to have recurring roles on the spin-off; both actors declined the offer (Kline would make a guest appearance on the show in early 1985). Somers reportedly unsuccessfully lobbied to reprise her Three's Company character Chrissy Snow as Jack's love interest in the spin-off. The sense of betrayal that DeWitt felt towards Ritter was short-lived and they reconciled by Three's Company's end.
