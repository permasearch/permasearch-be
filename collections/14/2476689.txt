With the win, the Packers would finish their season at 15â€“1 and also sweep the Lions for the first time since 2009. They also swept the NFC North for the first time ever since the NFL created divisions in 1967. This is also the highest-scoring game between the Lions and the Packers in the history of the rivalry between both teams with a combined total of 86 points. Aaron Rodgers, Charles Woodson, Greg Jennings, and Clay Matthews were put as inactive, after already securing the bye week, to avoid injury.[8]
