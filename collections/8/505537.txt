Let V be a finite dimensional inner product space of dimension n. Recall that every basis of V consists of exactly n linearly independent vectors. Using the Gram–Schmidt process we may start with an arbitrary basis and transform it into an orthonormal basis. That is, into a basis in which all the elements are orthogonal and have unit norm. In symbols, a basis {e1, ..., en} is orthonormal if ⟨ei,ej⟩ = 0 for every i ≠ j and ⟨ei,ei⟩ = ||ei|| = 1 for each i.
