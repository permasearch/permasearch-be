Clinton did win Upstate New York's traditionally Democratic cities and hold onto urban counties upstate. However Trump nevertheless also made gains in urban parts of upstate, which had long been in economic decline, due to his strength in economically distressed areas and his appeal to working class whites who traditionally vote Democratic. Trump's message on trade policy and pledge to halt job outsourcing appealed strongly to the Rust Belt region of the United States, where many local economies had been ravaged by loss of industrial jobs, which extends into Upstate New York cities like Buffalo, Rochester, and Syracuse. In Erie County, where Buffalo is located in Western New York bordering the Great Lakes, Clinton won only 51-44 compared with Obama's 57-41 victory in 2012. Clinton suffered her strongest swings against her in traditionally Democratic Northern New York along the Saint Lawrence River, becoming the first Democrat to lose Franklin County and St. Lawrence County since Michael Dukakis in 1988. Trump won St. Lawrence County 51-42, where Obama had won 57-41, and Franklin County 48-43, where Obama had won 62-36. Clinton barely held onto neighboring Clinton County 47-45, which Obama had also won 62-36.
