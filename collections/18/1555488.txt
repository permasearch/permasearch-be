The opening sequence of Ask This Old House consisted of a GMC van towing the blue Ask This Old House trailer from around Boston and rural Massachusetts before finally reaching its destination, the barn. The twenty-five-second version of the opening sequence shows Silva, the passenger, picking up four coffees from a drive-through. The driver in the forty-second version of the opening sequence shows Kevin O'Connor as the driver. In both versions, after the van pulls into the barn driveway. the footage cuts to Trethewey handing out the coffees to the other three regulars.
