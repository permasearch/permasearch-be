Tom and Anne try to push the quads to make friends with Simone, a new person in town, and the quads agree after realizing that Simone is an inventor with a lot of cool inventions. Simone invites them over to her house and shows off her invisibility cloaks among other inventions. She tells them to keep her inventions secret because she hates when her ideas get out. The next day, Simone's butler comes to invite the quads except Dicky. She continues inviting one less quad until only Nicky is left. During the last invite, the butler asks the quads about Simone's new inventions. They lie to him. Dawn concludes that the butler is the one who has been stealing Simone's ideas, so she and Ricky sneak in to tell Simone the truth, despite not being invited. They hide to wait for the perfect moment, but Simone finds them. Simone reveals that she was only testing them to see if they would reveal her secret and that the butler is actually her dad undercover. Dawn confronts Simone and tells her that if she wants to make real friends, she should learn to trust them instead of testing them.
