Time is also known for its signature red border, first introduced in 1927.[24]  The border has only been changed five times since 1927: The issue released shortly after the September 11 attacks on the United States featured a black border to symbolize mourning. However, this edition was a special "extra" edition published quickly for the breaking news of the event; the next regularly scheduled issue contained the red border. Additionally, the April 28, 2008, Earth Day issue, dedicated to environmental issues, contained a green border.[25] The next change in border was in the September 19, 2011, issue, commemorating the 10th anniversary of September 11 attacks with a metallic silver border. Another silver border was used in the December 31, 2012, issue, noting Barack Obama's selection as Person of the Year. The most recent change was the November 28 / December 5, 2016 issue, featuring a silver border covering the Most Influential Photos of All Time.
