Late in 2009, Google Voice had approximately 1.4 million users, of which 570,000 used the service 7 days a week.[13] This number rose markedly after Google made the transition of its Google Voice service from "invitation only" to be available to all Gmail subscribers in the United States. A Wired blog post quoted a figure of 3.5 million in 2013.[14]
