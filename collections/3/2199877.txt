Most bacteria enter the lungs via small aspirations of organisms residing in the throat or nose.[21] Half of normal people have these small aspirations during sleep.[25] While the throat always contains bacteria, potentially infectious ones reside there only at certain times and under certain conditions.[25] A minority of types of bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Legionella pneumophila reach the lungs via contaminated airborne droplets.[21] Bacteria can spread also via the blood.[22] Once in the lungs, bacteria may invade the spaces between cells and between alveoli, where the macrophages and neutrophils (defensive white blood cells) attempt to inactivate the bacteria.[47] The neutrophils also release cytokines, causing a general activation of the immune system.[48] This leads to the fever, chills, and fatigue common in bacterial pneumonia.[48] The neutrophils, bacteria, and fluid from surrounding blood vessels fill the alveoli, resulting in the consolidation seen on chest X-ray.[49]
