Even during World War I, the phrase met with some degree of skepticism; the British politician David Lloyd George is reputed to have said, "This war, like the next war, is a war to end war."[7] As it became apparent that the war had not succeeded in ending war, the phrase took on a more cynical tone. The British staff officer Archibald Wavell, a future field marshal and viceroy of India, said despondently of the Paris Peace Conference, "After the 'war to end war', they seem to have been in Paris at making the 'Peace to end Peace'."[8] Wells himself used the phrase in an ironic way in the novel The Bulpington of Blup (1932).[9] Walter Lippmann wrote in Newsweek in 1967, "The delusion is that whatever war we are fighting is the war to end war", while President Richard Nixon, in his "Silent Majority" speech, said, "I do not tell you that the war in Vietnam is the war to end wars".[2]
