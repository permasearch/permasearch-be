However, the writers strike began that same month and placed the film on hold. Warner Bros. had to let the options lapse for the cast,[48] but development was fast tracked once more in February 2008 when the strike ended. Warner Bros. and Miller wanted to start filming immediately,[49] but production was pushed back three months.[32] Originally, the majority of Justice League: Mortal was to be shot at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney,[36] with other locations scouted nearby at local colleges,[35] and Sydney Heads doubling for Happy Harbor.[27] The Australian Film Commission had a say with casting choices, giving way for George Miller to cast Gale, Palmer and Keays-Bryne, all Australian natives. The production crew was composed entirely of Australians, but the Australian government denied Warner Bros. a 40 percent tax rebate as they felt they had not hired enough Australian actors.[36][50] Miller was frustrated, stating that "A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the Australian film industry is being frittered away because of very lazy thinking. They're throwing away hundreds of millions of dollars of investment that the rest of the world is competing for and, much more significantly, highly skilled creative jobs."[51] Production offices were then moved to Vancouver Film Studios in Canada. Filming was pushed back to July 2008, while Warner Bros was still confident they could produce the film for a summer 2009 release.[52][53]
