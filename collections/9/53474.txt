The gallbladder can be affected by gallstones, formed by material that cannot be dissolved â€“ usually cholesterol or bilirubin, a product of haemoglobin breakdown. These may cause significant pain, particularly in the right upper corner of the abdomen, and are often treated with removal of the gallbladder called a cholecystectomy. Cholecystitis, inflammation of the gallbladder, has a wide range of causes, including result from the impaction of gallstones, infection, and autoimmune disease.
