Ownership of land is a much more complex proposition than simply acquiring all the rights to it. It is useful to imagine a bundle of rights that can be separated and reassembled. A "bundle of sticks" - in which each stick represents an individual right â€“ is a common analogy made for the bundle of rights. Any property owner possesses a set of "sticks" related directly to the land.[4]
