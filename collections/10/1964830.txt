Functions during or after modulations, and especially tonicizations, are often notated in relation to the function—in the original key—of the chord being tonicized. For example, in C major, a D major chord is notated as II, but during a tonicization of a G major chord, it would be notated as it is functioning in G major but with the G also notated as it functions as the dominant of C major. The standard notation for this is: V/V (five of five). For example, the twelve bar blues turnaround, I–V–IV–I, considered tonally inadmissible, may be interpreted as a doubled plagal cadence, IV/V–V–IV–I (IV/V–I/V, IV/I–I/I).
