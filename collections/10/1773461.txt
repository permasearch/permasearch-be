In 2006, early concepts of the Raspberry Pi were based on the Atmel ATmega644 microcontroller. Its schematics and PCB layout are publicly available.[200] Foundation trustee Eben Upton assembled a group of teachers, academics and computer enthusiasts to devise a computer to inspire children.[188] The computer is inspired by Acorn's BBC Micro of 1981.[201][202] The Model A, Model B and Model B+ names are references to the original models of the British educational BBC Micro computer, developed by Acorn Computers.[172] The first ARM prototype version of the computer was mounted in a package the same size as a USB memory stick.[203] It had a USB port on one end and an HDMI port on the other.
