Wallace and Gromit spearhead the fundraising for two children's charities,[92] Wallace & Gromit's Children's Foundation,[93] which supports children's hospices and hospitals in the United Kingdom, and Wallace and Gromit's Grand Appeal,[94] the Bristol Children's Hospital Charity. In July 2013, 80 giant fibreglass decorated sculptures of Gromit were distributed around Bristol as part of a Nick Park-inspired project to raise funds for the charity. The project is named Gromit Unleashed and sculptures were decorated by a range of artists and celebrities, including Joanna Lumley, Sir Peter Blake, Trevor Baylis and Jools Holland.[95] In 2015 a similar event took place featuring Shaun the Sheep sculptures.
