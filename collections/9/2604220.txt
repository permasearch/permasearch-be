The digit 3 was chosen to minimise nuisance calls:[citation needed] on seeing an unfamiliar '020x' code, some callers would assume that it was an old pre-PhONEday code and would mistakenly 'correct' it to 0120x.  01203 is the only 0120x code that is not valid, the old Coventry code 01203 having been changed to 024.
