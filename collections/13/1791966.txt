The action in the development section begins with a full step descent into B major, and instability ensues as interplay between the "fate" motif and phrases from the original theme are played off each other. A series of modulations, each seeming to lead further away from the tonic, eventually leads the path back to the recapitulation. Starting with a murky rumble in the basses, the music gathers strength with a thrilling set of arpeggios in the violins with support from the brass, which repeat the "fate" motif with great alacrity. Finally, a "shocking digression"[4] in the bass line leads to a modulation to Fâ™¯, setting the stage for the recapitulation.
