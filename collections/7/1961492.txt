In October 2016, the U.S. state of Ohio announced that it would resume executions in January 2017, using the midazolam-vecuronium bromide-potassium chloride cocktail, but this was blocked by a Federal judge.[78][79] On 25 July 2017, Ronald Phillips was executed with a three-drug cocktail including midazolam after the Supreme Court refused to grant a stay.[80] Prior to this, the last execution in Ohio had been that of Dennis McGuire.[81] Murderer Gary Otte's lawyers unsuccessfully challenged his Ohio execution, arguing that midazolam might not protect him from serious pain when the other drugs are administered. He died without incident in about 14 minutes on September 13, 2017.[82]
