After searching the woods for further clues, the group stumble across the eerie Bide-A-Wee Rest Home, and are shown to the sitting-room by the butler, Sockett (Bernard Bresslaw). Sockett informs the mistress of the house, Valeria (Fenella Fielding), of their presence, and she awakens her electrically-charged brother, Dr. Orlando Watt (Kenneth Williams). Dr Watt speaks to the three men, who are frightened from the house when Dr. Watt vanishes and re-appears when his electrical charge runs down.
