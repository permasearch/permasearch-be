The Aruba island rattlesnake is native to the island of Aruba in the southern Caribbean Sea near Venezuela. Habitat degradation, especially for tourism development, has reduced the Aruba Island rattlesnake population to fewer than approximately 200 individuals in the wild, and it is considered critically endangered. The DZS provides financial support to the Aruba Island Rattlesnake SSP to help restore habitat on Aruba, and as part of the SSP, Aruba rattlesnakes are often housed at the HRCC.
