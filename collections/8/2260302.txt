Los Cerritos Middle School Jazz Band is the first California middle school in 63 years to receive an invitation to play at the 64th annual 2010 Midwest Band Clinic, an international band and orchestra conference Dec. 15 through 18. The performance was scheduled for Dec. 15 at McCormick Place West in Chicago, Ill. School representatives say the invitation is the highest honor a school band can receive. The Midwest Band Clinic serves music educators with the goal of improving the field of music education. Founded in 1946, the clinic is one of the worldâ€™s largest conferences for instrumental music educators, attended annually by 15,000 musicians and teachers. The anticipated Chicago audience for Los Cerritos was up to 1,000 educators and musicians. Several professional musicians from the Southern California area and other parts of the United States performed with the students. There are now currently (as of 2010) two Jazz Bands in Los Cerritos. Originally called Jazz 1 and Jazz 2, Jazz 2 being the beginning Jazz band and Jazz 1 being the advanced, the Los Cerritos band director, Mr. Blake, changed the names of the bands to East Coast (Jazz 2) and West Coast (Jazz 1) Jazz bands. This naming system bears a striking resemblance to the A.M. and P.M. Jazz Bands of the local Thousand Oaks High School (TOHS). For the following 2013 school year, West Coast Jazz Band may be cut, due to a lack of proper funding for the dwindling number of returning and incoming band students.
