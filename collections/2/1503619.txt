Command and control management utilizes a linear problem solving approach where a perceived problem is solved through controlling devices such as laws, threats, contracts and/or agreements.[46] This top-down approach is used across many disciplines and works best with problems that are relatively simple, well-defined and work in terms of cause and effect.[47] The application of command and control management has often attempted to control nature in order to improve product extractions, establish predictability and reduce threats.[48] Some obvious examples of command and control management actions include: the use of herbicides and pesticides to safeguard crops in order to harvest more products; the culling of predators in order to obtain larger, more reliable game species; and the safeguarding of timber supply, by suppressing forest fires.
