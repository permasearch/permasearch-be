Possession is colloquially expressed by word order. The possessor is placed after the thing that is possessed.[47]:160 Alternatively, in more complex sentences or when emphasis is required, a possessive construction using the word របស់ (/rɔbɑh/ ~ /ləbɑh/, "property, object") may be employed. In formal and literary contexts, the possessive particle នៃ (nɨj) is used:[41]:358
