Stories for the home front recounted the soldiers' need for their sweethearts and families to remain as they were, because they were what the soldier were fighting for.[284] As the war ended, real and fictional stories often featured women who left war work to return to their homes and to raise children.[285] Women, particularly wives whose husbands were at war, and children were often portrayed as what was at risk in the war.[286]
