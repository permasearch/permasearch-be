With Valentine's Day approaching, Bender decides to start a computer dating service. Fry worries that his new relationship with Amy is becoming too serious, so he asks Leela to come with them on a picnic to Europa they had planned. When she refuses, Fry asks Dr. Zoidberg to come with them. Zoidberg joins them, but when Fry asks him to drive, he accidentally pulls the wheel off, crashing the car. Fry wakes up to find Zoidberg telling him that his body was badly damaged in the crash. Fry, in shock, discovers his head was grafted onto Amy's shoulder in order to be kept alive. After returning to Earth, Fry breaks up with an unwilling Amy, and she makes Valentine's Day plans with another man.
