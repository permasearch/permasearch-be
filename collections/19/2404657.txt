"Microcephaly" means "smallheadedness" (New Latin microcephalia, from Ancient Greek μικρός mikrós "small" and κεφαλή kephalé "headed"[20]). However, the older, slightly more traditional classification, "microencephaly," translates to, "smallness of brain." Similar to various sociocultural updates in linguistics, the term is deemed obsolete by modern medical culture. Therefore, because the size of the brain is most often determined by the size of one's skull, the use of classifying, "microencephaly," in more modern literature, is today almost always implied when discussing cases wherein microcephaly manifests.[21]
