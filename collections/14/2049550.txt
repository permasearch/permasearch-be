The women's side was also fast: Aselefech Mergia ran a course and Ethiopian record time of 2:19:31 hours to win, becoming the seventh fastest woman ever. For the first time in history, the top three runners of a race all finished under two hours and twenty minutes: debutante and runner-up Lucy Wangui Kabuu became the eighth fastest woman with a time of 2:19:34 hours and Mare Dibaba became the 15th fastest woman in 2:19:52 hours. Behind her, fellow Ethiopians Bezunesh Bekele and Aberu Kebede moved up to the 16th and 17th fastest of all-time.[4]
