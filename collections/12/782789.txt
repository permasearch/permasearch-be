Some bacteria have developed resistance to multiple antibiotics, so-called "superbugs." Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one example, and can be life-threatening without the appropriate therapy. Other examples of emerging resistant organisms include vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing E coli (ESBL).
