In stature and seniority, General of the Army Douglas MacArthur was the Army's foremost general. The son of Lieutenant General Arthur MacArthur, Jr., a recipient of the Medal of Honor for action during the American Civil War,[8] he had graduated at the top of his West Point class of 1903,[9] but never attended an advanced service school except for the engineer course in 1908.[10] He had a distinguished combat record in World War I, and had served as Chief of Staff of the United States Army from 1930 to 1935, working closely with Presidents Herbert Hoover and Franklin Roosevelt, despite occasional clashes over the military budget.[11] He would later compare Roosevelt's "extraordinary self-control"[12] with Truman's "violent temper and paroxysms of ungovernable rage".[13]
