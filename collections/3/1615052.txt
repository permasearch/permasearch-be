In addition to stamps, postage franking can be in the form of printed or stamped impressions made in an authorized format and applied directly by a franking machine, postage meter, computer generated franking labels or other similar methods ("Postage Evidencing Systems"),[8] any form of preprinted "postage paid" notice authorized by a postal service permit ("Indicia"),[9] or any other marking method accepted by the postal service and specified by its regulations, as proof of the prepayment of the appropriate fees. Postal franking also includes "Postage Due" stamps or markings affixed by a postal service which designate any amount of  insufficient or omitted postage fees to be collected on delivery.[10]
