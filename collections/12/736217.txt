Lineman's pliers can be used to bend or straighten solid wire or sheet metal components, especially in cases where smaller pliers don't offer enough mechanical advantage. The square nose and flat side of Lineman pliers is particularly useful for creating accurate right angle bends. Lineman's pliers can be used to cut armored cable of type MC, although other tools may be quicker.
