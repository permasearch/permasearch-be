In the limit when     σ   {\displaystyle \sigma }   tends to zero, the probability density     f ( x )   {\displaystyle f(x)}   eventually tends to zero at any     x ≠ μ   {\displaystyle x\neq \mu }  , but grows without limit if     x = μ   {\displaystyle x=\mu }  , while its integral remains equal to 1. Therefore, the normal distribution cannot be defined as an ordinary function when     σ = 0   {\displaystyle \sigma =0}  .
