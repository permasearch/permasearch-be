The song was recorded by Les Brown and His Band of Renown, and on different occasions by Stan Kenton and his band, once with a band vocal, once with The Four Freshmen and June Christy, once with Tex Ritter. Billy Ward and His Dominoes recorded the song, coupled with When the saints go marching in, for Decca during the 1950s. During the 1960s recordings were made by Dion and the Belmonts (1960), The Platters 1962, and The Impressions (1964). In 1991, seminal Swiss Industrial music band The Young Gods released their album of Kurt Weill songs, The Young Gods Play Kurt Weill, including an almost ambient version of September Song, which remains an audience favorite at their concerts to this day. Peter, Paul & Mary covered the song for their 1996 album LifeLines.
