Historically, Glenwood Springs has been most visited by residents of other parts of Colorado, but tourism from the rest of America and the world has been the most rapid source of growth recently.[44] Excellent connectivity is provided throughout town[45] by a local fiber-optic loop[46] with multiple uplinks due to Glenwood's railroad heritage.
