In 2011, The Rock's return generated a lot of buzz, an average of 4.7 million people watched that episode of Raw, but 7.4 million tuned in just during The Rockâ€™s promo.[213] His return also led the following episode of Raw on March 7 to be the highest rated episode of that year.[214] In that same year, The Rock wrestled his first match in years at 2011 Survivor Series in Madison Square Garden. The event sold out in less than 90 minutes[215] and was the highest attended Survivor Series in almost a decade (since 2002). The Rock was also part of the highest rated Raw segment in 2012 in a segment on Raw 1000 with CM Punk and Daniel Bryan which drew a 4.3 rating and was also part of the highest rated overrun of that year (4.4) the same night.[216]
