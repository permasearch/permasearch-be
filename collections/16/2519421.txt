Mitski Miyawaki was born on September 27, 1990 in Japan to an American father and Japanese mother. She grew up surrounded by her father's Smithsonian folk recordings and mother's 1970s Japanese pop CDs. Because of her father's job, which she prefers to not disclose, she and her family moved frequently, living in thirteen countries, including Turkey, China, Malaysia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, before eventually settling in New York City.[1] After enrolling at Hunter College to study film, she decided to pursue music instead and transferred to Purchase College's Conservatory of Music, where she studied studio compositions. During her time at Purchase College, she recorded and self-released her piano-based first and second albums, Lush (2012) and Retired from Sad, New Career in Business (2013), as student projects.[2][3][4] After graduating, she served as the vocalist for the short-lived prog-metal band Voice Coils,[5] and began work on her third studio album, Bury Me at Makeout Creek, which was released on November 11, 2014 through Double Double Whammy. The album represented a sonic departure from Mitski's orchestral and classical piano background found in her first two albums, exchanging it for raw, impulsive guitar.[4] It garnered critical acclaim from numerous publications.[6][7][8][9]
