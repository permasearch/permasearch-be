The Hebrew common greeting on Rosh Hashanah is Shanah Tovah (Hebrew: שנה טובה‎‎) (pronounced [ʃaˈna toˈva]), which translated from Hebrew means "[have] a good year".[32] Often Shanah Tovah Umetukah (Hebrew: שנה טובה ומתוקה‎‎), meaning "A Good and Sweet Year", is used.[33] In Yiddish the greeting is אַ גוט יאָר "a gut yor" ("a good year") or אַ גוט געבענטשט יאָר "a gut gebentsht yor" ("a good blessed year"). The formal Sephardic greeting is Tizku Leshanim Rabbot ("may you merit many years"), to which the answer is Ne'imot VeTovot ("pleasant and good ones"). Less formally, people wish each other "many years" in the local language.[citation needed]
