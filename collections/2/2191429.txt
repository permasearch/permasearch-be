New Zealand led 12â€“6 at the break, with tries from Laumape and Jordie Barrett, but the Lions fought their way back into the game, and eventually five penalties (four from Owen Farrell and one from Elliot Daly) were enough to draw the game.[70] There was controversy with two minutes left when Ken Owens was initially adjudged to have handled the ball in an offside position after Liam Williams tried to claim a high kick under pressure from Kieran Read; with the scores level, referee Poite initially awarded a penalty in kicking range before overturning it to a scrum after discussion with the video officials.[71][72][73]
