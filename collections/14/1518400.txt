In a 2009 interview, Manfred Nowak, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture, said: "The Chinese government has yet to come clean and be transparent ... It remains to be seen how it could be possible that organ transplant surgeries in Chinese hospitals have risen massively since 1999, while there are never that many voluntary donors available."[30] Nowak submitted two reports to the United Nations Human Rights Council, formally requesting that the Chinese government respond to the allegations.[30]
