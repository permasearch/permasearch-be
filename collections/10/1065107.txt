The airport improvements, including a new hangar, the new 4,000 ft (1,219 m) main runway, and night-time landing lights, were completed in 1962. The new lights allowed the first use of the airport for night-time flights since World War II when Norwegian flyers practised night-time flights.[43] Night-time flights began on April 15, 1963, and the airport extended its closing hour from one half-hour before sun-down to midnight.[44] The Government of Canada spent $3,118,500 on the improvements[45] ($25.3 million in 2017 dollars).[23]
