Cory embraces the idea of "first love" at the end of the school year, until he realizes Riley is among those experiencing it with Lucas. As Cory desperately tries to keep them apart, Lucas decides he wants to go about things right by asking Cory and Topanga for their blessing to date their daughter. Feeling that Riley is too young to be dating, Cory agrees to the date on the condition that it is a double date, with Maya and Farkle accompanying the two. Meanwhile, Auggie and Ava quickly get "engaged" and then "married", but Topanga escorts the "bride" out of the Matthews' apartment. Uncle Josh also pays a visit with plans to attend a pre-college program at NYU all summer. He takes an interest in a tour guide from the university, but being three years older than him, she turns him down. Maya understands what he is going through after experiencing same rejection from him. After Josh leaves the train that Riley, Maya, Farkle, and Lucas are going to their dates on, Riley sees how sad Maya is and Lucas notices too, telling Riley to go comfort her. After, Maya pushes Riley into Lucas' lap, paralleling the scene in the first episode.
