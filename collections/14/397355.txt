Before April 1, 2015, Virginia was the only state in the nation that did not have any standalone human trafficking laws. SB 1188[177] and HB 1964[178] were passed on April 1, 2015.  They were the first bills in Virginia to define sex trafficking, establish penalties, criminalized child sex trafficking as a Class 3 felony without the need to prove force, intimidation or deception, and criminalized recruitment for commercial sex.  It also provides provisions for protecting and identifying sex trafficking victims.[179]  Robert Dillard was the first man charged under this law.[180]
