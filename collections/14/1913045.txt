Another type of metallocene catalysts produce syndiotactic polypropylene.[26] These macromolecules also coil into helices (of a different type) and crystallize.  Atactic polypropylene is an amorphous rubbery material. It can be produced commercially either with a special type of supported Ziegler-Natta catalyst or with some metallocene catalysts.
