Decommissioning a reactor that has undergone a meltdown is inevitably more difficult and expensive. Three Mile Island was decommissioned 14 years after its incident for $837 million.[82] The cost of the Fukushima disaster cleanup is not yet known, but has been estimated to cost around $100 billion.[83] Chernobyl is not yet decommissioned, different estimates put the end date between 2013[84] and 2020.[85]
