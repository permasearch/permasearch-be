A disadvantage compared to the single-elimination format is that at least twice the number of matches have to be conducted. Since each player has to lose twice and since the tournament ends when only one player remains, in a tournament for n competitors there will be either 2n − 2 or 2n − 1 games depending on whether or not the winner was undefeated during the tournament. This may result in a scheduling hardship for venues where only one facility for play is available.
