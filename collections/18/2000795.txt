Prior to 1960, the event occurred only eight times.[6] The first Major League player to be credited with the feat was Ed "Cannonball" Crane of the New York Giants on October 4, 1888.[7] It has occurred in Major League Baseball 76 times.[8][9] Chuck Finley accomplished the feat on May 12 and August 15, 1999, with the Anaheim Angels and again on April 16, 2000, with the Cleveland Indians. Pete Richert of the Los Angeles Dodgers is the only pitcher to do it in his MLB debut (April 12, 1962, against the Cincinnati Reds).[10] Steve Delabar struck out 4 men in the 10th inning, and recorded the win in a 3-2 victory over the Chicago White Sox on August 13, 2012, making him the first pitcher in major league history to record four strikeouts in an extra inning.[11]
