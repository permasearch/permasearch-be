The group is then attacked by the Founder and Aiden, only for him to betray her and knock her, Jesse and possibly Lukas over the side. They land safely on land below, which is surprising to the Founder, as she thought there was nothing but an abyss. She and Jesse (Lukas will sit this out, feeling weak from fighting Aiden in the palace) build a tower back to Sky City, which is now overrun with monsters Aiden summoned from spawn eggs laid by the Eversource chicken. Though Jesse defeats Aiden and his crownies, the city is lost and the remaining townsfolk get into a waterfall and flow safely down to the land below. After deciding what to do with Aiden and the Eversource and how the new government should be run, Jesse and the group use a portal they and the Founder discovered while building the tower to return home, only to find themselves in a corridor filled with portals.
