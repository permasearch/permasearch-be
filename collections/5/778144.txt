Article 8 of the Edict allowed Jews to own land and take up municipal and university posts.[93] The Jews were free to practise their religion and their traditions were protected. Nevertheless, unlike the reforms in the Kingdom of Westphalia, the Edict of Emancipation in Prussia did have some limitations â€“ Jews could not become army officers or have any government or legal role, but were still required to do military service.
