Many residents of the Corbett-Terwilliger and Lair Hill neighborhoods, over which the tram passes, were concerned the cars would be an invasion of privacy and lead to lower property values.[47]  Initially, residents were promised that overhead power lines would be buried as part of the project, but as cost overruns mounted, this plan was scrapped.[48]  Neighborhood opponents of the tram have cited other reasons for opposing the tram's construction, including the fact that the North Corbett neighborhood is a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[49]  Some residents filed a lawsuit against the city and OHSU, claiming that they own the "airspace" above their properties.[50]  The city later offered to purchase homes directly under the tram route at fair market value.[50]
