Carlene is recently retired and a new grandmother. She headed for Manchester Coach Station and boarded a coach to London, wearing a disguise. However, the hunters found her on CCTV, and although she convinced the coach driver to divert past Milton Keynes (where she was planning to get off), she was caught in London on the first day.
