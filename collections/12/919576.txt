The knowledge of anomaly of volcanoes, along with density of the volcanic material, would be useful in determining the lithospheric composition and crustal evolution of different volcanic edifices.[27] It has been suggested that the extruded lava could range from andesite (low density) to basaltic (high density) and the composition could change during the construction of the volcanic shield, which contributes to the anomaly.[27] Another scenario is it is possible for high density material intruded beneath the volcano.[27][6] Such setting has already been observed over the famous Syrtis major, which has been inferred to have an extinct magma chamber with 3300Â kg m3 underlying the volcano, evident from positive Bouguer anomaly.[6]
