During spot welding, the large electric current induces a large magnetic field, and the electric current and magnetic field interact with each other to produce a large magnetic force field too, which drives the melted metal to move very fast at a velocity up to 0.5Â m/s. As such, the heat energy distribution in spot welding could be dramatically changed by the fast motion of the melted metal.[10][11][12] The fast motion in spot welding can be observed with high speed photography.[13]
