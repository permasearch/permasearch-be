In 1970, Neruda was nominated as a candidate for the Chilean presidency, but ended up giving his support to Salvador Allende, who later won the election and was inaugurated in 1970 as the first democratically elected socialist head of state.[37][43] Shortly thereafter, Allende appointed Neruda the Chilean ambassador to France, lasting from 1970â€“1972; his final diplomatic posting. During his stint in Paris, Neruda helped to renegotiate the external debt of Chile, billions owed to European and American banks, but within months of his arrival in Paris his health began to deteriorate.[37] Neruda returned to Chile two and half years later due to his failing health.
