The Administration office was completely transformed into a modern functional office space and the Council area on the first floor upgraded. The NW sector and sideshow area redevelopment was completed with the installation of underground drainage, the construction of new roads and the formation of white graveled exhibition bays which double as a car parking area out of Show time. The area is now proclaimed by the operators to be one of the most functional sideshow areas in Australia. The underground high voltage power system was extended and there were improvements in and around the Dog Pavilion. Work began on the redevelopment of the eastern Kingsway. A sum of $1.3 million was expended on capital improvements during 1990.
