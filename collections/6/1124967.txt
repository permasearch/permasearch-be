The traditional theory has been that these early migrants moved into the Beringia land bridge between eastern Siberia and present-day Alaska around 40,000â€“17,000 years ago,[35] when sea levels were significantly lowered during the Quaternary glaciation.[33][36] These people are believed to have followed herds of now-extinct pleistocene megafauna along ice-free corridors that stretched between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets.[37] Another route proposed is that, either on foot or using primitive boats, they migrated down the Pacific coast to South America.[38] Evidence of the latter would since have been covered by a sea level rise of hundreds of meters following the last ice age.[39] Both routes may have been taken, although the genetic evidences suggests a single founding population.[40] The micro-satellite diversity and distributions specific to South American Indigenous people indicates that certain populations have been isolated since the initial colonization of the region.[41]
