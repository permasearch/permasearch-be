In their annual rivalry game, Alabama met their rival to the north in the Tennessee Volunteers and was victorious 29–9.[70][71] Teams traded field goals in the first quarter with Leigh Tiffin converting from 39 and 43 yards for Alabama and Daniel Lincoln converting one from 31 yards for Tennessee to give the Tide a 6–3 at the end the first quarter.[72] In the second quarter, the Crimson Tide offense moved down the field with Glen Coffee scoring on a three-yard touchdown run.[72] With 2:41 remaining in the first half, the Volunteers started their final drive of the half at their own 22-yard line. The Tennessee offense quickly moved the ball down the field with several key Nick Stephens completions.[72] A 5-yard procedure penalty on the offense set up a third-and-six on Alabama's 19-yard line.[72] Stephens completed a pass to Lucas Taylor; however, it did not count as Taylor was flagged for offensive pass interference.[72] After failing to gain enough yardage on third down, the Volunteers again attempted a field goal, and after a timeout in attempt to "ice the kicker" by Nick Saban, Lincoln missed his second field goal of the game to give Alabama a 13–3 halftime lead.[72]
