One support item can be used each turn, including items that restore health or provide beneficial status effects that improve the character's abilities.[1] Weapons and armor can be enhanced using optional "strap-ons",[19] such as fake vampire teeth, bubble gum,[22] or a Jewpacabra claw.[19] These items can cause enemies to bleed and lose health,[22] weaken enemy armor, boost player health[19] or steal health from opponents, and disgust foes to make them "grossed out" and cause them to vomit.[15] Additionally, the "strap-ons" can set opponents on fire, electrocute them,[23] or freeze them.[20] Some enemies are immune to one or more of these effects.[20] Enemies can deflect certain attacks entirely; those in a riposte stance will deflect any melee attack, requiring the use of ranged weapons, while those in reflect stance will deflect ranged weapons.[1]
