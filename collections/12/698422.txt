The name Tervingi may mean "forest people".[7] This is supported by evidence that geographic descriptors were commonly used to distinguish people living north of the Black Sea both before and after Gothic settlement there, by evidence of forest-related names among the Tervingi, and by the lack of evidence for an earlier date for the name pair Tervingiâ€“Greuthungi than the late 3rd century.[14] That the name Tervingi has pre-Pontic, possibly Scandinavian, origins still has support today.[15]
