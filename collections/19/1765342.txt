The song is also sung by some motorized and parachute units of the Italian army, most especially by the 185th Paratroopers Division Folgore under the title of "Sui Monti e Sui Mar". In France, the lyrics were adapted slightly to become the Marche des Chars used by the 501e régiment de chars de combat,[4] and the tune was borrowed for the French Foreign Legion's song Képi Blanc.[5]
