The 2014 season started off with 6 straight victories and a #5 national ranking heading into a showdown with #2 Florida State in Tallahassee, Florida.[505] FSU won that game 31–27, on a controversial offensive pass interference call that brought back a last second Notre Dame touchdown.[506] The Fighting Irish bounced back with a win against Navy[507] before dropping their final 4 games of the season. They did win the Music City Bowl by defeating the LSU Tigers and finished the season at an 8–5 record.[508][506] After the 2014 season, the Irish again changed offensive coordinators, as Mike Denbrock stepped down from the position due to prostate cancer and returned to coaching the team's receivers.[509]
