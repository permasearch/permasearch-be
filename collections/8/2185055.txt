The lower Rogue passes through the Southern Oregon Coast Range, where forests include Douglas-fir, western hemlock, tanoak, Port Orford cedar, and western redcedar, and at lower elevations Sitka spruce.[115] Coastal forests extending from British Columbia in the north to Oregon (and the Rogue) in the south are "some of the most productive in the world".[23] The coastal region, where it has not been altered by humans, abounds with ferns, lichens, mosses, and herbs, as well as conifers.[23]
