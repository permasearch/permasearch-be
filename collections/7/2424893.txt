Onion soups have been popular at least as far back as Roman times. Throughout history, they were seen as food for poor people, as onions were plentiful and easy to grow. The modern version of this soup originates in Paris, France in the 18th century,[1][2] made from beef broth, and caramelized onions. It is often finished by being placed under a grill in a ramekin with croutons and ComtÃ© melted on top. The crouton on top is reminiscent of ancient soups (see history of soup).
