In their 50-year "Golden Jubilee" anniversary 1948–49 season, Bob Jackson's Portsmouth side were tipped to be the first team of the 20th century to win the Football League and FA Cup "double", but lost in the FA Cup semi-final against Leicester City. The 1948–49 season also saw them record a home attendance of 51,385, a club record which still stands to this day.
