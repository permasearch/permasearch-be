FDNY squad companies are also composed of specially trained firefighters of the New York Fire Department. Squad companies were initially established by the FDNY to serve as "manpower companies" to supplement the manpower and operations of engine and ladder companies. Today, squad companies can function as either Engine or ladder companies at the scene of a fire, but are also equipped with similar equipment and specialized tools as the rescue company. In particular, members of a squad company are highly trained in mitigating hazardous materials (hazmat) incidents, supplementing the FDNY's single hazmat company. Squad companies also operate a Freightliner M2-based medium rescue as a second piece of apparatus in response to Haz-Mat incidents.
