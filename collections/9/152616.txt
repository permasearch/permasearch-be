Since about 2005, computer scientists have attempted to develop automated methods to infer aesthetic quality of images.[67][68][69][70] Typically, these approaches follow a machine learning approach, where large numbers of manually rated photographs are used to "teach" a computer about what visual properties are of relevance to aesthetic quality. The Acquine engine, developed at Penn State University, rates natural photographs uploaded by users.[71]
