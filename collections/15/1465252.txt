The eliminated girls still participated in every photo shoot (including those taking place after the comeback competition was finished), and their photos were also still available to be voted on by the public. This separate competition was documented on the "Comeback series", which was untelevised and instead shown on The CW's official website. It lasted for six weeks, and the winning contestant, with the highest average social media score throughout the cycle (Leila Goldkuhl), was allowed to rejoin the main competition.
