For the final skit of the round, Greg showed the gumshoes the three locations before the clue was given. After that, the gumshoes were given some time to wager 0-50 Crime Bucks (in increments of 10) on the clue, then were given the clue. If the gumshoe answered correctly, their wager was added to their score. Otherwise, the amount of the wager was deducted from the score. The two highest scoring gumshoes continued on and followed the crook to the correct destination. In case of a tie for second place, Greg read clues related to a famous person or place. The first gumshoe to guess correctly earned 5 ACME crime bucks, and moved on to the next round. In case of a three-way tie, Greg read two questions before moving on.
