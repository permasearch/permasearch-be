Extrasolar planets have been discovered encircling ten stars in Boötes as of 2012. Tau Boötis is orbited by a large planet, discovered in 1999. The host star itself is a magnitude 4.5 star of type F7V, 15.6 parsecs from Earth. It has a mass of 1.3 M☉ and a radius of 1.331 solar radii (R☉); a companion, GJ527B, orbits at a distance of 240 AU. Tau Boötis b, the sole planet discovered in the system, orbits at a distance of 0.046 AU every 3.31 days. Discovered through radial velocity measurements, it has a mass of 5.95 Jupiter masses (MJ).[53] This makes it a hot Jupiter.[54] The host star and planet are tidally locked, meaning that the planet's orbit and the star's particularly high rotation are synchronized.[55][56]
