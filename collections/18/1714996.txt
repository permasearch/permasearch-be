The Brewers and Cubs have been playing each other in spring training Cactus League games since the Brewers franchise began as the Seattle Pilots in 1969.[1] However, this budding rivalry did not begin to grow until 1998, when the Brewers moved from the American League Central Division to the National League Central. Until then, the Brewers had a rivalry with Chicago's AL team, the White Sox.
