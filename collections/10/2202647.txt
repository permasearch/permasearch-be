In 1917 on the North Rim, W.W. Wylie built accommodations at Bright Angel Point.[22] The Grand Canyon Lodge opened on the North Rim in 1928. Built by a subsidiary of the Union Pacific Railroad called the Utah Parks Company, the lodge was designed by Gilbert Stanley Underwood who was also the architect for the Ahwahnee Hotel in California's Yosemite Valley. Much of the lodge was destroyed by fire in the winter of 1932, and a rebuilt lodge did not open until 1937. The facility is managed by TW Recreation Services.[24] Bright Angel Lodge and the Auto Camp Lodge opened in 1935 on the South Rim.
