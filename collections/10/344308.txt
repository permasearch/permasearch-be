After the linear heptapeptide molecule is synthesized, vancomycin has to undergo further modifications, such as oxidative cross-linking and glycosylation, in trans[clarification needed] by distinct enzymes, referred to as tailoring enzymes, to become biologically active (Figure 3). To convert the linear heptapeptide, eight enzymes, open reading frames (ORFs) 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 18, 20, and 21 are used. The enzymes ORF 7, 8, 9, and 20 are P450 enzymes. ORF 10 and 18 show to nonheme haloperoxidases[clarification needed]. And ORF 9 and 14 are identified as putative hydroxylation enzymes.[43] With the help of these enzymes, Î²-hydroxyl groups are introduced onto tyrosine residues 2 and 6, and coupling occurs for rings 5 and 7, rings 4 and 6, and rings 4 and 2. In addition, a haloperoxidase is used to attach the chlorine atoms onto rings 2 and 6 via an oxidative process.[39] Some of the glycosyltransferases capable of glycosylating vancomycin and related nonribosomal peptides display notable permissivity and have been employed for generating libraries of differentially glycosylated analogs through a process known as glycorandomization.[44][45][46]
