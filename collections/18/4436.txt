The outer part of the ear is called the pinna, and this is the visible part of the ear. When sound is created, there are changes in air pressure, and the pinna is able to collect those changes and carry them to the ear drum (tympanic membrane). To do this, the pinna funnels the changes in air pressure down the external auditory canal which is a tube goes from the outer ear to the middle ear. This part of the ear is made of cartilage and the inner ear is made up of more bones. Because this external auditory canal only travels to the middle ear, the changes in air pressure are then brought to the tympanic membrane, or more commonly called, the ear drum.
