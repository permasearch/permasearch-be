Regarding transgender issues, the 2017 General Synod voted in favour of a motion saying that transgender people should be “welcomed and affirmed in their parish church...”[72][73] The motion also asked the Bishops "to look into special services for transgender people."[74] The Diocese of Blackburn has already begun recognising the ceremony.[75] Since 2000, the church has allowed priests to undergo gender transition and remain in office.[76] The church has ordained openly transgender clergy since 2005.[77]
