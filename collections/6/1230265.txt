The Liberal Party of Canada (French: Parti libÃ©ral du Canada), colloquially known as the Grits, is the oldest federal political party in Canada. The party espouses the principles of liberalism and generally sits at the centre of the Canadian political spectrum.[10][11][12] The Liberal Party is traditionally positioned to the left of the Conservative Party of Canada and to the right of the New Democratic Party (NDP).[13]
