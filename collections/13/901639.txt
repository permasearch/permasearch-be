During the courtroom trials, the player aims to prove their clients' innocence; to do so, they cross-examine witnesses.[4] During these cross-examinations, the player aims to uncover lies and inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimony. They are able to go back and forth between the different statements in the testimony and can press the witness for more details about a statement. When the player finds an inconsistency, they can present a piece of evidence that contradicts the statement.[9] In the Nintendo DS version, the player can choose to press and present by using vocal commands.[4] In the Wii version, players have the option to present evidence by swinging the Wii Remote.[10] At certain points, the player has to answer questions from the judge, the witnesses, or the prosecutor through a multiple-choice answer selection, or by presenting evidence that supports Wright's claims.[4] A number of exclamation marks are shown on the screen; if the player presents an incorrect piece of evidence, one of them disappears. If they all disappear, the client is found guilty and the player must restart.[11] When the player solves a case, they unlock a new one to play.[12]
