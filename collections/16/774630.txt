A 1971 paper in the Journal of Molecular Biology by Kjell KleppeÂ (no) and co-workers in the laboratory of H. Gobind Khorana first described a method using an enzymatic assay to replicate a short DNA template with primers in vitro.[79] However, this early manifestation of the basic PCR principle did not receive much attention at the time, and the invention of the polymerase chain reaction in 1983 is generally credited to Kary Mullis.[80]
