The Munster Championship has wider implications for the GAA All-Ireland Hurling Senior Championship. The team that is defeated in the lone quarter-final advances to round one of the All-Ireland qualifiers. The two teams that are defeated in the Munster semi-finals also advance to round one of the All-Ireland qualifiers. The winners of the Munster final automatically qualify for the semi-final stages of the All-Ireland series of games while the runners-up qualify for the quarter-final stages.
