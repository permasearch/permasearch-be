The first twenty years of the 19th century continued the colonization of the northern California coast by Spain.  By 1820, Spanish influence extended inland approximately 25 to 50 miles (80 km) from the missions.  Outside of this zone, perhaps 200,000 to 250,000 Native Americans continued to lead traditional lives.  The Adams-Onís Treaty, signed in 1819 between Spain and the young United States, set the northern boundary of the Spanish claims at the 42nd parallel, effectively creating today's northern boundary of northern California.
