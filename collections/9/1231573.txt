Maggie Horton is one of the earliest characters invented by scriptwriter William J. Bell,[6] and executive producer Betty Corday.[7] The character was brought on as a potential love interest for already established character â€“ Mickey Horton. This was originally intended to put the character in close contact with the soap's core family, the Hortons. Shortly after her arrival on the serial in 1973, Maggie married Mickey, thus establishing her to the soap's core family. Maggie is the mother of Melissa Horton (whom she adopted) and Sarah Horton (whose biological father is Neil Curtis, not Mickey). She is the grandmother of Nathan Horton (Melissa's son).
