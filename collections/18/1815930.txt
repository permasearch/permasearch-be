Camryn Grimes first appeared as the character on January 27, 2014.[1] Grimes had previously portrayed the role of Cassie Newman, Mariah's twin sister, on the series from 1997 to 2005, when the character was killed off in a car accident.[2] Grimes was seven when she originated the role of Cassie, and in 2000 became the youngest recipient of the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series.[3] Over the years following her death, Grimes made several guest appearances as Cassie's ghost, which she played most recently from July 2013.[2][4] Although "Ghost Cassie" continued to make numerous appearances to her mother Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), it became apparent in February 2014 on-screen that the character appearing was not a spirit, and was in fact a real person.[5] Grimes later revealed that her return as Cassie's ghost was only slated to last four to six episodes.[6]
