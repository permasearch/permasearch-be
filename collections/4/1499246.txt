In May 2005, financier Carl Icahn waged a successful proxy fight to add himself and two other members to the board. Icahn accused Blockbuster of overpaying chairman and CEO John F. Antioco, who had served in that capacity since 1997, receiving $51.6 million in compensation for 2004. Icahn was also at odds with Antioco on how to revive profit at Blockbuster; Antioco scrapped late fees in January, started an internet service, and wanted to keep the company independent, while Icahn wanted to sell out to a private equity firm.[40] Also in 2005 Blockbuster began running a campaign promoting a "No more late fees" policy [41] The campaign proved controversial with Associated Press reporting that the new policy actually charged users the full price of the movie or game after eight days which they could cancel by returning the product in question and paying a fee.[42] More than 40 states filed suit against the company for false advertising.[42] Blockbuster would later settle the suit agreeing to refund customers as well as promising to better explain the policy.[42] In 2007, Antioco left the company, reportedly due to continued controversy over his compensation. He left with a $24.7 million severance package.[43]
