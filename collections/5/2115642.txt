The Top 8 performed on Monday, May 15, 2017, with the results following on Tuesday, May 16, 2017. For the first time, the duets between contestants were part of the competition and public voting. In the semifinals, three artists would automatically move to next week's finale, the two artists with the least votes would be immediately eliminated and the middle three would contend for the remaining spot in the next week's finals via the Instant Save. iTunes bonuses this week went to Lauren Duski (#1), Chris Blue (#2), Vanessa Ferguson and Chris Blue (Duet) (#6), Aliyah Moulden (#7) and Hunter Plake (#10).[6] With the elimination of Brennley Brown and Hunter Plake, Gwen was longer with no more artists.
