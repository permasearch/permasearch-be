The World Bank, a United Nations specialized agency, has been a primary force in promoting the Habitat conferences, and since the first Habitat conference has used their declarations as a framework for issuing loans for urban infrastructure.[241] The bank's structural adjustment programs contributed to urbanization in the Third World by creating incentives to move to cities.[244][245] The World Bank and UN-Habitat in 1999 jointly established the Cities Alliance (based at the World Bank headquarters in Washington, D.C.) to guide policymaking, knowledge sharing, and grant distribution around the issue of urban poverty.[246] (UN-Habitat plays an advisory role in evaluating the quality of a locality's governance.)[125] The Bank's policies have tended to focus on bolstering real estate markets through credit and technical assistance.[247]
