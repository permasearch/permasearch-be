In 1983, Rey faced one of the worst challenges of both his career, and personal life; an impostor was using his name and was committing crimes, among them were car-napping and rape.[5][6] The list even extended to marrying numerous women, and even petty crimes like "borrowing" money and personal items, all under Rey Valera's name.[6] Rey made numerous newspaper statements announcing that there is an imposter posing as him. Rey also wrote and released a song entitled, "My Fans Are in Trouble" to warn his fans through the medium of music, with the lyrics depicting his helplessness to stop this impostor.[7] What Rey feared most was not the money, but the physical harm people the impostor had fooled might do to him. Ultimately in 1984, Rey decided to quit show business at the peak of his career to protect his fans and also to make up for the time he lost with his family during his fame. When Rey made a comeback in 1988, he wore his hair long so that his impostor (who had kinky hair), would have a harder time posing as him if the impostor ever resurfaced. The impostor has never been heard from ever since.
