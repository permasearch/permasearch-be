Income inequality among the EU-15 was highest in the UK, and wages had fallen by 10% in real terms since 2008, worse than any OECD country apart from Greece. Real wages grew in Germany by 14%, in France by 11%, and across the OECD by 6.7%.[94] The Office for Budget Responsibility forecast in 2014 that individuals would have to borrow Â£360bn (excluding mortgages) over the next five years if the economy was to grow at the rate expected by the Government.[95] Unsecured household debt rose by 24% between 2011 and 2015, adding to widespread questions over the sustainability of the economic recovery.[96][97][98][99] The Bank of England insisted there was no cause for alarm,[100] despite having said two years earlier that the recovery was "neither balanced nor sustainable".[101]
