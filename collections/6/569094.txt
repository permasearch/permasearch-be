Although neural mechanisms involved in timing movement have been studied rigorously over the past 20 years, much remains controversial. The ability to phrase movements in precise time has been accredited to a neural metronome or clock mechanism where time is represented through oscillations or pulses.[19][20][21][22] An opposing view to this metronome mechanism has also been hypothesized stating that it is an emergent property of the kinematics of movement itself.[21][22][23] Kinematics is defined as parameters of movement through space without reference to forces (for example, direction, velocity and acceleration).[18]
