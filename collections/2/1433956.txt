The Campaign puts the player in control of four different player characters. For most of the story, the player controls SSgt. Henry "Black" Blackburn (portrayed by Gideon Emery), a member of the U.S. Marine Corps 1st Recon Battalion and main protagonist.[24] The player also controls Sgt. Jonathan "Jono" Miller, a M1 Abrams tank operator deployed in Tehran;[25] Lt. Jennifer "Wedge" Colby Hawkins, an F/A-18F Super Hornet weapon systems officer;[24][26] and Dimitri "Dima" Mayakovsky, a Russian GRU operative.[27] The main antagonist, Solomon, is an overseas asset for the Central Intelligence Agency.[23] Non-player characters include: Misfit 1, Blackburn's squad (including David Montes, Steve Campo, Christian Matkovic, and Cpt. Quinton Cole); Dima's GRU squadmates Vladimir and Kiril; and CIA Agents Gordon and Whistler, who interrogate Blackburn for much of the Campaign.[23]
