The scene cuts to Salad Fingers walking through a misty forest full of leafless trees, revealing the search for a doctor as his motive to Hubert Cumberdale. He finds a skip (or possibly a broken pram) full of rubbish and starts rummaging around inside it. He finds a grotesque puppet with bent hooks and springs in place of hands, and this he refers to as "Dr. Papanak". Lying on a large slab resembling a tombstone, he leans back for examination, initially seeming to relish it, but the puppet, seemingly completely animate, which makes noises like a hungry animal, and bites him, painfully, on the side of his head. He throws Dr. Papanak away in fear but as the puppet flies he sprouts knives and latches onto a nearby horse closely resembling Horace, but life-size. Dr. Papanak tears away savagely at the horse's side. Salad Fingers acknowledges that the doctor is hurting the horse, but tells it to try and be still whilst the doctor eats its blood. The horse is shown weeping a tear down its face but makes no movement or resistance.
