The post translational modification of proinsulin to mature insulin only occurs in the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans.[11] When proinsulin is transported through the Golgi apparatus the C-peptide is cleaved.[8] This cleavage occurs with the aid of two endoproteases.[12] Type I endoproteases, PC1 and PC3, disrupt the C peptide-B chain connection.[12] PC2, a type II endoprotease, cleaves the C peptide-A chain bond.[12] The resulting molecule, now mature insulin, is stored as a hexamer in secretory vesicles and is stabilized with     Z  n  2 +     {\displaystyle Zn^{2+}}   molecules until it is secreted.[8]
