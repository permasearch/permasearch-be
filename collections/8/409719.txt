On the 32nd list of world's billionaires, the gap between the top 1% and the rest of the billionaires continues to widen.[2] A record of 2,208 billionaires were in the ranking and the total wealth is $9.1 trillion, up 18% since 2017. For the first time, Jeff Bezos was listed as the top billionaire due to Amazon's rising stock price that resulted in one person's biggest one year gain in wealth since Forbes started tracking in 1987.[2] The U.S. continues to have the most billionaires in the world, with a record of 585 while China is catching up with 476 (including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan).
