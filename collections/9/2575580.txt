Marsupials present in South America included didelphimorphs (opossums) and several other small groups; larger predatory relatives of these also existed, like the borhyaenids and the sabertooth Thylacosmilus (sparassodont metatherians which are no longer considered to be true marsupials).[17] After the extinction of sparassodonts, and before the arrival of carnivorans, giant opossums like Thylophorops represented true marsupial macropredators.
