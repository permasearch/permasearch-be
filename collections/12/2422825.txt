Up to and including 1998, if the final ended in a draw, a replay would be required. This occurred on 14 occasions, the last being in 1993 between Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday. In September 1998, the Football Association decided that all future finals would be decided 'on the day', meaning that a penalty shootout would decide the winner if the score was level after normal and extra time.[1] Two finals since have been decided by a penalty shootout, those of 2005 (Arsenal defeating Manchester United) and 2006 (Liverpool defeating West Ham United).
