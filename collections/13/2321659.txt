Sub-Saharan Africa, the region with the lowest overall literacy rates, also features the widest gender gap: just 52% of adult females are literate, and 68% among adult men. Similar gender disparity persists in two other regions, the Arab States (86% adult male literacy, 70% adult female literacy) and South and West Asia (77% adult male literacy, 58% adult female literacy).[22]
