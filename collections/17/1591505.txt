Six people were killed in Northern Ireland, mostly due to fallen trees: two in County Fermanagh and one each in Cookstown, Dungannon, Omagh, and elsewhere in Tyrone.[16][29] The cereal crop in Northern Ireland suffered greatly due to Debbie, with half of the yield being lost. Losses from the crop were estimated at £1 million (US$2.8 million).[13] In the wake of the storm, military ambulances from the Royal Army Medical Corps were dispatched to parts of West Tyrone.[30] Power repair crews were dispatched for nearly a week repairing downed wires across Northern Ireland. Many public authorities paid tribute to the workers for their tireless work.[26] After passing through Ireland, the storm brought strong winds and heavy rain to parts of Scotland and Wales, resulting in some damage and flooding in the region.[17] On the coast of Lancashire and the Isle of Man, sand storms were reported, with significant sand deposits found inland.[8]
