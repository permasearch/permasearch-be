Another historic event occurred on December 15, 2003, when Bravo Company of the 1st Battalion deployed from Fort Myer, Virginia, for duty in the US Central Command area of operations. This was the first deployment of an element of The Old Guardâ€™s 1st Battalion since World War II. Bravo Company, also called Task Force Bravo and Team Battlehard, arrived in the US Central Command area of operations to take up duty in Djibouti on the Horn of Africa on December 17, 2003. The soldiers of The Old Guard served in support of Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) and Operation Enduring Freedom. Based at Camp Lemonnier, their missions in the region included force protection to civil affairs and engineer personnel, engaging in joint operations with other US and regional military forces and constant training to stay prepared. Team Battalehard redeployed back to Ft. Myer in July 2004.[19][20]
