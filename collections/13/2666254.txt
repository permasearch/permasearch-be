Soul is the lord of the past, the lord of the now, and the lord of the future.[59] Soul is eternal, never born, never dies, part of that which existed before the universe was formed from "brooding heat".[61] Sun rests in it, gods rest in it, all nature rests in it, it is everywhere, it is in everything.[63] To understand the eternal nature of one's Soul is to feel calmness, inner peace, patience and freedom regardless of the circumstances one is in, affections or threats one faces, praises or insults one is subjected to. Anyone who runs after sensory-impressions, gets lost among them just like water flows randomly after rainfall on mountains, state verses 2.4.14 and 2.4.15 of the Katha Upanishad; and those who know their Soul and act according to its Dharma[64] remain pure like pure water remains pure when poured into pure water.[61][65]
