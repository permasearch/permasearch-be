Chelsea began their 2014 FA Cup campaign with a comfortable 2–0 win against second tier side Derby County, managed by former England coach Steve McClaren. Victory came courtesy of a rare John Obi Mikel goal, scoring his second of the season despite not having scored since 2007 before his goal against Fulham in October, followed by an Oscar goal 20 minutes from time that sealed the win. On 11 January, Chelsea won their fourth consecutive league game at the KC Stadium with a 0–2 win over Hull City, with goals from Hazard and Torres.
