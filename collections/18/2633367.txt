John A. Marta, a veteran cinematographer, and Aaron Stell, a long-time film editor, also worked on the film.[14][15] Marta had shot close to 150 B movies for Republic Pictures by this time,[25] which is probably why he was hired (given AB-PT's relationship with that studio and Marta's fast-and-quick shooting style). Albert Glasser composed the musical score.[14][15] Glasser worked in the same office building where Gordon had his offices, and Gordon admired his score for the 1956 war film Huk! (a B movie from Pan Pacific Productions).[26] Gordon had already used Glasser to score his 1957 monster movie The Cyclops.[26] Glasser wrote the musical score for Beginning of the End as well as five more of Gordon's films.[26] Glasser was paid $4,000 for his work on The Cyclops, which may indicate how much he was paid for the musical score for Beginning of the End.[27] The musical soundtrack included the song "Natural, Natural Baby."[14] The art director was Walter Keller.[15]
