A population estimate for the empire of 11,692,480 for the 1520â€“1535 period was obtained by counting the households in Ottoman tithe registers, and multiplying this number by 5.[167] For unclear reasons, the population in the 18th century was lower than that in the 16th century.[168] An estimate of 7,230,660 for the first census held in 1831 is considered a serious undercount, as this census was meant only to register possible conscripts.[167]
