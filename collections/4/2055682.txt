In 1992, Tunick began documenting live nudes in public locations in New York through video and photographs. His early works from this period focus more on a single nude individual or small groups of nudes. Tunick cites 1994, when he posed and photographed 28 nude people in front of the United Nations building in midtown Manhattan, as a turning point in his career; "It all started there, moving my work from just photography into installation and performance photography," he says.[2] Since then, he has organized and photographed over 65 temporary site-related installations in the United States and abroad.
