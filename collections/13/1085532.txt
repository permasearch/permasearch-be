Oval BA is getting stronger according to observations made with the Hubble Space Telescope in 2007. The wind speeds have reached 618 km/h; about the same as in the Great Red Spot and far stronger than any of the progenitor storms.[104][105] As of July 2008, its size is about the diameter of Earth—approximately half the size of the Great Red Spot.[102]
