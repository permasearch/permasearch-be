In 2016, the Malawi eHealth Research Centre in partnership with Mzuzu University and Luke International was established and is Malawi's first fully dedicated eHealth Research Centre. This new research facility will contribute to improve health and social outcomes for communities in Malawi, by enhancing the quality of research and education in eHealth and healthcare.
