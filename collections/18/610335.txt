Through his time in the band, Coghill has endeavoured to improve his drumming. In 1999 following the release of the band's third album Internationalist, he took up lessons with Brisbane-based drum tutor Col Gillies.[9] Coghill has stated that he took the lessons due to being "really sore" "three quarters the way through a show".[10]
