At a team meeting in the house, the baseball coach introduces the new players, which include Jake, Plummer, Beuter, Brumley (Tanner Kalina) – all freshmen – and two transfer students: Jay (Juston Street), recruited for his professional-level pitching, and Willoughby (Wyatt Russell), a bearded philosopher-stoner. The coach cites two rules: no alcohol in the house, and no women upstairs, but the team disregards them, later hosting a drunken party, with several team members taking women up to their bedrooms. Jake tries to take a woman he's met to the downstairs room they'd set aside for sex, but it's occupied, and Beuter refuses to leave their room so Jake can't use it. The next morning, Beuter leaves temporarily for home, concerned that his girlfriend is pregnant.
