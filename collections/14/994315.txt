Likewise a person charged with a non-indictable criminal offense, including those being adjudicated in juvenile court,[242] may request alcohol treatment in lieu of criminal prosecution.[243] If a physician attests that the defendant is an alcoholic, the court may impose inpatient treatment for up to 30 days, outpatient treatment for up to 60 days, or both. If the person successfully completes the treatment program, the criminal charges will be dismissed.[241] A person with alcohol dependency who has been charged with an indictable crime may apply for "special probation" (also known as drug court).[244][245] Those charged with severe violent crimes (e.g. murder, kidnapping) are not eligible,[245] but people charged with offenses with mandatory sentences,[244] or who have extensive non-violent criminal records may be eligible.[246] If admitted to special probation, the defendant will be subject to 18 months to 5 years of intense probation and residential treatment as an alternative to prison.[245]
