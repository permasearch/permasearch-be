More than 1.8Â million signed an official parliamentary e-petition which said that "Donald Trump's well documented misogyny and vulgarity disqualifies him from being received by Her Majesty the Queen or the Prince of Wales,"[231] and Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn of the Labour Party said in Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) that Trump should not be welcomed to Britain "while he abuses our shared values with his shameful Muslim ban and attacks on refugees' and women's rights"[232] and said that Trump should be banned from the UK until the bar on Muslims entering the US is lifted.[233][230]
