People falling into (unrealistically being submerged in) quicksand or a similar substance is a trope of adventure fiction, notably movies. According to Slate, this gimmick had its heyday in the 1960s, when almost 3% of all films showed someone sinking in clay, mud, or sand. The proliferation of quicksand scenes in movies has given rise to an Internet subculture scene dedicated to the topic.[4]
