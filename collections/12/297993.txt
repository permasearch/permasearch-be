The Traveller continues on its journey, continuing to gain help from Nada and Polo and Atlas Stones from other Interfaces. As the Traveller progresses, they become aware that they, like Nada and Polo, are different from the other sentient beings in the galaxy, having some sense of the universe's construction and nature.[31] It is revealed that the galaxy itself exists as a computer simulation managed by the Atlas, the Traveller an entity created by the Atlas to explore the simulation, while Nada and Polo were "errors" that had become self-aware of being in a simulation and isolated themselves in the anomaly to help others.[31]
