Two months later, the team returned to Monterrey. Their money had run out after three days, and phone calls to Washington were needed to allow the team to extend their stay in the U.S. until they were eliminated. They never were. Led by ambidextrous pitcher Ángel Macías, the legendary Monterrey team won six tournaments, including the South Region tournament and the Little League World Series. The team was called Los pequeños gigantes ("The little giants"). Two movies are based on their story: a Mexican production, Los Pequeños Gigantes (1960),[3] and The Perfect Game (2009).[4]
