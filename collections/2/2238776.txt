Age is an important factor when considering TOT states. There are complaints that problems recalling information increases with age. The frequency of TOTs increases in adulthood and even more so during the elderly years.[29][30] Compared with young adults, older adults generally report having more TOT states, fewer alternate words, and less phonological information about the target word.[31] The underpinnings of TOT with regard to age have focused on neurological brain differences. Current research uses neuroimaging methods to access the presence of different brain patterns when a younger and older individual is experiencing a TOT state. It is found that older and younger individuals employ a similar network of brain regions during TOT states such as the prefrontal cortex, left insula, and sensorimotor cortex.[22] However, older individuals show differences in activity in some areas compared to younger individuals.[22] TOTs increase with age-related gray matter loss in the left insula for older individuals.[29]  This is accompanied by less activity in the left insula and is related to higher frequency of TOTs.[22] Furthermore, it was found that older individuals have over-activation in their prefrontal cortex when experiencing TOT states.[32] This may indicate a continued search when the retrieval process fails and a TOT state is experienced.[32] More specifically, greater activation in the sensorimotor cortex in older individuals and less in younger adults may reflect differences in the knowledge that is used to retrieve the target information.[32] Priming words during word retrieval tests generally reduces the frequency of TOTs and improves the retrieval of the target word and has been shown to have a larger benefit for older adults.[22][29] This is consistent with the spreading activation model, where neural connections are strengthened when used more.[29]  Although older people experience more tip of the tongue states more often than any other category,  recent studies have shown that frequent tip of the tongue states are not linked at all to dementia, which is common in the elderly.[33] Despite the association of increased age with lower levels of episodic memory and more frequent TOT states, the two phenomena seem to be largely independent of one another.[33]
