Unlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors.[25][26] In 2016, a study found that there were only 11 fixed genes that showed variation between wolves and dogs. These gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution, and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication. These genes have been shown to affect the catecholamine synthesis pathway, with the majority of the genes affecting the fight-or-flight response[26][83] (i.e. selection for tameness), and emotional processing.[26] Dogs generally show reduced fear and aggression compared to wolves.[26][84] Some of these genes have been associated with aggression in some dog breeds, indicating their importance in both the initial domestication and then later in breed formation.[26]
