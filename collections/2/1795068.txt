Cold Steel uses the PhyreEngine game engine.[1] The game was also localized into Chinese and Korean with the assistance of Sony Computer Entertainment Japan Asia.[2][3] The English localization was handled by Xseed Games, who also ported the game to Microsoft Windows in 2017, with the latter including additional voice acting not seen in the original release.[4][5][6] A remastered version for the PlayStation 4, The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel I: Kai -Thors Military Academy 1204-, was released in Japan in March 2018. It includes many features seen in the PC release, such as support for 4k resolution and a "high speed skip" combat feature.[7] It will be released in North America and Europe in early 2019.[8]
