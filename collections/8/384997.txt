Daniel “Scouse” Mercer first rose to notoriety as a public drinker in 2006 when residents noticed him drinking cans of lager every Sunday outside a Dixons window in the Wirral, UK, while watching the Coronation Street Omnibus. Speaking with local newspaper, Wirral Globe, Mercer said, “It’s not like I’m homeless or nothing. I’m just very sociable, like. It’s great watching Corrie with a tinnie with people walking past.”
