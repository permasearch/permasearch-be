The school crest has changed somewhat throughout the years especially on the removal of a "white cross" upon which the text "MBS" once sat. The removal of the cross was initially made in deference to Muslim students in the school who would specifically wear the "cross-less" version of the badge. (The badges of convent schools which featured a prominent cross had to be completely redesigned.) Politically, Malaysia was developing into a primarily Muslim country with a multi-racial, multi-ethnic population who have long learnt to exist among each other with tolerance. The permanent removal of the cross in 1989 reflects this subtle shift in the country's sensitivity to the Muslim community.
