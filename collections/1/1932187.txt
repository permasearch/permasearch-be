The University's College of Engineering also houses the NSF EUV ERC, or the Engineering Research Center. This facility has connections to UC Berkley and CU Boulder, and researches Extreme Ultraviolets. The building is also home to the world's largest wave hydraulic simulator, and an earthquake shake table for half scale buildings.[80] Nearby one can find the CIRA, or Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere, in connections with NOAA. Other advanced labs include the CHILL radar facility and a research lab in equine sciences.[81] The center is also home to the Ion Propulsion and plasma Space engineering lab, which develops ion propulsion rocket thrusters to advance planetary spacecraft.[82]
