Philpot continued that moments like Will and his boss making out recalled the show's "glory days", and Messing's trouble keeping a straight face "brought back fond memories of Tim Conway cracking up Harvey Korman on The Carol Burnett Show."[24] Knoxville News Sentinel's writer Terry Morrow also commented that the episode reminded him of The Carol Burnett Show because of its "goofiness and by-the-seat-of-its-pants style." Morrow added that the episode made him laugh more than any other sitcom on network television.[26] Jeffrey Kauffman of DVD Talk praised Baldwin for his performance and commented that "Alive and Schticking" helped "jumpstart the series creatively after a couple of seasons" and "It's fun [...] to see the actors momentarily break character, a la The Carol Burnett Show, where the absurdity of certain situations (usually involving Jack and/or Karen) makes giggling all but impossible."[27] Entertainment Weekly television critic Gary Susman gave "Alive and Schticking" four stars,[28] while Frazier Moore of the Associated Press lauded it as a "fun, and attention-grabbing, note."[16] The Hollywood Reporter's Ray Richmond said "In hindsight, this live thing proved a good idea."[29]
