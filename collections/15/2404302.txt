Approximately 100,000 species of insects have been described from sub-Saharan Africa, but there are very few overviews of the fauna as a whole[27] (it has been estimated that the African insects make up about 10-20% of the global insect species richness,[28] and about 15% of new species descriptions come from Afrotropics[29]). The only endemic African insect order is Mantophasmatodea.
