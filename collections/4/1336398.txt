In electromagnetic theory, the phase constant, also called phase change constant, parameter or coefficient is the imaginary component of the propagation constant for a plane wave. It represents the change in phase per unit length along the path travelled by the wave at any instant and is equal to real part of the angular wavenumber of the wave. It is represented by the symbol Î² and is measured in units of radians per unit length.
