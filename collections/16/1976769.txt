In Coal Miner's Daughter, Beverly D'Angelo portrayed Patsy alongside Sissy Spacek as Loretta Lynn. The film gained a wide audience. Instead of lip-synching to the original recordings, as was common during the period, both actresses sang. Contrary to the movie script, Cline and Lynn never toured together.[13] Cline also never owned a bus, though she had planned to buy one before her death, and stars during her time usually traveled in caravans and limousines.[13]
