A documentary film, The Weavers: Wasn't That a Time! (1982), was released after the death of Hays, and chronicled the history of the group, and the events leading up to the reunion. Critic Roger Ebert gave the film four stars out of a possible four in his Chicago Sun-Times review and named it one of his Top 10 films for 1982.
