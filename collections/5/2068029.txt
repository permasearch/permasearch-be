The Twins did not waste any time getting to Severino, with Brian Dozier hitting a leadoff home run. This was followed by a walk to Jorge Polanco and another home run, this one by Eddie Rosario, to put the Twins quickly up 3â€“0.[10] After allowing a single by Eduardo Escobar and a double by Max Kepler, Severino was relieved after only recording one out, marking the shortest appearance by a Yankees starting pitcher in postseason history.[11] Chad Green relieved Severino and recorded consecutive strikeouts to end the inning.[12] The Yankees quickly responded, however, tying the game in the bottom of the first inning on a three-run home run by Didi Gregorius as Twins starter Ervin Santana also struggled, throwing 41 pitches in the inning.[13][14] Brett Gardner's home run in the next inning gave the Yankees the lead. In the top of the third, after loading the bases with one out, Green was replaced by David Robertson. Robertson induced a potential double-play ground ball from Byron Buxton, but the Yankees weren't able to get the speedy Buxton out at first, allowing the Twins to tie the game at 4.[13]
