He married a schoolmistress, Asano (i.e. Hassana; she was formerly Muslim), baptised Susan. She was also rescued from the Portuguese slave ship that originally brought Crowther to Sierra Leone, and had also converted to Christianity. Their several children included Dandeson Coates Crowther,[5] archdeacon of the Niger Delta.[6] Crowther was father-in-law to Thomas Babington Macaulay, a junior associate, who married Crowther's 2nd daughter (Abigail Crowther).[7] Crowther's grandson Herbert Macaulay (Thomas Babington Macaulay and Abigail Crowther's son) became one of the first Nigerian nationalists and played an important role in ending British colonial rule in Nigeria.
