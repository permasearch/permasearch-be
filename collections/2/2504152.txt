While Piper and Paige attempt to gather as much information about their past innocents' current whereabouts, Phoebe finds her empathy power has returned as she conducts the wedding of Romeo & Juliet.[8] Piper and Paige arrive at the home of Tyler Michaels, a teenage firestarter whom they saved from The Source many years ago.[8] They find him under attack from demons who want to revive The Source, following Neena and Hogan's plan.[8] Paige then receives a new power: a force field called an orb shield.[8] The Charmed Ones later gather at the manor where they realize that they must go back to fighting evil, but they are unaware that Neena and Hogan's plan has been successful.[8] When The Source makes himself known to the sisters and attacks them outside the manor with a huge fireball, Piper attempts to attack him and discovers that she has a new power. This causes the street to melt and bind to The Source, causing him to get stuck.[9] The sisters escape to Magic School. Gathering magic from all their supernatural allies and using it in tandem with the "Power of Three", The Charmed Ones effectively vanquish The Source once again.[10]
