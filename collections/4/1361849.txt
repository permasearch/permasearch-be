Despite his new commercial gain, by the time of the recording of In the Wee Small Hours, Sinatra witnessed the messy end of a chain of relationships. He and his first wife, Nancy Barbato, had separated on Valentine's Day 1950. While still married, Sinatra began a relationship with Ava Gardner, which became very controversial. After he and Nancy finally divorced in October 1951, he married Ava just ten days later. However, they were both jealous of the others' extramarital affairs. The relationship deteriorated during the recording of Songs for Young Lovers.[10] Despite having considerable influence in getting him his part in From Here to Eternity, Ava broke off from Sinatra two months after the release of the film, divorcing in 1957. She claimed "We don't have the ability to live together like any normal married couple."[11] It is assumed that this album's grouping of "love-gone bad" songs, and Sinatra's poignant renderings, were a direct result of Sinatra's failing relationship with Gardner, to the point that these are called "Ava Songs".[12] Riddle directly credited Sinatra's loss of Gardner with his ability to sing the type of songs contained in this album.[13] The failure of this relationship did not irrevocably shatter Sinatra, but instead caused him to expand as an artist, capable of communicating emotionally to a degree rarely equaled in pop music.[14]
