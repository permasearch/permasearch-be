The film's release on DVD was called "appallingly bad",[22] "horrible" and "sloppy"[23] due to the quality of its transfer, which has been said to suffer from excessive grain, blur and muted colors.[22] Many online DVD forum users speculated that the DVD transfer was taken from the Laserdisc edition of the film and called for a restorative release. The film was initially distributed in an open-matte, fullscreen edition with an aspect ratio of 1.33:1 in the United States before a widescreen version with its intended ratio (1.85:1) was released and subsequently distributed worldwide. The latter version has also been mistakenly labelled anamorphic.[24] It was later released in North America on Blu-ray from Shout Factory on April 26, 2016.
