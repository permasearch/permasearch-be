The series originally centered on Ed Deline (James Caan), a strict ex-CIA officer who went from being head of security to becoming president of operations of the Montecito, whose job is to run the day-to-day operations of the casino. Following his departure from the series in season five, former Marine Danny McCoy (Josh Duhamel), Ed's former protégé, became the Montecito's new president of operations.
