Malacañang Park was originally built by former President Manuel L. Quezon as a rest house and venue for informal activities and social functions for the First Family.[42][46] The house was built and designed by architect Juan Arellano in the 1930s,[42][46] and underwent a number of renovations.[42] In 2008, the house was demolished and rebuilt in contemporary style by architect Conrad Onglao,[42][46] and a new swimming pool was built, replacing the Commonwealth Era one.[45][46] The house originally had one bedroom,[42] however, it was renovated for Aquino to have four bedrooms,[45] a guest room, a room for his household staff, and a room for his close-in security.[43] Malacañang Park was refurbished through the efforts of First Lady Eva Macapagal, the second wife of President Diosdado Macapagal, in the early 1960s.[46] Mrs. Macapagal renamed the rest house as Bahay Pangarap.[46]
