"Alive and Schticking" was performed live twice for viewers in the East and West coasts,[12][13] with different jokes for each broadcast.[14] The first show was broadcast at 8:30 p.m. (ET) for the East (this feed also aired live at 7:30 p.m. in the Central Time Zone) and the second three hours later at 11:30 p.m. ET (8:30pm PT) for the West.[15] During the two performances, Messing and Hayes had "attacks of the giggles".[16][17] An audience member who was in attendance commented that Messing and Hayes "were so bad at keeping a straight face" during a dress rehearsal that Burrows had to get on the show's PA system to yell at them.[18] After both telecasts were aired, Burrows revealed that McCormack, Messing, Hayes, Mullally, and Baldwin "had a ball, but they also dreaded it."[10]
