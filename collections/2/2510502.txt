Besides economic effects of rapidly increasing debt burdens placed on students, there are social ramifications to higher student debt. Several studies demonstrate that students from lower income families are more likely to drop out of college to avoid debt. Families who are classified as middle class are at risk because due to the increasing cost of college tuition will be limited in their education and training that allows them to succeed in their communities.[54][55] [56] Studies indicate that more than 75% of college students report stress, including stress involving tuition challenges[57] Recent reports also indicate an increase in suicides directly attributable to the stress related to distressed and defaulted student loans.[58][59][60][61] The adverse mental health impacts on the student population due to economic-induced stress are becoming a social concern. Students generally have higher stress levels on their financial burden such as student loans, and foreseeable employment in the job market.[62]
