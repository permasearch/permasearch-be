Christopher Russell "Oz" Ostreicher first appears in American Pie as a member of the high school lacrosse team and as a friend of Jim Levenstein, Kevin Myers, Steve Stifler, and Paul Finch. He is a member of The nerdy and geeky four friends make a pact to lose their virginity before they graduate from high school. Oz joins the jazz choir in an effort to lose his reputation as an insensitive jock and find a girlfriend there. Even though he was never an insensitive jock and he hangs the core three who are the biggest geeks of all time that didn't exactly get him in the popular seat. He soon wins the attention of Heather, a girl in the choir. However, he runs into problems when Heather comes to learn about Oz's reputation and subsequently breaks up with him, although he later manages to regain some of her trust. Heather sees the real Oz, not just some arrogant jock that people labeled as and see his real friends. Oz confesses the pact to Heather, and renounces it, saying that just by them being together makes him a winner. They reconcile and wind up making love together on the porch. Oz, honoring his newfound sensitivity, never confesses to what they did. The morning after the prom Jim, Kevin, Oz, and Finch eat breakfast at their favourite restaurant where they toast to the future.
