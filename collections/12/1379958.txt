In 2009, the bathroom scene was reused for a series of YouTube videos promoting the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series nominations that Family Guy received for consideration to voters for the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards. In it, Brian considers voting for the fellow nomineesâ€”The Office,[6] Flight of the Conchords,[7] Entourage,[8] 30 Rock,[9] How I Met Your Mother,[10] and Weeds.[11] In the first five videos, Stewie brutally beats up Brian for his different votes, in their respective videos, asking "Where's my Emmy man?" and forces him to vote for Family Guy. In the last video, when Brian thinks about voting for Weeds, Stewie doesn't beat him up and instead says, "Oh, fuck this. I'm not doing one for fucking Weeds," referring to the declining quality of the show within its fourth season.
