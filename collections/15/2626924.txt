In the anime-only sequel, Dragon Ball GT, Android #18 falls under Baby's control when the latter takes over Earth,[71] avoiding being killed by Baby despite being caught in a blast from his Super Galick Gun.[72] She is freed of his control with the use of the Sacred Water, though has to abandon Earth the following year to avoid the planet's explosion thanks to a wish he made with the unstable Black Star Dragon Balls.[73] Later she is nearly possessed by Android 17 to merge with him,[74] but is helped out of his control by Krillin, who is then killed. Android #18 tries to fight him, but is defeated and left for dead.[75] Android 18 comes to Goku's aid when he is fighting Super 17, the combination of Android 17 and Hell Fighter 17, a clone of her brother, in retaliation to Krillin's death which Goku was unaware of until she mentioned it. It is through her intervention that Goku is able to defeat him as she goads Super 17 to finish them both off and in doing so causes him to undergo an internal struggle that Goku exploits by attacking him during.[76] After being assured that Krillin would be resurrected with the Dragon Balls, Android 18 is last seen at Capsule Corporation.[77]
