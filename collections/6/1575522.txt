That way, she hopes to satisfy Raj's condition and ensure Tina's happiness. Rohan realises that Pooja does not love him, but keeps up the charade nevertheless. On the day of the marriage, Tina realises that Raj is really in love with Pooja, she changes from her wedding attire to simple clothes. At the altar, Raj knocks over the pot of wedding vermilion (Sindoor) by mistake, some of which falls into Pooja's hair. This is traditionally a sign of marriage. Just as Pooja is about to wipe it off, Tina stops her, saying that she is not alone and is glad to have such great friends willing to sacrifice their love for her. Pooja approaches Rohan to apologise, but he is not at all angry. He is glad to have made new friends. The movie ends with Pooja and Raj getting married.
