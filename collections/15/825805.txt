As signalled by its tagline "Life's short. Talk fast", Gilmore Girls is known for its fast-paced dialogue and "witty repartee".[18][22][23] Sherman-Palladino wanted a snappy delivery from the characters because she believes that "comedy dies slow",[14] which required large volumes of dialogue to fill the hour-long time slot.[24] Scripts averaged 80 pages per episode, compared to an "hour-long" average of 55–60 pages, with one page translating to 20–25 seconds of screen time.[25][26]
