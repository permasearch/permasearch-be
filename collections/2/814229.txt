On June 20, the cremated remains of Terri Schiavo were buried. The Schindlers' attorney stated that the family was notified by fax only after the memorial service; by then, the family had already started getting calls from reporters.[70] The ashes were interred at Sylvan Abbey Memorial Park in Clearwater, Florida.
