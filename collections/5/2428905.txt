Fred is Ward's suit-wearing office co-worker. He often gets on Ward's nerves, but the patient Ward, played by Hugh Beaumont, usually tolerates Fred well. Fred often addresses Ward as "Ward, old man"; Ward is thirteen years older than Fred. The two work for a "big company" with the home office in New York City. Fred drops by the Cleaver house occasionally on either work matters or social calls. If trouble brews between the Cleaver and Rutherford children, Fred either makes a phone call or appears at the Cleaver's door to advise Ward; and, usually implies the Cleaver kids are likely at fault. In one episode, the Cleavers have the Rutherfords in for cards. Fred plays golf at a local country club, sometimes accompanied by the reluctant Ward. Like Lumpy, Fred is self-aggrandizing.
