In this article, someone wrote: "In modern times, the first verse is often sung as:" and then proceeds to list the lyrics to the Canadian version of the song, not a modernized American version, which they seem to think it is. I'm an American, but when I was in elementary school in the mid 1980s, I remember our music teacher telling us that there was a Canadian version of the song, and those are the lyrics. The places mentioned in the verse obviously refer to Canada, not the United States. 66.251.84.28 17:21, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
