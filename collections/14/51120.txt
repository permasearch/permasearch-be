Budden describes Tosca as the most Wagnerian of Puccini's scores, in its use of musical leitmotifs. Unlike Wagner, Puccini does not develop or modify his motifs, nor weave them into the music symphonically, but uses them to refer to characters, objects and ideas, and as reminders within the narrative.[72] The most potent of these motifs is the sequence of three very loud and strident chords which open the opera and which represent the evil character of Scarpiaâ€”or perhaps, Charles Osborne proposes, the violent atmosphere that pervades the entire opera.[73] Budden has suggested that Scarpia's tyranny, lechery and lust form "the dynamic engine that ignites the drama".[74] Other motifs identify Tosca herself, the love of Tosca and Cavaradossi, the fugitive Angelotti, the semi-comical character of the sacristan in act 1 and the theme of torture in act 2.[74][75]
