Jupiter next continued to move and then it stopped in its apparent retrograde motion on December 25 of 2 BC over the town of Bethlehem.[91] Since planets in their orbits have a "stationary point",[84][86] a planet moves eastward through the stars but "After it passes the opposite point in the sky from the sun, it appears to slow, come to a full stop, and move backward (westward) for some weeks. Again it slows, stops, and resumes its eastward course," said Chester.[86] The date of December 25 that Jupiter appeared to stop while in retrograde took place in the season of Hanukkah,[84] and is the date later chosen to celebrate Christmas.[91][95]
