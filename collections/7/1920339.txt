Although coffee can be harvested year-round in Hawaii, highest production begins in late summer and extends to early spring.[clarification needed]These seasons do not exist in Hawaii In the 2008–2009 season, there were about 790 farms on the island of Hawaii, and 40 on other islands. Average yield was equivalent to 1400 pounds of parchment per acre. A total of about 7,800 acres (3,200 ha) are planted with coffee throughout the state. A little over half the acreage is outside the island of Hawaii, in particular on the island of Kauai, indicating that farms on other islands are larger in average size compared to those on Hawaii. Although total production increased from 2007 to about 8.6 million pounds, farm prices actually dropped, so the dollar value decreased by about 8%.[12] (Due to the relatively few coffee farms in Kauai, Maui and Honolulu counties their numbers are combined in USDA statistics to avoid disclosure of individual operations in those counties.) Several former sugarcane and pineapple plantations have changed to coffee production, such as Molokaʻi coffee.
