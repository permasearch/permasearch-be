Sir George Munro, 1st of Newmore who fought in Ireland as a Covenanter later became a royalist after his uncle Robert Monro was imprisoned by Cromwell in 1648. In September 1648, George Munro's Engager Covenanter forces (who favoured the royalists) defeated Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll's Kirk Party Covenanter forces at the Battle of Stirling.[45][46] In 1649 Colonel John Munro of Lemlair, as a royalist, took part in the Siege of Inverness (1649).[47] On hearing of this rising, James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, leader of royalist forces and his invading army of foreigners landed in Ross-shire, hoping for support from the clans. However, he was opposed by the Munros, Rosses and Sutherlands who then chose to support the Scottish Argyll Covenanter Government. The Munros, led by John Munro of Lemlair, together with their allies, comprehensively defeated the invading army at the Battle of Carbisdale in 1650.[48][49] Historian C.I Fraser of Reeling states that the clan had no cause to be hesitant about their part in this action and that some historians, such as John Buchan have done less than justice to it.[50]
