The commander of the Japanese First Division and overall commander of the invasion force  was Konishi Yukinaga, a daimyō (lord) of Uto from Higo Province in Kyushu, chosen as commander of the invasion force more because of his diplomatic skills than military skills as Toyotomi Hideyoshi did not expect the Koreans to resist.[96] Konishi had converted to Catholicism in 1583, and was known to the Spanish and Portuguese as Dom Agostinho.[97] Katō Kiyomasa who led the Second Division into Korea was known in Japan as Toranosuke ("the young tiger") and to the Koreans as the "devil general" on the account of his ferocity.[97] Katō was one of the "Seven Spears of Shizugatake", a group of seven samurai who distinguished himself in combat at the Battle of Shizugatake in 1583, where samurai had fought one another mano a mano, and where Katō demonstrated his skills with a cross-bladed spear with great effect by cutting so many men, whose severed and salted heads were thereafter tied to a stalk of green bamboo and carried by one of Katō's attendants into battle.[97]  Katō was a devoted follower of Nichiren Buddhism, a type of Buddhism closely associated with militarism and ultra-nationalism in Japan, and his relations with the Catholic Konishi were extremely unfriendly, to the extent that the two men almost never met during the campaign in Korea.[98] Katō's battle standard was a white pennant which carried a message alleged to be have been written by Nichiren himself reading Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō ("Hail to the Lotus of the Divine Law").[98] The naval commander was Wakizaka Yashuaru, another of the "Seven Spears of Shizugatake", who had been named daimyō of the island of Awaji in the Inland Sea in 1585, where he learned much about seafaring as the island is located close to whirlpools which are notoriously dangerous for sailors.[98] Toyotomi Hideyoshi never left Japan, remaining in the shōgunal capital of Edo (modern Tokyo); however, the idea of conquering China was his obsession, and throughout the war, he refused to accept defeat, treating the war as simply a question of willpower, believing if only his samurai fought hard enough, he could take China, Turnbull writes: "In a tactical sense, therefore, Hideyoshi cannot be considered as one of the commanders, but, as his will drove the whole project along until he died, his political influence cannot be underestimated".[99]
