In 1966, Life Magazine published an article documenting the housing conditions at animal dealer facilities.[9] The article, titled "Concentration Camp for Dogs," featured pictures of skeletal dogs and described the neglectful conditions that the investigative journalists and Maryland State Police found at a Maryland dog dealerâ€™s farm. As a result of these articles, the public lobbied Congress to pass a Federal law that would institute animal housing and care standards. [5]
