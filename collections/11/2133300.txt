The White Hart Lane site, actually located behind Tottenham High Road, was a nursery owned by the brewery chain Charringtons. A groundsman at a local cricket club, John Over, was tasked with demolishing the greenhouses and preparing a playing surface for football.[9] The stands from the previous ground at Northumberland Park were moved to the new ground.[14] The new ground was never officially named, although names such as Gilpin Park and Percy Park were suggested.[15][16] In its early day it was normally referred to as the High Road ground or the White Hart after the pub, in time it became popularly known as White Hart Lane, which is in fact the name of the street that lies across to the west of the High Road away from the ground.
