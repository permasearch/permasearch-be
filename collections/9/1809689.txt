The intro of this season depicts the chefs as they fight off Transformers-style robotic kitchen appliances as Hell's Kitchen turns into a battle zone, which ends with Ramsay morphing from one. Since the second episode, another version of the opening is shown featuring Zach saying "Get 'em Jon" just as Jon's name appears.
