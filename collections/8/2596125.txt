The carpal bones are not interlocked solely by their shapes; rather, they are held together by interosseous ligaments and by volar, dorsal, radial, and ulnar ligaments. The ligaments holding the carpal bones to each other, to the distal radius and ulna, and to the proximal ends of the metacarpals can be described as extrinsic, or capsular, and intrinsic, or interosseous (intercarpal). The function of the ligamentous system is guiding and constraining certain patterns of motion. Some portion of the ligaments are under tension in every position of the hand in relation to the forearm.
