Pharmacokinetics: In pre-clinical trials, it is possible to radiolabel a new drug and inject it into animals.  Such scans are referred to as biodistribution studies.  The uptake of the drug, the tissues in which it concentrates, and its eventual elimination, can be monitored far more quickly and cost effectively than the older technique of killing and dissecting the animals to discover the same information.  Much more commonly, drug occupancy at a purported site of action can be inferred indirectly by competition studies between unlabeled drug and radiolabeled compounds known apriori to bind with specificity to the site.  A single radioligand can be used this way to test many potential drug candidates for the same target.  A related technique involves scanning with radioligands that compete with an endogenous (naturally occurring) substance at a given receptor to demonstrate that a drug causes the release of the natural substance.[citation needed]
