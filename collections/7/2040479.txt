As the 1990s progressed, concern over the North's nuclear program became a major issue in North-South relations and between the DPRK and the US. By 1998, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung announced a Sunshine Policy towards the DPRK. This led in June 2000 to the first Inter-Korean summit, between Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong-il.[34] In September 2000, the North and South Korean teams marched together at the Sydney Olympics.[35] Trade increased to the point where South Korea became the DPRK's largest trading partner.[36] Starting in 1998, the Mount Kumgang Tourist Region was developed as a joint venture between the government of the DPRK and Hyundai.[37] In 2003, the Kaesong Industrial Region was established to allow South Korean businesses to invest in the North.[38]
