Luther Campbell along with JT Money and then-upcoming artist Clayvoisie responded with the song "Cowards in Compton", from Luke's second solo LP, In The Nude, and its accompanying video that parodied Dre's original premise as a member of the mid-1980s electro group World Class Wreckin' Cru and as well mocking the video for "Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang". In addition to "Cowards in Compton", In The Nude also included a skit called "Dre's Momma Needs a Haircut" dissing Dr. Dre. Snoop Dogg responded on "Tha Shiznit" off his debut LP Doggystyle. In addition Compton and Los Angeles rappers Tweedy Bird Loc responded with "Fucc Miami" off his second album No Holds Barred. King Tee responded with "Advertisement" off his fourth album IV Life and Rodney O & Joe Cooley responded on "Sounds of the Underground".
