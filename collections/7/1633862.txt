HFMD occurs in all areas of the world.[14] It often occurs in small outbreaks in nursery schools or kindergartens.[1] Large outbreaks have been occurring in Asia since 1997.[14] It usually occurs during the spring, summer, and fall months.[14] Typically it occurs in children less than five years old, but can occasionally occur in adults.[10][1] HFMD should not be confused with foot-and-mouth disease (also known as hoof-and-mouth disease) which mostly affects livestock.[15]
