In The Fall of Five, Malcolm Goode, Sam's father, explains to the Garde that he was "supposedly" visited by Pittacus Lore, who told him to prepare for the Garde before they got to Earth and to make sure they have the needs to go into hiding. He also says that Pittacus was wounded and that he died the same night, explaining that the huge skeleton in his cellar is actually Pittacus himself. Whether or not this is true remains unknown, as other evidence suggest otherwise, the skeleton of Pittacus Lore in Malcolm's cellar might have been the Garde who had taken on the title of the ruling elder, this might not have been the original Pittacus Lore (immortal of at least 10,000 years old).
