Activities that count towards continuing education credits generally include completing courses, publishing research papers, teaching classes, home study, and attending workshops.  Some states require that a certain number of the education credits be in ethics.  Most states allow psychologists to self-report their credits but randomly audit individual psychologists to ensure compliance.
