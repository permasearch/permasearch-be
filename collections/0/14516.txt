During World War II, as in the First World War,[70] the Crown Jewels were stored in the basement of Windsor Castle.[71][k] The most valuable gems were sealed in a tin or pot, which may have been submerged in a pond or lake at the castle,[73] so they could be taken elsewhere if there was an emergency.[72] After the war, 34 boxes containing the Jewels were kept in a vault at the Bank of England while the Jewel House was repaired; it had been struck by a bomb.[74] In 1947, the Jewels went back on display at the Tower of London.[75] In 1953, nine centuries after the coronation of its namesake, St Edward's Crown was placed on the head of Queen Elizabeth II in what is now the only ceremony of its kind in Europe.[52] Today, the Crown Jewels are permanently set with 23,578 precious and semi-precious stones, and they are seen in the Jewel House by around 2.5 million visitors from across the world every year.[76]
