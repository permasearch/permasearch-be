Helminthiasis may cause chronic illness through malnutrition including vitamin deficiencies, stunted growth, anemia, and protein-energy malnutrition. Worms compete directly with their hosts for nutrients, but the magnitude of this effect is likely minimal as the nutritional requirements of worms is relatively small.[17][18][19] In pigs and humans, Ascaris has been linked to lactose intolerance and vitamin A, amino acid, and fat malabsorption.[3] Impaired nutrient uptake may result from direct damage to the intestinal mucosal wall or from more subtle changes such as chemical imbalances and changes in gut flora.[20] Alternatively, the worms’ release of protease inhibitors to defend against the body’s digestive processes may impair the breakdown of other nutrients.[17][19] In addition, worm induced diarrhoea may shorten gut transit time, thus reducing absorption of nutrients.[3]
