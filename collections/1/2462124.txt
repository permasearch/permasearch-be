A V6 engine with a 60 degree included angle between cylinder banks hits the "sweet spot" in V6 engine design due to several desirable characteristics. Unlike most other V6 layouts, 60 degree engines can be made acceptably smooth without using a balance shaft. Although the engine will not be as smooth-running as an inline six or opposed six cylinder engine, modern design and mounting techniques can eliminate objectionable vibration.
