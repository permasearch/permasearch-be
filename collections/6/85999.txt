The clash guernsey is a predominantly white based design,[33] worn in away games where the standard home guernsey may cause a clash of colours with the home team. It features three hoops around the sternum in the clubs colours of red, yellow and navy blue, and is always worn with white shorts. The current clash guernsey was introduced in 2016, and is more similar to the home strip than those of previous years.
