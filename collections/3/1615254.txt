When the field (or a charge) is described as semé or semy of a sub-ordinary or other charge, it is depicted as being scattered (literally "seeded") with many copies of that charge. Semé is regarded as part of the field[29] and thus within the opening section of the blazon describing the field before the first comma. Thus: Azure semy-de-lis or not Azure,  semy-de-lis or. A charge on top would be blazoned: Azure semy-de-lis or, a bend argent.
