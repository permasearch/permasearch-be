Ram Trucks was established as a division of Chrysler in 2010, as a spin-off from the Dodge brand, and using the name of the popular Dodge Ram line of pickups that is now sold under the Ram banner.[1] According to Chrysler, the Ram Trucks brand will concentrate on "real truck customers," rather than casual truck buyers who buy trucks for image or style.[2]
