Earlier stories placed some limits on Mera's abilities, such as susceptibility to lead. However, her main weakness was her struggle with mental insanity, made more apparent after A.J.'s death. Once suspected to be the lingering effect of the psychotic breakdown suffered for the loss of her only son, with Mera blaming Arthur for his shortcomings, it has later been revealed to be the byproduct of the torn loyalties between her duties towards Xebel and her love for Arthur, and the full knowledge that Black Manta actually hated her (for hiding Jackson from him) more than Aquaman himself, and thus having to hide her responsibilities in the events.
