The mixed character of Greek anthropos and Latin -logia marks it as New Latin.[2] There is no independent noun, logia, however, of that meaning in classical Greek. The word λόγος (logos) has that meaning.[3] James Hunt attempted to rescue the etymology in his first address to the Anthropological Society of London as president and founder, 1863. He did find an anthropologos from Aristotle in the standard ancient Greek Lexicon, which he says defines the word as “speaking or treating of man.”[4] This view is entirely wishful thinking, as Liddell and Scott go on to explain the meaning: “i.e. fond of personal conversation.”[5] If Aristotle, the very philosopher of the logos, could produce such a word without serious intent, there probably was at that time no anthropology identifiable under that name.
