After the film was released, a fan put together a version of the song to show how a reprise could have worked at the climax of the film, when Elsa realizes that Anna is completely frozen. Commenting on the fan clip in January 2014, Anderson-Lopez mentioned that at one point, she actually had pitched a reprise of the song for the film's climax.[5] Lopez added, "if you watch it in the flow of the movie, it would be jarring to have them break into song at that moment."[5]
