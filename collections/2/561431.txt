In the past, children's vaccination rates have been low –  as of 2012[update], 60% of the children in Haiti under the age of 10 were vaccinated,[310][311] compared to rates of childhood vaccination in other countries in the 93–95% range.[312] Recently there have been mass vaccination campaigns claiming to vaccinate as many as 91% of a target population against specific diseases (measles and rubella in this case).[313] Most people have no transportation or access to Haitian hospitals.[314]
