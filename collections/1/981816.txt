Aloe vera gel is used commercially as an ingredient in yogurts, beverages, and some desserts,[52][53][54] although at certain doses, its toxic properties could be severe whether ingested or topically applied.[55] The same is true for aloe latex, which was taken orally for conditions ranging from glaucoma to multiple sclerosis until the FDA required manufacturers to discontinue its use.[56]
