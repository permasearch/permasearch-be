The LDS Church builds additional chapels (structures used for weekly worship and for baptisms) and temples (structures used for eternal marriage and ordinances) as wards and branches of the church are organized. The church built about 40 smaller temples between 1998 and 2001. There are 159 operating temples (which includes 10 previously dedicated, but closed for renovation), 11 under construction, and 19 announced (not yet under construction). (See List of temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.)
