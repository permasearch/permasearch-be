On January 11, 1965, Tommy Prothro was hired away from Oregon State as head coach of the UCLA Bruins.[11] In the 1965 football season, the Bruins lost their season opening game 13–3 at Michigan State, who then rose to become the top-ranked team in the country.[11] The unheralded Bruins would go on a seven-game undefeated streak, surprising the national powers likes of Syracuse and Penn State.[11] Going into the 1965 UCLA–USC rivalry football game ranked #7, the conference championship and 1966 Rose Bowl were on the line.[11] #6 USC, led by Heisman Trophy winner Mike Garrett led 16–6 until UCLA got a touchdown on a pass from Gary Beban to Dick Witcher with four minutes to play.[11] After the two-point conversion made it 16–14, UCLA recovered an onside kick.[11] Beban then hit Kurt Altenberg on a 50-yard bomb and UCLA won, 20–16.[26] Integrated UCLA then faced all-white Tennessee in the newly built Liberty Bowl stadium in Memphis, Prothro's native city.[11] On the last play of the game, Tennessee defensive back Bob Petrella intercepted a UCLA pass to save a Volunteer win by a score of 37–34.[11] Tennessee's winning drive was aided by a controversial pass interference call, the clock had questionably stopped twice, and a dropped pass that appeared to be a lateral was recovered by UCLA, but was later ruled an incomplete forward pass.[11] After the game, Prothro stated, "For the first time in my life, I am ashamed to be a Southerner."[27] Prothro and the Bruins went on to completed the season with a dramatic pay-back upset victory over the #1 ranked Michigan State Spartans in the 1966 Rose Bowl, 14–12. This victory over the much stronger Spartans perpetuated the legend of the "Gutty little Bruins."
