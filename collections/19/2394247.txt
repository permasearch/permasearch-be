When Devon was introduced, his paternity was a mystery.[41] In 2009, the character of Virginia (Della Reese), Devon's great aunt was introduced to the canvas. Virginia reveals that Devon's father was not even aware of his existence.[42] In 2011, it was announced that daytime legend Debbi Morgan would join the cast and Yahoo! TV pitched several scenarios for her potential character including a recast of Yolanda, originally played by Chene Lawson or the mother of Tucker McCall (Stephen Nichols)'s.[43] In May 2011, Daytime Confidential confirmed that the character of Devon would be involved in two major stories, one of which hinted at him discovering his paternity.[44] Head writer Scott Hamner said the manner in which Devon's paternity is exposed "leaves a very bad feeling" and Devon is bitter about it because of his prior expectations. Devon is turned off by the "bad judgement" of his new biological relatives, his father Tucker and grandmother Katherine (Jeanne Cooper). He slighted because it takes them so long to find him despite their wealth and power. Additionally, Devon is angry with Katherine because she had recently put him charge of the music division at her company, a job she assured him was based on his talent. However, he quickly realizes that it was because of their biological connection and Devon is insulted.[31]
