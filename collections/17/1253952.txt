Shrek introduced a new element to give the film a unique feel; the film used pop music and other oldies to make the story more forward. Covers of songs like "On the Road Again" and "Try a Little Tenderness" were integrated in the film's score.[1] As the film was about to be completed, Katzenberg suggested the filmmakers redo the film's ending in order to "go out with a big laugh"; instead of ending the film with a storybook closing over Shrek and Fiona as they ride off into the sunset, they decided to add the song "I'm a Believer" by Smash Mouth and show all the fairytale creatures in the film.[2]
