In New Orleans, "Vietnamese Po' boy" is another name for the bánh mì. This Vietnamese sandwich can be found in stores and restaurants throughout the city (for example at Dong Phuong Oriental Bakery), owing to the influence of Vietnamese immigrants, who brought with them Vietnamese-French bakeries.[11]
