Billy Midwinter was the first cricketer to play for two nations during his career, playing two Test matches for Australia in 1877 before appearing for England in four Tests in 1881-82. Within a year he was representing Australia once again. The Bulletin noted that "In Australia he plays as an Englishman; in England, as an Australian; and he is always a credit to himself and his country ... whichever that may be."[3]  Four other Test cricketers switched allegiance from Australia to England in the late-19th century: Billy Murdoch, J. J. Ferris, Sammy Woods and Albert Trott.  Both Frank Hearne and Frank Mitchell started their international careers playing for England but went on to play for the South African Test team. Three cricketers moved from representing India to Pakistan in the 1950s. John Traicos revived his Test career after playing for South Africa in 1970, albeit briefly, when he featured for Zimbabwe in four Test matches in the early 1990s, more than 22 years after his previous international Test appearance.[4]
