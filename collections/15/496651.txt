A 3-way socket has three electrical contacts.  In addition to the two contacts of the standard socket, a third contact is added.  This contact is positioned off-center in the bottom of the socket (contact two in photo).  This extra contact matches a ring-shaped contact on the bottom of a 3-way bulb, which creates the connection for the second filament inside the bulb.  A problem of these devices is that the ring contact of the socket (contact two in photo) digs into the lead seal on the lamp bulb's contact ring and this connection tends to fail early (sometimes in months), leading to intermittent flashes, popping noises, and loss of power to the low wattage filament as the lead seal on the bulb's ring alternately melts and solidifies.
