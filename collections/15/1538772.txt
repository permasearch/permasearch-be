Initially, all civil and criminal cases had the right to appeal to the Supreme Court. An amendment to the Supreme Court Act in 1975 required that parties wishing to appeal must apply for "leave to appeal". The only exception is a select type of more serious criminal cases where there continues to an appeal "as of right", as well as appeals from reference questions submitted to the provincial courts of appeal by the provincial governments.  The federal government also has the power to pose a reference to the Court on its own motion, as an original proceeding, without requiring leave from the Court.
