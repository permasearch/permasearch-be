Curling Canada introduced a new 16-team format for both the Tournament of Hearts and Brier for 2018, under which all 14 member associations of Curling Canada were represented in the main field, rather than being limited by a pre-qualifying tournament. The teams were divided into two pools for round robin play, after which the top four teams from each advanced to the Championship Pool. Defending champion Rachel Homan declined to participate as Team Canada in order to prepare for the 2018 Winter Olympics; Michelle Englot's team, who finished as runner-up in the 2017 tournament, participated in her place. The final spot in the tournament was filled by a wildcard play-in game held on the Friday before the tournament.[2][3]
