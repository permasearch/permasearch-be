After use Dutch ovens are typically cleaned like other cast-iron cookware: with boiling water, brush and soap. Soap vs no soap controversy is derived from the fact that early american soap had lye in it which takes off the seasoning. Today's soaps are free of lye and can be used on cast iron. After the oven has been dried, it should be given a thin coating of cooking oil to prevent rusting. Whether that should be a vegetable fat or an animal fat (such as lard) is hotly contested[citation needed]. Saturated fats are more stable than polyunsaturated fats, which tend to go rancid more quickly. If the oven is used regularly, this poses no issue. Mustard oil provides the highest temperature resistance, which would be conducive to cooking.
