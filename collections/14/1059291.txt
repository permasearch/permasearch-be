Finland has a long tradition of socialist and communist protest songs beginning in years before Finnish Civil War, most which were imported and translated from Soviet Russia. Notably right-wing protest songs are completely absent in contrast to Estonian tradition and widely considered socially unacceptable. In the 21st century the socialist protest song tradition is continued by rap artists and to lesser degree in more traditional Taistoist form by KOM-theatre choir.
