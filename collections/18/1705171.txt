The Order was originally established to treat the virulent disease of leprosy, its knights originally being lepers themselves.[62] According to the Order's official international website, "From its foundation in the 12th century, the members of the Order were dedicated to two ideals: aid to those suffering from the dreadful disease of leprosy and the defense of the Christian faith."[63] Sufferers of leprosy regarded the beggar Lazarus (of Luke 16:19â€“31) as their patron saint and usually dedicated their hospices to him.[63]
