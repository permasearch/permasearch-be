Igor Stravinsky used ffff at the end of the finale of the Firebird Suite.[citation needed] ffff is also found in a prelude by Rachmaninoff, op.3-2.[citation needed] Shostakovich even went as loud as fffff (5 fs) in his fourth symphony.[citation needed] Gustav Mahler, in the third movement of his Seventh Symphony, gives the celli and basses a marking of fffff (5 fs), along with a footnote directing 'pluck so hard that the strings hit the wood'.[citation needed] On the other extreme, Carl Nielsen, in the second movement of his Symphony No. 5, marked a passage for woodwinds a diminuendo to ppppp (5 ps).[citation needed]
