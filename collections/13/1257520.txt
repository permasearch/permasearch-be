After the sale of Desilu Studios, Ball shut down The Lucy Show in 1968 and retooled it into Here's Lucy and became her own producer and distributor. She used Gordon again, this time as her irascible boss (and brother-in-law) Harrison Otis 'Uncle Harry' Carter at an employment agency that specialized in unusual jobs for unusual people. In reality, it was just a continuation of the Lucy Carmichael/Mr. Mooney relationship, but with new names and a new setting.[4]
