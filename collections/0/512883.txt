After the Battle of Salamis-in-Cyprus, Thucydides makes no further mention of conflict with the Persians, saying that the Greeks simply returned home.[185] Diodorus, on the other hand, claims that in the aftermath of Salamis, a full-blown peace treaty (the "Peace of Callias") was agreed with the Persians.[187] Diodorus was probably following the history of Ephorus at this point, who in turn was presumably influenced by his teacher Isocratesâ€”from whom there is the earliest reference to the supposed peace, in 380 BC.[20] Even during the 4th century BC, the idea of the treaty was controversial, and two authors from that period, Callisthenes and Theopompus, appear to reject its existence.[188]
