Conventional amphotericin B desoxycholate (AmB: used since the 1950s as a primary agent) is known to be associated with increased drug-induced nephrotoxicity (kidney toxicity) impairing kidney function.[29] Other formulations have been developed such as lipid soluble formulations to mitigate such side-effects as direct proximal and distal tubular cytotoxicity. These include liposomal amphotericin B, amphotericin B lipid complex such as Abelcet (brand) amphotericin B phospholipid complex[30] also as AmBisome Intravenous,[31] or Amphotec Intravenous (Generic; Amphotericin B Cholesteryl Sul)[32] and, amphotericin B colloidal dispersion, all shown to exhibit a decrease in nephrotoxicity. The later was not as effective in one study as amphotericin B desoxycholate which had a 50% murine morbidity rate versus zero for the AmB colloidal dispersion.[33]
