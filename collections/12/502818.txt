Lily begins to experience strange events. On her first night in the house, the telephone is wrenched out of her hands by an unseen force. A spot of black mold appears on a section of wall and slowly grows as the months pass. Lily often finds a corner of the rug at the base of the stairs has been flipped up, but she is the only person in the house who walks on the first floor. Ms. Blum only calls Lily "Polly," never using her real name. Mr. Waxcap explains that Polly Parsons is the protagonist of Ms. Blum's most popular novel, The Lady in the Walls. Lily presses him about how the novel ends, but he says she must read it herself. Lily responds that she is easily scared, and cannot bring herself to read it. Later, Lily opens a copy of the book in Ms. Blum's study, and it has a dried chrysanthemum pressed between the pages. Steeling herself to read, Lily learns the novel's central conceit: that Ms. Blum communicated with the long-dead Polly, and is retelling Polly's story. Lily puts the book down after a few pages, too frightened to continue. While rinsing berries in the kitchen, black mold spots cover Lily's hands and arms, then her arms bloat and turn sickly gray as if they are rotting, but a second later she looks down again and everything is normal. She glimpses a figure dressed in white reflected on a TV screen, but no one is there when she turns around.
