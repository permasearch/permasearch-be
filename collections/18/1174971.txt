Some episodes have shown that she has incredible talents of her own as well, such as being a champion debater and a well-known advice columnist. In one episode, she even upstaged Susie and her brothers in domestic house chores, which she hated at first, but grew to like and be good at. Angelica's goals and priorities throughout the episodes have also matured to fit her age, and she strives to acquire a position amongst popular cliques at her school (a goal she succeeded at, but which earned her a "frenemy") or impress boys, albeit still aided by the geeky, redheaded Harold (whom she and Susie had met when they were in preschool). She began dating a boy named Jeremy in Season 2, but shortly after she left him for another character named Ty.
