A macrolichen is a lichen that is either bush-like or leafy; all other lichens are termed microlichens.[2] Here, "macro" and "micro" do not refer to size, but to the growth form.[2] Common names for lichens may contain the word moss (e.g., "reindeer moss", "Iceland moss"), and lichens may superficially look like and grow with mosses, but lichens are not related to mosses or any plant.[4]:3 Lichens do not have roots that absorb water and nutrients as plants do,[7]:2 but like plants, they produce their own food by photosynthesis.[8] When they grow on plants, they do not live as parasites, but instead use the plants as a substrate.
