The 1996 Tyson Holly Farms 400 was the last Winston Cup Series race held at the track. Junior Johnson refused to attend the last race weekend stating "I'm not going. It would be more of a sad deal for me to go out and just stand around and look at something disappear, something I can remember almost since I've been around."[5] Bruton Smith needed extra security for the weekend for own protection. Most of the hostile race fans viewed him as the reason for the track's closure.[6] Ted Musgrave got the last pole with a lap speed of 118.054Â mph. This was the last Cup race to have fewer than 40 cars start until the 2016 Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500 at Atlanta, where only 39 cars showed up. Eight drivers led laps in the race, with Jeff Gordon leading most of the event with 207 laps up front. Gordon won the race in front of a record crowd over runner-up Dale Earnhardt. Every car that started this race was running at the finish. Most of the fans remained in the stands long after the race was over, holding on to memories of the track.
