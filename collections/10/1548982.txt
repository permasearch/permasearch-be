As part of the shift in assembly plants, in 2008, to streamline production, Lincoln offers the Town Car with only 4 options: HID headlamps, whitewall tires, polished 18-spoke wheels (10-spoke machine-finished wheels are standard), and a trunk organizer; all previously optional features are either deleted or standardized.
