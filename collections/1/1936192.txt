Tibetan barley has been a staple food in Tibetan cuisine since the fifth century CE. This grain, along with a cool climate that permitted storage, produced a civilization that was able to raise great armies.[34] It is made into a flour product called tsampa that is still a staple in Tibet.[35] The flour is roasted and mixed with butter and butter tea to form a stiff dough that is eaten in small balls.
