Perhaps the earliest "performance" theory was the "delay line" hypothesis of Valentino Braitenberg. The original theory put forth by Braitenberg and Roger Atwood in 1958 proposed that slow propagation of signals along parallel fibers imposes predictable delays that allow the cerebellum to detect time relationships within a certain window.[42] Experimental data did not support the original form of the theory, but Braitenberg continued to argue for modified versions.[43] The hypothesis that the cerebellum functions essentially as a timing system has also been advocated by Richard Ivry.[44] Another influential "performance" theory is the Tensor network theory of Pellionisz and Llin√°s, which provided an advanced mathematical formulation of the idea that the fundamental computation performed by the cerebellum is to transform sensory into motor coordinates.[45]
