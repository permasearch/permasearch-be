Various options were considered over a number of years. In 2000, the club under Alan Sugar submitted a plan to rebuild the East Stand as a three-tier structure to increase the ground capacity to 44,000.[11] As the stadium was hemmed in by other buildings and conservation areas that limited expansion, the club in 2001 (now owned by ENIC) also considered moving to a proposed new stadium in Picketts Lock planned to be used for the 2005 World Athletics Championships.[12]  The Picketts Lock plan however fell through when the government decided that it was too expensive and scrapped the plan,[13][14] while the East Stand plan was also shelved in 2004 due to concerns over transport infrastructure and council objections.[15][14] Other suggestions were mooted, including ground-share with rival Arsenal,[14] and buying Wembley Stadium.[16]
