In closed circuit SCUBA (rebreather) diving, exhaled carbon dioxide must be removed from the breathing system, usually by a scrubber containing a solid chemical compound with a high affinity for CO2, such as soda lime.[16] If not removed from the system, it may be re-inhaled, causing an increase in the inhaled concentration.
