The finale of the work is a monothematic rondo-sonata.[16] This means that the main theme and the secondary theme are similar, or in this case, almost identical, and the main theme is played every time a theme ends. Haydn vastly changes the main theme with each occurrence â€” something that is not done in rondo works. Even the bridges in between themes are similar to the main theme.[9] Haydn also builds a fugue into the last movement.[17]
