In 2014, whole genome sequencing indicated that the dog is not a descendant of the extant gray wolf, the ancestor of the dog had gone extinct, and the dingo fell within the dog clade.[20][50] In 2015, the Taxonomy of Australian Mammals considered the Dingo as Canis familiaris.[2] In 2017, a review of the latest scientific information proposed that the Dingo and New Guinea singing dog are types of domestic dog Canis familiaris Linnaeus 1758.[7] In late 2017, the Australian Government's Australian Faunal Directory listed the Dingo under Canis familiaris Linnaeus 1758.[8]
