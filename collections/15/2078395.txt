"Mr. Roboto" is a song written by Dennis DeYoung of the band Styx, and recorded on the Styx album Kilroy Was Here. It was also released as a 45 RPM single in a 4:44 radio edit, which has the synthesizer intro removed (available on "Greatest Hits" released by PolyTel in Canada in 1992), with the song "Snowblind" (from their previous album Paradise Theatre) as the B-side. In Canada, where they were generally more popular than in their native U.S., it went to #1 on the RPM national singles chart,[2] becoming their third single to top the charts in that country (following "Babe" in 1979â€“80 and "The Best of Times" in 1981).[citation needed] In the U.S., it reached #3 on the Billboard Hot 100.[3]
