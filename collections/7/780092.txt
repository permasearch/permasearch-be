Several Carboniferous spiders were members of the Mesothelae, a primitive group now represented only by the Liphistiidae.[69] The mesothelid Paleothele montceauensis, from the Late Carboniferous over 299 million years ago, had five spinnerets.[72] Although the Permian period 299 to 251 million years ago saw rapid diversification of flying insects, there are very few fossil spiders from this period.[69]
