Conversely, while the Ranger was not marketed in North America at all, the American-designed Ford F-150/Super Duty trucks were not sold widely in global markets (with exceptions being Mexico, the Caribbean, the Cayman Islands, Suriname, Ecuador, Peru, and GCC countries of the Middle East[18][19]). Along with the lack of demand for larger vehicles, taxes on engine displacement, and fuel economy concerns, the F-Series trucks also lack factory right-hand drive capability.[20]
