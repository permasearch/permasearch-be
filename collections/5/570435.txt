Prior to the first half, Chelsea continued to dominate possession and round-up more opportunities â€“ the ball was given to Wise, after cooperation between Petrescu and Vialli, whose shot went just across the left goal.[88] It did not take long, before Granville generated another endeavor for Chelsea to make Wohlfahrt throw himself to the right in order to prevent the shot.[86] The club made its first substitute change in the 71st minute, which saw Flo being replaced by Zola.[87] He made an effect immediately, picking up the ball after a well-timed pass by Wise, and finishing with a half volley in the penalty box, past Wohlfahrt, which found its way straight in the top right corner.[88][89] As the match went on, Petrescu was sent off for an illegal tackle on Yakin.[86] It did not affect Chelsea as Stuttgart failed to produce anything to turn the final in their favour.[87] Stuttgart's situation proved worse when they were also reduced to ten men, as Poschner was dismissed after quarrels with referee Braschi.[86][90]
