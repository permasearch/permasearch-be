Businesses can become compliant by learning upfront whether or not their products contain chemicals that match the current Proposition 65 list of 910 chemicals. Users can do this by searching in a Microsoft Excel[11] chemical list or a website offering the search by chemical name or CAS Number.[12] Product manufacturers may also learn if a chemical in their products has been removed from the Proposition 65 list, such as saccharin, removed December 2010.[13] Alternatively, they can post generic Prop 65 warnings just in case their products contain any listed chemicals.
