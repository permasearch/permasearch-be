During British rule, a Governor was the chief administrative and political officer of Bombay. The executive Government of the Presidency was administered by the Governor. He had the same power and right in the Presidency as the Governor-General of India, and observed the same order and course in their proceedings.[4] Governors of Bombay and Madras Presidencies, who were appointed by the British Crown, were the most important officials after the Viceroy.[5] Bombay Castle was the official residence of the Governor of Bombay until the 1770s, when it was moved to Parel; a century later, in 1883, it was moved to Malabar Hill.[6][7]
