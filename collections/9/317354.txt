In the early 2000s, Lloyd Webber was sued by the estate of Giacomo Puccini for similarities between the former's song "The Music of the Night" (1986), also from The Phantom of the Opera, and a melody titled "Quello che tacete" which was used in Puccini's 1910 opera La fanciulla del West.[5][6] The matter was settled out of court between the two parties soon after the lawsuit was revealed.[7] However, author John Snelson, who wrote a biography on Lloyd Webber in 2009, further compared "All I Ask of You" to the same aforementioned melody, citing similar "motivic connections" and "operatic and emotional cross-references" as his evidence.[2]
