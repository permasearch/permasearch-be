According to author Steven Gaines, Derek Taylor, the Beach Boys' press officer, is widely recognized as having been instrumental in this success, due to his longstanding connections with the Beatles and other industry figures in the UK.[194] The music press there carried advertisements saying that Pet Sounds was "The Most Progressive Pop Album Ever!"[80] Rolling Stone founding editor Jann Wenner later recalled that fans in the UK identified the Beach Boys as being "years ahead" of the Beatles and declared Wilson a "genius"[195] â€“ the latter being a description of the group's leader that Taylor had helped to establish among local music journalists.[196] Carlin writes that Andrew Oldham, the Rolling Stones' manager, took out a full-page advertisement in Melody Maker in which he lauded Pet Sounds as "the greatest album ever made".[197]
