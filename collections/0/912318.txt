Though In/Casino/Out was recorded live, "Relationship of Command may very well be the first record to harness the chaotic balance of adrenaline and intellect of ATDI's live performance."[39] "Ross was instrumental in bringing out a lot of feeling from us," Bixler recalls. "We channeled a lot of emotion into this record. He pushed us farther than we thought we could go. I learned to cut loose the way we do live and not to be afraid to break something or whatever."[39] While capturing the essence of At the Drive-In's live shows in a way never before seen, the record also featured some of the band's most experimental songs, including "Rolodex Propaganda", "Non-Zero Possibility", and "Invalid Litter Dept.".
