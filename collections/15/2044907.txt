The vowels /ɨ̞/ and /ɨː/ occur only in northern dialects; in southern dialects they are replaced by /ɪ/ and /iː/ respectively. In all dialects, the contrast between long and short vowels is found in stressed word-final syllables (mainly monosyllabic words), whereas in some southern dialects, the contrast is found in stressed non-word-final syllables in addition.
