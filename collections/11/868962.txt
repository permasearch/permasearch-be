In December 2013, Kevin Smith and Paul Dini had a conversation in an episode of Smith's Fat Man on Batman podcast addressing the 2013 cancellation of Tower Prep (created by Dini), Young Justice, Green Lantern: The Animated Series, claiming that the network executives did not want girls watching the programs because "they don't buy toys," and wanted more boys watching.[45] This led to a widely held belief that the show was cancelled due to too many girls watching;[citation needed] however, Greg Weisman denied that the show's female viewership was a factor in its cancellation.[46]
