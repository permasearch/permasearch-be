In a switching subcircuit, switching noise must be suppressed. When a load is applied to a voltage source, it draws a certain amount of current. Typical power supply lines show inherent inductance, which results in a slower response to change in current. This in turn affects the transient voltage levels, since if the load current is zero the voltage across the load is zero as well. This sudden voltage drop would be seen by other loads as well if the inductance between two loads is much lower compared to the inductance between the loads and the output capacitors of the power supply. This is only temporary; the inductor ultimately saturates (that is the magnetic field around the conductor reaches its max), the voltage drop across the inductor reaches zero, and the supply voltage comes back to normal. But even a temporary reduction in voltage can disturb adjacent subcircuits. Decoupling caps provide instantaneous current jolt which helps maintain constant voltage across a subcircuit (or provide a low impedance path for the transient currents; different descriptions are used by different industries).
