Archery was first organized in Golden Gate Park in 1881.[12] However, there was not a devoted range specifically for archery until around 1933. In 1936, during Franklin D. Rooseveltâ€™s presidency, many parts of Golden Gate Park, including the archery range, were improved as part of the Works Progress Administration (WPA).[87] With WPA support, the archery range was increased in size and the adjacent hill was carved to serve as a backdrop for stray arrows. Bales of hay are used as targets and are provided by the Golden Gate Joad Archery Club as well as donations from other donors.[88] The Golden Gate Park Archery Range is located right inside the park off of 47th Street and Fulton Street. It is open whenever the park itself is open and is free to use by anyone. There is no staff and equipment is not offered to be rented at the range, however there are archery stores nearby for rentals and there are multiple groups that offer training and lessons.
