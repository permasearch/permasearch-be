The Doctor regroups with Wilfred, who is able to identify Naismith. Wilfred prepares to go with the Doctor, but an apparitional woman in white (Bloom) warns him to arm himself to protect the Doctor before departing. At Naismith's mansion, the Doctor and Wilfred meet two Vinvocci disguised as humans, who assert the Gate is a harmless medical device from their homeworld. The Doctor is too late stopping the Master from activating the Gate, which he has reprogrammed to replace all of humankind's DNA with his own, making humanity his own "Master race"; only Wilfred, protected in the Gate's control rooms, and Donna, due to Time Lord biological traits she gained earlier, are unchanged. Donna sees many of the monsters she encountered with the Doctor, Racnoss, Daleks, Davros, the Ood, and the Vespiform as she hears The Master's laugh. The Master and his doppelgangers taunt the Doctor, who can only look on in horror.
