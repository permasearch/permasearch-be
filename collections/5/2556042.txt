Toole returned home in 1959 to spend a year as assistant professor of English at the University of Southwestern Louisiana (USL), now renamed the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Joel L. Fletcher, a close friend, noted, "Ken has a real gift for mimicry and a refined sense of the absurd ... the English faculty at USL, which is divided into several camps of war, both fear and court Ken because of his biting comic talent."[41] This year is generally considered one of the happiest of his life.[42] While at USL he rented a dilapidated apartment from an elderly and eccentric widow on Convent Street.[43] Toole described the apartment in "Conradian metaphor" to friends.[43]
