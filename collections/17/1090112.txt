Zap2it noted Patrick Dempsey's absence, "Just as fans were used to having him back after his sojourn to D.C. and declaring that he loves Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) and his family more than changing the world, Derek Shepherd has gone missing."[5] The episode also focused on Kelly McCreary's character learning about Lexie Grey (Meredith's sister)) and the story-arc was praised, Tv Equals wrote, "I had completely forgotten that during the midst of all of this sisterly bonding, Maggie knew nothing about Lexie. Watching Meredith and Maggie learn more about each other is absolutely one of my favorite things about this season."[3]
