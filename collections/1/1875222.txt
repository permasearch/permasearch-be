In what is known as the Skirmish of Alness, during the Jacobite Rising of 1715, William Mackenzie, 5th Earl of Seaforth led a force of 3000 men in support of the Jacobites, where they forced the retreat of a smaller force that was loyal to the British Government which was commanded by the Earl of Sutherland and included the Munros led by Sir Robert Munro, 6th Baronet of Foulis, as well as the Mackays and Rosses who were led by Lord Reay.[55] Much of the Ross's lands were ravaged and the Munros returned to find their lands plundered.[55][56] This was fully retaliated by the Munros who then raided the Mackenzie lands in the Siege of Brahan.[57][58]
