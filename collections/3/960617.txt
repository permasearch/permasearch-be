A number of medications are being studied for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, including bedaquiline and delamanid.[171] Bedaquiline received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in late 2012.[172] The safety and effectiveness of these new agents are still uncertain, because they are based on the results of a relatively small studies.[171][173] However, existing data suggest that patients taking bedaquiline in addition to standard TB therapy are five times more likely to die than those without the new drug,[174] which has resulted in medical journal articles raising health policy questions about why the FDA approved the drug and whether financial ties to the company making bedaquiline influenced physicians' support for its use.[173][175]
