Garum was the distinctive fish sauce of ancient Rome.[28] It was used as a seasoning, in place of salt; as a table condiment; and as a sauce. There were four major fish sauce types: garum, liquamen, muria, and allec.[28] It was made in different qualities, from fish such as tuna, mullet, and sea bass.[28] It could be flavoured, for example mixed with wine, or diluted with water (hydrogarum), a form popular among Roman soldiers, although the emperor Elagabalus asserted that he was the first to serve it at public banquets in Rome.[28] The most costly garum was garum sociorum, made from mackerel (scomber) at the New Carthage fisheries in Spain, and widely traded.[28] Pliny wrote in his Natural History that two congii (1.84 gallons) of this sauce cost 1,000 sesterces.[29] One thousand sesterces in the Early Empire was equal to 4 oz. of gold.
