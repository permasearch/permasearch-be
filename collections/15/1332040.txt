Sgt. Carter's Navy foe; a bully to some Marines. Simpson once knocked Carter out during a boxing match with one punch, and makes fun of the platoon when Gomer messes up. He was the Fleet boxing champion for four years: 37 KOs and only retired from the said position because he couldn't find someone brave enough to challenge him. Simpson also has his own gang of men following him around. In "Cat Overboard", Carter and the other Marines laughed at Simpson when they learned about the romance magazines he reads aboard ship. He got offended and told Carter off that his choice of reading romance magazines are none of his and the Marines business. Simpson has a strict rule on contraband, evident when he threw a pet turtle over board and confiscated a transmitter radio. Although angry that Gomer had snuck his pet cat, Henrietta, aboard ship, Simpson has shown compassion when he learned about her pregnancy and took her to the sick bay so some of his pharmacists can have some training in delivering kittens.
