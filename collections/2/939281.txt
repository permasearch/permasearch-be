Italian scientist Galileo Galilei was the first to study the properties of pendulums, beginning around 1602.[28] The earliest extant report of his research is contained in a letter to Guido Ubaldo dal Monte, from Padua, dated November 29, 1602.[29] His biographer and student, Vincenzo Viviani, claimed his interest had been sparked around 1582 by the swinging motion of a chandelier in Pisa Cathedral.[30][31] Galileo discovered the crucial property that makes pendulums useful as timekeepers, called isochronism; the period of the pendulum is approximately independent of the amplitude or width of the swing.[32] He also found that the period is independent of the mass of the bob, and proportional to the square root of the length of the pendulum. He first employed freeswinging pendulums in simple timing applications. His physician friend, Santorio Santorii, invented a device which measured a patient's pulse by the length of a pendulum; the pulsilogium.[28] In 1641 Galileo conceived and dictated to his son Vincenzo a design for a pendulum clock;[32] Vincenzo began construction, but had not completed it when he died in 1649.[33] The pendulum was the first harmonic oscillator used by man.[32]
