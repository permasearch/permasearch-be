The general consensus was that while the film's dance and stepping sequences were found to be impressive, its plot was seen as melodramatic and clichÃ©d.[5] Regardless of the critical reviews, however, the film opened at number-one with a first-weekend gross of $22 million, becoming the first film in three weekends to beat out Night at the Museum at the box office. Stomp the Yard, produced on a budget of $13 million, eventually went on to gross $61 million in the United States and $75 million worldwide.[1][6]
