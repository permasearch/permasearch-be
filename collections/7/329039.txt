The 1890 Warren and Brandeis article "The Right To Privacy" is often cited as the first implicit declaration of a U.S. right to privacy.[4] This right is frequently debated. Strict constructionists[who?] argue that such right exists (or at least that the Supreme Court has more jurisdiction to protect such a right), while some civil libertarians[who?] argue that the right invalidates many types of currently allowed acts not to be surveillance (wiretaps, public cameras film industry, etc.).
