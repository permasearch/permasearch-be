The Angelicum has its roots in the Dominican mission to study and to teach truth, as reflected in the Order's motto, "Veritas". The distinctively pedagogical character of the Dominican apostolate as intended by Saint Dominic de Guzman in 1214 at the birth of the Order, "the first order instituted by the Church with an academic mission,"[6] is succinctly expressed by another of the Order's mottos, contemplare et contemplata aliis tradere, (to contemplate and to bear the fruits of contemplation to others).[7] Pope Honorius III approved the Order of Preachers in December 1216 and January 1217.[8] On 21 January 1217 the papal bull Gratiarum omnium[9] confirmed the Order's pedagogical mission by granting its members the right to preach universally, a power formerly dependent on local episcopal authorization.[10]
