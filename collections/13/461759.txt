On 15 February, gunshots could be heard in the streets of Mingora, but Yousafzai's father reassured her, saying "Don't be scared â€“ this is firing for peace." Her father had read in the newspaper that the government and the militants were going to sign a peace deal the next day. Later that night, when the Taliban announced the peace deal on their FM Radio studio, another round of stronger firing started outside.[38] Yousafzai spoke out against the Taliban on the national current affairs show Capital Talk on 18 February.[39] Three days later, local Taliban leader Maulana Fazlulla announced on his FM radio station that he was lifting the ban on women's education, and girls would be allowed to attend school until exams were held on 17 March, but they had to wear burqas.[38]
