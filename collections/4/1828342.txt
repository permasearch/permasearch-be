On the group 12 transition metals (zinc, cadmium and mercury), Smith[51] observed that, "Textbook writers have always found difficulty in dealing with these elements." There is an abrupt and significant reduction in physical metallic character from group 11 to group 12.[52] Their chemistry is that of main group elements.[53] A 2003 survey of chemistry books showed that they were treated as either transition metals or main group elements on about a 50/50 basis.[14][n 6] The IUPAC Red Book notes that although the group 3âˆ’12 elements are commonly referred to as the transition elements, the group 12 elements are not always included.[55] The group 12 elements do not satisfy the IUPAC Gold Book definition of a transition metal.[56][n 7]
