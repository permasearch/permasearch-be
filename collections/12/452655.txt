Under Salvini, the party has emphasized Euroscepticism, opposition to immigration, and other "populist" policies, while forming an alliance with nationalist and right-wing populist parties such as France's National Front, the Netherlands' Party for Freedom and the Freedom Party of Austria at the European level. The party also established a sister party in Southern Italy, Us with Salvini. All this has been opposed by Bossi and, to some extent, criticised by Maroni and Zaia.
