The iCarly team is going to Webicon (an awards show for websites and other things on the internet) and they accidentally start a fan war, a war between fans thanks to Sam. The fans are divided who should end up together: Carly and Freddie (Creddie) or Sam and Freddie (Seddie). Meanwhile Spencer faces battle-to-battle with his online gaming nemesis, Asparatamay (Jack Black) and when Aspartamay finds out his opponent Aruthur has a sister he tries to destroy her. As a sub-plot, Gibby's grandfather is supposed to go to Webicon along with Gibby and Guppy but he complains that wants to have soup first. Sam becomes obsessed with Fat Shakes like her favourite snack the Fat Cakes. [7]
