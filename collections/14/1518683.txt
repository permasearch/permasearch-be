After Puyi, China's last emperor, was ousted in 1912, the country was declared a republic. Puyi was emperor of Manchukuo, now northeastern China, in 1934â€“1945. He died without issue in 1967. His brother Prince Pujie was next in line under a 1937 succession law, the most recently published agreed upon succession rule.[2] Stories published in the Chicago Times and The New York Times acknowledge Pujie as heir of Puyi.[3]
