At the beginning of the century surveyors had improved the older chains and ropes, but still faced the problem of accurate measurement of long distances. Dr Trevor Lloyd Wadley developed the Tellurometer during the 1950s. It measures long distances using two microwave transmitter/receivers.[6] During the late 1950s Geodimeter introduced electronic distance measurement (EDM) equipment.[7] EDM units use a multi frequency phase shift of light waves to find a distance.[8] These instruments saved the need for days or weeks of chain measurement by measuring between points kilometers apart in one go.
