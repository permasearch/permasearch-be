In 1965, Burr purchased the Naitauba, a 4,000-acre (16Â km2) island in Fiji, rich in seashells. There, he and Benevides oversaw the raising of copra (coconut meat) and cattle, as well as orchids.[75][87] Burr planned to retire there permanently. However, medical problems made that impossible and he sold the property in 1983.[88]
