After commencement day on 3 May 2000, an e-mail trojan called "ILOVEYOU" spread internationally and caused delays in several online transactions. The ILOVEYOU virus unleashed a flood of e-mail that hit at least 45 million users in at least 20 countries according to one estimate. The virus started with "ILOVEYOU" in the subject line, but several variations appeared soon afterward, including one masquerading as an e-mail joke and another as a receipt for a Mother's Day gift. The virus both replicates itself and steals the user names and passwords of unsuspecting victims. The e-mail replies from angry virus recipients to the creator passed through the United States e-mail address "isp-adm@mail.com", which then forwarded them to the two Access.Net (Philippine Internet Service Provider) e-mail accounts used by the virus creator - "spyder@super.net.ph" and "mailme@super.net.ph".[7]
