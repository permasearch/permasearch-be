Tropical hardwood hammocks can also be restored where they have been destroyed. Atestament to this is the fact that virtually all of the tropical hardwood hammocks in the Florida Keys are secondary and have recovered following clearing for agriculture and settlements. Craighead (1971) pointed out that hammocks on Elliott and Rhodes keys had recovered well after 35 years of natural regeneration. Tropical hardwood hammocks can also become established in areas of pine rockland that has been cleared and then abandoned. Some of these forests have become so well established that only well-trained botanists can distinguish them from natural forests. Secondary forests can be useful for wildlife, even at a relatively young age. Key Largo woodrats and the Schaus swallowtail butterfly both utilize relatively young secondary forests in the Florida Keys. Unfortunately, the period when tropical hardwood hammocks could become established through natural regeneration and establishment on disturbed lands is probably at an end due to the invasion of South Florida by exotic plant species. Any site that is abandoned to vegetational succession will almost certainly become dominated by exotic pest plant species, especially if a seed source for exotics is nearby. Opportunities to use natural regeneration to establish or re-establish tropical hardwood hammocks and to establish wildlife habitat, however, should be explored.
