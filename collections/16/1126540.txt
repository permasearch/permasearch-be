Lucre scolds Witgood for not telling him about his engagement. Witgood apologises and says that he wanted to maintain a low profile because he was worried that his London creditors might catch up with him. Lucre persuades Witgood to send for the 'Widow'. He also lends him fifty pounds for the wedding. Mistress Lucre (Lucre's wife) enters with Sam (her son from another marriage). They greet Witgood warmly. The 'Widow' (Witgood's Courtesan) enters. Lucre gives her a welcoming kiss. Sam tries to give her a welcoming kiss too, but is rejected (and thus offended).
