The calculation of even a modestly-sized system's      Φ   Max      {\displaystyle \Phi ^{\textrm {Max}}}   is often computationally intractable, so efforts have been made to develop heuristic or proxy measures of integrated information. For example, Masafumi Oizumi has developed      Φ  ∗     {\displaystyle \Phi ^{*}}  , a practical approximation for integrated information that solves the theoretical shortcomings of previously proposed proxy measures,[6] such as the one proposed by Adam Barrett.[7]
