In the west, Sicily and southern Italy were some of the largest recipients of Greek colonisers.  Indeed, so many Greek settlements were founded in southern Italy that it was known in antiquity as Magna Graecia â€“ "Great Greece".  It has been observed that in the last quarter of the eighth century, new Greek settlements were founded in Sicily and southern Italy at an average rate of one every other year, and Greek colonists continued to found cities in Italy until the mid-fifth century BC.[41]
