In state after state in the South, the Redeemers movement seized control from the Republicans, until only three Republican states were left in 1876: South Carolina, Florida and Louisiana. Republican Presidential candidate Rutherford B. Hayes announced that he favored restoring "home rule" in these states, provided they promised to respect the rights of the freedmen. When Hayes became president in 1877 he ordered the removal of federal troops and Redeemers took over in these states as well. As white Democratic-dominated state legislatures regained power and Congressional efforts to reconstruct the south faded, in the late 19th century after the Reconstruction period, Jim Crow laws were enacted to limit the civil rights of former slaves.
