African Americans formed a large part of the black minstrels' audience, especially for smaller troupes. In fact, their numbers were so great that many theater owners had to relax rules relegating black patrons to certain areas.[74] Theories as to why blacks would look favorably upon negative images of themselves vary. Perhaps they felt in on the joke, laughing at the over-the-top characters from a sense of "in-group recognition".[75] Maybe they even implicitly endorsed the racist antics, or they felt some connection to elements of an African culture that had been suppressed but was visible, albeit in racist, exaggerated form, in minstrel personages.[76] They certainly got many jokes that flew over whites' heads or registered as only quaint distractions.[77] Another draw for black audiences was simply seeing fellow African Americans on stage;[76] black minstrels were largely viewed as celebrities.[78] Formally educated African Americans, on the other hand, either disregarded black minstrelsy or openly disdained it.[79] Still, black minstrelsy was the first large-scale opportunity for African Americans to enter American show business.[80] Pat H. Chappelle (1869-1911) capitalized on this and created the first totally Black-owned Black Vaudeville Show, The Rabbit's Foot Company performed with an all-black cast of that elevated the level of shows with sophisticated and fun comedy. It successfully toured mainly the southwest and southeast, as well as in New Jersey and New York City.[81]
