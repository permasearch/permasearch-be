Levin was interviewed by police in November 1985, when he said Winston Silcott had led the attack with a machete; he told the court in 2014 that that had been a mistake. The court heard that, during Nove's 1992–1994 investigation, police offered Levin immunity from prosecution, gave him £5,000 and paid for a flight from Spain when he missed his flight home from a holiday.[144] They approached him again in January 2008 for his testimony and helped him with expenses and a deposit for accommodation.[142]
