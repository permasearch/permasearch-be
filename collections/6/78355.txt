Medically discharged at the rank of 2nd Lieutenant following a helicopter crash in Greece, he worked as an investment broker briefly and made a fortune. He met and married Caroline "Cathy" Mueller, a medical student and later an ophthalmic/eye surgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital, with whom he had four children. He returned to academia, eventually accepting a position as a history professor at the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis.
