The sculpture and Interpretation Hub is widely supported by Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council and a coalition of local companies and other organisations. It will stand on land provided by FCC Environment, (one of the world's largest waste services companies) next to the M1 motorway at Kimberworth in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England. A 99-year lease has been generously provided by the landowners and work is expected to begin in 2017.
