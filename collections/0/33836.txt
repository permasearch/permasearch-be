In New Zealand, agriculture is the largest sector of the tradable economy, contributing about two-thirds of exported goods in 2006-7.[1] For the year ended March 2002, agricultural exports were valued at over $14.8Â billion. New Zealand is unique in being the only developed country to be totally exposed to the international markets since subsidies, tax concessions and price supports for the agricultural sector were removed in the 1980s.[2] However, as of 2017, the New Zealand Government still provides state investment in infrastructure which supports agriculture.[3]
