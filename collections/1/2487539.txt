Maria Bertram succumbs to Mr. Crawford's flirtations and becomes attracted to him, despite her engagement to Mr. Rushworth, for whom she cares little and only wishes to marry because of his wealth. However, when Mr. Crawford leaves Mansfield indefinitely to see to his estate and stay in London with his uncle, Maria marries Rushworth. When Mr. Crawford finally returns, he decides to amuse himself by courting Fanny, showing her attention and kindness, in order to make her fall in love with him. Gradually, her goodness grows on him and he finds himself falling in love with her in earnest. Fanny, in love with Edmund and with a bad opinion of Mr. Crawford's character, does not appreciate his attentions. Sir Thomas begins to realize that Mr. Crawford is in love with Fanny, and approvesâ€”it would make a very good match for a penniless girl such as Fanny. Mr. Crawford dances with Fanny at a ball, and later tries to gain her favour by facilitating the promotion of her favorite brother, William, to lieutenant in the Royal Navy by using his uncle's influence. But when he proposes to Fanny, she rejects him due to her love for Edmund, his scandalous flirting with Maria and Julia, and because his behavior has made her believe he has no principles. The refusal angers Sir Thomas, who demands an explanation. Fanny can neither tell anyone of her secret love of Edmund nor reveal Henry Crawford's scandalous behavior towards Julia and Maria to Sir Thomas. Therefore, Sir Thomas believes her to be simply selfish and willful. He remonstrates with Fanny quite severely for her ingratitude for what he has done for her. Fanny is emotionally devastated by this, but still refuses Crawford, as he continues to court her.
