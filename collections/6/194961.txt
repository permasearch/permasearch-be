Meritocracy is a fundamental ideology in Singapore and a fundamental principle in the education system which aims to identify and groom bright young students for positions of leadership. The system places a great emphasis on academic performance in grading students and granting their admission to special programmes and universities, though this has raised concerns about breeding elitism.[78] Academic grades are considered as objective measures of the students' ability and effort, irrespective of their social background.[79] Having good academic credentials is seen as the most important factor for the students' career prospects in the job market, and their future economic status.[80]
