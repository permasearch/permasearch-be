Back inside the formation, Feng Jiu woke and kissed Dong Hua, thinking that she was dreaming. Once she realized that it wasn't a dream, Dong Hua told her that they were married, and that she had amnesia, as she only remembered the events that happened 70 years ago. Due to injuries, Feng Jiu fell asleep again, and Dong Hua placed her body inside an ice coffin while taking her soul into the Dream World to recuperate.
