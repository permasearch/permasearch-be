It has also been acclaimed by modern-day film historians and critics, and has often been included in lists of the most prominent experimental films.[43] Brian Taves called it a "landmark" of avant-garde film,[11] and said: "A Hollywood Extra was something entirely new, in both style and substance; more than any other American film, it initiated the avant-garde in this country."[58] Film historian William Moritz called it "a genuine little masterpiece",[13] and "perhaps the most famous American experimental film of the 1920s".[59] Hye Seung Chung, a film professor at Colorado State University, called the film an "early American avant-garde masterpiece" and described Florey as "one of the most undeservingly neglected B film auteurs".[60] David E. James called it the "prototypical 20th-century avant-garde film",[57] and wrote that A Hollywood Extra's successful commercial distribution indicates experimental films were acceptable among a popular audience during its time period, "rather than only an elite or mandarin audience".[18] Director and author Lewis Jacobs wrote: "Its style, broad and impressionistic, disclosed a remarkable sensitivity and resourcefulness in the use of props, painting, camera, and editing."[31]
