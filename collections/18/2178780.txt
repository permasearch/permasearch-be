According to Allan Moore (1995, 191), "part of the heritage of rock lies within common-practice tonality" (Burns 2000, 213) but, because the leading-note/tonic relationship is "axiomatic to the definition of common-practice tonality", and a fundamental feature of rock music's identity is the absence of a diatonic leading tone, the harmonic practices of rock music, "while sharing many features with classical tonality, are nonetheless distinct" (Moore 1995, 187). Power chords are especially problematic when trying to apply classical functional tonality to certain varieties of popular music. Genres such as heavy metal, new wave, punk rock, and grunge music "took power chords into new arenas, often with a reduced emphasis on tonal function. These genres are often expressed in two partsâ€”a bass line doubled in fifths, and a singe vocal part. Power chord technique was often allied with modal procedure" (Everett 2000, 331).
