Depending on how broadly the term is defined, the roots and practice of terrorism can be traced at least to the 1st-century AD.[81] Sicarii Zealots, though some dispute whether the group, a radical offshoot of the Zealots which was active in Judaea Province at the beginning of the 1st century AD, was in fact terrorist. According to the contemporary Jewish-Roman historian Josephus, after the Zealotry rebellion against Roman rule in Judea, when some prominent Jewish collaborators with Roman rule were killed,[82][83] Judas of Galilee formed a small and more extreme offshoot of the Zealots, the Sicarii, in 6 AD.[84] Their terror was also directed against Jewish "collaborators", including temple priests, Sadducees, Herodians, and other wealthy elites.[85]
