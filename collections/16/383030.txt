"Warmblood" breeds, such as the Trakehner or Hanoverian, developed when European carriage and war horses were crossed with Arabians or Thoroughbreds, producing a riding horse with more refinement than a draft horse, but greater size and milder temperament than a lighter breed.[106] Certain pony breeds with warmblood characteristics have been developed for smaller riders.[107] Warmbloods are considered a "light horse" or "riding horse".[96]
