In ancient and classical India, the area that is now Bihar was considered a centre of power, learning, and culture.[20] From Magadha arose India's first empire, the Maurya empire, as well as one of the world's most widely adhered-to religions, Buddhism.[21] Magadha empires, notably under the Maurya and Gupta dynasties, unified large parts of South Asia under a central rule.[22] Another region of Bihar is Mithila which was an early centre of Brahmanical learning and the centre of the Videha kingdom.[23] There is an ongoing movement in the Maithili speaking region of Bihar for a separate Indian state of Mithila. What will be the capital of the state has yet to be decided however Darbhanga is the most likely candidate. Other potential capitals include Muzaffarpur, Purnia, Madhubani and Begusarai.[24]
