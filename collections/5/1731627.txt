Using mobile phone triangulation, the hunters located the driver who gave Alex a lift from Sussex to Devon, and inferred that the extraction point would be on the River Dart. On the morning of the final day, the hunters were 200 metres away from finding Bob camping in a field. The hunters were unable to catch the four remaining fugitives on time and the contestants won Â£25,000 each.
