Modern break laws in the United States stem from labor laws passed between 1935 and 1974. It was during this time that jobs in the U.S. modernized and the country's desire for these laws sparked. In 1938 the Fair Labor Standards Act was passed. This federal statue was implemented in order to protect employees from abuses that had become commonplace during the Great Depression.[2] During this time it was not unusual for companies to work their employees for long hours without a break and to pay them minuscule wages.[2] When the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act were finally set in place in 1945, such abuses were outlawed.
