Richard Fortus, being interviewed by the French music website Rock N' Live in June 2012, revealed that the band would not play any more dates for the "Up Close and Personal Tour", as the band members hoped to spend more time in the studio, hoping to complete the next album by the end of the year.[320] Fortus said, "I'm pretty much focused on GnR right now. We're getting ready to go back in the studio, so that's where my head's at right now, that's all I want to think about until the end of the year, pretty much."[320]
