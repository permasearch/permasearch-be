Unlike previous generations of the Honda Vigor, which were simply upmarket versions of the Accord, the third generation 'CB5' model was spun off as a model in its own right and was based on a different platform which featured a longitudinal engine layout compared to the transverse set-up of the Accord. A sister model to the Vigor, the Honda Inspire, was also unveiled in 1989 and, bar a different front grille, front and rear lights and bumpers, sported identical bodywork. The Vigor was available in the USA and Canada under the Acura brand.
