Because blinking coats the eye with tears, symptoms are worsened by activities in which the rate of blinking is reduced due to prolonged use of the eyes.[10] These activities include prolonged reading, computer usage, driving, or watching television.[4][10] Symptoms increase in windy, dusty or smoky (including cigarette smoke) areas, in dry environments high altitudes including airplanes, on days with low humidity, and in areas where an air conditioner (especially in a car), fan, heater, or even a hair dryer is being used.[4][10][11][13] Symptoms reduce during cool, rainy, or foggy weather and in humid places, such as in the shower.[10]
