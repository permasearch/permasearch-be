He is the main protagonist of the mini-series Recovery One. He is also a major character in Reconstruction where he assists the Red and Blue teams in stopping The Meta. He was imprisoned by the UNSC afterward but was offered freedom in exchange for the retrieval of the Epsilon AI, causing him to side against the Red and Blue teams for most of Revelation. However, upon capturing a copy of the Tex AI, The Meta betrays Washington in order to pursue his original goal of gaining the full Alpha AI. Wash is subsequently injured by The Meta and saved by the Red and Blue teams. He fakes his death and joins the Blue Team, wearing Church's armor with his original yellow trim, so as to not be caught by authorities, as his mission failed.
