Rehearing by the entire panel of the Ninth Circuit (instead of just the three judges) was denied over the dissent of seven judges.[9] Judge Smith, one of the dissenters, argued that the panel "incorrectly rested its laurels on Supreme Court rulings in defamation cases that false facts did not receive First Amendment protections."[10] Smith argued that this was not a defamation case, because even if the act was intended to prevent injury to military personnel, "the right against defamation belongs to natural persons, not to governmental institutions or symbols."[11]
