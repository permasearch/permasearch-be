The freedmen fought for Britain throughout the Atlantic campaign, including the attack on Washington D.C. and the Louisiana Campaign. Seven hundred of these ex-marines were granted land (they reportedly organised themselves in villages along the lines of their military companies).[citation needed] Many other freed American slaves were recruited directly into existing West Indian regiments, or newly created British Army units[citation needed] The British later resettled a few thousand freed slaves at Nova Scotia, as they had for freedmen after the Revolution.[122] Some of the earlier freedmen had migrated to Sierra Leone in the late 18th century, when it was established as a British colony. Descendants have established the Black Loyalist Heritage Museum and website.[122]
