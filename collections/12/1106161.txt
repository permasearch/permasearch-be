The history of the double bass is tightly coupled to the development of string technology, as it was the advent[9] of overwound gut strings, which first rendered the instrument more generally practicable, as (overâ€‘) wound strings attain low notes within a smaller overall string diameter than non-wound strings.[14] Professor Larry Hurst argues that had "it not been for the appearance of the overwound gut string in the 1650s, the double bass would surely have become extinct."[7] because thicknesses needed for regular gut strings made the lower-pitched strings almost unplayable and hindered the development of fluid, rapid playing in the lower register.
