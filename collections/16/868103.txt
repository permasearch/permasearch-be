In 1968 Bruce Henderson of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) generalized the Unit Cost model pioneered by Wright, and specifically used a Power Law, which is sometimes called Henderson's Law. He named this particular version the experience curve.[9][10] Research by BCG in the 1970s observed experience curve effects for various industries that ranged from 10 to 25 percent.[11]
