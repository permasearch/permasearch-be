Kirsty Miller (Annabelle Dowler),[23] worked at Ambridge Organics and the Jaxx Bar. Kirsty was in a relationship with Tom Archer, before he broke up with her for someone else. She then dated Sam Batton, who chose to end the relationship because he was in love with Ruth Archer. In 2013, Kirsty and Tom got back together and became engaged. He jilted her at the altar. Kirsty was good friends with Tom's sister, Helen, but they fell out when Kirsty discovered that Helen had known before the wedding day Tom had doubts. She ultimately returned to Ambridge several months later, got a job at Grey Gables and moved in with Roy Tucker, while also making amends with Helen and the rest of the family. After doing so, she immediately picked up that something was off about Helen, and was the only person to spot the signs that he was abusing her emotionally. Eventually, after convincing Helen to meet with Jess, Rob's ex-wife, she was horrified when Helen decided to confront Rob about his behaviour, a confrontation that led to Helen stabbing him. After having a one-night stand with Tom shortly after the trial, Kirsty became pregnant with his son, and despite her initial reservations, decided to keep the baby. However, a couple of weeks later, her pregnancy ended tragically when she miscarried. After initially repressing her grief, Kirsty eventually agreed to take compassionate leave and grieved properly. Unfortunately, his handling of both the pregnancy and the miscarriage ultimately proved to be the final nail in the coffin of her friendship with Tom.
