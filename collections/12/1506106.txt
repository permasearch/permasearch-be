Sarah, Bud and Salazar win their battle with the zombies and drive away in a military vehicle. They make a stop at the gun store while Bud stays in the vehicle. When Sarah and Salazar return they find Bud has transformed. Instead of killing him, Sarah insists they take him with them because Bud is restrained by plastic wrist-ties and poses no threat. Sarah and Salazar hear Trevor call for help on the radio and go to the radio station to rescue them. While driving there Sarah crashes into her zombified mother and kills her before rescuing Trevor and Nina from the radio station.
