Para-Medic (パラメディック) is a FOX support team member that provides medical information.[130] Although it is set before the modern use of the word "paramedic", her codename instead comes from a portmanteau of "parachute" and "medic".[131] In Metal Gear Solid 3, she provides Naked Snake with surgical information as well as general information on the local flora and fauna. She is also an avid movie-watcher, and enjoys discussing her favorite films with Naked Snake despite his disinterest. In Portable Ops, Para-Medic can be recruited into Big Boss's team.[121] Metal Gear Solid 4 revealed that Para-Medic became one of the Patriots' founders and the head of the "Les Enfants Terribles" project.[132] In addition, she is actually Dr. Clark (クラーク博士, Kurāku Hakase), a character mentioned in the original Metal Gear Solid that's responsible for Gray Fox's revival and was in-turn murdered by the original Cyborg Ninja which EVA wanted.[133] Dr. Clark was referred to as a male by Naomi Hunter in Metal Gear Solid;[134] this is later explained in The Phantom Pain by Emmerich when he tells Venom Snake that Dr. Clark is so secretive that nobody knows anything about her, including her gender. Para-Medic is voiced by Houko Kuwashima in the Japanese version and by Heather Halley in the English translation.
