The console uses an external power supply with a 10 A/100–120 V or 5 A/220-230 V (AC) input and DC output rated at 203/175/150/130/115 W (depending on revision). An estimated 2 W of power are used while the older versions of console are in standby mode giving a yearly usage of approximately 17.5 kWh.[35] The new version uses around 0.5W while in standby.[34] Saving the console size and weight, the power supply displaces 1300 cm³.[36] Xbox 360 power supplies are designed with keys in the plug to be forwards, but not backwards compatable. For example, a 203 watt supply would fit and work on a 175 watt console, but not the other way around.[37]
