The colonial government and white farmers also wanted cheap labour[54] which, for a period, the government acquired from native Kenyans through force.[51] Confiscating the land itself helped to create a pool of wage labourers, but the colony introduced measures that forced more native Kenyans to submit to wage labour: the introduction of the Hut and Poll Taxes (1901 and 1910 respectively);[51][55] the establishment of reserves for each ethnic group, which isolated ethnic groups and often exacerbated overcrowding;[56] the discouragement of native Kenyans' growing cash crops;[51] the Masters and Servants Ordinance (1906) and an identification pass known as the kipande (1918) to control the movement of labour and to curb desertion;[51][57] and the exemption of wage labourers from forced labour and other compulsory, detested tasks such as conscription.[58][59]
