Missouri's newest rivalry after joining the SEC is with the Arkansas Razorbacks, known as the Battle Line Rivalry. Both the Razorbacks and Tigers have played five times before playing annually in the same conference which started in 2014. Arkansas was one of the founding members of the Southwest Conference along with the Texas Longhorns. The Razorbacks left the Southwest Conference to join the SEC, which triggered the Southwest and the Big Eight Conferences to merged to form the Big 12 in 1996. Arkansas is placed in the West Division of the SEC while Missouri is placed in the East and with the SEC current football scheduling format a team from the West and the East divisions must play annually. To keep traditional rivalries ongoing in the SEC, the conference dropped Arkansas's cross-division annual match up with South Carolina to replace the Gamecocks with the Tigers due to the proximity of the two universities. Missouri currently leads the football series 5â€“3.[citation needed]
