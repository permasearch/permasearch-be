The original line-up of Fang dissolved in 1985 after the departure of founder Tom Flynn. Sammytown carried on the band, recruiting a new line-up of Bill Collins (guitar), Joe Miller (bass), and Steve Chinn (drums). Flynn and Boner Records remained affiliated with the band, putting out the first tracks by the new line-up on a Boner Records compilation, Then Boners Be Poppin' in 1985. In January 1986, the "Spun Helga" LP was recorded in West Germany with McBride singing vocals, and two Germans named Joe (guitar) and Ollie (drums) playing instruments. We Bite Records released the LP in Germany, and in the US it was handled by National Trust Records. Fang next release was 1987's A Mi Ga Sfafas? (literally, "Give Me Head?").
