Day's recording of the song for Columbia Records (catalog number 40704) made it to number two on the Billboard Hot 100[4] and number one in the UK Singles Chart.[2] From 1968 to 1973, it was the theme song for the sitcom The Doris Day Show, becoming her signature song.[5][6] The three verses of the song progress through the life of the narrator—from childhood, through young adulthood and falling in love, to parenthood—and each asks "What will I be?" or "What lies ahead?" The chorus repeats the answer: "What will be, will be." It reached the Billboard magazine charts in July 1956. The song in The Man Who Knew Too Much received the 1956 Academy Award for Best Original Song with the alternative title "Whatever Will Be, Will Be (Que Será, Será)".[3] It was the third Oscar in this category for Livingston and Evans, who previously won in 1948 and 1950.[2] In 2004 it finished at #48 in AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs survey of top tunes in American cinema.
