In the early 10th century, Ab큰 Zayd al-Balkh카, originally from Balkh, founded the "Balkh카 school" of terrestrial mapping in Baghdad. The geographers of this school also wrote extensively of the peoples, products, and customs of areas in the Muslim world, with little interest in the non-Muslim realms.[49] The "Balkh카 school", which included geographers such as Estakhri, al-Muqaddasi and Ibn Hawqal, produced world atlases, each one featuring a world map and twenty regional maps.[50]:194
