Texas eventually finished the season of 2005–2006 as the only undefeated team, winning both the Big 12 Conference championship[41] and the National Championship.[42] The Longhorns' penultimate victory of the season, in the Big 12 Championship Game, featured the biggest margin of victory in the history of that contest. Their ultimate victory in the 2006 Rose Bowl against the University of Southern California Trojans for the national championship, as well as their overall season, have both been cited as standing among the greatest performances in college football history by publications such as College Football News,[20][43][44] the Atlanta Journal-Constitution,[45] Scout.com,[46] and Sports Illustrated.[47] The Longhorns and the Trojans were together awarded the 2006 ESPY Award by ESPN for the "Best Game" in any sport.[48] The Longhorns finished the season as the only unbeaten team, with 13 wins and zero losses overall.[49][50]
