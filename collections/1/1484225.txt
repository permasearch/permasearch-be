The Heringâ€“Breuer deflation reflex serves to shorten exhalation when the lung is deflated.[7]  It is initiated either by stimulation of stretch receptors or stimulation of proprioceptors activated by lung deflation.  Like the inflation reflex, impulses from these receptors travel afferently via the vagus.  Unlike the inflation reflex, the afferents terminate on inspiratory centers rather than the pontine apneustic center.  These reflexes appear to play a more minor role in humans than in non-human mammals.
