Slaughter of cow (includes bull, bullock, ox, heifer or calf), and its progeny, is totally prohibited. The export of cattle for slaughter and the sale of beef are both prohibited.[196] This "does not include flesh of cow contained in sealed containers and imported", meaning that restaurants in the states can serve beef, if they can prove its meat has been imported into the state. The law also excuses the killing of cows "by accident or in self defence".[199] Consumption is not penalized.[197] Anyone violating the law can be punished with imprisonment up to a maximum of 2 years or fine up to â‚¹1,000 or both. The law places the burden of proof on the accused. The crime is treated as a cognizable and non-bailable offence.[196]
