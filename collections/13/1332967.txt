After he leaves, Annie inquires about Bury St. Edmunds and recoils when told of Canon Stanford's Atheist and Marxist views. Equally disgusted, Hacker complains that he can't refuse to appoint the Canon because it "will look political". The devoutly Anglican Annie suggests that, since Canon Stanford does not believe in heaven, hell, the divinity of Jesus Christ, or the Virgin Birth, Hacker can refuse to nominate him on religious grounds. Hacker is overjoyed.
