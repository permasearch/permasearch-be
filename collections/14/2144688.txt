The following figures provide a visual illustration of how the Fourier transform measures whether a frequency is present in a particular function. The depicted function f (t) = cos(6πt) e−πt2 oscillates at 3 Hz (if t measures seconds) and tends quickly to 0. (The second factor in this equation is an envelope function that shapes the continuous sinusoid into a short pulse. Its general form is a Gaussian function). This function was specially chosen to have a real Fourier transform that can easily be plotted. The first image contains its graph. In order to calculate f̂ (3) we must integrate e−2πi(3t)f (t). The second image shows the plot of the real and imaginary parts of this function. The real part of the integrand is almost always positive, because when f (t) is negative, the real part of e−2πi(3t) is negative as well. Because they oscillate at the same rate, when f (t) is positive, so is the real part of e−2πi(3t). The result is that when you integrate the real part of the integrand you get a relatively large number (in this case 1/2). On the other hand, when you try to measure a frequency that is not present, as in the case when we look at f̂ (5), you see that both real and imaginary component of this function vary rapidly between positive and negative values, as plotted in the third image. Therefore, in this case, the integrand oscillates fast enough so that the integral is very small and the value for the Fourier transform for that frequency is nearly zero.
