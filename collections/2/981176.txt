Carter Burwell, the composer of Twilight and Breaking Dawn: Part 1, returned to score the final installment of the series. In later announcements, Burwell confirmed that the score for the film was complete. "The movie basically upholds the final installment with a score that has the same jungle-music feeling The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn â€“ Part 1 brought us," Burwell affirmed. "The music pieces that take place in the catalytic final battle will be very much like the nineteenth song in the previous movie's score, 'It's Renesmee' and the twenty-fourth, 'You Kill Her You Kill Me', which were, if not the most, one of the boldest pieces in my career. I will tease anything but I recommend for the fans to listen to 'A Kick in the Head', 'Exacueret Nostri Dentes in Filia' and 'Aro's End' if you want to have goosebumps for the rest of your life."[citation needed]
