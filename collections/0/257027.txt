In 1986, Reagan signed a drug enforcement bill that budgeted $1.7Â billion to fund the War on Drugs and specified a mandatory minimum penalty for drug offenses.[233] The bill was criticized for promoting significant racial disparities in the prison population[233] and critics also charged that the policies did little to reduce the availability of drugs on the street, while resulting in a great financial burden for America.[234] Defenders of the effort point to success in reducing rates of adolescent drug use:[235] marijuana use among high-school seniors declined from 33% in 1980 to 12% in 1991.[236] First Lady Nancy Reagan made the War on Drugs her main priority by founding the "Just Say No" drug awareness campaign, which aimed to discourage children and teenagers from engaging in recreational drug use by offering various ways of saying "no." Nancy Reagan traveled to 65 cities in 33 states, raising awareness about the dangers of drugs including alcohol.[237]
