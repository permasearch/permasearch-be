In 1831, Wagner enrolled at the Leipzig University, where he became a member of the Saxon student fraternity.[18] He took composition lessons with the Thomaskantor Theodor Weinlig.[19] Weinlig was so impressed with Wagner's musical ability that he refused any payment for his lessons. He arranged for his pupil's Piano Sonata in B-flat major (which was consequently dedicated to him) to be published as Wagner's Op. 1. A year later, Wagner composed his Symphony in C major, a Beethovenesque work performed in Prague in 1832[20] and at the Leipzig Gewandhaus in 1833.[21] He then began to work on an opera, Die Hochzeit (The Wedding), which he never completed.[22]
