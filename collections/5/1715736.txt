Akira Toriyama initially based most of the characters on those of the Chinese novel Journey to the West,[1][2] Goku being Sun Wukong, Bulma as Xuanzang, Oolong as Zhu Bajie and Yamcha being Sha Wujing, and redeveloped one of his earlier one-shot manga series, Dragon Boy.[3] To be creative with the character, Toriyama stated in 1995 that he designed Goku not as a monkey like the Journey to the West character, but as a human-looking boy with a monkey's tail to give him a distinguishing feature.[4] However, in 2003 he elaborated saying he added the tail because his editor told him without it Goku had no distinguishing features, even though this was probably a joke, he went ahead and did it.[5] Toriyama later stated that the tail was a pain to draw, hence why he had it get cut off early on,[6] and that he never thought of making Goku an alien until Vegeta appeared.[7]
