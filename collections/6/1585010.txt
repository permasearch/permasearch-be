The District of Columbia's At-large congressional district is a congressional district based entirely of the District of Columbia. According to the U.S. Constitution, only states may be represented in the Congress of the United States. The District of Columbia is not a U.S. state and therefore has no voting representation. Instead, constituents in the district elect a non-voting delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives. Unlike residents of U.S. territories, who also elect non-voting delegates to the Congress, D.C. residents pay federal income tax, which in the view of many residents subjects them to "taxation without representation".
