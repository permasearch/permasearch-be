In 1989, Pittsburgh radio station WYDD-FM executed an early viral marketing plan by playing this song non-stop in a loop for 25.5 hours — focusing on a repeat of the "Pure Energy" sample from Leonard Nimoy as Star Trek’s Mr. Spock. The marketing stunt caused listeners to call emergency services, concerned that some calamity had befallen the DJs and other station employees. Bob Hank, general manager at the time, told reporters he was only trying to draw attention to the station's switch in format and new call letters WNRJ (W-N-R-J = "energy"). "We were just trying to draw a little bit of attention," Hank said. "We never dreamed it would go this far".[7] The song also samples Star Trek in the intro, with the character Dr. McCoy saying "it's worked so far, but we're not out yet."
