Soon after Down in the Groove's release, Dylan embarked on a summer tour of North America, presumably in support of the album. The first show was on June 7, 1988, at Concord Pavilion in Concord, California, and it was a dramatic shift from previous tours. In recent years, Dylan had relied on larger ensembles, often staffed with high-profile artists like Mick Taylor, Ian McLagan, the Grateful Dead, and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. This time, Dylan organized his concerts around a small, "garage rock"-type combo, consisting of guitarist G.E. Smith (of Saturday Night Live fame), bassist Kenny Aaronson, and drummer Christopher Parker. (There was a notable exception in the early June shows; those concerts featured a second, lead guitarist in Neil Young, whose own career was also in a downturn at the time.)
