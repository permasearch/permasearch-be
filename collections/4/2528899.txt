McLeod's Daughters is filmed on location at Kingsford, a 35-acre (55 ha) property which is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register and which is located in the locality of Kingsford north of Gawler.[7] Gawler is north of Adelaide, which Posie Graeme-Evans refers to as "our very own backlot". Kingsford was originally part of a 30,000-acre (12,245ha) property. Kingsford had been used in the years prior to filming by the South Australian Government as a wheat research station then by a Montessori school as a primary school campus. The property was purchased by The Nine Network in 1999. The historical house was built from Edinburgh sandstone, transported to Australia as a ship ballast. The house took over 30 years to build and was finished by 1856. Although Kingsford was a grand property at the time, it is now quite run down - a look that was important for the production design of the series, as the McLeod family has no money for maintenance.
