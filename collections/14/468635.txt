Scholars have argued that warfare was absent throughout much of human's prehistoric past, and that it emerged after sedentism, farming, and more complex political systems arose.[12] However, the findings at the site of Nataruk in Turkana County, Kenya, where the remains of 27 individuals who died as the result of an intentional attack by another group 10,000 years ago, show that inter-group conflict has a much longer history.[13]
