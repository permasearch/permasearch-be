According to the Tax Foundation, Texans' state and local tax burdens are among the lowest in the nation, 7th lowest nationally, with state and local taxes costing $3,580 per capita, or 8.7% of resident incomes.[26] Texas is one of only 7 states not to have a state income tax.[26][27] The state sales tax rate, 6.25%, is above the national medium, with localities adding up to 2% (8.25% total).[28] Texas does have a "back to school" sales tax holiday once a year (generally around the first weekend in August) on clothing and footwear under $100.[29]
