The screw propeller was tested on Lake Ontario in 1841 before being used on ocean ships.[149] Propellers began being used on Great Lakes ships in 1845.[150] Propellers caused vibrations which were a problem for wooden ships.[151] The SS Great Britain, launched in 1845, was the first iron ship with a screw propeller. Iron ships became common and more efficient multiple expansion engines were developed. After the introduction of iron ships, Britain became the leading shipbuilding country. The U.S. tried to compete by building wooden clipper ships, which were fast, but too narrow to carry economic volumes of low value freight.
