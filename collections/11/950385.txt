Walt Disney Pictures released the film in the United States on May 25, 2007. Critical reviews were mixed; the film was praised for its performances, musical score, action scenes, and special effects, but was criticized for its plot and running time. Despite this, At World's End was a box office hit, becoming the highest-grossing film of 2007 with over $960 million. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling and the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, which it lost to La Vie en Rose and The Golden Compass, respectively. A sequel, On Stranger Tides, the first in the series to neither be directed by Verbinski nor star Bloom and Knightley, was released on May 20, 2011.
