The pioneering studies of Lengiel and Blum were extended by others, who were primarily interested in the existence of Na+ sensitivity per se (i.e., the Na+ selectivity relative to H+ only) and in establishing whether or not the electrodes were reversible in the thermodynamic sense. A review of this work is given by Shultz, whose studies and those of Nicolskii and Tolmacheva are noteworthy. In fact, Shultz was the first to demonstrate, by direct comparison with a sodium amalgam electrode, that glasses behave as reversible electrodes for Na+ at neutral and alkaline pH.
