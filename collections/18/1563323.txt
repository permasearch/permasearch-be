To compare sequences of different lengths, the shorter sequence is usually padded at the end with enough "blanks" (a special symbol that is treated as smaller than every element of A). This way of comparing sequences of different lengths is always used in dictionaries. However, in combinatorics, another convention is frequently used, whereby a shorter sequence is always smaller than a longer sequence. This variant of the lexicographical order is sometimes called shortlex order.
