When Stewie wants to hang out with Brian, he is rejected. He feels that his and Brian's friendship is drifting apart, so after he sees that Joe and Bonnie have become closer since the birth of their daughter Susie, he decides that the way for them to bond again is to have their own baby. He takes a sample of Brian's DNA that he acquired and injects it into himself using a special machine. He shares the news with Brian, who is disgusted, and encourages Stewie to get an abortion. When Stewie ignores him, he tries to punch him to induce one. As time passes, Stewie goes through the stages of pregnancy and has Brian take him to the doctor for prenatal care, clothes shopping at Baby Stop, and photographs of his pregnancy. At a fast food restaurant, Stewie's water breaks and he and Brian try to get to a midwife, but it is too late and Brian must deliver the baby in his car. Unexpectedly, it is not one baby, but an entire litter of Stewie-Brian hybrids coming out every orifice in Stewie's body with the birth causing a mess in Brian's car.
