Some time later, a man brings his sick daughter to the temple so that she can die in peace. Arya talks to the sickly girl and lies about how she was ill like her in the past. Arya then gives the girl the temple's poisoned water to end her suffering. After she cleans the body, Arya is taken by Jaqen to a chamber underneath the temple, where the Faceless Men store the faces of all the people that have died in the temple. Jaqen tells Arya that she is not yet ready to become "no one", but she is ready to become "someone else".
