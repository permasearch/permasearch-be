By the middle of the Third Age, the Dwarf realm of Khazad-d没m had become the longest surviving city in all of Middle-earth. Since its foundation in the First Age by Durin the Deathless, the wealth and power of Khazad-d没m had greatly increased. The great fortune of Khazad-d没m had always been built upon the seemingly endless veins of mithril that had been found there, for it could not be mined anywhere else in Middle-earth. Mithril was coveted by all the peoples of Middle-earth; it was traded with the men from the kingdoms of Gondor and Arnor for great value, and it was loved by the Elves, who created many fair things out of it such as the Ithildin that was to be found on the West-gate of Khazad-d没m.
