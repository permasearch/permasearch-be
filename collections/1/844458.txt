Railroads proposed the end-of-train device (EOT or ETD) as an alternative. An ETD could be attached to the rear of the train to detect the train's air brake pressure and report any problems to the locomotive. The ETD also detects movement of the train upon start-up and radios this information to the engineers so they know all of the slack is out of the couplings and additional power could be applied. The machines also have blinking red lights to warn following trains that a train is ahead. With the introduction of the ETD, the conductor moved up to the front of the train with the engineer.
