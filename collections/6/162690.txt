In Toy Story 2, when the toys discover Barbie dolls in an aisle while searching for Woody, Tour Guide Barbie volunteers to help them. During the end credits she is a cinema usherette and is seen giving out instructions to the audience. After a while she asks if everyone has gone and promptly stops smiling and complains that it hurts her face. She then leaves for her break.
