Unlike many Pink Floyd albums, A Momentary Lapse of Reason is not a concept album and is instead a collection of songs written by guitarist David Gilmour, sometimes with outside songwriters. It followed guitarist Gilmour's decision to include material recorded for his third solo album on a new Pink Floyd album with drummer Nick Mason and keyboardist Richard Wright.
