Islamic economics grew naturally from the Islamic revival and political Islam whose adherents considered Islam to be a complete system of life in all its aspects, rather than a spiritual formula[68] and believed that it logically followed that Islam must have an economic system, unique from and superior to non-Islamic economic systems.[Note 3] "Islamic economics" "emerged" in the 1940s according to the Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World.[70] Maulana ala Maududi's 1941 address "The economic problem of man and its Islamic solution" (Insaan ka Maashi Maslah aur aus ka Islami Hul) is "generally considered to be one of the founding documents of modern Islamic economics"[71][72][73]
