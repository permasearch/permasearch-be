"Cry Me a River" is an R&B song[21] with an instrumentation that features clavinet, guitars,[1][19] beatboxing,[20] synthesizers, Arabian-inspired riffs and Gregorian chants.[18] The instruments are arranged into what critics described as a graceful and mysterious melody.[18] Jane Stevenson of Jam! said the single combines gospel and opera.[22] Tyler Martin of Stylus Magazine enjoyed the way that the song unconventionally mixed a range of experimental sounds.[23] According to Martin, the wave synth affects the real strings to create an unusual dissonance.[23] The song's chorus devolves into a choral reading in which Timberlake pleads over the group. "Cry Me a River" finishes with a Timbaland vocal sample.[23]
