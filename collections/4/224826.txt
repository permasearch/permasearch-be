The wall originally listed 57,939 names when it was dedicated in 1982;[4] but other names have since been added and as of MayÂ 2017[update] there were 58,318 names, including eight women. The number of names on the wall is different than the official number of U.S. Vietnam War deaths, which is 58,220.[5] The names inscribed are not a complete list of those who are eligible for inclusion as some were omitted at the request of their families.[6]
