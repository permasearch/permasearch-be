Freeman's life was marked by a prodigious literary output. His published scholarly works include the fifteen large volumes of Norman Conquest, his unfinished History of Sicily,[16][17] and his William Rufus (1882). He wrote several others on the early Middle Ages, and produced works on Aratus, Sulla, Nicias, William the Conqueror, Thomas of Canterbury, Frederick II and many more.[18][19][20][21] He was also interested in Switzerland and in comparative constitutional history.[22][23] Freeman wrote articles for various other publications, including reviews for newspapers and other periodicals, and was a prolific contributor to the Saturday Review until 1878, when he ceased to write for it for political reasons.
