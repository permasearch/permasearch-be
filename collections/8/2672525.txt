Meyer had a "No Smoking" sign added to the Enterprise's bridge, which he recalled "Everyone had a fit over [...] I said 'Why have they stopped smoking in the future? They've been smoking for four hundred years, you think it's going to stop in the next two?"[24] The sign appeared in the first shot of the film, but was removed for all others appearing in the final cut of the film.[14]
