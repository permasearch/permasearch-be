Though Smith initially viewed God the Father as a spirit,[247] he eventually began teaching that God was an advanced and glorified man,[248] embodied within time and space.[249] By the end of his life, Smith was teaching that both God the Father and Jesus were distinct beings with physical bodies, but the Holy Spirit was a "personage of Spirit".[250] Through the gradual acquisition of knowledge, according to Smith, those who received exaltation could eventually become like God.[251] These teachings implied a vast hierarchy of gods, with God himself having a father.[252] In Smith's cosmology, those who became gods would reign, unified in purpose and will, leading spirits of lesser capacity to share immortality and eternal life.[253]
