Text book publishers also explored ways to utilize both the Internet and CD ROM technology as an extension to traditional learning. In 1994, Simon and Schuster was the one of first to pioneer in this area, launching the New Media Group through its then Higher-Ed subsidiary Prentice Hall. Among the New Media Group's members was future MP3 Newswire publisher Richard Menta, whose key project was the Guest Lecture Series. This series was the first successful delivery of online video lectures to universities.[42] The inaugural lecture was streamed in December 1996 with Harvard physics professor Dr. Eric Mazur presenting on Peer Instruction.[43]
