By the end of August the North Korean troops had been pushed beyond their limits and many of the original units were at far reduced strength and effectiveness.[7][18] Logistic problems racked the North Korean army, and shortages of food, weapons, equipment, and replacement soldiers proved devastating for North Korean units.[5][19] However, the North Korean force retained high morale and enough supply to allow for another large-scale offensive.[6] On 1 September the North Koreans threw their entire military into one final bid to break the Pusan Perimeter, the Great Naktong Offensive, a five-pronged simultaneous attack across the entire perimeter.[20] The attack caught U.N. forces by surprise and almost overwhelmed them.[21] North Korean troops attacked Kyongju,[22] surrounded Taegu[23] and Ka-san,[24] recrossed the Naktong Bulge,[25] threatened Yongsan,[26] and continued their attack at Masan, focusing on Nam River and Haman.[27] However, despite their efforts, in one of the most brutal fights of the Korean War, the North Koreans were unsuccessful.[28] Unable to hold their gains, the North Korean army retreated from the offensive a much weaker force, and vulnerable to counterattack.[29]
