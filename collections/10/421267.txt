Thompson continued with supporting roles in the 2003 drama Imagining Argentina, where she played a dissident-journalist abducted by the country's 1970s dictatorial regime. Antonio Banderas played the husband who tries to find her, in a film that most critics disliked.[93] The film was booed and jeered at when it was screened at the Venice Film Festival and received a scathing article in The Guardian.[94] Thompson had greater success that year when she worked with HBO for a second time in the acclaimed miniseries Angels in America (2003).[25] The show, also featuring Al Pacino and Meryl Streep, dealt with the AIDS epidemic in Reagan-era America. Thompson played three roles – a nurse, a homeless woman, and the title role of The Angel of America – and was again nominated for an Emmy Award.[73] In 2004, she played the eccentric Divination teacher Sybill Trelawney in the third Harry Potter film, the Prisoner of Azkaban, her character described as a "hippy chick professor who teaches fortune-telling".[95] She later reprised her role in the Order of the Phoenix (2007) and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (2011),[25] and has called her time on the popular franchise "great fun".[52]
