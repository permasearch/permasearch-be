Freight trains operated by EWS first ran over CTRL Section 1, on the consecutive evenings of 3â€“4 April 2004. Five freight trains that would have run via the classic lines were diverted to run over the Channel Tunnel Rail Link instead: three southbound intermodal trains on 3 April 2004 and two northbound intermodal trains on 4 April 2004.[97]
