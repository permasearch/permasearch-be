"Socialist heraldry", also called "communist heraldry", is a colloquial name for the common design patterns of the national emblems adopted by communist states. Although commonly called coats of arms, most such devices are not actually coats of arms in the traditional heraldic sense, but the recognisable common patterns has led to the use of the unofficial term "socialist heraldry".
