While Cat babysits two polite British girls, Gwen and Ruby, Dice notices that they have a "Pear Phone 6", a phone that hasn't yet been released in America. Dice strikes a deal with them to buy five new Pear Phones for $500. When he gets the package, he realizes they tricked him and sold him rocks instead. Cat visits the girls to see what went wrong, and ends up trading her bike for bibble, a fictional popcorn snack that she covets. However instead of bibble, she receives a tin of cotton swabs. In the end, they trick the British brats in a bingo game at Elderly Acres and get their stuff back with the help of two police officers who perform a fake raid. Dice gets his money back, Cat gets her bike back, and Sam gets her community service form signed.
