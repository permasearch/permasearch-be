Primary healthcare (PHC) refers to "essential health care" that is based on "scientifically sound and socially acceptable methods and technology, which make universal health care accessible to all individuals and families in a community. It is through their full participation and at a cost that the community and the country can afford to maintain at every stage of their development in the spirit of self-reliance and self-determination".[1] In other words, PHC is an approach to health beyond the traditional health care system that focuses on health equity-producing social policy.[2][3] PHC includes all areas that play a role in health, such as access to health services, environment and lifestyle.[4] Thus, primary healthcare and public health measures, taken together, may be considered as the cornerstones of universal health systems.[5]
