A capillary seal is formed when the capillary pressure across the pore throats is greater than or equal to the buoyancy pressure of the migrating hydrocarbons. They do not allow fluids to migrate across them until their integrity is disrupted, causing them to leak. There are two types of capillary seal [12] whose classifications are based on the preferential mechanism of leaking: the hydraulic seal and the membrane seal.
