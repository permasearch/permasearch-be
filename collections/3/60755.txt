Apart from the standard, full (​4⁄4) size, violins are also made in so-called fractional sizes of ​7⁄8, ​3⁄4, ​1⁄2, ​1⁄4, ​1⁄8, ​1⁄10, ​1⁄16, ​1⁄32 and even ​1⁄64.These smaller instruments are commonly used by young players, whose fingers are not long enough to reach the correct positions on full-sized instruments.
