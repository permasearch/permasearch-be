Winnie-the-Pooh, or Pooh for short, is an anthropomorphic, soft-voiced, cuddly, loveable and quiet toy bear and the main protagonist. Despite being naÃ¯ve and slow-witted, he is a friendly, thoughtful and sometimes insightful character who is always willing to help his friends and try his best. A prime motivation is his love for honey, which quite often leads to trouble.
