"Rolling in the Deep" as sung by Rachel and Jesse received considerable praise, though Berk gave it a single star because it was an Adele song, and Entertainment Weekly's Sandra Gonzalez would have given it an "A" if she had "never heard the Adele version", but as she had, gave it a "Bâˆ’" instead.[33][34] Among the many favorable comments, John Kubicek of BuddyTV called it "one of the best vocal performances this show has ever seen".[35] Benigno complimented Groff and Michele's "fantastic voices", gave the song an "A" and wrote simply, "they crush it".[32] Rolling Stone's Erica Futterman called the performance a "passion-filled winner", though she detected "some oversinging".[14]
