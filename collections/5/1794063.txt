There was a lull in fighting over the winter of 1812â€“13 while both the Russians and the French rebuilt their forces; Napoleon was able to field 350,000 troops.[174] Heartened by France's loss in Russia, Prussia joined with Austria, Sweden, Russia, Great Britain, Spain, and Portugal in a new coalition. Napoleon assumed command in Germany and inflicted a series of defeats on the Coalition culminating in the Battle of Dresden in August 1813.[175]
