The term STV in Australia refers to the Senate electoral system, a variant of Hare-Clark characterized by the "above the line" group voting ticket, a party list option.  It is used in the Australian upper house, the Senate, and some state upper houses.  Due to the number of preferences that are compulsory if a vote for candidates (below-the-line) is to be valid –  for the Senate a minimum of 90% of candidates must be scored, in 2013 in New South Wales that meant writing 99 preferences on the ballot[60] –  95% and more of voters use the above-the-line option, making the system, in all but name, a party list system.[61][62][63]  Parties determine the order in which candidates are elected and also control transfers to other lists and this has led to anomalies: preference deals between parties, and "micro parties" which rely entirely on these deals.  Additionally, independent candidates are unelectable unless they form, or join, a group above-the-line.[64][65]  Concerning the development of STV in Australia researchers have observed: "... we see real evidence of the extent to which Australian politicians, particularly at national levels, are prone to fiddle with the electoral system".[57]:86
