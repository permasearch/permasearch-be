Jackson contends that the ACP's public statements often do not match the findings of their studies. He argues that studies by Delft Hydraulics,[53] WPSI Inc.,[54] and DHI[55] all say that the proposed water-saving basins will allow more salt water into Gatun Lake, from which about half of Panama's population takes its drinking water. The ACP says that the problem can be reduced by "flushing" the new locks with fresh water from Gatun Lake, but this would defeat the water-saving feature.
