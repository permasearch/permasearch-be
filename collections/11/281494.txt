On 19 October 2009, changes to the citizenship test came into effect. Under the new rules, a mark of 75% (15 out of 20 questions correct) is required to pass.[6] Previously, a mark of 60% plus answering three mandatory questions correctly was required. Applicants will need to pass the test before a decision is made on their citizenship application, i.e. the application must be lodged before the test takes place.[7]
