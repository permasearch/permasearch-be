The local media began to criticize Grossman for his inconsistent performances and shortcomings. Many fans called upon Lovie Smith to bench Grossman in favor of veteran quarterback Brian Griese. Nevertheless, Smith, who had supported Grossman throughout the season, opted to keep Grossman as the team's starter. The Bears prepared to take on the Seattle Seahawks for a second time, who had returned with a healthy Shaun Alexander. Prior to the game, Smith announced the creation of the "Fourth Phase", which involved using fan support as an advantage. On a dreary day along the lake-front, the Bears defeated the Seahawks, 27â€“24, on an overtime Robbie Gould field goal. The win marked the first time since 1994 season, that the Bears had won a playoff game.
