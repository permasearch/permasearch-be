The yolk mass, together with the egg cell or ovum properly (after fertilization, the embryo) are enclosed by the vitelline membrane, whose structure is different from a cell membrane.[2][3] The yolk is mostly extracellular to the oolemma, being not accumulated inside the cytoplasm of the egg cell (as occurs in frogs),[4] contrary to the claim that the avian egg cell (in strict sense) and its yolk are a single giant cell.[5][6]
