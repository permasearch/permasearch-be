Juliette begins to feel threatened by Layla when she steals some of her spotlight and gets distracted. When Layla goes over her set time, making Juliette's set and the show run late, at the next show she flips Layla and Will's sets. Just as Layla is supposed to go on stage to sing with Will, Juliette barges in, takes the mic and sings with him instead. To get back at her, Layla calls the press to inform them that Juliette is the cause of the Wentworths' divorce. At the Music City Festival, the press hound her. She tells Glenn to find the person who leaked to the press but soon suspects that Layla might have had something to do with it. Jeff goes to Layla, telling her that if she had anything to do with it, she will be dropped from the label. When Juliette arrives at the next tour stop, she is greeted by angry picketers who harass her and call her names. Her reputation takes another blow when someone edits a video of her so it sounds like she said "there is no God". She turns to Layla for help as a way to clear her name.
