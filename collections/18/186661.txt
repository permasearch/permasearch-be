Fox Sports West's deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers, whose games aired via sister network Prime Ticket, expired at the end of the 2013 MLB season. On June 20, 2011, MLB Commissioner Bud Selig rejected a proposed contract extension between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Prime Ticket, citing concerns that the deal was structured in a way that most of the proceeds would end up being assigned to beleaguered Dodgers owner Frank McCourt and not the team's operations.[8] Both Fox Sports West and the Dodgers were involved in separate lawsuits over the team's broadcast rights as well as the sale of the club.[9][10] On January 10, 2012, Fox and the Dodgers reached a settlement in court, clearing the way for the sale of the team.[11] Fox's exclusive negotiating period with the Dodgers expired on November 30, 2012 â€“ leaving the team open to competing offers.[12]
