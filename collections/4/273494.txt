Sales of D&D reached US$29 million in 1985,[5] but Gygax, seeing his future at TSR as untenable,[45] resigned all positions with TSR, Inc. in October 1986, and settled his disputes with TSR in December 1986.[46] By the terms of his settlement with TSR, Gygax kept the rights to Gord the Rogue as well as all D&D characters whose names were anagrams or plays on his own name (for example, Yrag and Zagyg).[47] However, he lost the rights to all his other work, including the World of Greyhawk and the names of all the characters he had ever used in TSR material, such as Mordenkainen, Robilar, and Tenser.
