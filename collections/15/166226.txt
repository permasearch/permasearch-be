Under Article I of the Constitution, which establishes the U.S. Congress, each of the 50 states is represented in the Senate (irrespective of population size) by two senators, and each is guaranteed at least one representative in the House. Senators are elected by popular vote to staggered terms of six years. There are presently 100 U.S. Senators. Representatives are elected from single-member districts by popular vote to terms of two years (not staggered). The size of the House—presently 435 voting members—is set by federal statute. Seats in the House are distributed among the states in proportion to the most recent constitutionally mandated decennial census.[21]
