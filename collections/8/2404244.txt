In the first step the energy WI of the transfer of a specific amount of charge is calculated, e.g. for the system in a state when both spheres carry half of the amount of charge which is to be transferred. This state of the system can be reached by transferring the respective charge from the donor sphere to the vacuum and then back to the acceptor sphere.[9] Then the spheres in this state of charge give rise to a defined electric field in the solvent which creates the total solvent polarization Pu + Pe. By the same token this polarization of the solvent interacts with the charges.
