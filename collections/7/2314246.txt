The Penal Laws against Catholics (and also Presbyterians) were renewed in the late 17th and early 18th centuries due to fear of Catholic support for Jacobitism after the Williamite War in Ireland and were slowly repealed in 1771â€“1829. Penal Laws against Presbyterians were relaxed by the Toleration Act of 1719, due to their siding with the Jacobites in a 1715 rebellion. Nevertheless, this did not prevent the large-scale emigration of Presbyterians and other non-Conformist Protestants out of Ireland. Some 250,000 left for the New World alone between the years 1717 and 1774, most of them arriving there from Ulster. Their descendants account for most of the Protestant portion of the Irish American population today.
