It is a Friday morning in the Matthews household, and Cory is annoyed that Morgan ate all of the sugar cereal. Eric tries to convince Amy and Alan to have a later curfew so that he could spend more time with his date. Alan then excitedly informs Eric and Cory about the annual father/son softball game. Cory and Eric, though, do not share the same enthusiasm as Alan for the softball game. At school, Cory's class recited the Pledge of Allegiance, except Topanga. Cory then laughs about Topanga getting in trouble and finds out that Mr. Feeny asked Topanga not to say the Pledge of Allegiance to start the lesson of the day. He used Cory and Topanga as examples for the social debate: Pledge Vs. Protest. Topanga is defending the right to protest and Cory thinks it's not worth it to protest. Meanwhile, Cory sees Alan practicing for the father/son game and feels guilty about telling him that he doesn't want to play. Eric and Cory try to make Amy help them not be in the softball game. Eric and Cory try to give Alan excuses and he tells them that the game has been cancelled. Cory then finds out that the game was played from Topanga. Eric and Cory then try to make it up to Alan by throwing him a barbecue. In the class, Cory then tells the class that no matter what tradition anyone is doing they should respect it. Cory and Eric then tell Alan to have a re-match father/son softball game by challenging the bookstore to another match. In the post-credits, they come back victorious.
