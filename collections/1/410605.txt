When a line segment is given an orientation (direction) it suggests a translation or perhaps a force tending to make a translation. The magnitude and direction are indicative of a potential change. This suggestion has been absorbed into mathematical physics through the concept of a Euclidean vector.[1][2] The collection of all directed line segments is usually reduced by making "equivalent" any pair having the same length and orientation.[3] This application of an equivalence relation dates from Giusto Bellavitisâ€™s introduction of the concept of equipollence of directed line segments in 1835.
