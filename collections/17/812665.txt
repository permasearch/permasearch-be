The administration of the empire was carried on along the lines indicated in his Amuktamalyada. He was of the opinion that the King should always rule with an eye towards Dharma. His concern for the welfare of the people is amply proved by his extensive annual tours all over the empire, during which he studied everything personally and tried to redress the grievances of the people and to punish the evil doers. With regard to the promotion of the economic progress of his people, Krishnadevaraya says:" The extent of the kingdom is the means for the acquisition of wealth.[12] Therefore even if the land is limited in extent, excavate tanks and canals and increase the prosperity  of the poor by leasing him the land for low ari and koru, so that you may obtain wealth as well as religious merit."[12]
