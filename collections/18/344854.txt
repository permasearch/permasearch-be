At the age of ten, Morgan was a witness to the shooting death of his father, also a police officer.[2] Left without a father figure, he had behavioral problems as an adolescent and earned himself a juvenile record for fighting. He was taken under the wing of a local youth center coordinator, Carl Buford. Buford acted as a surrogate father to Morgan, helping expunge Morgan's juvenile criminal record and him to obtain the aforementioned football scholarship. Although Morgan was able to avoid going into a life of crime like many of his peers, Buford was also sexually abusing him, a fact which Morgan only admitted years later and under extreme duress.[2] As a teen he discovered the body of an unidentified boy, which had a profound effect on him (he went door to door in order to collect money to buy the boy a headstone and visited the boy's grave every time he came home to Chicago). Due to his difficult past, he displays little sympathy for unremorseful criminals who attempt to use their traumatic childhood as an excuse for the crimes they commit.[3] Prior to joining the FBI, Morgan served in a bomb squad and was a Chicago PD officer. At one time he spent 18 months doing deep undercover work.
