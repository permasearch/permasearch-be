Also known as full-size luxury cars, grand saloons, flagship car, or premium large cars, while "Oberklasse" is used in Germany. Many of these are the marque's showcases for the newest automotive technology.[53] Several nameplates also offer long-wheelbase versions that offer additional rear legroom and amenities.[54] Full-size luxury cars sold in Canada and the U.S. typically have mid-displacement V8 engines, though recently some marques have offered six cylinder powerplants but without much success.[55][56][57]
