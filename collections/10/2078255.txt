The music video for "Let Me Love You (Until You Learn to Love Yourself)" was directed by Christopher Simms.[20] Incorporating choreographed dance scenes, with Ne-Yo baring "his toned physique" in a bedroom scene,[30] the video was uploaded on the singer's Vevo channel on July 18, 2012.[31] The overall atmosphere in the video is "dark", consisting of dim lighting and murky locations.[21] The video begins with an opening scene where Ne-Yo wears his trademark fedora to one side, while singing the opening lyrics of the song.[1] The video then moves on to bedroom scenes, where Ne-Yo strips of to show his six pack abs while embracing a topless woman.[1] Trent Fitzgerald from music website PopCrush stated that in the following dance scenes, Ne-Yo was "channeling" Michael Jackson in his dance moves. These scenes feature Ne-Yo dancing in front of a troop of backing dancers in a warehouse setting.[1] Finally, the video ends with Ne-Yo and his femme fatale on a beach, smiling at the camera.[32]
