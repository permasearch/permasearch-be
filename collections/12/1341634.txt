Region of northwestern India that now comprises Rajasthan state and small sections of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. The Aravalli Range crosses the southern part of the region from northeast to southwest. The northwestern part is largely the Thar desert, but to the southeast the land is extremely fertile. The Rajput princely states came under British protection by treaties in the early 19th century; most of the area was formed into Rajasthan state in 1948. The catchment area or recruitment area for the regiment is mostly from Rajputs from all over the state of Rajasthan and some western districts of Madhya Pradesh (mainly Mandsaur, Neemuch, and Sheopur). However the Rajputana Rifles both by its name and composition remain strongly associated with the state of Rajasthan and more or less considered Rajasthan's infantry brigade in the Indian Army.This in contrast to the similarly-named Rajput Regiment which is in fact entirely associated with the state of Haryana and some regions of Harit Pradesh and recruits mainly from Rajputs . Jats are also recruited in the same strength. Nearly, 80% of the Regiments strength is of Rajputs and Jats . Other's recruited are Ahir, Sikh, Gurjar and Muslims.
