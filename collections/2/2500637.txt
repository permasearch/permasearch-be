According to Davis, I Look to You was not aimed at simply following current music marketing trends, but instead, staying true to who Houston is and the impact she has made on the music industry.[4] The album's opener "Million Dollar Bill" was written and co-produced by Alicia Keys, after the singer-songwriter personally asked Davis if she could make a contribution to the album.[1] Production courtesy of Kaseem "Swizz Beatz" Dean surprised critics, as they felt it was more of an "old-school R&B" production and did not sound like most "Swizzy" productions, and is "not an attempt at being a hip-hop club banger."[1] Shaheem Reed from MTV commented "Houston's voice [was displayed] over a club-friendly beat that blends a rough-riding thump with R&B".[5] "Nothin' But Love", produced by contemporary R&B and hip-hop producer Nathaniel "Danja" Hills, was described by Rap-Up magazine as being "uptempo [and] danceable [with a] hand-clapping beat." It was also described as being made for urban radio.[1] "Call You Tonight" is one of two songs written by Johnt√° Austin and was produced by Norwegian production team Stargate featuring "their trademark guitar riffs."[1] The other Austin track on the album is a mid-tempo R&B track titled, "Worth It", produced by Eric Hudson.[1]
