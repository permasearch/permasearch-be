Players can only participate in the Continental Tour that their national federation is a member of. In addition to prize money, Continental Tour events award players with FIVB ranking points and their national federations with National Federation ranking points.[47] The latter determines how many teams a national federation can send to the World Championships and the Summer Olympics.[51]
