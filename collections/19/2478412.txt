Pit connections and pit plugs are unique and distinctive features of red algae that form during the process of cytokinesis following mitosis.[33][34] In red algae, cytokinesis is incomplete. Typically, a small pore is left in the middle of the newly formed partition. The pit connection is formed where the daughter cells remain in contact.
