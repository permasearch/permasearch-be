In 2007, Cadbury launched a new advertising campaign entitled Gorilla, from a new in-house production company called "Glass And A Half Full Productions".[9] The advert was premiÃ¨red during the season finale of Big Brother 2007, and consists of a gorilla at a drum kit, drumming along to the Phil Collins song "In the Air Tonight".[10] The advert had over five million views on YouTube, and put the Phil Collins song back into the UK charts.
