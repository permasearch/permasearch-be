This term is new to possibly distinguish between Halloween Eve's or Halloween Days' Trick-or-Treating, which in most places is just called "The day the town decided when Trick-or-Treating was." Traditionally, Halloween Day or Halloween Eve, children went trick-or-treating at night- when Halloween festivities started. Due to both days being festival days, especially on weekends, many car accidents and intoxicated misbehaviors occurred. To make this holiday safer, in a county all towns in it, will receive a different day for children residing in that town to go trick-or-treating: hours between getting out of school and ending between 6-8pm. Due to the differing days, children are able to go trick-or-treating on multiple weekdays in the neighboring towns.
