With Rusty turning eighteen, Sharon decides to adopt him for legal reasons, as well as the fact that she considers him her son. Rusty agrees to the idea and as a result, Sharon divorces her estranged husband Jack after being separated for over twenty years after he refuses to accept the adoption without money. During this time, she also has to deal with the return of Rusty's mother, Sharon Beck who ends up in a rehabilitation center but immediately goes back to drinking. Sharon later learns Sharon Beck had pressed Rusty to work on the streets to get her bail money and ensures she goes to jail for a year, in order to protect Rusty, that will be extended to seven if she misbehaves. Shortly afterwards, Sharon officially adopts Rusty, though he keeps his own last name. After some tension between Rusty and her biological son Ricky, Sharon's children accept Rusty into the family as well.
