A flagellum (/fləˈdʒɛləm/; plural: flagella) is a lash-like appendage that protrudes from the cell body of certain bacterial and eukaryotic cells. The primary role of the flagellum is locomotion, but it also often has function as a sensory organelle, being sensitive to chemicals and temperatures outside the cell.[1][2][3][4] The similar structure in the archaea functions in the same way but is structurally different and has been termed the archaellum.[5]
