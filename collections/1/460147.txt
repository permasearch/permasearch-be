"The One with the Embryos" was co-written by Jill Condon and Amy Toomin and directed by Kevin S. Bright.[2] In October 1997, Lisa Kudrow announced she and her husband Michel Stern were expecting their first child.[3] When Marta Kauffman first learned of Kudrow's pregnancy, she was overjoyed and wanted to find a solution of incorporating it into the show without choosing to cover up.[4] At the time of filming "The One with the Embryos" in December, Kudrow was four months pregnant and the writers discussed ways of narrating the pregnancy on the show, settling with Kudrow's character carrying her brother's embryos.[4]
