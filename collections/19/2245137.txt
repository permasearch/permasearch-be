New Zealand is a constitutional or limited monarchy. The underlying principle is democracy, with political power exercised through a democratically elected parliament â€“ this is often stated as "The Queen reigns but the government rules so long as it has the support of the House of Representatives."[1] The "Crown in Right of New Zealand" has been legally distinct from the British monarchy since New Zealand ratified the Statute of Westminster 1931 with the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947 in 1947. The British Crown and New Zealand Crown are thus legally distinct.
