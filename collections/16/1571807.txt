The product known as Kraft Dinner (KD) in Canada, Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Dinner or Kraft Mac and Cheese in the United States and Australia, and Macaroni Cheese or Cheesey Pasta in the United Kingdom, is a nonperishable, packaged dry macaroni and cheese product. It was first introduced under the Kraft Dinner name in both Canada and U.S. in 1937.[2] The product also developed into several other formulations, including Kraft's Easy Mac Cups, renamed Macaroni & Cheese Dinner Cups, a single-serving product designed specifically for microwave ovens.
