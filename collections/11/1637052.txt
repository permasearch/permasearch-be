Again, new material with Robinson failed to materialize, and in 2010, Herron, Ellis and Jones signed with René Moore's Rufftown Records in a deal that was to include two albums and touring.[33] While the trio finished several songs for a new album, including promotional single "I'll Cry Later" which was sent to select urban adult contemporary radio stations on September 26, 2011,[34] the comeback stalled and Jones left the band once more.[33] In August 2012, Jones and Robinson announced that they would potentially record a group album together under the moniker Heirs to the Throne.[35] While Herron and Ellis would continue to tour as En Vogue along with a rejoined Bennett,[33] Jones and Robinson added singer Shaunté Usual to their lineup.[36] However, in 2013, Robinson chose not to begin a new group with her former band member and instead joined the cast of the TV One reality show R&B Divas: Los Angeles.[37] Meanwhile, Jones began a touring with singers Alison Carney and Maria Freeman as her new lineup of En Vogue, entitled En Vogue to the Max.[38][39][40] Jones later lost the right to use the En Vogue name after Herron and Ellis had filed suit against her for unauthorized use of the name and a judge ruled that Herron and Ellis, as holders of the group's LLC, had exclusive rights to the group's name. Jones went solo and began recording her own original material, releasing her debut single ‘Didn’t I’ and a new ballad version of the En Vogue hit ‘Don’t Let Go (Love)’ with Australian singer Greg Gould which topped the charts and reached over 20 million views.[41]
