The debate over the Americans with Disabilities Act led some religious groups to take opposite positions.[31] The Association of Christian Schools International, opposed the ADA in its original form.[32] primarily because the ADA labeled religious institutions "public accommodations", and thus would have required churches to make costly structural changes to ensure access for all.[33] The cost argument advanced by ACSI and others prevailed in keeping religious institutions from being labeled as "public accommodations".[citation needed]
