Jennings was also instrumental in SpongeBob's genesis.[37] Kenny has called him "one of SpongeBob's early graphics mentors".[30] On weekends, Kenny joined Hillenburg, Jennings, and Drymon for creative sessions, in which they captured ideas on a tape recorder.[30] Kenny performed audio tests as SpongeBob during these sessions, while Hillenburg enacted voices for the other characters.[27][30]
