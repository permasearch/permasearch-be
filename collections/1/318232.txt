Cytoprotective agents are designed to help protect the tissues that line the stomach and small intestine.[24] They include the medications sucralfate and misoprostol. If NSAIDs are being taken regularly, one of these medications to protect the stomach may also be taken. Another cytoprotective agent is bismuth subsalicylate.
