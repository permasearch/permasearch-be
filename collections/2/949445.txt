As a practical matter, the Kelloggâ€“Briand Pact did not live up to all of its aims, but has arguably had some considerable success. It did not end war or stop the rise of militarism, and was unable to keep the international peace in succeeding years.[12] Moreover, it erased the legal distinction between war and peace because the signatories, having renounced the use of war, began to wage wars without declaring them as in the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931, the Italian invasion of Abyssinia in 1935, the Spanish Civil War in 1936, the Soviet invasion of Finland in 1939, and the German and Soviet invasions of Poland.[13] The pact is, however, associated with a marked decline in territorial conquest of one nation by another in the periods before and after its signing. The period 1816 to 1928 saw on average one conquest every 10 months and 114,088 square miles of territory taken per year. The period since WWII has seen one conquest every four years and 5,772 square miles of territory taken per year. After WWII, territories that had been conquered between 1928 and WWII, with some exceptions, were mostly returned to the countries that had originally held them. [14]
