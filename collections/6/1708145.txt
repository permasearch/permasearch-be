In September 2014, Kalaipuli S. Thanu signed on to finance a project directed by Atlee, which would feature Vijay in the lead role. Atlee continued to script the film through late 2014, while it was announced that Vijay would join the team to start filming after the completion of his other venture, Puli (2015).[9][10][11] Actresses Samantha Ruth Prabhu and Amy Jackson were reported to have signed the film in January 2015, after a few Hindi actresses turned down the opportunity to work on a Tamil film.[12] Several of the technical crew involved in Atlee's previous film, Raja Rani (2013), were also added to the team including music composer G. V. Prakash Kumar, cinematographer George C. Williams, editor Ruben and art director T. Muthuraj.[13] An official launch event was held at the Kerala Club House on the East Coast Road in Chennai, with several members of the cast and crew in attendance. Alongside the lead actor, it was revealed that Prabhu, Raadhika, director Mahendran, and actress Meenaâ€™s daughter Nainika would be a part of the film.[14] Several titles for the film including Moondru Mugam, Vetri, Thuppaki 2, Khakee and Thaarumaaru were considered, before the makers finalised Theri in late November 2015.[15]
