In 2008, from the time the king nominated José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero for a second term as prime minister immediately following the 2008 general election, almost a month passed before Zapatero was able to present his Investiture Speech before the Congress and stand for a Vote of Confidence.[8] If no overall majority was obtained on the first Vote of the Confidence, then the same nominee and program is resubmitted for a second vote within forty-eight hours.[7] Following the second vote, if confidence by the Congress is still unreached, then the monarch again meets with political leaders and the Speaker, and submits a new nominee for a vote of confidence.[7] If, within two months, no candidate has won the confidence of the Congress then the King dissolves the Cortes and calls for a new general election.[7] The King's royal decree is countersigned by the Speaker of the Congress.[7]
