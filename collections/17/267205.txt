In June and July 1905, there were many peasant uprisings in which peasants seized land and tools.[43] Disturbances in the Russian-controlled Congress Poland culminated in June 1905 in the Łódź insurrection. Surprisingly, only one landlord was recorded as killed.[44] Far more violence was inflicted on peasants outside the commune: 50 deaths were recorded.
