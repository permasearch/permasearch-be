Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly was "pleasantly surprised" by the film's calm tone, which he found to be against modern trends, but said that George was perhaps a bit too sweet and that the "movie comes close to denying he's any sort of troublemaker".[10] He noted somewhat negatively the few modern anachronisms in the film.[10] Brian Lowry of Variety was negative about the film, criticizing the quality of the animation, the music, and other aspects.[11]
