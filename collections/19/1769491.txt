The modern word "sine" is derived from the Latin word sinus, which means "bay", "bosom" or "fold", translating Arabic jayb. The Arabic term is in origin a corruption of Sanskrit jīvā, or "chord". Sanskrit jīvā in learned usage was a synonym of jyā "chord", originally the term for "bow-string". Sanskrit jīvā was rendered into Arabic as jiba.[3][4] This term was then transformed into the genuine Arabic word jayb,[4] meaning "bosom, fold, bay", either by the Arabs or by a mistake of the European translators such as Robert of Chester (perhaps because the words were written without vowels), who translated jayb into Latin as sinus.[3] Particularly Fibonacci's sinus rectus arcus proved influential in establishing the term sinus.[5] The words "minute" and "second" are derived from the Latin phrases partes minutae primae and partes minutae secundae.[6] These roughly translate to "first small parts" and "second small parts".
