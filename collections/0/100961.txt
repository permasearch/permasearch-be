To address Christie's concerns, new legislation was drafted that prohibits businesses other than Atlantic City casinos from advertising online gambling, or allowing their facilities to be used for online gambling.[35][36] On February 26, 2013, a revised bill permitting Internet gambling was overwhelming approved by the New Jersey Legislature, and then signed into law by Chris Christie.[37] The law legalizes online casino gambling for a 10-year trial period, restricts the operation of the websites to Atlantic City's eleven casinos, and imposes a 15% tax on online gambling revenue, instead of the 8% currently imposed on casinos.[38][clarification needed]
