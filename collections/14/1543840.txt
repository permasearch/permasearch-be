The album was a debut for Daniel Lanois as a rock music producer; he would later (often in partnership with Brian Eno) produce for artists as diverse as U2, Bob Dylan, and Dashboard Confessional.  Daniel's sister Jocelyne was a member of the band, playing bass and singing backing vocals on this album.
