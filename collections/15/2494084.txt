Rabbinical writings often show more hostility towards gentiles due to frequent persecution of the Jews by these nations. Some rabbis show more compassion towards the gentiles, while others are less tolerant. Eliezer ben Hyrcanus writes that the mind of every gentile is always intent upon idolatry.[3] He believed that gentiles only perform animal sacrifice to make a name for themselves. He further believed that gentiles have no share in the world to come.
