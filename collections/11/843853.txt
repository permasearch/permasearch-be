MAC is composed of a complex of four complement proteins (C5b, C6, C7, and C8) that bind to the outer surface of the plasma membrane, and many copies of a fifth protein (C9) that hook up to one another, forming a ring in the membrane. C6-C9 all contain a common MACPF domain.[7] This region is homologous to cholesterol-dependent cytolysins from Gram-positive bacteria.[8]
