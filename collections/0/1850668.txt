After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, oil import prices to Ukraine reached world market levels in 1993. However, gas import prices and transit fees remained below European levels for Russian exports to Europe through pipelines in Ukraine; these were set in bilateral negotiations.[18] At the same time Ukraine remained the main transit corridor for Russia's gas export. In 2004â€“2005, 80% of Russian gas exports to the European Union were made through Ukrainian Territory.[19][20] Two-thirds of Gazprom's revenue comes from the sale of gas that crosses Ukraine.[21]
