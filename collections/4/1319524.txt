United States swimmers have won the title 43 times, followed by Australia (13 times) and East Germany (11 times).[1] This ratio is approximately proportional to the amount of gold medals won by the respective nations at the Olympics. East Germany was particularly successful in the 1970s and 1980s, when they dominated the women's events, aided by systematic state-sponsored doping.[3][4]
