After the first states legalized in 2012, the Justice Department issued the Cole Memorandum in August 2013, seeking to clarify how federal law would be enforced. The memo specified eight conditions which would merit enforcement of federal law, some of which included the distribution of cannabis to minors and the diversion of cannabis across state borders.[155] Aside from these situations, the memo generally allowed for the commercial distribution of cannabis in states where such activity has been legalized. In January 2018, however, the Cole memo was rescinded by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, introducing uncertainty into how federal law would be enforced.[90]
