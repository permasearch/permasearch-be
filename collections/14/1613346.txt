One of the notable biker gangs in Northern California, the Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, was founded in Charming. The Club was formed in 1969 by John Teller and Piney Winston following their service in the Vietnam War, with the duo acting as President and Vice President respectively. The Sons of Anarchy has become one of the most prevalent Clubs worldwide, with charters ranging from the United States to Northern Ireland and beyond. However, the founding chapter remained in Charming, becoming known as Redwood Original or SAMCRO (Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club Redwood Original).
