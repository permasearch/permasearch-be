The old city limit of 174km sq was set during 70s and have not been risen till 2012.The population of 4.8 million is for the 174km sq limits of the city.So with the expansion the city population is estimated to be 7.2 million..The metro area which is 1200sq km (again the old metro limit set during 70s) is now home to 1.07 crore plus people.The metro region includes Chengalpet, Tiruvallur,Kanchipuram,Thiruporur and Vada Nemili..All these areas have continous development from the city part and you cant classify them as separate places and these places have already been included under Chennai metro area..So if you include all these places the new metro area will be 1500 sq km plus.So we are waiting for the official data ..the CMDA estimated the population to cross 1 crore during the census 2011 itself..But no official data for the new expanded area limits have been published..(for both city and metro limits).Moreover the distance between one end of the city to other is 83 km..so this places Chennai in the same traditional position of 4 only below Mumbai,Delhi and Kolkata..Hyderabad and Bangalore follow Chennai..So Chennai is surely home to over 1.08 crore people.. hey guys, i have put pictures of HYD,Bangalore,Chennaiand Kolkata on the graph.
