The agate was designated as the state's first official rock in 1969. A form of cryptocrystalline quartz (chalcedony) that is regarded as a semiprecious gemstone, agate is found in several areas in the state.[1] Collecting localities are found in Hawkins County (golden tone agate), Greene County (agatized oolites), Bedford County (carnelian, blue, ivory, pink, finely banded, dendritic, moss, iris and Fairburn style agate), and Shelby County (Lake Superior type agate and agatized corals and sponges).[12]
