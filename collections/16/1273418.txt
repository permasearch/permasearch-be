James Francis "Jimmy" Finnerty (Griffin Frazen)(11â€“15 years old) - The black sheep of the family, Jimmy's choices are not always accepted by his parents (such as choosing to become a vegetarian). Thus, he often confides in his Uncle Eddie. Many comparisons are made between the two characters on the show, most notably in the third season episode Who Are You? where he pretends to shoplift in a desperate grab for attention. The reason he gets so little attention is that unlike his siblings he causes the least trouble. He is arguably the most sensible and intelligent of the characters.
