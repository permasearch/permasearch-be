There had been a tradition of concerts on New Year's Day in Vienna since 1838, but not with music of the Strauss family. From 1928 to 1933 there were six New YearsÂ´s concerts in the Musikverein, conducted by Johann Strauss III. These concerts were broadcast by the RAVAG.[3] In 1939, Clemens Krauss, with the support of Vienna Gauleiter Baldur von Schirach, devised a New Years' concert which the orchestra dedicated to Kriegswinterhilfswerk ('Winter War Relief'), to improve morale at the front lines.[4] After World War II, this concert survived, as the Nazi origins were largely forgotten, until more recently.[5]
