Evidence of dugong predation was identified in one study that found dugong tissue in 15 of 85 tiger sharks caught off the Australian coast.[34] Additionally, examination of adult dugongs has shown scars from failed shark attacks.[35] To minimize attacks, dugong microhabitats shift similarly to those of known tiger shark prey when the sharks are abundant.[36]
