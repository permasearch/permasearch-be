The Communist Party USA was routinely harassed and oppressed by government officials, leading it to be the primary client of the ACLU.[102] The Communists were very aggressive in their tactics, often engaging in illegal or unethical conduct, and this led to frequent conflicts between the Communists and ACLU.[102] Communist leaders often attacked the ACLU, particularly when the ACLU defended the free speech rights of conservatives.[102] This uneasy relationship between the two groups continued for decades.[102]
