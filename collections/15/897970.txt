The Wetlands is a large aviary alongside Tsavo and is home to a variety of Storks, Cranes and waterfowl. In 2009, a walk-through bird safari with African bird species opened. It currently houses von der decken's hornbills, lilac-breasted rollers, hamerkops, weaver birds, Blacksmith Plovers, Red-Winged Starlings and a variety of waterfowl, amongst other species. At the other side of the Bird Safari is a Large pen for wattled cranes and Black crowned cranes.
