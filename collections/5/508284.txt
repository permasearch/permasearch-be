Cena has a history of returning from actual (and kayfabe) injuries much sooner than expected. In 2016, ESPN reported David Shoemaker said of him, "Never underestimate Cena's recuperative abilities. He's somewhere on the recovery scale between German platelet-rich plasma therapy and Deadpool."[332] Big Show stated he felt the most stable to be lifted by Cena, despite Cena being over 200 lbs lighter and almost a foot shorter, a testament to Cena's functional strength.[333]
