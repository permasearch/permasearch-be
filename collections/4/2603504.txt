The notion of air "holding" water vapor or being "saturated" by it is often mentioned in connection with the concept of relative humidity. This, however, is misleadingâ€”the amount of water vapor that enters (or can enter) a given space at a given temperature is independent of the amount of air (nitrogen, oxygen, etc.) that is present. Indeed, a vacuum has the same equilibrium capacity to hold water vapor as the same volume filled with air; both are given by the equilibrium vapor pressure of water at the given temperature.[15][16]
