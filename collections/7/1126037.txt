There are some brief tests (5â€“15 minutes) that have reasonable reliability to screen for dementia. While many tests have been studied,[53][54][55] presently the mini mental state examination (MMSE) is the best studied and most commonly used. The MMSE is a useful tool for helping to diagnose dementia if the results are interpreted along with an assessment of a person's personality, their ability to perform activities of daily living, and their behaviour.[56] Other cognitive tests include the abbreviated mental test score (AMTS), the, Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS),[57] the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI),[58] the Trail-making test,[59] and the clock drawing test.[60] The MOCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) is a very reliable screening test and is available online for free in 35 different languages.[11] The MOCA has also been shown somewhat better at detecting mild cognitive impairment than the MMSE.[61]
