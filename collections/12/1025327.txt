Flynn had a small role in The Fugitive. The show's writers took advantage of this, placing Janitor (in his fictional role) as the real actor in the film. J.D. notices this as he watches the movie. When J.D. confronts Janitor, he (eventually) admits that it really was him- after J.D. explains that he wanted it to be Janitor as it would show him to be more than a bitter wretch but a man who once had hopes and dreams, even if they didn't work out- but admonishes him not to tell anyone.[17]
