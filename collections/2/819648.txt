To pass the inspection a driver must get to a police vehicle registration center or an authorized service station and present a vehicle for inspection. If the vehicle passes, then the driver would receive a certificate of worthiness that must be presented to the insurance company to obtain the compulsory vehicle insurance. The lack of the valid insurance certificate or driving with the elapsed one is subject to heavy fines and eventual revocation of the Driver's License. The test periodicity varies with the type of vehicle. Commercial buses (defined as vehicles that carry >8 persons aside from a driver) and oversize/dangerous cargo trucks must be inspected each 6 months, heavy trucks (>3.5 tons loaded weight) are inspected annually, while the new cars, bikes and light trucks (< 3.5 tons) must be first inspected after three years, then bi-annually until they are 7 years old, after which the inspections become annual.
