The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration, which reached #40 in the US and went gold,[citation needed] was released in August 1993 just before Dylan was about to deliver his second folk studio set inside of a year, World Gone Wrong. The concert was dubbed "Bobfest" by Neil Young at the beginning of his "All Along the Watchtower" cover.
