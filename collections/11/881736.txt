Church was born on May 3, 1977 in Granite Falls, North Carolina to Ken and Rita Church. Church worked with his father at Clayton Marcus, a furniture upholstery company where his father was president.[2] At 13, he bought a guitar and began writing songs of his own. By his senior year of high school, he had found a gig at a local bar, which occupied most of his time. He played many Jimmy Buffett cover songs and a few of his own original songs in some dive bars. Some of these places were so rough that he got into a few altercations from the stage. For a few years, the band played often in bars and restaurants throughout North Carolina.[citation needed] The band "Mountain Boys" consisted of his college roommate, brother, and a fellow guitarist.[3]
