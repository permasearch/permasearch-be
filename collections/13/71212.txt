The more familiar form of the word appears in 1769, in Elizabeth Raffald's The Experienced English Housekeeper, as "To make Indian pickle, or Piccalillo".[7] Richard Briggs, in his 1788 The English Art of Cookery, similarly calls it "Picca Lillo".[8] The spelling "piccalilli" can be seen in an advertisement in a 1799 edition of The Times.[9]
