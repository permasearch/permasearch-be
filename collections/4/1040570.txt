In Twilight, vampires deviate from traditional myth in many ways, a fact often alluded to in the series, usually for humor. Meyer has said she did not research vampire mythology before writing the series.[10] For example, they are unharmed by garlic, holy items, or wooden stakes; they have reflections and shadows,[11] and are able to be out during daylight. Vampires are also capable of eating human food, though their bodies are unable to digest it and they must cough it up later.[12] They do not have to breathe, but typically find it uncomfortable to be without a sense of smell.
