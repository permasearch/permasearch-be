Fewer than 100 Texian soldiers remained at the Alamo Mission in Béxar, under the command of Colonel James C. Neill.[100] Unable to spare the number of men necessary to mount a successful defense of the sprawling facility,[152] in January Houston sent Bowie with 30 men to remove the artillery and destroy the complex.[153][Note 10] In a letter to Governor Smith, Bowie argued that "the salvation of Texas depends in great measure on keeping Béxar out of the hands of the enemy. It serves as the frontier picquet guard, and if it were in the possession of Santa Anna, there is no stronghold from which to repel him in his march towards the Sabine."[153][Note 11] The letter to Smith ended, "Colonel Neill and myself have come to the solemn resolution that we will rather die in these ditches than give it up to the enemy."[153] Few reinforcements were authorized; cavalry officer William B. Travis arrived in Béxar with 30 men on February 3 and five days later, a small group of volunteers arrived, including the famous frontiersman Davy Crockett.[154] On February 11, Neill left to recruit additional reinforcements and gather supplies.[155] In his absence, Travis and Bowie shared command.[143]
