The Warden and Alistair are saved by Flemeth, a powerful witch who lives in a secluded hermitage with her daughter and apprentice, Morrigan. The Warden, Alistair, and Morrigan decide to gather a new army to slay the Archdemon and stop the Blight from destroying Ferelden and Thedas. Using ancient Grey Warden treaties, the Warden travels across Ferelden to enlist the aid of the Circle of Magi, the Dalish Elves, the Dwarves of Orzammar, and soldiers in Redcliffe loyal to Arl Eamon. In addition, Alistair reveals that he is a bastard son of King Maric Theirin, Cailan's father, making him a contender for the now vacant throne.
