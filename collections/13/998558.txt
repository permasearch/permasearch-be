Although the committee found scant hard evidence to support the widespread public belief that the profits of the arms industry had been a significant factor in America's decision to participate in the war, their reports did little to dispel the notion.[10] The committee documented the huge profits that arms factories had made during the war. It found that bankers had pressured Wilson to intervene in the war in order to protect their loans abroad. Also, the arms industry was at fault for price fixing and held excessive influence on American foreign policy leading up to and during World War I.[2][11]
