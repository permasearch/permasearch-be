The episodes received positive reviews, with critics calling the crossover fun, and everything fans could have wanted and more. Critics praised the producers for bringing the two series together while keeping the episodes as self-contained adventures, and highlighted the fight scene between the Flash and Arrow as living up to the hype. Ratings for the episodes were exceptional, with both being the highest watched episodes of each show since their respective series premieres. A subsequent crossover occurred the following year titled "Heroes Join Forces".
