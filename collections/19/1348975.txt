In February 1990, the first 767 equipped with Rolls-Royce RB211 turbofans, a 767-300, was delivered to British Airways.[54] Six months later, the carrier temporarily grounded its entire 767 fleet after discovering cracks in the engine pylons of several aircraft.[55] The cracks were related to the extra weight of the RB211 engines, which are 2,205 pounds (1,000Â kg) heavier than other 767 engines.[55] During the grounding, interim repairs were conducted to alleviate stress on engine pylon components, and a parts redesign in 1991 prevented further cracks.[55] Boeing also performed a structural reassessment, resulting in production changes and modifications to the engine pylons of all 767s in service.[56]
