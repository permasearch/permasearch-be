"Strawberry Fields Forever" was sequenced as the opening track of the 1973 compilation album The Beatles 1967â€“1970,[176] and the single charted again in Britain, peaking at number 32, when EMI reissued all 22 of the Beatles' UK singles in March 1976.[177][nb 16] In 1996, three previously unreleased versions of the song appeared on Anthology 2:[179] one of Lennon's home demos from November 1966; an altered version of the first studio take; and the complete take 7, in mono, edited with an extension of the coda's drums and percussion track from 9 December.[180] In 2006, a newly mixed version of the song was included on the album Love.[15] This mash-up takes sections from an acoustic demo,[181] take 1 and then take 26, and the ending incorporates elements from "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", "In My Life", "I'm Only Sleeping", "Penny Lane", "Piggies" and "Hello, Goodbye".[83] In 2015, the promo film was included in the three-disc versions (titled 1+) of the Beatles' 1 compilation.[182] A new stereo mix was created by Giles Martin to accompany the clip. This version appeared on CD in 2017 on the two-disc and six-disc 50th-anniversary editions of Sgt. Pepper, together with a selection of outtakes from the "Strawberry Fields Forever" sessions, including a complete take 26.[183]
