Clyde Drexler of the Portland Trail Blazers and Isiah Thomas of the Detroit Pistons were the candidates for the final professional roster spot.[10] Drexler was added to the team on May 12, 1992, with Christian Laettner of Duke University. As an acknowledgment to the previous amateur system, the US basketball committee decided to include one collegiate player on team, filling the final roster spot.[14][15] Laettner was the only player without any professional experience, and was chosen over Louisiana State University's Shaquille O'Neal for the final spot on the roster.[16]
