Biles' senior international debut was in March at the 2013 American Cup, a FIG World Cup event. She and Katelyn Ohashi were named as replacements for Elizabeth Price and 2012 Olympic gold medalist Kyla Ross, both of whom withdrew from the competition because of injuries.[37][38][39] Biles led for two rotations but finished second behind her teammate, Ohashi, after a fall off the beam.[40]
