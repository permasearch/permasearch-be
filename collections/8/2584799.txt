Steagall endured polio as a teen and learned how to play the guitar and mandolin during his recuperation.[19] This activity helped him regain the use of his left arm and hand.[20] When he enrolled at West Texas State University, he formed his first country band.[19] Don Lanier formed a group by the name of The Rhythm Orchids along with Buddy Knox and Jimmy Bowen.[21] He was hired as a soil chemist but played weekends at country dances. After he quit his professional role, he formed a band that became popular in the Rocky Mountain ski-resort clubs.[22] He moved to Los Angeles in 1965 and embarked on folk club performing and songwriting.[23] He wrote for two music publishers, Tree and Combine, before signing with Capitol Records.[22] Eventually, Steagall joined Lanier and Bowen. Steagall and Lanier co-wrote "Here We Go Again".[21] Steagall's first break came when Charles covered "Here We Go Again".[19] Steagall says that the song "came about in a very unusual manner and very quickly".[21] One source even claims that Steagall did not come to Hollywood until after Charles recorded the song.[24]
