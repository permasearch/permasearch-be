At the intersection of Ashland and Milwaukee Avenues, the Blue Line descends underground, swings over to Milwaukee Avenue, and continues southeast towards downtown under Milwaukee Avenue (with stops at Division Street, Chicago Avenue and Grand Street), east under Lake Street (crossing beneath the Chicago River) (with a stop at Clark/Lake Streets), south under Dearborn Street through the Loop (with stops at Washington Street, Monroe Street, and Jackson Boulevard) and west under Congress Parkway (with stops at LaSalle Street and Clinton Street). The tracks emerge from a portal near Halsted Street in the median of the Eisenhower Expressway (Interstate 290) and continue west. Jackson provides a transfer tunnel to the Red Line. Until October 2006, a transfer tunnel existed at Washington as well.
