Samuel Hahnemann invented the practise of homeopathy while translating the botanical, Treatise of the materia medica by the Scottish physician William Cullen[4] from English into German in 1790.  Twenty pages in that work are devoted to Peruvian cinchona bark which is used to prepare the medicine quinine.  This substance produces fever-like symptoms while being used to cure intermittent fever or ague and this led Hahnemann to conceive the principle of similars: that like may cure like.  He went on to develop the materia medica along these homeopathic lines and others then continued this work to produce great volumes of potential ingredients.[5]
