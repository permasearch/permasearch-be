The word prion, coined in 1982 by Stanley B. Prusiner, is a portmanteau derived from protein and infection, hence prion, and is short for "proteinaceous infectious particle",[7] in reference to its ability to self-propagate and transmit its conformation to other proteins.[142] Its main pronunciation is /ˈpriːɒn/ ( listen),[143][144][145][146] although /ˈpraɪɒn/, as the homographic name of the bird is pronounced,[145][146] is also heard.[147] In his 1982 paper introducing the term, Prusiner specified that it be "pronounced pree-on."[24]
