The presence of a uranium resource in Australia had been known since the 1890s.[1] Uranium was mined at Radium Hill in South Australia from 1906 and a refinery at Hunter's Hill near Sydney processed the Radium Hill ore between 1911 and 1915 for radium bromide and uranium. Radium was used for medical research and also mined at Mount Painter (adjacent to Mount Gee) in South Australia.[5]
