A study conducted by the Open University and University College London in May 2015 found that clinical leaders “seemed to be more willing to challenge or ignore diktats and messages from above, and to encourage their managerial colleagues to do the same”. Prof Martin Marshall said clinical leaders were more “focused on outcomes and less interested in processes. They don’t really mind how they do things as long as they feel they’re having an impact” Having the option of returning to full-time clinical practice meant that clinicians felt a “degree of freedom in what they say and do”.[18]
