The plot of the video essentially follows that of the song. Despite the fact it is the second track, the video reveals Jesus' and Whatsername's relationship before it is revealed in the story. The video pays homage to "1979" by Smashing Pumpkinsâ€”it also made use of the snorricam which created the videos' notable up close shots in the convenience store and party scenes.
