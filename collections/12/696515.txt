Willie Davis, the club professional from the Royal Montreal Club, designed a 12-hole course that opened in late summer 1891.[8] Members of Shinnecock Indian Nation helped build the course,[9] which is on land they have laid claim to and which remains in litigation. Stanford White designed the 1892 clubhouse, said to be the oldest golf clubhouse in the United States.[8] A nine-hole ladies-only course was designed and built at Shinnecock Hills in 1893.[10]
