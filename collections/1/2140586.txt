After the partition was announced, the majority of the Sikhs migrated from the Pakistani province of Punjab to the Indian province of Punjab, which then included the parts of the present-day Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. Following India's independence in 1947, the Punjabi Suba Movement led by the Akali Dal aimed at creation of a Punjabi linguistic state (Suba) in the Punjab region of India in the 1950s,[113] consistent with the policy of linguistic states (States Reorganisation Act, 1956) applied elsewhere in India. Concerned that creating a Punjabi-majority state would effectively mean creating a Sikh-majority state, the Indian government initially rejected the demand. After a series of protests, violent clampdowns on the Sikhs, and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, the Government finally agreed to partition the state, creating a new Punjabi speaking Punjab state and splitting the rest of the region to the states of Himachal Pradesh, the new state Haryana.[114] Subsequently, the Sikh leaders started demanding more autonomy for the states, alleging that the Central government was discriminating against Punjab (such as denying the state control over its waters, disproportionate extraction of its water resources to benefit other Indian regions, leaving significant Punjabi speaking regions outside of Punjab etc). Although the Akali Dal explicitly opposed the demand for an independent Sikh country, the issues raised by it and the Indian state's discrimination against the Sikhs (and Punjab) were used as a premise for the creation of a separate country by the proponents of Khalistan. The allegation of "secessionism" could have been overplayed by the Indian state to legitimise its brutal crushing of Sikh campaigns for rights or their dissent (such as their disproportionate role in opposing the Indira dictatorship (The Emergency (India))
