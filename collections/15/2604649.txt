Information and communication, food security and nutrition, and gender equality are closely linked dimensions of rural development, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)-Dimitra Project, 2011.[120] The vital contribution of women to the agricultural sphere in developing societies cannot be overemphasized.
