mineral nutrients required by the plant are absorbed from the soil by the roots only. some of these nutrients are observed as salts( nitrates, phosphates, sulphates, etc...) and some are simply as ions( potassium , calcium , magnesium , chlorine , etc...).These elements are required as constituents of cell and cell organelles as well as in the synthesis of a variety of compounds or enzymes within the cell.
