Sutton Coldfield was the focus of national attention in 1817 when a young woman named Mary Ashford was found murdered in the town. She had been attending a party in Erdington on the evening of 26 May 1817,[68] and had left with Abraham Thornton and her friend Hannah Cox, who left Mary and Abraham.[69] The following morning, her body was recovered from a water-filled pit by Penns Lane, Erdington. Thornton was quickly traced and arrested for her murder.[70] At the trial, Thornton provided evidence that it was not possible for him to have killed Mary at the suggested time.[71] As a result, the jury found him not guilty of her murder and rape, allowing him to walk free from the court.[72]
