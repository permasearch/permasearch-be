Nick Frisbee was a children's in-vision continuity presenter who had a squirrel puppet sidekick, Larry the Loafer (operated by Ray Tizzard). The premise of the character was to mock children's television presenters at the time, many who had puppet sidekicks â€“ Larry was loosely based, and named after, BBC Saturday morning show Going Live's puppet Gordon the Gopher. Unlike children's television presenters, Nick was crude, and often cared very little for Larry or his viewers. He'd famously treat Larry very harshly, often hitting him with a club, which prompted the audience to 'aww,' to which Nick would reiterate to the audience that "it's a puppet!" Nick would read out letters, poems and jokes "sent in" by viewers with double-entendre names, and show spoof trailers for movies. In the last episode, Larry gets his revenge on Nick by dropping a studio light on him when he appeals for the welfare of loafers.
