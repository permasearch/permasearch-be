After the death of Root, Finch goes on a rogue mission to destroy Samaritan. Guided by the Machine, Finch uploads the Ice-9 virus to Samaritan in ".exe" but it has global side effects. In the series finale "return 0", Reese and Finch work together one last time to destroy a Samaritan copy that uploaded itself to an orbiting satellite. Wounded, Finch attempts to sacrifice himself to upload a copy of the Machine to destroy Samaritan, but is tricked by Reese who sacrifices himself in his place. With Samaritan destroyed and having been reminded of the value of life by the Machine and Reese, Finch returns to his fiancÃ© and a normal life.
