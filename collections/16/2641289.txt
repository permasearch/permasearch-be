For an ordered subset     W = {  w  1   ,  w  2   , … ,  w  k   }   {\displaystyle W=\{w_{1},w_{2},\dots ,w_{k}\}}   of vertices and a vertex v in a connected graph G, the representation of v with respect to W is the ordered k-tuple     r ( v  |  W ) = ( d ( v ,  w  1   ) , d ( v ,  w  2   ) , … , d ( v ,  w  k   ) )   {\displaystyle r(v|W)=(d(v,w_{1}),d(v,w_{2}),\dots ,d(v,w_{k}))}  , where d(x,y) represents the distance between the vertices x and y. The set W is a resolving set (or locating set) for G if every two vertices of G have distinct representations. The metric dimension of G is the minimum cardinality of a resolving set for G. A resolving set containing a minimum number of vertices is called a basis (or reference set) for G. Resolving sets for graphs were introduced independently by Slater (1975) and Harary & Melter (1976), while the concept of a resolving set and that of metric dimension were defined much earlier by Blumenthal in his monograph Theory and Applications of Distance Geometry. Graphs are special examples of metric spaces with their intrinsic path metric.
