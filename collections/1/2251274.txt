The Mechonoids (spelt 'Mechanoids') next appeared in the TV21 comic strip story The Eve of War, the story running from December 1965 to January 1966. They are depicted as the sworn enemies of the Daleks. A race of blue-skinned humanoids subtly interfere with events using a robot called K2 in order to prevent a war. This was followed by a further comic strip appearance (where they are again termed 'Mechanoids') in the story The World That Waits, included in the 1966 The Dalek World annual. The narrative depicts a Dalek attack on Mechanus which results in the destruction of the Mechanoid city.
