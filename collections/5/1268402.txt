One World Trade Center is principally owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Around 5 percent equity of the building was sold to the Durst Organization, a private real estate company, in exchange for an investment of at least $100 million. The Durst Organization assisted in supervising the building's construction, and manages the building for the Port Authority, having responsibility for leasing, property management, and tenant installations.[220][221] By September 2012, around 55 percent of the building's floor space had been leased,[222] but no new leases were signed for three years until May 2014;[223] the amount of space leased had gone up to 62.8 percent by November 2014.[224]
