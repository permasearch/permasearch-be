Restrictions on international travel on people (immigration or emigration) are commonplace.[7] Within countries, freedom of travel is often more limited for minors, and penal law can modify this right as it applies to persons charged with or convicted of crimes (for instance, parole, probation, registration).[8] In some countries, freedom of movement has historically been limited for women, and for members of disfavored racial and social groups.[8] Circumstances, both legal and practical, may operate to limit this freedom. For example, a nation that is generally permissive with respect to travel may restrict that right during time of war.
