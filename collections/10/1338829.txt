The Continental Army's first offensive action took place in May 1775, three weeks after the Battles of Lexington and Concord.[17] Ethan Allen, accompanied by 200 Green Mountain Boys, was ordered to capture Fort Ticonderoga and retrieve supplies for the fight in Boston. Benedict Arnold shared the command with Allen, and in early May 1775, they captured Fort Ticonderoga, Crown Point, and the southern Loyalist settlement of Skenesborough.[17] As a result of Allenâ€™s offensive attack on the Champlain Valley in 1775, the American forces controlled the Lake Champlain waterway.
