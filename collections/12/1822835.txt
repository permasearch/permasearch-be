A spacious new international terminal was completed in 2000; this then became the domestic terminal in 2012 following the completion of the new international terminal. The old terminal, now reserved for domestic flights, is next to the international terminal. The terminals host about 2.5 million travellers per year, and are especially busy during the peak summer tourism months when charter flights arrive frequently from major cities in Europe.[citation needed]
