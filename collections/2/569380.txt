He replaced a rested Jonathan Trott in the England ODI squad in India in early 2013[68] and replaced Craig Kieswetter as the first-choice wicket-keeper halfway through the ODI series.[73] This allowed Buttler to break into the England ODI side on a consistent basis, playing regularly throughout the year in both ODI and T20 formats and increasingly as a wicket-keeper, despite some reservations about the quality of his work behind the stumps.[74][75] He scored his maiden half-century for England in a T20 warm-up match at the start of England's tour of New Zealand followed by his first T20I half-century in the second match of the T20I series.[76][77] After being confirmed as England's first-choice limited-overs wicket-keeper[35] he played in every England match in the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy in England. Buttler played again in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 in India in March and played regular one-day cricket again throughout the year. He scored his maiden One-Day International century against Sri Lanka at Lord's in May, scoring 121 in 61 balls with nine fours and four sixes, the fastest century by any England batsman.[78] After first choice wicket-keeper Matt Prior stood down after injury on the 22 July 2014, Buttler was called up for the England squad for the third Test against India. He made 85 runs from 83 balls in his first Test innings. He played in the final three Tests of the series before reverting to one-day duty, touring Sri Lanka at the end of the year.
