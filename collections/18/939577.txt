Higher rates of necrotising fasciities are seen in those with obesity, diabetes, immunocompromised, alcholic, or with peripheral vascular disease. However, such disease may also occurs in young healthy adults with no underlying illnesses. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) may have increase the rates of necrotising infections due to the modification of immune response in the body. This is because NSAIDs inbihits the cycloxygenase -1 and cycloxygenase-2 enzymes which are important in producing thromboxane and prostaglandin E2. Prostaglandin has been responsible for fever, inflammation, and pain. The inhibition of prostangladin E2 production reduces inflammatory response and leukocyte adhesion, thus reduces immune response against bacterial invasion, giving rise to soft tissue infection.[2]
