The mandolin and guitar were played in both classical music and pop music. Although used in popular music, both instruments were also taught in the Saigon National Conservatory (now the Conservatory of Ho Chi Minh City).[194] However, the mandolin has disappeared from the conservatory where it had been taught, apparently dropped from the curriculum.[194] Instead of Guitar-Mandolin department, the school lists Guitar-Accordion.[195]
