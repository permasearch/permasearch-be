Bengal was absorbed within the Mughal Empire during the reign of Akbar after the Battle of Tukaroi (which was fought in 1575 near the village of Tukaroi, now in the Balasore District, West Bengal) between the Mughals and the Karrani Sultanate of Bengal and Bihar.[36] From that time Dhaka became the capital of the Mughal province of Bengal. But due to its geographical remoteness the Mughals found it difficult to govern the region. In particular, the area east of the Brahmaputra River remained outside mainstream Mughal influence. The Bengali ethnic and linguistic identity further crystallised during this period, since the whole of Bengal was united under an able and long-lasting administration. Furthermore, its inhabitants were given sufficient autonomy to develop their own customs and literature.
