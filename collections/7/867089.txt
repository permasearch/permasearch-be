The character of Roxana can be described as a proto-feminist because she carries out her actions of prostitution for her own ends of freedom but before a feminist ideology was fully formed, (though Defoe also works to undercut the radicalism of her position).[4] The book also explores the clash of values between the Restoration court and the middle-class.[5]
