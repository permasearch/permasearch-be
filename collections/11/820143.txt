The BBC announced that the next episode of the show would not be broadcast on 15 March.[21] It was later announced through the BBC's website that the network would be likely to drop the remaining two episodes of the series as well in the wake of the incident, which involved Clarkson punching producer Oisin Tymon, who was later treated in hospital.[137][138] Tymon also claimed that Clarkson had called him a "lazy Irish cunt".[139] Clarkson's contract with the BBC expired at the end of March, and a previously proposed three-year renewal was withdrawn.[140][141][142]
