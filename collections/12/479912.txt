2011 was rated by the BBC as a "disastrous year" for Pakistan-U.S. relations, primarily due to three events: the Raymond Allen Davis incident, the death of Osama bin Laden and the Salala incident.[75] As early as 2005, Western criticism against Pakistan grew and many European and American political correspondents criticized Pakistan at the public level.[76] The London-based The Economist in fact observed: "As an American ally, Pakistan has become an embarrassment for the United States."[76] In January 2011, the Raymond Allen Davis incident occurred in which Raymond Davis, an alleged private security contractor, shot dead two Pakistani locals after they attempted to rob him. The action sparked protests in Pakistan and threatened relations between the United States and Pakistan, including aid flows.[77] Pakistan prosecuted him despite US demands for him to be freed because he enjoys diplomatic immunity.[77] Ultimately he was freed after the United States made payments to the families of the slain Pakistanis, but the incident was emblematic of the volatile nature of American-Pakistani relations. In spite of this rocky relationship, the United States remains committed to assisting Pakistan's new democratic government in the areas of development, stability, and security.[78]
