During filming, Twitter comments alleging the number plate "H982 FKL" on the Porsche was a reference to the 1982 Falklands War began to appear and the number plate "H1 VAE" was substituted.[24] Andy Wilman, executive producer for the show, said on 2 October: "Top Gear production purchased three cars for a forthcoming programme; to suggest that this car was either chosen for its number plate, or that an alternative number plate was substituted for the original is completely untrue"; Clarkson tweeted: "For once, we did nothing wrong".[25] "H982 FKL" has been registered to the Porsche since its manufacture in May 1991.[26][27][28]
