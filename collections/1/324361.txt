The remaining five carried on and recorded the band's eighth studio album, Mystery to Me, six months later. This album contained Welch's song "Hypnotized" which received a great amount of airplay on the radio, and became one of the band's most successful songs to date in the US. The band was proud of the new album and anticipated that it would be a smash hit. Despite the success, things were starting to come haywire. The McVies' marriage, at this time, was under a lot of stress, which was aggravated by their constant working with each other, and John McVie's considerable alcohol abuse.[26] During the tour, Weston had an affair with Fleetwood's wife, Jenny Boyd Fleetwood, the sister of Pattie Boyd Harrison. Courage soon fired Weston and the tour was cancelled. Due to lack of touring, the album sold less than its predecessor.
