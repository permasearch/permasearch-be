"Baptism in the Early Church" by George Rice (1981), in "Bible and Spade", cited Cote with favour and claimed that archaeology "overwhelmingly testifies to immersion as the normal mode of baptism in the Christian church during the first ten to fourteen centuries".[117] Rice cites in particular imagery in the Catacomb of San Ponziano[118] and a crypt in the catacomb of Santa Lucina,[119] as well as a 9th- or 10th-century fresco in the basilica of San Clemente[120] he also states that "pictures of Jesus standing in water while John pours water over His head are of a much later date than those depicting immersion and they demonstrate the change in the mode of baptism that came into the church". He mentions a 4th-century baptistery sufficiently large for immersion,[121] Rice says that archaeological evidence demonstrates some early baptismal fonts large enough for adult immersion were later made smaller or replaced, to accommodate affusion baptism of infants,[122] leading to mistakes in the dating of art works by 20th-century studies.[123]
