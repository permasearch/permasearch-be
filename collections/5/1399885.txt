Despite estimates that Yorktown, damaged in the Battle of the Coral Sea, would require several months of repairs at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, her elevators were intact and her flight deck largely so.[28] The Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard worked around the clock, and in 72 hours she was restored to a battle-ready state,[29] judged good enough for two or three weeks of operations, as Nimitz required.[30][31] Her flight deck was patched, and whole sections of internal frames were cut out and replaced. Repairs continued even as she sortied, with work crews from the repair ship USSÂ Vestal, herself damaged in the attack on Pearl Harbor six months earlier, still aboard.[32]
