Calculations show that the additional electron is located in the aluminium cluster at the location directly opposite from the iodine atom. The cluster must therefore have a higher electron affinity for the electron than iodine and therefore the aluminium cluster is called a superhalogen (i.e., the vertical electron detachment energies of the moieties that make up the negative ions are larger than those of any halogen atom).[34] The cluster component in the Al 13I− ion is similar to an iodide ion or a bromide ion. The related Al 13I− 2 cluster is expected to behave chemically like the triiodide ion.[35][36]
