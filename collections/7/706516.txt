It is highly systematised and technical. Inherent in its approach are the concepts of the phoneme, the morpheme and the root. His rules have a reputation for perfection[48] – that is, they tersely describe Sanskrit morphology unambiguously and completely.

His sophisticated logical rules and technique have been widely influential in ancient and modern linguistics.
