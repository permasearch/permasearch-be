The first act was presented as mannequins of hot actresses. Bagri was excited with this and finally the iconic costume donned by Alia Bhatt in the movie Student of the Year was worn by Ahlawat and Nanda. Ahlawat’s strong muscles looked very abrupt in the performance as Bhatt, and his long skirt (Ghaghra) too created problems during the performance. Chhabra appreciated Nanda’s performance as he was able to emote the right expressions. In the end he was selected amongst the winners.
