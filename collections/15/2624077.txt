The mesothelium is composed of an extensive monolayer of specialized cells (mesothelial cells) that line the body's serous cavities and internal organs. The main purpose of these cells is to produce a lubricating fluid that is released between layers,[2] providing a slippery, non-adhesive, and protective surface to facilitate intracoelomic movement.
