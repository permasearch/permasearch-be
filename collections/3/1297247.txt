The firearms previously stocked at police stations include .303 Lee–Enfield rifles (have been replaced), 7.62 1A Self Loading Rifles, and SAF Carbine 2A1s which now have been replaced by AK-47 and INSAS rifles. The Ordnance Factories Board is the one of the suppliers of arms, ammunition, uniforms, bullet-proof vehicles, and mine protected vehicles to the Indian police. Only the station officer can allow the use of reserve guns, to be only used in emergencies. During public unrest, protests or probable terrorist attacks, police are equipped and armed directly by the state or central government. Some special units in the state and federal level police forces also have additional automatic weapons such as AK-47, AKM, INSAS assault rifles and Bren guns. Police special forces and SWAT units use Heckler & Koch MP5s, Brügger & Thomet MP9s, AK-103s, and M4A1 Carbines and many more. Bullet proof jackets are generally not worn by the state police, though special units carry special tactical vests, gear and weapons according to their function and role.
