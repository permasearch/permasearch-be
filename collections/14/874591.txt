The Government of Sacramento County is defined and authorized under the California Constitution, California law, and the Charter of the County of Sacramento.[1] Much of the government of California is in practice the responsibility of county governments, such as the Government of Sacramento County. The County government provides countywide services such as elections and voter registration, law enforcement, jails, vital records, property records, tax collection, public health, and social services. In addition the County serves as the local government for all unincorporated areas.
