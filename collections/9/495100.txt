While the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup is considered to be the predecessor of the UEFA Cup, it is not officially recognised by UEFA and therefore successes in this competition are not included in this list.[4] Also excluded are the unofficial 1972 European Super Cup and the Club World Cup, a FIFA competition.[5]
