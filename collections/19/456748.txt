US 101 is called the James Lick Freeway, named for James Lick, a philanthropist, from the San Francisco county/city line, through the interchange with I-280 at the Alemany Maze, until the junction with the San Francisco Skyway (I-80) and the Central Freeway near the city's Civic Center. US 101 continues in a northwestern direction on the Central Freeway, and then leaves the freeway, on Mission Street (northbound) and South Van Ness Avenue (southbound), to run north on Van Ness Avenue. At the intersection of Van Ness Avenue and Lombard Street, US 101 heads west on Lombard Street, and then on Richardson Avenue, entering The Presidio, where it becomes a divided highway again (the partially built Presidio Parkway). It is then joined by Route 1 before approaching and crossing the Golden Gate Bridge.
