Lee Byung-hun was sued by his girlfriend who broke up in 2009. His girlfriend claimed Lee hurt her mentally and physically because she only used him for entertainment, and sued him for compensation and chronic gambling charges worth 100 million won. Lee, on the other hand, claimed that her claims were all false, and that the men behind her claim demanded money from her to reveal the truth about her relationship with her girlfriend, and then responded with the threat.[90][91][92]
