If the arrester lacks reasonable cause to believe the arrested person to have committed the offence, the latter may sue the former for defamation, wrongful arrest, or trespass.[23] For most offences, a private individual can only make such an arrest if the suspect would otherwise evade arrest by a Garda, and the arrester must surrender the suspect to Garda custody as soon as practicable.[28][27][25][21] An exception is that stamp hawkers must be brought before the District Court.[26] Citizen's arrests are rare; most often they are made by store detectives on shoplifting suspects.[23]
