Kasie Hines (Diona Reasonover) is a graduate student at the medical school in New York where Ducky is guest teaching in season 15. Ducky hires her as his assistant to help keep him on schedule on a book he is writing about past cases. However, when a past cold case resurfaces in "One Man's Trash", Ducky returns to NCIS to assist in the investigation, bringing a reluctant Kasie along with him to help and meet his co-workers. While Kasie is friendly towards most of Gibbs' team to the point of giving hugs, she is noticeably cold towards Abby Sciuto, making no attempts to connect with her despite staying in her guest room. This frustrates Abby, who believes that Kasie doesn't like her despite her attempts to be friendly, and later learns from Ducky that Kasie has a degree in forensic science. After witnessing Kasie encourage Ducky to use the case to inspire his creativity for the book, Abby confronts Kasie, who admits that she is a fan of Abby's work and freaked out internally when she met her, and the two develop a close friendship.
