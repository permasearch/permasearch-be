On June 15, 1846, some 30 non-Mexican settlers, mostly Americans, staged a revolt, seized the small Mexican garrison in Sonoma, and captured Mexican general Mariano Vallejo. They raised the "Bear Flag" of the California Republic over Sonoma. The so-called California Republic lasted one week with William B. Ide as president of the Republic, until the U.S. Army, led by FrÃ©mont, took over on June 23. The California state flag today is based on this original Bear Flag, and continues to contain the words "California Republic".
