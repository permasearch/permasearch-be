The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) currently lists 355 volcanoes in the Philippines as inactive.[2] The PHIVOLCS listing is the basis of this list, but with additional information, some were reclassified in the active list or the potentially active list. Volcanoes with solfataric or fumarolic activity indicating active magma supply such as Pocdol Mountains, are placed in the List of potentially active volcanoes in the Philippines. This list shows 339 inactive volcanoes in the Philippines, listed by volcanic region.
