Students are required to pay a "registration fee" on entry to their courses. These charges cover costs such as equipment usage, administration fees and exam fees. Charges for 2008/09 were on average €850 per student, but was raised to €1,500 per student for the 2009/10 school year.[7] These charges have been labelled as "unofficial fees", and University Heads have admitted that "student registration charges are fees by any other name".[8] In 2011, after large annual increases, the Registration Fee was abolished and replaced with a Student Contribution. For the school year 2015/2016 this fee stands at €3,000.
