In the past as well as the present day, Evangelista has drawn praise and accolades from many of the fashion industry's elite. As far as Treacy is concerned, "Linda is the ultimate model of the past 50 years".[170] Lagerfeld, who had once described Evangelista as "the most famous of all",[171] said that she is "the best model in the world".[172] His reasoning is "Because she's a true model, pure and simple. She doesn't pretend or aspire to do anything else. She's just brilliant at what she does."[172] Fellow designer Stefano Gabbana said of Evangelista, "Linda is the model. If you talk about models of the sixties and seventies, the first name is Veruschka. In the eighties and nineties, it's Linda."[7] David Bonnouvrier, one of the founders of DNA Model Management said, "Linda is the model of all time, to its strictest definition. She could be out of a Cecil Beaton picture, she could be out of a Guy Bourdin picture."[173] Sozzani, the editor-in-chief of Vogue Italia recounts that she would receive letters from readers concerned about "what would happen to the magazine if Linda got sick. Because it was all about Linda Evangelista. Her face had the most possibilities."[174] Sozzani additionally stated, "For me, she is the model, not only for her beauty, but her attitude, her intelligence."[174]
