After the girlfriend-boyfriend stage, engagement, and marriage follows.  With regards to the engagement and pre-marriage stages, Filipino tradition dictates that the man and his parents perform the pamamanhikan[4] or pamanhikan[6] (literally, a Tagalog word that means "to go up the stairs of the house" of the girlfriend and her parents; pamamanhikan is known as tampa or danon to the Ilocanos, as pasaguli to the Palawe√±os, and as kapamalai to the Maranaos[6]).  This is where and when the man and his parents formally ask the lady's hand[4] and blessings from her parents in order to marry.  This is when the formal introduction of the man's parents and woman's parents happens.  Apart from presents, the Cebuano version of the pamamanhikan includes bringing in musicians.[6] After setting the date of the wedding and the dowry,[4] the couple is considered officially engaged.[2]  The dowry, as a norm in the Philippines, is provided by the groom's family.[4]  For the Filipino people, marriage is a union of two families, not just of two persons.  Therefore, marrying well "enhances the good name" of both families.[3]
