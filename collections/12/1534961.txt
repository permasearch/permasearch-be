Story mode is similar to Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 rather than the previous game, Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations; it features boss battles, including quick time events requiring strategy to defeat the opponent.[7][8] Ultimate Decision Mode has the option of changing battle difficulties, with higher scores if greater difficulty is chosen.[5]
