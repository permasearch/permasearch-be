Cadets have a host of extracurricular activities available, most run by the office of the Directorate of Cadet Activities (DCA).[177] DCA sponsors or operates 113Â athletic and non-sport clubs.[178] Many cadets join several clubs during their time at the academy and find their time spent with their clubs a welcome respite from the rigors of cadet life.[179] DCA is responsible for a wide range of activities that provide improved quality of life for cadets, including: three cadet-oriented restaurants,[180] the Cadet Store,[181] and the Howitzer and Bugle Notes.[182] The Howitzer is the annual yearbook, while Bugle Notes, also known as the "plebe bible," is the manual of plebe knowledge. Plebe knowledge is a lengthy collection of traditions, songs, poems, anecdotes, and facts about the academy, the army, the Old Corps, and the rivalry with Navy that all plebes must memorize during cadet basic training.[183][184][185] During plebe year, plebes may be asked, and are expected to answer, any inquiry about plebe knowledge asked by upper class cadets. Other knowledge is historical in nature, including information as found in Bugle Notes.[186] However, some knowledge changes daily, such as "the days" (a running list of the number of days until important academy events),[187] the menu in the mess hall for the day, or the lead stories in The New York Times.[186]
