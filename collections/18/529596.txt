When interviewed by the media at the time, Whitney expressed enthusiasm in the role and about science fiction in general. She described Rand's role on board the Enterprise as "She's in charge of the other women aboard the space ship. She's Miss Efficiency."[14] She also added that the character didn't go into space "to catch a man."[14] At the time the media described Rand's position on the Enterprise as "chief female executive officer",[14] and her image was used to promote the series before it began to air.[15] Whitney enjoyed several of the episodes she appeared in, and found it hard to choose between "The Enemy Within", "Charlie X" and "Miri".[11]
