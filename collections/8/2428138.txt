The music and the background score for the film was composed by A. R. Rahman. The soundtrack's original version has lyrics penned by Irshad Kamil whereas the Tamil version by Vairamuthu. In an interview with Hindustan Times, Rahman stated that he had emphasised the folk-classical genre as the film brings out a fascination for Benaras through the music[29] and hence, most of the songs are character-driven. In all, the soundtrack album has nine original tracks.[30] The original version of the soundtrack was released on the co-branded record labels Sony Music and Eros Music[31] on 31 May 2013 and the Tamil version on 19 June 2013.
