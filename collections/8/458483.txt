Floyd Hebert is Wade's cousin and lives in his girlfriend Debra's condo in Vespucci Beach. Jimmy Ray Bennett plays Floyd.[40] Floyd works as a stevedore, or dockhand at the Port of Los Santos. He is unequivocally shown to be a milquetoast, stuck in a dead end job and in a relationship with a woman who does not appreciate him. He is quite nervous around Trevor, who frequently bullies him, forcing him to assist Trevor in his crimes, and, along with Wade, trashes his girlfriend's apartment. Floyd is quite serious about his relationship, and is worried that he may never get a chance to have a girlfriend again if his current relationship ends. Floyd is perhaps the only decent person and positive role model in the entire game, believing in living an honest life and abstain from vices such as drugs, violence, adultery, corruption, greed, and materialism or any forms of crime. At one point, Trevor bursts in the safehouse to find Debra and Floyd, who are angry at him and each other for his ruining of her apartment and their lives. In a Mexican standoff, Debra pulls out a handgun on Floyd and Trevor; consequently, Floyd pulls a knife on Debra. Having failed to calm them down, Trevor kills him and his girlfriend off-screen.[66]
