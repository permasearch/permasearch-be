Early Byzantine art was also marked by the cultivation of ivory carving.[21] Ivory diptychs, often elaborately decorated, were issued as gifts by newly appointed consuls.[22] Silver plates were another important form of luxury art:[23] among the most lavish from this period is the Missorium of Theodosius I.[24] Sarcophagi continued to be produced in great numbers.
