ASL possesses a set of 26 signs known as the American manual alphabet, which can be used to spell out words from the English language.[47] These signs make use of the 19 handshapes of ASL. For example, the signs for 'p' and 'k' use the same handshape but different orientations. A common misconception is that ASL consists only of fingerspelling; although such a method (Rochester Method) has been used, it is not ASL.[31]
