The film's production partners, New Regency and Dune Entertainment, offset financing for the film by paying Tom Cruise a lower advance fee than he normally received.[3] Cruise previously garnered $20 million or higher in an advance fee, but the Los Angeles Times reported he only received $11 million for Knight and Day.[3] Cruise will also not receive "first dollar gross", which was customary for him.[3] This means that Cruise will not receive a share of the film's revenue, until Knight and Day funding investors have first gained back their investment in the production.[3] In total, production costs for the film exceeded $125 million.[11]
