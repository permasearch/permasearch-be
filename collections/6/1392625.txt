Uhtred is associated with many different women, several of whom have a significant impact on his life. Uhtred has a fondness for defiant women who have "a spirit like an eagle", a characteristic he has attributed to many a woman. Conversely he dislikes women who crave order and Christianity (Ã†thelflaed and Hild being notable exceptions). Uhtred does not limit himself to those women with whom he has a long-standing relationship. In "The Burning Land", he was found lying with a slave girl in Dunholm by Father Pyrlig, one of many instances of his philandering.
