Increasingly, it seems that many other off-spinners are trying to make use of the "doosra" delivery with varying degrees of success.[citation needed] While Saqlain never had legitimacy issues regarding his action, other off-spinners attempting to utilize the delivery have had accusations (for the most part dismissed) of chucking (throwing) levelled against them. These include; Shohag Gazi, Muttiah Muralitharan, Harbhajan Singh, Shoaib Malik, Saeed Ajmal and Johan Botha. The South Australian Dan Cullen has also been rumoured to be able to bowl the doosra.
