The following table shows empirically measured covalent radii for the elements, as published by J. C. Slater in 1964.[8] The values are in picometers (pm or 1×10−12 m), with an accuracy of about 5 pm. The shade of the box ranges from red to yellow as the radius increases; gray indicates lack of data.
