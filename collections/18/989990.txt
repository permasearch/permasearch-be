It was originally developed by African slaves who escaped into the wilds of Jamaica when the British captured the island from Spain in 1655.[1] Adapting to their new surroundings, the slaves made use of the natural food sources available to them, creating the spicy sauce and slowly cooking the meat over a smoking wood fire. Nowadays, the smoky taste of the meat is achieved using various alternative cooking methods, including the use of modern wood burning ovens.
