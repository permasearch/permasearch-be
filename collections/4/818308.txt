Save Rock and Roll debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 with 154,000 first week sales, earning the band its second career number one. Its top 20 lead single, "My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up)", has achieved triple-platinum certification in the U.S. and charted worldwide. Rolling Stone described the band's comeback as a "rather stunning renaissance",[5] and the record received positive reviews upon its release, although most music critics were hesitant to refer to the album as solely a rock record. The group followed the record release with the Save Rock and Roll arena tour in promotion, with multiple European, US and Australian legs announced, as well as worldwide promotional shows, festival appearances and TV performances. In 2014, Fall Out Boy and Paramore headlined Monumentour, a US arena concert tour before releasing the first single from the band's next album.
