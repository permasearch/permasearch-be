Fox expressed a robust attitude to his situation: he refused to regard himself as disabled,[86] and would not allow anyone to pity him, telling a Toronto radio station that he found life more "rewarding and challenging" since he had lost his leg.[80] His feat helped redefine Canadian views of disability and the inclusion of the disabled in society.[87][88] Fox's actions increased the visibility of people with disabilities,[88][89] and in addition influenced the attitudes of those with disabilities, by showing them disability portrayed in a positive light.[88] Rick Hansen commented that the run challenged society to focus on ability rather than disability. "What was perceived as a limitation became a great opportunity. People with disabilities started looking at things differently. They came away with huge pride", he wrote.[90]
