In recent years an intensive $440 million[128][129] revitalization project called "Ponce en Marcha"[130] ("Ponce on the Move") has increased the city's historic area from 260 to 1,046 buildings.[131] The Ponce en Marcha project was conceived in 1985 by then governor Rafael Hernández Colón during his second term in La Fortaleza and Ponce mayor Jose Dapena Thompson.[132][133] The plan was approved by the Ponce Municipal Legislature on 14 January 2003. It was signed by Governor Sila Calderon via Executive Order on 28 December 2003, and went into effect on 12 January 2004. The plan incorporates a one billion dollars in spending during the period of 2004 through 2012.[134] A significant number of buildings in Ponce are listed in the National Register of Historic Places.[135] The nonprofit Project for Public Places[136] listed the historic downtown Ponce city center as one of the 60 of the World's Great Places, for its "graciously preserved showcase of Caribbean culture".[137] The revitalized historic area of the city goes by various names, including "Ponce Centro" (Ponce Center),[138] "Historic Ponce",[139] and "Historic District."[140]
