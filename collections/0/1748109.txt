It was quickly discovered, however, that cleaning the air was only taking care of a small percentage of the problem of indoor air pollution; the larger percentile of dust and debris in a room "settles" onto surfaces and any movement through that room would stir the dust and contaminants back up and into the air. Further research proved that by removing the contaminants at their source, they could effectively stop the cycle of stirring dust and contaminants up into the air every time there was movement in the room.
