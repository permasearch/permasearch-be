The cast and crew of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel were involved in the making of each television series. Sometimes actors and crew were involved with both series. On Buffy, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Nicholas Brendon are the only actors to hold the same spot in the credits throughout the entire series. On Angel, David Boreanaz is the only one to hold the same spot. On Buffy, Anthony Stewart Head held the coveted last spot ("and...as...") until Season Six, from which point he would only be credited as 'special guest star'. On Angel, Alexis Denisof would be given the last ("...and") spot during Angel Season 4. After Anthony Stewart Head's departure, Alyson Hannigan took the last ("and...as...") spot. Season Four holds the record for most changes in the Buffy credit lineup (3).
