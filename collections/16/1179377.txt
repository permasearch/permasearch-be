Shrek was originally set up to be a live-action/CG animation hybrid with background plate miniature sets and the main characters composited into the scene as motion-captured computer graphics, using an ExpertVision Hires Falcon 10 camera system to capture and apply realistic human movement to the characters.[36] A sizable crew was hired to run a test, and after a year and a half of R & D, the test was finally screened in May 1997.[37] The results were not satisfactory, with Katzenberg stating "It looked terrible, it didn't work, it wasn't funny, and we didn't like it."[28] The studio then turned to its production partners at Pacific Data Images (PDI), who began production with the studio in 1998[38] and helped Shrek get to its final, computer-animated look.[28] At this time, Antz was still in production by the studio[28] and Effects Supervisor Ken Bielenberg was asked by Aron Warner "to start development for Shrek."[39] Similar to previous PDI films, PDI used its own proprietary software (like its own Fluid Animation System) for its animated movies. For some elements, however, it also took advantage of some of the powerhouse animation software in the market. This is particularly true with Maya, which PDI used for most of its dynamic cloth animation and for the hair of Fiona and Farquaad.[40]
