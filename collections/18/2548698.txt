Nashi has been accused of recruiting skinheads and local hooligans to intimidate rival youth groups.[25] Such activities caused Gavin Knight, in New Statesman, to draw the conclusion that "Nashiâ€™s true function was as a personality cult for Putin whose job was intimidate, bully and harass his opponents."[51] The movement has evoked comparisons with the Hitler Youth, in the mainstream media,[9][10][11][12] to the extent that Nashi, together with other pro-Putin youth organizations, were derogatively nicknamed Putinjugend.[52][53][54][55]
