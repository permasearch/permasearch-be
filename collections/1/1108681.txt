Most hospitals in the United States are prepared for handling a large influx of patients from a terrorist attack. Volunteer hospital decontamination teams are common. These teams are specially trained to set up showers or washing equipment, to wear personal protective equipment, and to ensure safety of both the victims and the community during the response. From a planning perspective it must be remembered that first responders in Level A or B personal protective equipment (PPE) will have limited working duration, typically 20 minutes to 2 hours.[1]
