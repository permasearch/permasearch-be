The education system of Georgia has undergone sweeping modernizing, although controversial, reforms since 2004.[234][235] Education in Georgia is mandatory for all children aged 6–14.[236] The school system is divided into elementary (six years; age level 6–12), basic (three years; age level 12–15), and secondary (three years; age level 15–18), or alternatively vocational studies (two years). Students with a secondary school certificate have access to higher education. Only the students who have passed the Unified National Examinations may enroll in a state-accredited higher education institution, based on ranking of the scores received at the exams.[237]
