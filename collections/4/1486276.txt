The largest factor, and arguably most prominent, relates to the large number of French families immigrating to Chile during the late 20th century. The French were able to share their fine tastes and experience with the native Chileans, expanding their knowledge of the wine world. Chile is now the fifth largest exporter of wines in the world, and the seventh largest producer.[1] The climate has been described as midway between that of California and France. The most common grapes are Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Carmen√®re. So far Chile has remained free of phylloxera louse which means that the country's grapevines do not need to be grafted.[2]
