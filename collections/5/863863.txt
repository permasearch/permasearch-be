All surviving works of Greek drama were composed by playwrights from Athens and are written exclusively in the Attic dialect.[22] Choral performances were a common tradition in all Greek city-states.[23] The Athenians credited a man named Thespis with having invented drama[24] by introducing the first actor, whose primary purpose was to interact with the leader of the chorus.[25] Later playwrights expanded the number of actors to three, allowing for greater freedom in storytelling.[26]
