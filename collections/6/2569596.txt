J.B. Schramm, the founder of College Summit, used his high-school and college experiences to create revolutionary college assistance for under-average teens. As a social entrepreneur in David Bornstein’s book, How to Change the World, Schramm undertakes the challenge of reforming not only the way schools equip students for college, but also how students view their own strengths in lieu of what test scores might tell them. Charismatic and friendly, Schramm traveled through his years of primary and secondary school with the same group of buddies. When the time came for him to graduate from high-school, he had no doubt of his friends attending college. “We all had our strengths. And I just assumed that we’d all go on to the next stage in life together. College was a given,”[51] explains Schramm. Although he was accepted to Yale University, Schramm was shocked to find that most of them were not continuing to higher education. “It lodged in me,” says Schramm, “It profoundly didn’t make sense. And the difference was not that they were less college capable than I was”[52]
