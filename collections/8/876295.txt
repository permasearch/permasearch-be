Palladium has been used as a precious metal in jewelry since 1939 as an alternative to platinum in the alloys called "white gold", where the naturally white color of palladium does not require rhodium plating. Palladium is much less dense than platinum. Similar to gold, palladium can be beaten into leaf as thin as 100 nm (​1⁄250,000 in).[4] Unlike platinum, palladium may discolor at temperatures above 400 °C (752 °F);[64] it is relatively brittle.[clarification needed]
