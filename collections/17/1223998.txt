During the Pit Stop, all teams were moved to Zermatt railway station to start the leg. In this Leg's Roadblock, one team member had to participate in a Rio Carnival parade. After putting on special costumes, teams learned the samba and then led a parade of dancers. If the Carnival Princess approved their dance, teams would receive their next clue; if not, they would be sent back to relearn the dance and try again.
