In his paper "On certain arithmetical functions", Ramanujan defined the so-called delta-function whose coefficients are called τ(n) (the Ramanujan tau function).[62] He proved many congruences for these numbers such as τ(p) ≡ 1 + p11 mod 691 for primes p. This congruence (and others like it that Ramanujan proved) inspired Jean-Pierre Serre (1954 Fields Medalist) to conjecture that there is a theory of Galois representations which "explains" these congruences and more generally all modular forms. Δ(z) is the first example of a modular form to be studied in this way. Pierre Deligne (in his Fields Medal-winning work) proved Serre's conjecture. The proof of Fermat's Last Theorem proceeds by first reinterpreting elliptic curves and modular forms in terms of these Galois representations. Without this theory there would be no proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.[63]
