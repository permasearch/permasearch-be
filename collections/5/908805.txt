Team challenge: The teams were brought outside to meet special VIP guests who arrived via limousine. They turned out to be dogs and their trainers from the American Kennel Club, who were there for a Hell's Kitchen dog show. The teams had to create a tasting menu consisting of two appetizers and three entrees and submit them for judging by a panel of chefs. Sade was under the mistaken impression that the entrees would be served to the dogs and made a chopped up dish that resembled dog food. However, since the blue team had an extra member and had to drop a dish, her team quickly decided not to submit her dish for judging. Sterling's crab cake appetizer was the clear winner for the red team while Fernando's prawn appetizer had enough potential to get a point for the blue team. Jennifer's Chilean sea bass beat out Steve and Bryant's pork chop wins the second entree slot over Roe's anemic surf & turf. With both teams tied, it's down to Frank and Santos's duck dishes which both had their flaws (inconsistently cooked duck pieces vs a burnt potato, respectively). In the end, Frank's dish wins it for the red team.
