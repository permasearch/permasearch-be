The trilogy after The Return trilogy, The Hunters, was written by a ghostwriter. In fact, Smith signed a "work for hire" contract back when she had written the original Vampire Diaries novel trilogy, which means Alloy owns the copyrights to the series. Smith had originally intended to call the books in "The Hunters" trilogy Phantom, Evensong and Eternity,[2][3][4][5] but the third book was called Destiny Rising by the ghostwriter.[6] Phantom was released on October 25, 2011,[7] Moonsong on March 13, 2012,[8] and Destiny Rising on October 23, 2012.[9]
