Within the storyline of the musical, Macavity makes several attempts to scare the tribe. This culminates in his abduction of Old Deuteronomy, after which two queens, Bombalurina and Demeter, sing about him. He then returns to attempt to abduct Demeter. Munkustrap and Alonzo come to her defence and, in a dramatic cat fight, drive him off. As seen in the film production and most stage performances, he appears to be capable of performing some form of hypnosis. When Demeter and Bombalurina (a flirty queen cat who is close friends with Demeter)[8] sing about him, they do so in a sensuous manner, suggesting he is more familiar to them.  The Macavity number develops from a bluesy duet into a big female ensemble routine.[12]
