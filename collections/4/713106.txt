It turns out that Leonard was imagining everything, and he is still with Sheldon complaining about the Spock cardboard cut-out. Leonard decides that, despite the fact it seems that the relationship will once again end badly, he still wishes to ask Penny out. Penny asks whether he has thought things through. Leonard replies that he has and still thinks they should go ahead with it. Penny therefore agrees and then smiles.
