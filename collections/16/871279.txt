This term is used to describe an explosive phenomenon whereby the decomposition is propagated by an explosive shock wave traversing the explosive material at speeds greater than the speed of sound within the substance. [4] The shock front is capable of passing through the high explosive material at supersonic speeds, typically thousands of metres per second.
