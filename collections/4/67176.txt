In the United States, the first standard for home smoke alarms, NFPA 74, was established in 1967.[9] In 1969, the AEC allowed homeowners to use smoke detectors without a license.[5] The Life Safety Code (NFPA 101), passed by the National Fire Protection Association in 1976, first required smoke alarms in homes.[9] Smoke alarm sensitivity requirements in UL 217 were modified in 1985 to reduce susceptibility to nuisance alarms.[9] In 1988 BOCA, ICBO, and SBCCI model building codes begin requiring smoke alarms to be interconnected and located in all sleeping rooms.[9] In 1989 NFPA 74 first required smoke alarms to be interconnected in every new home construction, and in 1993 NFPA 72 first required that smoke alarms be placed in all bedrooms.[9] NFPA began requiring the replacement of smoke detectors after ten years in 1999.[9] In 1999 Underwriters Laboratory changed smoke alarm labeling requirements so that all smoke alarms must have a manufactured date written in Plain English.
