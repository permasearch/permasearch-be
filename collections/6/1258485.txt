Google has been granted a patent on MapReduce.[39] However, there have been claims that this patent should not have been granted because MapReduce is too similar to existing products. For example, map and reduce functionality can be very easily implemented in Oracle's PL/SQL database oriented language[40] or is supported for developers transparently in distributed database architectures such as Clusterpoint XML database[41] or MongoDB NoSQL database.[42]
