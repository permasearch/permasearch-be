Generally, the treatment for SIRS is directed towards the underlying problem or inciting cause (i.e. adequate fluid replacement for hypovolemia, IVF/NPO for pancreatitis, epinephrine/steroids/diphenhydramine for anaphylaxis).[12] Selenium, glutamine, and eicosapentaenoic acid have shown effectiveness in improving symptoms in clinical trials.[13][14] Other antioxidants such as vitamin E may be helpful as well.[15]
