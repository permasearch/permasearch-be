Alex plans to use a love potion to make him fall in love with her, also helping Justin to sabotage his meeting.

After the potion wears off, it seems to have some after-effects; Alex mails herself mass amounts of flowers. Meanwhile, Max's wizard powers begin to develop, and he must wear a goofy hat to control them while his powers settle in.
