The format was tweaked slightly in 2016. The four-minute round length returned, while the minute of bonus time was changed to 30 seconds and required two home runs of 440 feet (134.1Â m) or longer. The additional time was removed, while the swing-off (which was not required) was reduced to one minute.[9] Each batter is allowed one time-out during each round, and two in the finals.
