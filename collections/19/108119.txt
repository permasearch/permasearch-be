Richard Lawson of Vanity Fair,[105] Karen D'Souza of the San Jose Mercury News,[106] and Dana Stevens of Slate[107] all published critical reviews of the film. All three found much to like in the acting (especially Blunt and Pine's performances), but all three also concluded that after the various cuts and changes, the final version of the film had failed to adequately preserve the power of the dark existentialist message at the heart of the original musical's second act.[105][106][107] Stevens characterized the result as a "generic dystopian bummer,"[107] while Lawson criticized the film as a "dutiful but perfunctory adaptation" which lacked "genuine heart".[105] Paul Katz of The Huffington Post felt the change in tone between the last two acts was too abrupt, and also criticized the film's faithfulness to the stage musical.[108] Conversely, Alyssa Rosenberg of The Washington Post disliked the performances by Streep and Depp, while simultaneously calling the film's first two acts a "surprising delight".[109]
