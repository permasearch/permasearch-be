Other than the Monoliths bearing TMA labels, there are many other Monoliths that are seen in the series. In two instances, millions of Monoliths are generated for a limited time purpose. The first, in 2010: Odyssey Two, Monoliths are generated to transform Jupiter into a star, subsequently named Lucifer. The second, in 3001: The Final Odyssey, they generate again to block both the Earth and human-settled Ganymede from their primary star in an attempt to destroy the humans.
