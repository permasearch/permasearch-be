The OFA is located in the inferior occipital gyrus.[37] Similar to the FFA, this area is also active during successful face detection and identification, a finding that is supported by fMRI activation.[36] The OFA is involved and necessary in the analysis of facial parts but not in the spacing or configuration of facial parts. This suggests that the OFA may be involved in a facial processing step that occurs prior to the FFA processing.[36]
