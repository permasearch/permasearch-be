In 1940, corporals became assistant squad leaders while the squad leaders became sergeants (with two staff sergeants in the platoon headquarters). In 1942, with the upgrade of squad leaders to staff sergeants and the assistant squad leaders to sergeants (with a technical sergeant and a staff sergeant in the platoon headquarters), corporals in rifle squads became either an automatic rifleman or a senior rifleman with usually only one or two per squad. In 1948, corporals again became assistant squad leaders under sergeants as squad leaders (staff sergeant having been eliminated and technical sergeant converted to sergeant first class). In 1956, corporals became fire team leaders with two per squad. Finally, in 1958, corporals were effectively eliminated in rifle squads (having been replaced by the rank of specialist third class/specialist four) when squad leaders again became staff sergeants with two sergeants/fire teams per squad. In the 1960s the only corporals found in divisions with assistant gunners in field artillery howitzer crews and Pathfinders (tactical air traffic controllers) in aviation battalions.
