On October 17, 1777, nearly 6,000 British and Hessian soldiers, called the Convention Army, surrendered to the Americans.[29] This put the Continental Congress in the position of holding a massive number of prisoners of war on American soil, something that hadn't happened on a grand scale up to that point. The Continental Congress were already having trouble providing for the Continental Army, and after Saratoga they also had to provide for enemy combatants.
