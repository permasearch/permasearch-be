Innovative Configuration or Adhocracy gathers the specialists of different fields into teams for specific tasks.[34] Such organizations are common when environment is complex and dynamic.[34] Mintzberg considers two types of such organization: operating adhocracy and administrative adhocracy.[34] Operating adhocracy solves innovative problems for its clients.[34] Examples of such organisation can be advertising agency or firm that develops the prototypes of products.[34] Administrative adhocracy has teams solving problems for the organization itself.[34] As an example of such organization Mintzberg gives NASA when it worked on Apollo program.[34]
