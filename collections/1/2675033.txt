Within the work, Blake emphasizes the problems of the feudal system and the corruption and decay of the French monarchy and church.[4] The poem operates, according to G. E. Bentley, as a "psychomachia, a war of spirits, of the spirits of freedom and privilege. Some of the noblest rhetoric in the poem defends the ancient bastions of civilization".[7] The language that Blake relies on in the poem is very political, but Blake felt that language in such discussions is replaced by rhetoric. In order to overcome that problem, he attempts to return to an original language.[8]
