Tranexamic acid, a medication to promote blood clotting, may also be used to reduce bleeding and blood transfusions in low-risk women,[24] however evidence as of 2015 was not strong.[2] A 2017 trial found that it decreased the risk of death from bleeding from 1.9% to 1.5% in women with postpartum bleeding.[3] The benefit was greater when the medication was given within three hours.[3]
