Apple codenames are the codenames given to products by Apple Inc. during development. The codenames are often used internally only for various reasons, often to maintain secrecy of the project. Occasionally they may end up being the product name. This article contains a list of codenames and the associated Apple product, used internally by Apple, rather than the final marketed product names.
