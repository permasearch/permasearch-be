The significant role that laughter and fun play in organisational life has been seen as a sociological phenomenon and has increasingly been recognised as also creating a sense of involvement among workers.[36] Sharing humour at work not only offers a relief from boredom, but can  also build relationships, improve camaraderie between colleagues and  create positive affect.[35] Humour in the workplace may also relieve tension and can be used as a coping strategy.[35] In fact, one of the most agreed upon key impacts that workplace humour  has on peopleâ€™s well being, is the use of humour as a coping strategy to aid in dealing with daily stresses, adversity or other difficult  situations.[35] Sharing a laugh with a few colleagues may improve moods, which is  pleasurable, and people perceive this as positively affecting their  ability to cope.[35] Fun and enjoyment are critical in people's lives and the ability for  colleagues to be able to laugh during work, through banter or other,  promotes  harmony and a sense of cohesiveness.[35]
