Any member may object to the Speaker's determination. If the Speaker feels that the division is unnecessary, he/she may first ask those who support his/her determination of the voice vote to rise, and then ask those who oppose the opinion to rise. Then, the Speaker may either declare that his ruling on the voice vote stands, or proceed to a division.
