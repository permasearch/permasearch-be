These indigenous elements in the Filipino's genetic makeup serve as clues to the patterns of migration throughout Philippine prehistory.  After the 16th century, of course, the colonial period saw the influx of genetic influence from Europeans. During the above-mentioned study conducted by Stanford University Asia-Pacific Research Center, it was stated that 3.6% of the Philippine population has varying degrees of European ancestry from Spanish, and American colonization.[22] However, only 28 individuals from the Philippines were genotyped for this study, again a sample size far below the minimum sample size needed to account for credible test results in a population of over 90 million individuals.[26] However, the Stanford study is conflicted by the findings of the open-source Y-DNA bank of the company, Applied Biosystems,[27] which found out that most Philippine Y-DNA haplogroups were found to be O3 and O2, which comes from East Asia, Southeast Asia and Polynesia but also concluded that those that carry the percentage of Spanish Y-DNA haplogroups, were higher at around 13.33% of the population (haplogroup R1b). Compared to the 28 individuals used by Stanford which they sampled from the rural areas of isolated Palawan island, the Y-DNA bank had analyzed 105 Filipino individuals from all across the country. A much bigger study by National Geographic on around 40,000 Filipinos found out only 2-3% of the ancestry was R1b found in Europe, Middle East and India, 2-3% was South Asian and the rest mostly Austronesian.
