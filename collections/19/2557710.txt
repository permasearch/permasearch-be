Abductive reasoning allows inferring     a   {\displaystyle a}   as an explanation of     b   {\displaystyle b}  . As a result of this inference, abduction allows the precondition     a   {\displaystyle a}   to be abduced from the consequence     b   {\displaystyle b}  . Deductive reasoning and abductive reasoning thus differ in the direction in which a rule like "    a   {\displaystyle a}   entails     b   {\displaystyle b}  " is used for inference.
