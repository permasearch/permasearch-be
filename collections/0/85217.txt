The book was first published in the US as Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker in December 1976 by Ballantine Books, six months before the theatrical release of the film. The cover art was by Star Wars conceptual artist Ralph McQuarrie, who was commissioned by Ballantine Books executive Judy Lynn Del Rey while he was working on visualisation work for Lucas's forthcoming film.[2] The cover depicted Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, C-3PO, and R2-D2 standing in front of an enlarged head of Darth Vader. In the United Kingdom, the novelization was published by Sphere Books, and featured cover art by John Berkey.[3][4] Sphere reportedly paid $225,000 for the British publishing rights.[5]
