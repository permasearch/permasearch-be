Various race cars in the then-NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series appear during the NASCAR race at the end, (which is shown to be the 2004 Pop Secret 500, which Herbie: Fully Loaded was actually filmed during) which have various sponsorship decals on the cars. (Dale Earnhardt Jr's #8 car is seen briefly, but it has all the Budweiser logos removed and replaced with his signature to avoid advertising alcohol in a children's film) In addition, billboards can be seen in straightaway scenes, some with the NEXTEL logo on them.
