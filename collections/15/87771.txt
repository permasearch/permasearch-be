Date and time notation in the United States differs from that used in other English-speaking countries; in particular, the date notation is not used commonly by any other country in the world. Traditionally, dates are written in the "month-day-year" order ("April 4, 2018") with a comma before and after the year if it is not at the end of a sentence,[1] and time in 12-hour notation ("11:00 p.m."). The internationally more common notations are used in some professional environments, such as in the military.
