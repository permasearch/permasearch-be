According to DuBrow, Rhoads' departure from Quiet Riot "didn't derail the band, it ended it."[8] He and Forsyth continued on with the addition of guitarist Greg Leon.[11][12][13] Quiet Riot broke up in 1980. During this period (1980â€“1982), Kevin DuBrow formed his own band called 'DuBrow' and also played shows with former Gamma drummer Skip Gillette. By 1982 guitarist Carlos Cavazo and drummer Frankie Banali had also been recruited by DuBrow.
