This patient (Degree 3) is suffering from schizophrenia ("He lives in a world of fiction"). Schizophrenics suffer from a variety of symptoms that are touched on in the lyrics here. Obvious ones include references to delusions and the fact that he "lives in a world of fiction". "Intro tape begins to roll...igniting sonic rage" refers to the fact that schizophrenics are prone to auditory hallucinations... especially command hallucinations that tell the person what to do - even to the point of killing someone or themselves ("To save him from himself"). However, there are references to drug abuse in this song (Random urine testing,/counseling and therapy."), so schizophrenia may only be part of the song.
