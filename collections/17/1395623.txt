The failures of British military policy in 1757 led to a change of government in London, with William Pitt coming firmly into control of Britain's global war effort.[68] Pitt decided to focus a large number of resources on the war in North America, and three major expeditions were planned. One of these, under the command of Brigadier General John Forbes, was assigned to move against the French in the Ohio Country, with its first major goal the capture of Fort Duquesne.[69] Forbes was to lead an army of 2,000 regulars augmented by 5,000 provincials raised from Pennsylvania southward.[70]
