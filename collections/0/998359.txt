In later seasons, (4th(?) and beyond), Hodgins gets his own lab suite, known as the "Ookey Room", (which used to be Zack's workspace), where he does most of his lab work, keeps his collection of Arthropods, and performs most of his experiments. There is a running gag in the show where he often pleads Cam, his boss, for "permission" to conduct a seemingly pointless and absurd experiment, sometimes to bizarre and amusing effect but still aids the investigation nonetheless. In episode 10 of season 4, "The Bones That Blew", Hodgins stated that his passion to "figure stuff out in amusing ways" was why he chose a career in science. In several episodes he has cooked using the lab apparatus, much to his co-workers' bemusement.[13][14] He also has been known to distill quite palatable spirits using lab apparatus repurposed for the job.
