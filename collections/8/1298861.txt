Fort Detroit was surrendered to the British on November 29, 1760, after the fall of Quebec. Control of the area, and all French territory east of the Mississippi River, was formally transferred to the United Kingdom by the Treaty of Paris (1763) after it defeated France in the Seven Years' War. The British counted 2,000 people in Detroit in 1760, but the population had dropped to 1,400 by 1773.[4] The city was in the territory which the British reserved for the Indians under the Royal Proclamation of 1763. It was transferred to Quebec under the Quebec Act of 1774. By 1778 in a census taken during the American Revolution, its population was up to 2,144. It was then the third-largest city in the Province of Quebec, after Montreal and Quebec.[5]
