There are two main types of personal message: a feature on social platforms and private messaging services. Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram are all examples in which social media included personal messaging features to provide space for private interactions among their users. WhatsApp, Kik Messenger, and Snapchat are examples of pure private messaging tools. Users create and sign up for accounts to connect privately with selected friends. A third type of messaging platform is a peer-to-peer messaging platform where the users themselves own and create the infrastructure used to transmit and store the messages; while features vary depending on application, users themselves are in control of data concerning themselves. One example is Classified-ads.[2]
