Brian Lake took ten marks of which seven were intercept marks to repel the Dockers attack. He took two crucial marks in the final quarter which sealed his Norm Smith Medal win. Lake finished with 12 votes, just edging out teammate Jack Gunston with 11 votes who was also crucial on the day with his straight kicking, booting 4 goals. David Mundy polled 4 votes, while Luke Hodge and Nat Fyfe polled 2 and 1 votes respectively.[8] He subsequently accepted a four match suspension for deliberately elbowing opponent Michael Walters in the jaw during the third quarter, making him the first Norm Smith Medalist to have committed a reportable offence during a match.[9]
