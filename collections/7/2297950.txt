Morgan was born Florence Catherine Currier in Newton, Massachusetts on May 3, 1924,[1] one of five children born to musicians Olga (Brandenburg) and Bertram Currier.[2] When she was four years old, the Currier family moved to Daytona Beach, Florida. At five she began vocal lessons while continuing piano lessons. During the summers, she took on child roles and appeared in theater productions at the Kennebunkport Playhouse in Kennebunkport, Maine, which her brother had founded.[3] In 1941, she was listed as the Treasurer of the Kennebunkport Playhouse.[4] While attending grade school, Morgan actively engaged in singing and competing against other students throughout Florida and the Southeast. After graduating from Seabreeze High School, she and her multiple musical talents were promptly accepted into New York's prestigious Juilliard School of Music. Intending to become an opera singer, she studied opera by day and performed whenever possible.[5]
