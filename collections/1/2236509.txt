While experimenting with the telepathic techniques he has been researching, Professor Espérandieu hatches a 136 million year-old pterosaur egg within the Galerie de paléontologie et d'anatomie comparée, resulting in the death of a former prefect (scandalously sharing a taxicab with a Moulin Rouge showgirl) which though witnessed only by the then-drunk Choupard sparks an epidemic of claimed sightings of the creature. The President of France orders the case be considered of utmost urgency by the National Police, only for it to be handed down to the bumbling Inspector Albert Caponi.
