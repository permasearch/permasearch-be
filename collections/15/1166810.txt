Guilt, Worry and Shame serve no one. You didn't cause this. You can't control it and you can't fix it.  Any time you feel these emotions, ask yourself if they are true.  They aren't -- but ask anyway.  You are only one person. You know when you need a break. And when the person receiving care keeps adding on to you already empty reserves of energy, you can't always take it.  When that happens, find a way to take a break.  A full day off and way is essential. You may need to take your person to an Adult Care Day locationâ€”You might need to hire someone to stay at your house. But you have to get away.
