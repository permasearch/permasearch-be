The Pan-American Highway[1] is a network of roads measuring about 30,000 kilometres (19,000 mi)[2] in total length. Except for a rainforest break of approximately 160 km (100 mi), called the Darién Gap, the road links almost all of the mainland countries of the Americas in a connected highway system. According to Guinness World Records, the Pan-American Highway is the world's longest "motorable road". However, because of the Darién Gap, it is not possible to cross between South America and Central America, alternatively being able to circumnavigate this terrestrial stretch by sea.
