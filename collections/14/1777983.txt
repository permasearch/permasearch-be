During a sequence in the episode, the survivors pull a bloated zombie—commonly referred to by the group as a "walker"—out of a water well, ultimately leading to the walker splitting apart. Greg Melton, the series' production designer, collaborated with KNB Efx Group in producing the scene. Filming for the sequence arose over an approximate period of two days.
