In 2014 a new category of Chianti Classico was introduced: Chianti Classico Gran Selezione.[9] Gran Selezione is made exclusively from a wineryâ€™s own grapes grown according to stricter regulations compared to regular Chianti Classico.[9] Gran Selezione is granted to a Chianti Classico after it passes a suitability test conducted by authorised laboratories and after it is approved by a special tasting committee.[9]
