Many of the Arts and Crafts Movement designers were socialists, including Morris, T. J. Cobden Sanderson, Walter Crane, C.R.Ashbee, Philip Webb, Charles Faulkner and A.H.Mackmurdo.[33] In the early 1880s Morris was spending more of his time on socialist propaganda than on designing and making.[34] Ashbee established a community of craftsmen, the Guild of Handicraft, in east London, later moving to Chipping Campden.[6] Those adherents who were not socialists, for example, Alfred Hoare Powell,[17] advocated a more humane and personal relationship between employer and employee. Lewis Foreman Day, a very successful and influential Arts and Crafts designer, was not a socialist either, despite his long friendship with Crane.
