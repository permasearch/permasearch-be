Most justices have been Protestants, including 36 Episcopalians, 19 Presbyterians, 10 Unitarians, 5 Methodists, and 3 Baptists.[102][103] The first Catholic justice was Roger Taney in 1836,[104] and 1916 saw the appointment of the first Jewish justice, Louis Brandeis.[105] Several Catholic and Jewish justices have since been appointed, and in recent years the situation has reversed. The Court currently has at least five Catholic justices, and three Jewish justices.[98]
