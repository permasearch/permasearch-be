During the first three weeks of Big Brother Series 7, Channel 4 conducted a promotion in conjunction with NestlÃ© to distribute 100 "golden tickets" randomly throughout Kit Kats, in a style reminiscent of the story Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Members of the public finding these tickets were permitted to use them to give themselves a chance to become a Big Brother housemate and bypass the standard auditions process.
