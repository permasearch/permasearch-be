Kid Quick (キッド・クイック, Kiddo Kuikku) from Brooklyn, New York. His only appearance was in the arcade version of Punch-Out!!. He is the only boxer in the Punch-Out!! series to have no special attack; however, as his last name "Quick" tells it, he is very fast in both offense and defense. In 2009, a new Punch-Out!! character named Disco Kid appeared in Punch-Out!! Wii, with his fighting style being similar to Quick's. What is also interesting to note is that Disco Kid is referred to as "Kid Quick" in the game files, implying that Kid Quick was reworked into Disco Kid.
