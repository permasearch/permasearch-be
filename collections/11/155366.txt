Accusations of Jets also illegally videotaping the Patriots in their January 2007 playoff match-up arose following the incident. Jets general manager Mike Tannenbaum called the accusations "completely false" in September 2007.[29] In the week before the teams' December 16, 2007 game, Newsday reported the Jets were found videotaping from the mezzanine level of Gillette Stadium and asked to leave by Patriots security.[30] The Jets later claimed they had been granted permission by the Patriots to film in the game, while Belichick denied permission was ever given.[31]
