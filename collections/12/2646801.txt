In 2006 "Shenandoah" was proposed as the "interim state song" for Virginia, with updated lyrics.[15] The proposal was contentious because the standard folksong refers to the Missouri River, and in most versions of the song the name "Shenandoah" refers to an Indian chief, not the Shenandoah Valley or Shenandoah River which lie almost entirely in Virginia.[15][16] In 2015, "Our Great Virginia", which uses the melody of "Shenandoah" was designated by the Virginia Legislature as the official traditional state song of Virginia.
