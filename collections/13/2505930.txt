Evan begins working at Fitzgerald Motors alongside Tyler Brennan, and fellow apprentice Ben Kirk. Tyler tells Ben that Evan is in the third year of his apprenticeship, and sends Ben to get the coffees while he and Evan work inside. Evan comes to check on Ben and meets Yashvi Rebecchi. He admires her BMX bike, and asks if she is a member of a local Facebook BMX group. Yashvi later brings her bike to the garage for Evan to check over. When Yashvi's father brings his car to the garage, Yashvi takes the opportunity to spend time with Evan. They have a disagreement and Yashvi says he is stupid. She comes to apologise and invites Evan to a football game. Yashvi is forced to cancel the date when her younger sister goes missing, but Evan helps her search. He and Yashvi later attend a screening of another football match at Erinsborough Backpackers' and Yashvi gets drunk. Her mother confronts Evan, and he tells Yashvi that they are never going out again.
