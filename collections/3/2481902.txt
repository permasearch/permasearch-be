Less than a month after Broz arrived in Petrograd, the July Days demonstrations broke out, and Broz joined in, coming under fire from government troops.[49][50] In the aftermath, he tried to flee to Finland in order to make his way to the United States, but was stopped at the border.[51] He was arrested along with other suspected Bolsheviks during the subsequent crackdown by the Russian Provisional Government led by Alexander Kerensky. He was imprisoned in the Peter and Paul Fortress for three weeks, during which he claimed to be an innocent citizen of Perm. When he finally admitted to being an escaped POW, he was to be returned by train to Kungur, but escaped at Yekaterinburg, then caught another train which reached Omsk in Siberia on 8 November after a 3,200-kilometre (2,000Â mi) journey.[49][52] At one point, police searched the train looking for an escaped POW, but were deceived by Broz's fluent Russian.[50]
