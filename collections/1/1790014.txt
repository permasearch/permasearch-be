The team pursuit event had its inception at the senior level during the 2004â€“05 season. Davis had never practiced or participated in the event, and U.S. Speedskating never expressed an interest in having Davis skate in the team pursuit event. In April 2005, U.S. Speedskating voted that it could appoint skaters to the Olympic Pursuit Team who had not otherwise made the team in an individual event. Having never skated the pursuit event, Davis submitted his declaration to U.S. Speed skating; he informed them of his intention to skate the 1000 m, 1500 m, and 5000 m. On December 31, 2005, U.S. Speed skating named the maximum allotted 5 member team (K. C. Boutiette, Chad Hedrick, Charles Leveille, Clay Mull and Derek Parra). The U.S coaches arrived in Turin and named Davis as a substitute to the pursuit team without his knowledge or consent. In the event of an injury after the team had entered the competition track, substitution would be permitted if an International Skating Union (ISU) Withdrawal Form had been presented to and accepted by the referee.[10] No such injuries occurred, which meant that Davis was not even eligible to skate the team pursuit event at the Olympics.
