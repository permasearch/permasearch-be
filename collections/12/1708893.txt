On January 13, 2015, the judge dismissed the charges against Solo based on a lack of cooperation from both alleged victims. Solo claimed she was defending herself from an attack by her nephew, who is 6 feet 9 inches (2.06 m).[167] However, prosecutors filed an appeal with the Superior Court of Washington.[168] In October 2015, the prosecution prevailed in the Superior Court and the charges were reinstated. In June 2016 the state appeals court denied Solo's petition to review the case.[169]
