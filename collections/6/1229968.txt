Manors were run by nobility and gentry.  Land was power at the time; those with land received payments from the tenants on their land and from their workers. Thus they had significant wealth and influence. They also had responsibilities, for they were meant to aid the monarch by governing their land. Local grievances were taken to the lord of the manor; on the other hand, tenants were loyal to him â€“ if called upon, they were obliged to go to war. The lord's views tended to greatly influence those of his largely uneducated tenants.
