then its result on db is either { (a : 1) } under S1 or { (a : 1), (a : 2) } under S2. It will also be clear that if we take the domain to be an infinite set, then the result of the query will also be infinite. To solve these problems we will restrict our attention to those queries that are domain independent, i.e., the queries that return the same result for a database under all of its schemas.
