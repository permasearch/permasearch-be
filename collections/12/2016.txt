For the final segment of the film, a one-armed body double was needed for Elizabeth Marvel (who played the adult Mattie). After a nationwide call, the Coen brothers cast Ruth Morris â€“ a 29-year-old social worker and student who was born without a left forearm.[13] Morris has more screen time in the film than Marvel.[14]
