While color monitors had been used by several racing video games before (such as Indy 800[40] and Speed Race Twin[41]), it was during this period that RGB color graphics became widespread, following the release of Galaxian in 1979.[42] Namco's Rally-X in 1980 featured multi-directional scrolling,[43] and introduced a radar tracking the player position.[44] Sega's Space Tactics that year was a space combat game allowing multi-directional scrolling from a first-person perspective.[45] The following year, Namco's Bosconian allowed the player's ship to freely move across open space that scrolls in all directions.[46] By the early 1980s, scrolling had become popular among arcade video games and would make its way to third-generation consoles, where it would prove nearly as pivotal as the move to 3D graphics on later fifth-generation consoles.[47]
