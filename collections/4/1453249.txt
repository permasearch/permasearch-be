Buddy makes a life-size replica of his wife for her 30th birthday, and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie asks for a cake, arranged by New Jersey Devils owner Jeffrey Vanderbeek. Buddy's mother retires. Buddy announces an Employee of the Month contest – which he wins. (In addition to its regular version, this episode was also broadcast as a special Icing on the Cake episode, featuring special facts about the family, shop and baked goods, done in the same style as Pop-Up Video and Pawn Stars.)
