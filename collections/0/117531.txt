On 23 August 2015, the BBC announced that the Met Office will lose its contract as the BBC is legally obliged to ensure that licence fee payers get the best value for money. MeteoGroup is due to take over on 31 March 2018,[1][2] although the on air presenting team is not expected to change, and Met Office severe weather warnings will continue to be used by BBC Weather.[3]
