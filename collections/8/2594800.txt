Carrie Raisler of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C rate criticizing the story of Damon about being an Augustine vampire: "To be more specific, everything the show is doing with Damon right now is completely baffling" and that the story leaves many questions to the viewers. "This was actually a fairly streamlined episode of TVD, with most of the action happening either in the dungeons of Whitmore or back at the Salvatore mansion, where Katherine and Caroline team up to attempt to cure Stefan of his PTSD issues."[7]
