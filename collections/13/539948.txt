There are no non-stop scheduled flights between any two antipodal locations by commercial airline service—or anything even close. There is currently no commercial aircraft capable of travelling between antipodes at full load non-stop. (The current record holder Boeing 777-200LR's maximum range is rated at 17,395 km.) There are also regulations regarding pilot's work time, so relief crewmembers would be needed.[citation needed]
