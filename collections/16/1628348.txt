Ocativus's second costume as Spider-Man is a more significant change to his previous costume, possibly to show that he is no longer bound by Peter's memories.[114] The costume is primarily black and red, and the lenses that were previously white are now black. The costume retains many of the features of the previous suit, and adds several upgrades and new equipment. The most prominent addition is the set of four mechanical spider-arms that are based on the Iron Spider's and Doctor Octopus's mechanical arms.[92] The arms are stored on the back of the costume inside a backpack;[92] the backpack can also be used to store Octavius's civilian clothes when he acting as Spider-Man.[115] The arms are quite sharp and their strength is great enough for Octavius to lift an entire car above his head.[116] The costume also features built in wrist communicators that allow him to communicate with both his personal mercenary squad and his Spider-Bots.[92] The Nano-sized Spider tracers have been upgraded so that they can now be detonated to explode and inflict damage to the subject at a sub-dermal level.[117] Another upgrade Octavius has added is an improved web formula, according to Octavius the web-formula will not dissolve and will stay indefinitely until he activates the dissolving agent built within the formula.[118]
