A themed Ancient Egypt area, Forbidden Kingdom was created in 1994 as part of the Terror Tomb dark ride. It currently has two popular rides; Tomb Blaster and Rameses Revenge. Opening in 2002 Tomb Blaster[36] is a dark ride shoot out game where riders shoot laser guns at targets. Rameses Revenge is a Top Spin ride with a water element[38] that opened in 1995.[35] One side of Forbidden Kingdom is architecturally designed as an Arabic market town, while Tomb Blaster is set in an Ancient Egyptian courtyard, though much detail has been removed throughout the area over the years.
