where r is the separation between the two bodies and G is the gravitational constant, 6.6742(10) × 10−11 m3 kg−1 s−2.[1] In this case, the zero potential reference point is the infinite separation of the two bodies. Care must be taken that these masses are point masses or uniform spherical solids/shells. It cannot be applied directly to any objects of any shape and any mass.
