Anglicans generally understand their tradition as a branch of the historical "Catholic Church" and as a via media ("middle way") between traditions. The initial use of the phrase was by John Henry Newman in the 19th century, placing Anglicanism as a via media between Rome and Reform - between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism, although Newman later converted to the Catholic Church.
