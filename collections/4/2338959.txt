In July 2009, the Cadbury World visitor attraction in Birmingham opened a new area, Advertising Avenue.  Towards the end of the attraction, in the Music Shop, a chocolate DJ ('D.J. Choc') invites guests to enjoy four selected clips of favourite Cadbury TV adverts - three of these are broadcast on flatscreen monitors, culminating with the lights in a previously-un-noticed drum booth coming on, with a full-sized anamatronic gorilla drumming to In the Air Tonight.
