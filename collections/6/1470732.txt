At the Drunken Clam, Peter drinks a shot of hot sauce to win a bet and $10 from Quagmire, inspiring him to get paid for doing foolish dares for money. During a night out drunk with his friends, Peter takes the bet of drinking from a fire hydrant; this leads the hydrant sending a blast of water that catapults Peter into the Quahog Public Library, which is then flooded and destroyed. What happened at the Quahog Public Library reaches the news as Lois, Chris, Meg, and Stewie watch. At a press conference at his house, Mayor Adam West raises the legal drinking age to 50 years old, on the basis that Peter is 42 but cannot drink responsibly. The deputy mayor is also present as Mayor West quietly says through his teeth for him to be quiet.
