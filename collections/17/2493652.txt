TfL has long aspired to split the Northern line into two separate routes.[36][37] Running trains between all combinations of branches and the two central sections, as at present, means only 30 trains an hour can run through each of the central sections at peak times, because merging trains have to wait for each other at the junctions at Camden Town and Kennington.[38] Completely segregating the routes could allow 36 trains an hour on all parts of the line.[38] TfL has already separated the Charing Cross and Bank branches during off-peak periods; however, four trains per hour still run to and from Morden via Charing Cross in the peak, and the Edgware and High Barnet northern branches cannot be separated until Camden Town station is upgraded to cope with the numbers of passengers changing trains.[38]
