There are two basic types of "do not know" decisions. First is a slow, low confidence decision.[22] This occurs when a person has some knowledge relevant to the question asked. This knowledge is located and evaluated to determine whether the question can be answered based on what is stored in memory. In this case, the relevant knowledge is not enough to answer the question. Second, when a person has zero knowledge relevant to a question asked, he or she is able to produce a rapid response of not knowing.[22] This occurs because the initial search for information draws a blank and the search stops, thus producing a faster response.
