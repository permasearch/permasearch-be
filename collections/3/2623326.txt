Red salamanders generally live in springs or streams during the winter and then disperse to and from these sites in the fall and spring.[12] Due to its semiaquatic nature, the red salamander remains in terrestrial environments until early spring then disperses to more aquatic sites.[8] Adults often live in burrows along streams and in other moist environments such as under logs and rocks along the forest floor.[9] Adult red salamanders, like their larvae, are generalists and tend to feed on invertebrates, as well as small amphibians.[9] Its predators include birds and small carnivores such as skunks and raccoons.[8] Since the red salamander is a large species of salamander, its presence or absence can greatly affect the ecosystem where it lives, and understanding its ecology is important to understand its role in community structures.
