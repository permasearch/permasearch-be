As of 2013, about 70% of the rooms branded under Hilton were franchised to independent operators and companies. During its 2007â€“2013 ownership of Hilton, Blackstone Group pursued a strategy of predominantly expanding Hilton's reach through franchise agreements, while relatively few new properties were actually operated by Hilton. Hence, the proportion of franchised rooms grew significantly during this period.[66] The practice of franchising is popular within the hospitality industry among most major hotel chains, as the parent company does not have to pay for the maintenance and overhead costs of franchised properties. Franchisees must follow strict brand standards in order to maintain a licensing agreement with Hilton.[66] Many of Hilton's flagship properties, airport properties, and largest resorts, however, are corporately managed.
