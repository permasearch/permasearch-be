During the time of the events of The Lord of the Rings, Sauron learned from Gollum that the One Ring was held by a hobbit named Baggins in a land called "Shire". Sauron sent the Ringwraiths forth to search for the Ring. The Riders did not at first know the location of the Shire, and were dispelled by Saruman from Isengard, but when they came by chance upon Gr√≠ma Wormtongue in Rohan, he told them what he knew of Saruman's plans, including his interest in the Shire and the Shire's location.
