Allegiant grossed $66.2 million in North America and $113.1 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $179.2 million.[3] Due to its underperformance, The Hollywood Reporter called it "the second big-budget miss for Lionsgate this year after Gods of Egypt".[19] Many critics have blamed the underperformance of the film on Lionsgate's decision to split the last novel into two pictures.[20][21] As a result, Lionsgate will cut the budget of the fourth and final movie in the series, Ascendant.[9] Due to the box office struggles of Allegiant, Lionsgate has planned to wrap up the film series with a television movie which it then hopes to continue as a television series spinoff.[22] Made on a total budget of $183.6 million, including net production budget, advertising and promotion costs, and domestic home entertainment costs, Deadline.com projects the film to make a mere profit of $3.5 million should it earn a net total of $187.1 million from various platforms (including theatrical revenues, TV rights and DVD sales). By comparison, Divergent made a net profit of $71.8 million and Insurgent $30.6 million.[23]
