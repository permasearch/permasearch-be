In June 2016, XXL editor-in-chief Vanessa Satten revealed Post Malone was considered for XXL's "2016 Freshmen Class" magazine cover, but she was "told by his camp that he wasn't paying attention to hip hop so much. He was going in more of a rock/pop/country direction."[41] However, Post denied these claims, explaining that his latest mixtape as well as his upcoming album were both hip-hop.[42] In August 2016, Post issued an apology for his album, Stoney, being late.[43] It was available for pre-order on November 4, and was finally released on December 9. Post later went on to call the album "mediocre",[7] despite the success of the single "Congratulations" featuring Quavo, Post's first top-ten song on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number eight.[44][45] Stoney also featured the top 100 hits "I Fall Apart", and "Deja Vu", featuring Bieber, with the album later being certified double platinum by the RIAA in October 2017.[46]
