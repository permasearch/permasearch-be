Adidas signed an agreement with the NHL to be the official outfitter of uniforms and licensed apparel for all teams, starting with the 2017â€“18 season, replacing Reebok.[135] The Reebok Edge template will now be retired in favor of the Adidas' ADIZERO template. The home and away uniforms that were debuted in the 2007-08 season remains nearly identical with the exception of the new Adidas ADIZERO template and the new collar. With the new collar, the NHL shield remains but is no longer placed on a lower layer with flaps nearby, as it's now front and center on a pentagon with a new "Chrome Flex" style.[136] The waist stripes are now curved instead of being straight across. The Adidas logo replaces the Reebok logo on the back collar.
