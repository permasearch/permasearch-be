Most of northeastern China, except for Liaoning, did not receive significant settlements by Han Chinese until the 18th century,[37] and as a result the Northeastern Mandarin dialects spoken there differ little from the Beijing dialect.[38] The Manchu people of the area now speak these dialects exclusively; their native language is only maintained in northwestern Xinjiang, where Xibe, a modern dialect, is spoken.[39]
