Patrick O'Malley is Emily's husband, a florist who had a long-standing crush on her before revealing his feelings in Delicious: Emily's True Love; he and Emily became engaged at the end of that game. Patrick had an important role in the sample game Delicious: Emily's Big Surprise and he and Emily are married in Delicious: Emily's Wonder Wedding. In a bonus scene that players must unlock to see at the end of Delicious: Emily's Honeymoon Cruise, Patrick's wife, Emily, is seen going into labour with their first child, daughter Paige. So far he has only helped out by being a cleaner in a couple of restaurants in Delicious: Emily's Honeymoon Cruise.
