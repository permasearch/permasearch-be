Gwynn's father encouraged his sons to play ball in the makeshift baseball field that he assembled in their backyard.[4] The setup was a narrow strip of grass that was longer than wide.[4][10] Pulling the ball too much resulted in it being lost over the neighbor's fence, but left field being short ruled out hitting it to the opposite field as well.[4][5][10][11] Once the brothers' supply of wiffle balls  was exhausted, they resorted to using a sock rolled in rubber bands, a wad of tape, or a hardened fig from a neighbor's tree.[4] Although Gwynn was able to pull the ball in his back yard, he would naturally hit it the other way during regular games.[11] Growing up, he attended Los Angeles Dodgers games and watched his hero, Willie Davis; the Dodgers outfielder had twice as many stolen bases as home runs (398 SB, 182 HR) in his career. Gwynn admired Davis for being black, left-handed, and "aggressive but under control"; he respected Davis' work habits as well.[12] Unlike other kids that tracked home run hitters, Gwynn checked the box scores in the newspaper every morning to follow high-average hitters like Pete Rose, George Brett and Rod Carew.[13]
