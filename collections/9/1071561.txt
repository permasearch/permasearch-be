Similar to the Ermac rumors in the first Mortal Kombat but received with far less fanfare, Skarlet originated as a nonexistent character in Mortal Kombat II due to false reports of a glitch nicknamed "Scarlet" by players in which the palette swaps of either Kitana or Mileena would turn red.[143] In March 2011, nearly two decades after the rumors originated, she was announced as one of the Mortal Kombat reboot's first two downloadable characters,[144][145] released on June 21.
