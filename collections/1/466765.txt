Nike also announced that each team will have a third, alternate uniform called the "Statement" uniform for the 2017â€“18 season. The Cavaliers' Statement uniform will be black with dark gray pinstripes, a wine colored "C" trimmed in gold on the front, names in gold letters on the back, wine colored/gold trimmed numbers on the front and back, and gold colored Nike and Goodyear logos on the front.  The black uniform is a nod to the team's former black sleeved jerseys that they wore when they won Game 7 in the 2016 Finals.[22]
