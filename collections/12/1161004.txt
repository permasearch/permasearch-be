Phil embarked on an affair with Glenda behind his partner Shirley's back. In January 2011, he had a heart attack, and afterwards asked Shirley to marry him, but on their wedding day he discovered his affair and called things off. Their rocky relationship soon resumes again. Glenda left Walford having been rejected by Ronnie and Roxy for her actions. Ben (now Joshua Pascoe) was released from prison in September, and began to stalk his father when Phil refused to accept that he was gay, sending him threatening notes for several months. Billy's granddaughter Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold) was introduced as a new teenage troublemaker, and became pregnant by Ben, her distant relative, when they tested his sexuality.
