Some Classical slow movements involve a different sort of truncation, in which the development section is replaced altogether by a short retransition. This occurs in the slow movements of Mozart's quartets KV 387, KV 458, KV 465, KV 575, and KV 589. It is also common in overtures, occurring for example in Schubert's Overture in the Italian Style in C, D 590. This is distinct from a short development, such as in the opening movement of Mozart's Violin Sonata in G major, KV 379.
