Take This to Your Grave is the debut studio album by American rock band Fall Out Boy. It was released on May 6, 2003, by Fueled by Ramen. The album was produced by Sean O'Keefe. When the band was signed to Island Records, Island employed an unusual strategy that allowed the band to sign with independent label Fueled by Ramen for their debut, and later move to the major label for a second album. O'Keefe had helped with the band's demo, and the group returned to Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin to record the bulk of their first album. Living on a stranger's floor for part of the time, and running out of money halfway through, the band recorded seven songs in nine days, bringing them together with the additional three from the demo. While Patrick Stump had previously written all the lyrics and took them lightly, Pete Wentz took to the process with considerable seriousness and obsessively picked apart his bandmate's lyrics. The "exhausting" process led to numerous revisions of single songs and several arguments. The album cover, which shows the four bandmates sitting on a broken futon, features a blue tint reminiscent of jazz records, and was the second choice after the original was rejected by the label.
