Some breeds are used to enforce public order by chasing and detaining suspects either by direct apprehension or a method known as Bark and Hold. K9s such as the German Shepherd breed, have many qualities that make them applicable for the job. A successful K9 should be intelligent, aggressive, strong, and have a good sense of smell. Many police dogs that are chosen are male and remain unneutered to maintain their aggressive behavior, however there are female police dogs which are used for rescue, tracking, and locating bombs and drugs.[12] German Shepherd dogs and Belgian Malinois are most commonly used because of their availability.
