The bronze penny was first issued with the so-called "bun head", or "draped bust" of Queen Victoria on the obverse. The inscription around the bust read VICTORIA D G BRITT REG F D. This was replaced in 1895 by the "old head", or "veiled bust".[11] The inscription on these coins read VICTORIA DEI GRA BRITT REGINA FID DEF IND IMP.
