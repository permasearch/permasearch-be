The only professional doctorate in Japan is the Juris Doctor, known as Hōmu Hakushi (法務博士)[93] The program generally lasts two or three years. This curriculum is professionally oriented,[94] but unlike in the US the program does not provide education sufficient for a law license. All candidates for a bar license must pass the bar exam (Shihou shiken), attend the Legal Training and Research Institute and pass the practical exam (Nikai Shiken or Shihou Shushusei koushi).[95]
