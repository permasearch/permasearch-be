While both sides have support in the literature, there appears to be greater empirical support for the significance of response bias.[1][2][3][11][12][13] To add strength to the claims of those who argue the importance of response bias, many of the studies that reject the significance of response bias report multiple methodological issues in their studies. For example, they have extremely small samples that are not representative of the population as a whole, they only considered a small subset of potential variables that could be affected by response bias, and their measurements were conducted over the phone with poorly worded statements.[5][7]
