Clubs therefore had an equal chance to grow to become among the strongest in their particular sport which has led to a situation where many large cities are represented by multiple top class teams in the same sport. In the 2016â€“17 football season, London has five teams playing in the Premier League, while Liverpool and Manchester also have double representation. Other large European cities like Rome, Milan, Madrid, Rotterdam and Barcelona have multiple first division clubs.
