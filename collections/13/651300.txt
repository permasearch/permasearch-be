Some cities, such as Seattle, and states like Connecticut,[5] have created mandatory recycling laws that may fine citizens who throw away certain recyclable materials. Vermont also employed a landfill ban of recyclable materials, food and yard waste, and wood.[6] There are also voluntary programs and educational programs to increase recycling where it is not mandated by law.
