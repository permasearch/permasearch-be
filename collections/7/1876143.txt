Vildagliptin (Galvus)(Figure 6) was first synthesized in May 1998 and was named after Edwin B. Villhauer.  It was discovered when researchers at Novartis examined adamantyl derivatives that had proven to be very potent.  The adamantyl group worked as a steric bulk and slowed intramolecular cyclization while increasing chemical stability.  Furthermore, the primary metabolites were highly active. To avoid additional chiral center a hydroxylation at the adamantyl ring was carried out (Figure 6). The product, vildagliptin, was even more stable, undergoing intramolecular cyclization 30-times slower, and having high DPP-4 inhibitory activity and longer-lasting pharmacodynamic effect.[6]
