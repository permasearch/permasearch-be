The Shar Pei has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th century. According to historical documents and artifacts, they have existed in China since ancient times, and their likeness was often used to decorate various objects, especially during the Han Dynasty. During this period, they were used as fighting dogs, and gradually became favorite pets of Chinese emperors. They continue to be trained as fighting dogs in modern-day Tibet.[20]
