Tiki-taka has been variously described as "a style of play based on making your way to the back of the net through short passing and movement,"[13] a "short passing style in which the ball is worked carefully through various channels,"[24] and a "nonsensical phrase that has come to mean short passing, patience and possession above all else."[25] The style involves roaming movement and positional interchange among midfielders, moving the ball in intricate patterns,[26] and sharp, one- or two-touch passing.[22] Tiki-taka is "both defensive and offensive in equal measure" – the team is always in possession, so does not need to switch between defending and attacking.[17] Commentators have contrasted tiki-taka with "route one physicality"[13] and with the higher-tempo passing of Arsène Wenger's 2007–08 Arsenal side, which employed Cesc Fàbregas as the only channel between defence and attack.[24] Tiki-taka is associated with flair, creativity and touch,[27] but can also be taken to a "slow, directionless extreme" that sacrifices effectiveness for aesthetics.[25]
