Following the disbanding of the Continental Army at the end of 1783 only one major general, Henry Knox, remained in service until his resignation in June 1784.  The rank was revived on March 4, 1791 when Arthur St. Clair was appointed as major general in command of the U.S. Army.   St. Clair was succeeded by Major General Anthony Wayne who commanded the Army (then named the Legion of the United States) until his death on December 15, 1796.  The rank was revived on July 19, 1798 when Alexander Hamilton and Charles C. Pinckney were commissioned as major generals during the Quasi War with France. The expanded Army was demobilized on June 15, 1800 when it was reduced to only four regiments of infantry and two of artillery commanded by a brigadier general.
