Since the facts of the case are undisputed - Carl Lee did kill the two rapists - the only way in law to get a verdict of not guilty is to plead temporary insanity. Ellen Roark prepares for Brigance a thorough study of all Mississippi precedents touching on the relevant British M'Naghten rules which apply in Mississippi as in sixteen other US states. Brigance gets a psychiatrist to prove that Carl Lee was indeed insane while committing his act, and the state gets an opposing psychiatrist to assert he was completely sane and therefore culpable. Much of the trial is devoted to prosecution and defense trying to discredit each other's expert witnesses. Yet in fact, no one truly takes seriously the issue of Carl Lee's sanity, and it has only a marginal place in the jurors' deliberations and the final verdict they reach.
