Modified whole life insurance features smaller premiums for a specified period of time, followed by higher premiums for the remainder of the policy. Survivorship life insurance is whole life insurance insuring two lives, with proceeds payable after the second (later) death.The level premium system results in overpaying for the risk of dying at younger ages, and underpaying in later years toward the end of life.[8]
