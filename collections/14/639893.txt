They catch up with the thief, Ethan Nakamura, just as the last petal falls off the flower because Ethan has revived the Titan Iapetus. At the culmination of their fight, Percy flings Iapetus into the river Lethe, a river that erases memories. Only Percy's powers as the son of Poseidon can keep him dry. Percy tells the now mind-wiped Iapetus that his name is Bob and that they are friends. When the three heroes and "Bob" return to Hades and Persephone with the sword, Hades is very unhappy about the sword and leaves in anger, threatening Persephone never to disobey him again. By this, they know that Persephone commissioned the sword against Hades' orders. (However, Percy saw a look of "hunger" in Hades' eyes while he stared at the sword.)
