The Cambridge School of political thought, led principally by Quentin Skinner, J. G. A. Pocock, Richard Ashcraft, and Peter Laslett, uses a historical methodology to situate Locke in the political context of his times. But they also restrict his importance to those times.[40] Ashcraftâ€™s Locke takes the side of the burgeoning merchant class against the aristocracy.[41] Neal Wood puts Locke on the side of the agrarian interests, not the manufacturing bourgeoisie.[42]
