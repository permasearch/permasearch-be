The rivalry between Nintendo and Sega resulted in what has been described as one of the most notable console wars in video game history,[32] in which Sega positioned the Genesis as the "cool" console, with games aimed at older audiences, and edgy advertisements that occasionally attacked the competition.[33] Nintendo however, scored an early public relations advantage by securing the first console conversion of Capcom's arcade classic Street Fighter II for SNES, which took over a year to make the transition to the Genesis. Despite the Genesis's head start, much larger library of games, and lower price point,[34] the Genesis only represented an estimated 60% of the American 16-bit console market in June 1992,[35] and neither console could maintain a definitive lead for several years. Donkey Kong Country is said to have helped establish the SNES's market prominence in the latter years of the 16-bit generation,[36][37][38][39] and for a time, maintain against the PlayStation and Saturn.[40] According to Nintendo, the company had sold more than 20 million SNES units in the U.S.[41] According to a 2014 Wedbush Securities report based on NPD sales data, the SNES ultimately outsold the Genesis in the U.S. market.[42]
