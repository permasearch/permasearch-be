Intensive factory farming has grown to become the biggest threat to the global environment through the loss of ecosystem services and global warming.[97] It is a major driver to global environmental degradation and biodiversity loss.[98] The process in which feed needs to be grown for animal use only is often grown using intensive methods which involve a significant amount of fertiliser and pesticides. This sometimes results in the pollution of water, soil and air by agrochemicals and manure waste, and use of limited resources such as water and energy at unsustainable rates.[99]
