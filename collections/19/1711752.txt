Ted (Luke Benward) is obsessed with buying collectable toys online, and spends five thousand dollars (which he was supposed to use to buy a car) on a rare Robo-Bear toy from the 80's named Mangler with a mysterious link to accidents and deaths that occurred to the children that received the toys. Mangler comes alive that night, and goes after Ted's younger brother Mark (Dylan Schmid) and friend Jason (Rhys Matthew Bond) for using him to mock Ted. Mark figures out the link via a blue fuzz ball that Jason dropped and urges Ted to get rid of Mangler. Although Ted refuses, he accepts Mark suggestion of asking why the previous owner sold him. The seller (Glynis Davies)'s brother owned it, but he died from an animal attack. Ted refuses to destroy the toy and Mangler comes alive again that night going after Mark and seeing him in action finally convinces Ted that he's a problem. They chase it through the house and Ted cuts his head off with a katana, sealing him in a shipping box, and selling him online to recoup his losses.
