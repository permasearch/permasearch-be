On June 2016, scientists from Brigham Young University conclusively reported that endospores of Bacillus Subtilis were able to survive high speed impacts up to 299Â±28 m/s, extreme shock, and extreme deceleration. They pointed out that this feature might allow endospores to survive and to be transferred between planets by traveling within meteorites or by experiencing atmosphere disruption. Moreover, they suggested that the landing of spacecrafts may also result in interplanetary spore transfer, given that spores can survive high-velocity impact while ejected from the spacecraft onto the planet surface. This is the first study which reported that bacteria can survive in such high-velocity impact. However, the lethal speed impact is unknown, and further experiments should be done by introducing higher-velocity impact to bacterial endospores.[28]
