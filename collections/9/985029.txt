Air New Zealand and Boeing are researching the jatropha plant to see if it is a sustainable alternative to conventional fuel.[119] A two-hour test flight using a 50â€“50 mixture of the new biofuel with Jet A-1 in the number one position Rolls Royce RB-211 engine of 747-400 ZK-NBS, was successfully completed on December 30, 2008. The engine was then removed to be scrutinised and studied to identify any differences between the Jatropha blend and regular Jet A1. No effects to performances were found.
