This is a list of wrongful convictions in the United States. This list includes people who have been legally exonerated, including people whose convictions have been overturned and have not been retried, as well as people who have not been formally exonerated but are widely considered to be factually innocent. This list is not exhaustive and represents only exonerees who currently have Wikipedia articles. Crime descriptions with an asterisk (*) indicate that the events were later determined not to be criminal acts.
