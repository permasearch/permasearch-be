By 1926, South African astronomer William Stephen Finsen calculated the approximate orbit elements close to those now accepted for this system.[54] All future positions are now sufficiently accurate for visual observers to determine the relative places of the stars from a binary star ephemeris.[55] Others, like the Belgian astronomer D. Pourbaix (2002), have regularly refined the precision of any new published orbital elements.[15]
