On September 17, 2010, Yahoo! showed off a new Mail program to reporters.[20][21] Codenamed "Minty", the 2011 release was announced on September 16, 2010.[22] It included a new interface, enhanced performance, improved Facebook and Twitter integration, the ability to watch YouTube videos straight from email, and improved search.[23] Public beta began on October 26, 2010.[24] In May 2011, the new Yahoo! Mail became the default interface.[11] As the new interface became mandatory for users, some users of Yahoo! Mail reported slow typing speeds, contradicting Yahoo's claims of faster performance. Yahoo! offered no resolution to the problem as of  SeptemberÂ 12, 2011[update]. Users also missed the ability to paste textual email addresses into the sender box. The new version disabled the use of the "secondary" addresses provided in the previous version. The new interface overrode the browser's right mouse button (making functions such as opening mails in new tab windows unavailable).[citation needed]
