San Lorenzo Colossal Head 8 (also known as San Lorenzo Monument 61) stands 2.2 metres (7.2 ft) high;[92] it measures 1.65 metres (5.4 ft) wide by 1.6 metres (5.2 ft) deep and weighs 13 tons.[93] It is one of the finest examples of an Olmec colossal head. It was found lying on its side to the south of a monumental throne.[94] The monument was discovered at a depth of 5 metres (16 ft) during a magnetometer survey of the site in 1968;[95] it has been dated to the Early Preclassic.[92] After discovery it was initially reburied;[96] it was moved to the Museo de Antropología de Xalapa in 1986.[97] The headdress is decorated with the talons or claws of either a jaguar or an eagle.[94] It has a headband and a cover that descends from under the headdress proper behind the ears.[98] Two short straps descend in front of the ears.[99] The head sports large ear ornaments in the form of pegs. The face is that of a mature male with sagging cheeks and wrinkles between these and the nose. The forehead is gathered in a frown. The mouth is slightly parted to reveal the teeth.[100] Most of the head is carved in a realistic manner, the exception being the ears. These are stylised and represented by one question mark shape contained within another. The head is very well preserved and displays a fine finish.[101]
