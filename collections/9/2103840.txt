The redesign in 1992 for 1993 featured mild restyling, flush-mounted door glass, wider doors, and slight fender flares. The 1989-style dashboard remained, but the seats and door panels were new. The 2.9-liter engine was discontinued. The engines offered were offered in displacements of 2.3, 3.0 and 4.0 liters. A new "Splash" model was introduced, which had a flare side bed, unique chrome wheels, 1-inch (25 mm) lowered rear suspension and a 2-inch (51 mm) lowered front suspension (on 4x2 models), and special vinyl "Splash" decals on the sides and the tailgate.
