To estimate the time, a driver can wait until the rear end of the vehicle in front passes any distinct and fixed point on the roadwayâ€”e.g. a road sign, mailbox, line/crack/patch in the road. This should be done without looking up for more than one second, which would defeat the purpose. After the car ahead passes a given fixed point, the front of one's car should pass the same point no less than two seconds later. If the elapsed time is less than this, one should increase the distance, then repeat the method again until the time is at least two seconds.
