Rolling Stone writer Jon Freeman writes, "the tune has a touch of Jeff Lynne's hyper-melodic work with Electric Light Orchestra in its DNA, from the stacked harmonies to the bright combination of chords".[3] Andrew Unterberger of Billboard calls the track, "a rollicking anthem of folk-pop perseverance with a gently throbbing pulse", and "It's marvelous, it's irresistible â€“ it's Come On Over-worthy, which 20 years later is still pretty much the highest compliment you can give to a song of its ilk".[6]
