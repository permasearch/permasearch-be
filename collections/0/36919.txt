When Guyana became a republic under the leadership of Forbes Burnham in 1970, the National Assembly elected Chung as the country's first President; he took office on March 17, 1970. Ten years later, a constitutional revision transformed the presidency into an executive position, and Burnham succeeded Chung as President[1] on October 6, 1980.[3]
