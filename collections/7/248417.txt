It is common for skaters to skid the forward take off edge, especially on double and triple Axel jumps, rather than vaulting directly off a clean edge. The skid helps the blade grip the ice on the take off, and is considered an acceptable technique as long as the skid does not make the skater pre-rotate the jump or take off the back of the blade. When the skater makes a mistake in the timing of the jump so that the blade slips off the edge instead of gripping the ice, the result is called a "waxel," often resulting in a fall.
