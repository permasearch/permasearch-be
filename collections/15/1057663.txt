Tornado occurrence is highly dependent on the time of day. [8] Austria, Finland, Germany, and the United States'[39] peak hour of occurrence is 5Â pm, with roughly half of all tornado occurrence between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. local time,[40][41] due to this being the time of peak atmospheric heating, and thus the maximum available energy for storms; some researchers, including Howard B. Bluestein of the University of Oklahoma, have referred to this phenomenon as "five o'clock magic." Despite this, there are several morning tornadoes reported, like the Seymour, Texas one in April 1980.
