I reverted an addition by an IP that referenced the Jackson-Calhoun toasts that may be more appropriate under the Nullification section, although since this is covered in the main article Nullification Crisis I'm not sure why any additional elaboration on ths is in order. There is a discussion below on the reorganization of the article that the IP may want to participate in since it relates in part to the over-emphasis on the Nullification Crisis as compared to more significant events in the 1840s and 1850s that are given less coverage. As far as the references to Madison and Jefferson, the intent of this section is not to carry the history of states' rights arguments all the way back to the founding -- this is well beyond the scope of the article. The mention of Madison is particularly inappropriate since by 1830 he was clearly on the record as opposed to both nullification and secession. Tom (North Shoreman) (talk) 00:17, 2 April 2008 (UTC)
