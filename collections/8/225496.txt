"Jump (For My Love)" would afford the Pointer Sisters an international hit, charting in Belgium (#3 on the Flemish chart), Germany (#20), Ireland (#2), the Netherlands (#9), New Zealand (#3), Switzerland (#13), and the UK (#6). In Australia, "Jump" was issued as the lead single off Break Out in December 1983 and peaked at #79: reissued after "Automatic," it would reach an Australian chart peak of #8 in the summer of 1984. The Australian single release of "Jump" was also unique in featuring as B-side the Break Out track "Operator" with Anita Pointer on lead; in other territories, "Heart Beat", a track with Ruth Pointer on lead introduced on the Pointer Sisters previous album So Excited!, was utilized as the B-side of "Jump (For My Love)." Released prior to the 1984 Summer Olympics games, the song's video featured footage of athletes competing in track and field events, as well as NBA stars Julius Erving and Magic Johnson. The Pointer Sisters were awarded the 1985 Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for "Jump (For My Love)", and Steve Mitchell (co-writer) received his nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance in 1985 for his musical performance as the principle musician on the song's recording.
