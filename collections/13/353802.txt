With the recapture of Kokoda, air landings and evacuation could occur from its landing strip and it became the main point of evacuation. As well as Câ€“47s landing with supplies, Stinson L-1 Vigilant light observation aircraft converted for use as air ambulances, flew into Kokoda.[notes 20] At the start of November, the detachment at Myola was caring for 438 sick and wounded. Many walked back along the track as they became sufficiently well to make the trek. Some had to wait up to two and a half months before porters were available to carry the stretcher cases forward to Kokoda for evacuation by air. The last arrived at Port Moresby only a couple of days before Christmas.[notes 21] Norris later wrote and questioned: "why after three years of war no adequate ambulance planes were available"?[170]
