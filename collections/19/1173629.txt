Storylines Carmine was first mentioned as the notorious ex-boyfriend of Angelina Veneziano (Diana DeGarmo). Angelina's father Angelo (Mike Starr) forbid her from having contact with him and hired Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart) to make sure that didn't happen. Angelina then attempted to convince Kevin that she was pregnant with Carmine's child and that they had to run away together for safety, all of which was never true. Kevin and Angelina ended up marrying for their own safety from Angelo, which was later annulled.
