On the way to Aeolus's castle, Jason, Leo, and Piper become separated from Thalia, who says she will return and meet them at the Wolf House, the last place Thalia had seen Jason before this meeting. After almost being imprisoned by Aeolus under Gaea's orders, the trio manage to escape thanks to Mellie, Aeolus's former assistant, and end up in San Francisco, as a result of a dream Piper had with Aphrodite. After landing in San Francisco, the trio rush to Mount Diablo to fight the Giant Enceladus, who captured Piper's father. They manage to kill the giant with the help of Zeus sending a thunderbolt and save Piper's father (Tristan McLean), and subsequently rush to the Wolf House to free Hera.
