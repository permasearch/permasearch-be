Initial critical reception of the song was mixed. Metal Injection praised the song for being "catchy" and having a "memorable enough hook" that takes effect after hearing the song three times.[12] MetalSucks was less enthusiastic, criticizing that it sounded too much like early 2000s rock music from the band and similar artists such as Seether and Theory of a Deadman.[13]
