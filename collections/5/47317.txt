Studio A contains sets for the school's hallways, washrooms, cafeteria and classrooms.[26] The hallways are stenciled with phrases such as "the perfect human being is all human", which were found at the Etobicoke School for the Arts, one of the many schools that set designers used during their original research. The washroom set is used for the girls' and boys' room; urinals are installed and removed as needed."[28] It is also used as the studio's cafeteria where the cast and crew eat.[28]
