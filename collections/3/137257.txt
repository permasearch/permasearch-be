The second source of Chief Powhatan’s involvement was William Strachey, Secretary of the Jamestown colony in 1610–11. Strachey’s The Historie of Travaile Into Virginia Britannia seemed to confirm Smith’s report and provided additional information: the colonists had been living peacefully among a group of natives beyond Powhatan’s domain for more than twenty years when they were massacred. Furthermore, Powhatan himself seemed to have directed the slaughter because of prophecies by his priests that he would be overthrown by people from that area,[19]:101 and he reportedly produced several English-made iron implements to back his claim.[20]
