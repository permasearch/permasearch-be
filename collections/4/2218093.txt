The West German government was known to be much more decentralised than its state socialist East German counterpart, the former being a federal state and the latter a unitary one. Whilst East Germany was divided into 15 administrative districts (Bezirke), which were merely local branches of the national government, West Germany was divided into states (LÃ¤nder) with independently elected state parliaments and control of the Bundesrat, the second legislative chamber of the Federal Government.
