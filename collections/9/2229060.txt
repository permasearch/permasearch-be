Some investigators have studied whether hypercarbia or higher than normal carbion dioxide levels, could explain the occurrence of NDEs. However, studies are difficult to interpret since NDEs have been observed both with increased levels as well as decreased levels of carbion dioxide, and finally some other studies have observed NDEs when levels had not changed, and there is little data.[12]
