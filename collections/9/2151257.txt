This ratio arises because volume is composed of three mutually orthogonal directions. Thus, in an isotropic material, for small differential changes, one-third of the volumetric expansion is in a single axis. As an example, take a cube of steel that has sides of length L. The original volume will be     V =  L  3     {\displaystyle V=L^{3}}   and the new volume, after a temperature increase, will be
