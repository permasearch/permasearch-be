"Double Shot (Of My Baby's Love)" is a popular song written by Don Smith and Cyril Vetter[1] and originally recorded in 1964 by Dick Holler & the Holidays. It was later recorded by The Swingin' Medallions who released it as their second single in 1966. The song became a hit for the group, peaking at #17 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.[2] The song was banned on many radio stations due to the lines referring to drinking and sex, including "worst hangover I ever had" and "she loved me so hard".
