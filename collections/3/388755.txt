The conflicting origins and stories of the DC universe are explained as a Multiverse, containing many parallel universes and alternate versions of the characters, with the primary DC continuity referred to as Earth-1. A cosmic being known as the Monitor supervises many of these realities, but is opposed by his counterpart the Anti-Monitor, who comes from an antimatter universe and begins destroying many of the realities with a wave of antimatter, to replace them with his own.
