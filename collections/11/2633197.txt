The 26.17-acre (10.59Â ha) Hudson Yards project,[66][67] the largest planned development ever built in the United States,[68] was to be constructed over the existing at-grade West Side Yard, allowing LIRR trains to continue to be stored during midday hours. The land parcel is bordered by 30th Street and Chelsea on the south, Twelfth Avenue on the west, 33rd Street and Hell's Kitchen on the north, and Tenth Avenue on the east. Eleventh Avenue runs through the site, and splits the redevelopment project into two phases. To minimize construction impact on the LIRR's ability to store trains during midday and peak hours, caissons were drilled into bedrock throughout much of the site, over which the platform was to be built.[69] However, only 38% of the ground level at West Side Yard was to be filled in with columns to support the development.[45] Much of the platform itself will be built by a huge Manitowoc 18000 crane.[70] The eastern platform, supporting the towers, comprises 16 bridges.[71] The platform for the Eastern Rail Yard was completed in October 2015, and the western platform will be completed by 2016.[72]
