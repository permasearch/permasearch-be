After receiving an invitation by the Evil Queen to participate in the enactment of the Dark Curse, the Blind Witch joins various others with dark souls. As each had to sacrifice a piece of themselves, the Blind Witch cuts off a lock of her hair. However, the first enactment fails, displeasing her and various others. Eventually, the Evil Queen casts the curse and she, along with the rest of the Enchanted Forest, is consumed by the curse.
