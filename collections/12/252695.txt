Myocardial contractility represents the innate ability of the heart muscle (cardiac muscle or myocardium) to contract. Changes in the ability to produce force during contraction result from incremental degrees of binding between myosin (thick) and actin (thin) filaments. The degree of binding that occurs depends on concentration of calcium ions in the cell. Within an in vivo intact heart, it is generally the action/response of the sympathetic nervous system driven by precisely timed release of a catecholamine that determines the concentration of calcium ions in the cytosol of cardiac muscle cells. All factors that cause an increase in contractility work by causing an increase in intracellular [Ca++] during contraction.[citation needed]
