The final immunity challenge took place at Tribal Council. Colby took the lead after 7 questions, but Tina pulled even. After 11 questions, they were tied. On the last question (Who stated on their Survivor application form that their proudest accomplishment was being on the Deanâ€™s list in college for five semesters?), Colby said Amber while Tina said, Nick. With the right answer being Amber, Colby continued his dominance and got to choose who to take with him to the final 2. Colby finally chose philanthropy over strategy, choosing to take Tina with him and making Keith the final member of the jury.
