Approximately 10,000 years ago, desertification forced hunter-gatherer societies south into the Sahel regions of northern Central Africa, where some groups settled and began farming as part of the Neolithic Revolution.[10] Initial farming of white yam progressed into millet and sorghum, and before 3000 BC[11] the domestication of African oil palm improved the groups' nutrition and allowed for expansion of the local populations.[12] This Agricultural Revolution, combined with a "Fish-stew Revolution", in which fishing began to take place, and the use of boats, allowed for the transportation of goods. Products were often moved in ceramic pots, which are the first known examples of artistic expression from the region's inhabitants.[10]
