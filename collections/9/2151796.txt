Many researches are currently using Spearman's form of intelligence testing in their current studies. Although not all of the studies are currently using Spearman's exact model for intelligence testing, they are adding some modern concepts to that study. Spearman described that there was a functional relationship between intelligence and Sensory Discriminatory Abilities.[5] Recent research has determined that there is an overlap between Working Memory, General Discriminatory Abilities, and Fluid Intelligence.[5] His work has been built on, expanded, and linked to many other factors related to intelligence.
