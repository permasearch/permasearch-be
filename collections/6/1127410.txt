The Nissan Leaf's battery pack is shielded from crash damage by structural steel reinforcement.[123] To prevent shock and fire hazards, the Leaf has a battery safety system that is activated in a crash that involves the airbags. The airbag control unit sends a signal which mechanically disconnects the high voltage from the vehicle.[120]
