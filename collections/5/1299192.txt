With his name clear, Elliot eventually marries Constance, but their decision to reveal to Allison that he is her real father, and that her mother hid that fact from her to protect her from association with a convicted murderer, does not go over too well with a daughter who had a firmly established view of the fictionalized father she had been brought up to believe in. Meanwhile, Norman falls in love with working class girl Rita Jacks (Patricia Morrow), whose mother, Ada (Evelyn Scott), owns the local tavern. They start a relationship, but both are constantly bothered by Rita's aggressive ex-boyfriend Joe Chernak (Don Quine). Steven Cord (James Douglas) arrives in Peyton Place to work with the Peyton/Harrington attorney but slowly reveals an agenda of his own. Claire Morton (Mariette Hartley), the daughter of Dr. Morton and a successful physician in her own right, returns to Peyton Place to end her marriage to a successful but indifferent doctor (Leslie Nielsen) and shows more than a professional interest in Dr. Rossi. Norman and Rita's graduation night is spoiled when Joe tries to assault Rita, who tries to keep it secret. Otherwise, while serving as a co-chaperone, Constance tells Rodney she's changed her mind about him. Elliot is offered the editorship of the Peyton Place Clarion after Matt decides to retire and leave Peyton Place.
