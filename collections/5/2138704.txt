If we are to have a serious article we really need to work on citations. There are all kinds of "authoritative" pronouncements and "things that every martial arts student knows" floating around. What we need is, e.g., a claim from somebody who has reasonable credentials to the effect that such-and-such is asserted in the 23rd chapter of the Nan Jing. We need to cite that, and, ideally, we need to check out the Nan Jing also. _-P0M 01:17, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)~
