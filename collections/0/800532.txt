Critical reaction to the film was largely negative. David Maraniss, author of Barack Obama: The Story, described the film as "preposterous," saying that it is "depressing to have so much fictional, unreported, conspiratorial, unhistorical stuff floating around." Among anti-Obama productions, Maraniss said "This DVD is the worst of the bunch."[3]
