where u is velocity, B is magnetic field, t is time, and     η = 1  /  ( σ μ )   {\displaystyle \eta =1/(\sigma \mu )}   is the magnetic diffusivity with     σ   {\displaystyle \sigma }   electrical conductivity and     μ   {\displaystyle \mu }   permeability.  The ratio of the second term on the right hand side to the first term gives the Magnetic Reynolds number, a dimensionless ratio of advection of magnetic field to diffusion.
