The region was already inhabited by Homo erectus from 1,000,000 years ago during the Middle Pleistocene age.[26] Homo sapiens reached the region by around 45,000 years ago,[27] having moved eastwards from the Indian subcontinent.[28] Homo floresiensis also lived in the area up until 12,000 years ago, when they became extinct.[29] It has been proposed that the Austronesian people, who form the majority of the modern population in Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, East Timor, and the Philippines, may have migrated to Southeast Asia from Taiwan. They arrived in Indonesia around 2000Â BC, and as they spread through the archipelago, they often settled along coastal areas and confined indigenous peoples such as Orang Asli of peninsular Malaysia, Negritos of the Philippines or Papuans of New Guinea to inland regions.[30] Archaeologists refer these people as Deutero-Malays, whom are more advanced in farming techniques and metal knowledge than their indigenous counterpart, the Proto-Malays.[31][32]
