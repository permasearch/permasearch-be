In "St. Patrick's Day", Michael calls Packer, who is at a pub, to inform him that he will be unable to celebrate the holiday with him, because the CEO of Sabre, Jo Bennett, is making the employees at the office stay late. Packer then tells Michael to "hike up your skirt and pull out your tampon, borrow some balls, and come meet me!" Later in the episode, Michael is direct with Jo and tells her that he is allowing his employees to leave and she complies. The employees then go to the pub, where Packer jokingly humps Michael, only for Meredith to start humping Packer for real, much to his pleasure (causing Michael to wonder aloud, "What the hell is going on back there?").[9] This episode marks Packer's first appearance in the series after a three-year-long absence.
