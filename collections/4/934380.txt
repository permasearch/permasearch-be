The train operates every day. At 11:30Â am, the station gates are opened to allow the passengers for the next trip into the vehicle staging area.[15] Here, the vehicles are assigned their number, which is affixed to the driver's door magnetically.[16] The vehicle is typically video surveyed to document any preexisting dents and other damage,[3] in the event a damage claim is later filed. The passengers leave their vehicles here and take their carry-on bags with them into the station to await boarding. The vehicles are then staged near the autorack ramps by size and length for optimal loading order, and are then loaded onto the autoracks. In the case of motorcycles, the owner assists with tying their bikes down to a dedicated motorcycle carrier which is then loaded into the autorack. Passengers do not have access to their vehicles during the trip.[16] Amtrak offers Priority Offloading, a time-saving option that would ensure that when the train reaches Lorton or Sanford, their vehicle would be one of the first 30 vehicles offloaded from the autoracks.[17]
