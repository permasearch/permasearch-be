The section between Topock where US 66 entered Arizona from California via the Red Rock Bridge and Kingman originally followed a steep and winding path past Oatman into the Black Mountains and through Sitgreaves Pass. This section was built across this rough terrain instead of following the more level route to the east adopted by the railroad because the road followed the National Old Trails highway which was for gold mining in Oatman and Goldroad, now a ghost town. It was fraught with hairpin turns and was the steepest along the entire route, so much so that some early travelers, too frightened at the prospect of driving such a potentially dangerous road, hired locals to navigate the winding grade. The section remained as Route 66 until 1952 when it was realigned, bypassing Oatman and running along level ground close to the railroad, from Topock to Kingman through Yucca. The original section of US 66 through Oatman is still open to traffic today as the Oatman Highway and has been designated the Route 66 Historic Back Country Byway by the Bureau of Land Management.[3]
