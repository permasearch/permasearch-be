To make the walk accessible to viewers worldwide, it was held after dark, with the first step coming at 10:16Â p.m. local time (02:16 June 16 UTC).[45][58]  The time was also advantageous to Wallenda, as half of the volume of water going over the Falls is diverted for power generation purposes after dusk.[59] Wallenda wore a microphone for the event which allowed Troffer to talk with him, while the public listened in, throughout the walk.[45]
