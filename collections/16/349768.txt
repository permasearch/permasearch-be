After surgery, Salander is moved to an intensive care ward under guard, accessible only to police, doctors, nurses, and her lawyer, Annika Giannini (who is also Mikael Blomkvist's sister). Zalachenko, whom Salander injured with an axe, is two rooms away. Niedermann, thanks to botched responses from the local law enforcement, is on the run after murdering a police officer, and carjacking and kidnapping a woman during his escape. Niedermann seeks help from his old friends at the outlaw SvavelsjÃ¶ Motorcycle Club, kills the treasurer, and steals 800,000 kronor before disappearing.
