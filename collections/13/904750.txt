The IDF prohibits the growing of facial hair unless a special request form has been filed and approved. The requests can be for religious reasons (full beard only), health reasons (no restrictions on facial hair styles), such as acne and on the grounds of "free will", which means the facial hair (mustache, a goatee or a full beard all of which must be well groomed) has to be part of the soldiers identity and part of his self-esteem. If the request is due to health reasons, it must be approved by the military doctor and lasts up to half a year. if the request is due to religious reasons or "free will" it must be approved by an Adjutant officer and expires only if the soldier shaves his facial hair willingly
