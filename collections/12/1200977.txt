By the end of the 1970s, a strong anti-disco sentiment developed among rock fans and musicians, particularly in the United States.[34][35] Disco was criticized as mindless, consumeristic, overproduced and escapist.[36] The slogans "disco sucks" and "death to disco"[34] became common. Rock artists such as Rod Stewart and David Bowie who added disco elements to their music were accused of being sell outs.[37][38]
