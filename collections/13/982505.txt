While the group's predecessor single, "Wheel of Fortune", was a modest success, "All That She Wants", led Ace of Base to take off internationally. After hearing Swedish top 20 hit "Another Mother" by Kayo, the band decided that this was exactly the sound they wanted to create.[8] In 1991, the group produced a demo version of "All That She Wants", titled "Mr. Ace", which featured different lyrics, Linn on lead vocals, and rap vocals performed by both Jonas and Ulf.[9] The song was initially in major key, but was changed to minor upon Linn Berggren's insistence.[10]
