The International System of Units consists of a set of base units, a set of coherent derived units, and a set of decimal-based multipliers that are used as prefixes.[3]:103–106 Coherent units are derived units that contain no numerical factor other than 1—quantities such as standard gravity and density of water are absent from their definitions. For example: 1 N = 1 kg × 1 m/s2 which says that one newton is the force required to accelerate a mass of one kilogram at one metre per second squared. Since the SI units of mass and acceleration are kilogram and metre per second squared respectively and F ∝ m × a, the units of force (and hence of newtons) is formed by multiplication to give 1 kg⋅m⋅s−2. Since the newton is part of a coherent set of units, the constant of proportionality is 1.
