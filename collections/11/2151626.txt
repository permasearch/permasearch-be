Character names were also localized to use double meanings similarly to the Japanese names;[106] the name puns were based on the characters' personalities or backgrounds, or were visual gags.[108] Several English names were based on their Japanese counterparts, but for some characters the names had to be altered heavily compared to the Japanese versions.[106] Smith and Anderson had a lot of freedom when localizing the names of minor characters in the first game, but discussed the names of the main cast with Capcom. Phoenix's English surname, "Wright", was chosen as his Japanese name, "Naruhodō" – meaning "I see" or "I understand" – was frequently used as a joke in the script.[105]
