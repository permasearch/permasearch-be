On 29 April 2017, immediately after the first round of French presidential elections, the EU27 heads of state accepted negotiating guidelines prepared by Tusk.[104] The guidelines take the view that Article 50 permits a two-phased negotiation, in which the UK first agrees to a financial commitment and to lifelong benefits for EU citizens in Britain, and then negotiations on a future relationship can begin.[105] In the first phase, the EU27 would demand the UK pay a "divorce bill", initially estimated as amounting to £52bn[106] and then, after additional financial demands from Germany, France, and Poland, to £92bn.[107] A report of the European Union Committee of the House of Lords published on 4 March 2017 stated that, if there is no post-Brexit deal at the end of the negotiating period, the UK could withdraw without payment.[108]
