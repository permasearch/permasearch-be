The helium core of a red giant continues to collapse until it is entirely supported by electron degeneracy pressure—a quantum mechanical effect that restricts how closely matter can be compacted. For stars of more than about 0.5 M☉,[59] the core eventually reaches a temperature where it becomes hot enough to burn helium into carbon via the triple alpha process.[60][61] Stars with more than 5–7.5 M☉ can additionally fuse elements with higher atomic numbers.[62][63] For stars with ten or more solar masses, this process can lead to an increasingly dense core that finally collapses, ejecting the star's overlying layers in a Type II supernova explosion,[4] Type Ib supernova or Type Ic supernova.
