In 218 BC, the expeditionary force to Hispania reached Massalia (Marseilles) for a stopover. There was surprise when it was found out that Hannibal was further inland in the area and on his way to Italy. Publius Cornelius Scipio sent 300 cavalry inland for reconnaissance. Hannibal was crossing the River Rhone. He sent 500 Numidian cavalry towards the Romans to ascertain their numbers and their intentions. The two clashed and the Romans won a bloody battle. Hannibal decided to continue his journey to Italy. Publius Cornelius decided to return to Italy to fight Hannibal there and sent his brother, Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus, to Hispania with the bulk of the expeditionary force. Gnaeus landed at Emporion, (Emp√∫ries). He brought all the coastal peoples north of the Ebro to the Roman side by renewing old alliances and forming new ones. He gained a reputation for clemency that helped him gain support from the more warlike inland and mountain tribes. Several strong contingents were recruited among them.[8] Hanno, who was in charge of Carthaginian Hispania, encamped near the Romans and offered battle. Gnaeus Scipio, who preferred to fight the two Carthaginian commanders singly (the other was Hasbrubal Barca) accepted. This was the Battle of Cissa, which was fought near Tarraco (Tarragona. It was a hard fought battle. Hanno was defeated and lost 6,000 men; 2,000 men, including those who were guarding the camp, which was seized, were taken as prisoners. The camp had the baggage left by Hannibal, which was looted.[9] Hanno and Indibilis, the chief of the Ilergetes (a tribe close to the Pyrenees) whom Polybius described as 'despot of all central Iberia and a strenuous supporter of the Carthaginians, were also captured.[10]
