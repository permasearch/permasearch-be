The remaining fall schedule for ABC was announced on November 16, 2015 where it was announced that Grey's Anatomy would air eight episodes in the fall with the fall finale to air on November 19, 2015, just like the rest of ABC's primetime lineup "TGIT" Scandal and How to Get Away with Murder, which was the same last year. The remaining 16 episodes will air after the winter break, beginning on February 11, 2016,[30] and ending on May 19, 2016,[31] as a result of ABC airing the television miniseries Madoff over two nights on February 3â€“4, 2016 in the same time-slot as Grey's Anatomy and Scandal.[32] On March 3, 2016, ABC announced that Grey's Anatomy was renewed for a 13th season.[5]
