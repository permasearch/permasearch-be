On the FreeBSD system console, the Scroll Lock key additionally enables scrolling: after pressing Scroll Lock, one can use Page Up and Page Down to scroll up or down. Pressing Scroll Lock again disables this mode and moves back to the bottom of the output. The Linux console implements this behaviour by using ⇧ Shift+Page Up and ⇧ Shift+Page Down, not requiring Scroll Lock to be active.
