Dan McHale, the animation director of the series, had come to train the artists to do the in -betweens and clean up. He also did the voice over of the character Raj Guru and the theme song for the series. "Though I have done voices before this is the first time I have done the music." McHale explained. P Jayakumar, Director Operations, Toonz Animation, said, "To produce a half-hour animation episode in any of the studios in the United States costs around $300,000 and in an Hollywood Studio it costs around $500,000. While in India it only costs $60,000 to $70,000. The only problem is the quality of animation produced in India is not of international standards even now and many studios fail to make on time delivery. To overcome this problem, Toonz Animation ensures at least 10 percent of their staff has international exposure. These expatriates then train their Indian counterparts. Toonz has been able to curb costs by doing everything here in India, and the 26 episode series of Tenali Raman just cost $50,000 for two 11-minute episodes."[6]
