In April 2008, a resource consent was granted to Neptune Power for the installation of a $10 million experimental underwater tidal stream turbine capable of producing one megawatt. The turbine has been designed in Britain, and will be built in New Zealand. It will be 14 metres (46 ft) in diameter and constructed of carbon fibre. It will be placed in 80 metres (260 ft) of water, 4.5 kilometres (2.8 mi) due south of Sinclair Head, in waters known as the “Karori rip”. Power from the turbine will be brought ashore at the Island Bay substation. The turbine is a pilot, and will be sited in slower tides for testing. Neptune hopes to generate power from the unit by 2010. The company claims there is enough tidal movement in Cook Strait to generate 12 GW of power, more than one-and-a-half times New Zealand's current requirements.[15][16][17][18] In practice, only some of this energy could be harnessed.[19] As of October 2016 the Neptune Power website is a placeholder with no further announcements.
