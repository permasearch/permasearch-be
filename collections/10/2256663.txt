The Disney adaptations also develop his personality further, expanding the original organized character into a control freak with a short temper, although his care for his friends remains.  The film character's willingness to do things by the book appeared in Pooh's Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin, in which he consistently follows written instructions for fear of being unable to think well for himself, although he later produces a competent plan.  Despite occasional malevolent behavior, he always learns from his wrongdoing; while a leading character in the film Springtime with Roo, he abandons his selfishness after considering the possibility that it will drive all of the other characters away from the forest.
