President Reagan professed that he was unaware of the plot's existence. He opened his own investigation and appointed two Republicans and one Democrat (John Tower, Brent Scowcroft and Edmund Muskie, known as the "Tower Commission") to investigate the scandal. The commission could not find direct evidence that Reagan had prior knowledge of the program, but criticized him heavily for his disengagement from managing his staff, making the diversion of funds possible.[254] A separate report by Congress concluded that "If the president did not know what his national security advisers were doing, he should have."[254] Reagan's popularity declined from 67% to 46% in less than a week, the greatest and quickest decline ever for a president.[255] The scandal resulted in fourteen indictments within Reagan's staff, and eleven convictions.[256]
