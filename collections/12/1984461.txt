On 25 March 1971, West Pakistan began a civil war to subdue the democratic victory of East Pakistanis. This began the war between the Pakistani military and the Mukhti Bahini resistance fighters. In November 1971, General Yahya Khan ordered Pakistan Army Corps of Military Police to arrest both Bhutto and Rehman, and he ordered action against East Pakistan's military government. The resulting refugee crisis led to the intervention by India, eventually leading to the surrender of the Pakistani Army. East Pakistan suffered a genocide of its Bengali population.
