The title of physician associate is not a protected medical profession. Hence, even if a PA has been trained in pharmacology and IRMER[17] (ability to request radiology imaging – X-rays), they are not able to prescribe or request imaging.[18] At present, there is no regulatory body for PAs, such as the General Medical Council (GMC) for doctors. Since June 2010, physician associates have been able to obtain membership of the Managed Voluntary Register (MVR) for physician associates.[19] This database, run by PAs for PAs, aims to identify all qualified PAs who are able to practise in the United Kingdom. It is intended to maintain high standards in the UK.[20] To remain on the register, physician associates in the United Kingdom are required to re-certify every 5–6 years[21] and maintain up-to-date practice through attendance of training accumulating CPD hours (continuous professional development), which need to be completed on an annual basis.
