Taxila was a centre of learning and is considered by some to have been one of the earliest universities in the world.[8][9][10][11] Others do not consider it a university in the modern sense, in that the teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges, and there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in Taxila,[12] in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India.[7][13][14]
