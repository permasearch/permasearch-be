In mid-2001, the Xeon brand was introduced ("Pentium" was dropped from the name). The initial variant that used the new NetBurst microarchitecture, "Foster", was slightly different from the desktop Pentium 4 ("Willamette"). It was a decent[clarification needed] chip for workstations, but for server applications it was almost always outperformed by the older Cascades cores with a 2 MB L2 cache and AMD's Athlon MP[example  needed]. Combined with the need to use expensive Rambus Dynamic RAM, the Foster's sales were somewhat unimpressive[example  needed].
