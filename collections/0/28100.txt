Following Barry Hearn's takeover of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, the Grand Prix was reformatted and renamed to World Open.[1] The event gave a chance for amateurs to play alongside professionals.[2] The amateurs had to win 3 matches to qualify for the main draw.[3] On 9 January 2012 it was announced, that the World Open would be held in the next five years in Haikou on the Hainan Island.[4] In November 2014, it was announced that the tournament would not be held in the 2014/2015 season after the contract with the promoter was not renewed and a new venue was not found in time.[5] The event returned in the 2016/2017 season.[6]
