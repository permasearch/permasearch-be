English musician Neil Innes sued the band claiming the song borrowed portions of his song "How Sweet to Be an Idiot". Innes and Oasis settled a plagiarism lawsuit and Innes received songwriting credit.[8] The portion of the melodic line in question accompanies the lyrics "I'm free to be whatever I" of the Gallagher version.
