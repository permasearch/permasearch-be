On the 18th June 2017 team 'Highway One to Hell’ set a new world record for a complete lap of Australia[5]. While there have been previous attempts (notably Motor Magazine's 2004 record of 6 days, 8 hours and 52 minutes[6]) which skipped inland direct to Mt Isa, the 'Highway One to Hell’ team traveled the entire route of Highway 1 (equaling 14280km) in 5 days, 13 hours and 43 minutes[7].
