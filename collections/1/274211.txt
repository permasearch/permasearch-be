In his memoirs, Wagner revealed he has had affairs with Yvonne De Carlo, Joan Crawford, Elizabeth Taylor, Anita Ekberg, Shirley Anne Field, Lori Nelson and Joan Collins.[17] He had a four-year romantic relationship with Barbara Stanwyck after they acted together in the movie Titanic (1953).[18] Because of the age difference – he was 22, she was 45 – they kept the affair secret in order to avoid damage to their careers.[19]
