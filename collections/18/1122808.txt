The medical use of cannabis is legal (with a doctor's recommendation) in 31 states, the District of Columbia, and the territories of Guam and Puerto Rico.[2]  Fifteen other states have laws that limit THC content, for the purpose of allowing access to products that are rich in cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive component of cannabis.[2]  Although cannabis remains a Schedule I drug, the Rohrabacherâ€“Farr amendment prohibits federal prosecution of individuals complying with state medical cannabis laws.[3]
