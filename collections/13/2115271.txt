Sisera, despite falling from his chariot, was among the Canaanites to escape the battle. Barak was determined not to let them get far, however, and pursued them so thoroughly that, among the Canaanites, "not even one man" survived. Sisera staggered into the tent of Yael, wife of Heber the Kenite, and begged for protection, as the Kenites were not at war with the Hazor Canaanites.[2] Yael hid Sisera and gave him some milk to drink and killed him shortly after by knocking a tent peg through his skull after he had fallen asleep. Thus, when Barak arrived in pursuit of Sisera, he found that Deborah's prophecy had been fulfilled.
