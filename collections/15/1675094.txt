The Cure's in-house design company "Parched Art" (Porl Thompson and Andy Vella) created the album cover for the Cure's The Head on the Door using a manipulated photograph of Janet taken by Porl.[201][202] During the mid-1980s, Janet gave up a professional career as a pianist to spend more time with Porl and the Cure,[192] and the couple were married in March 1988.[203] Janet is also credited with having taught Robert's guitar technician Perry Bamonte to play piano while the Cure were recording Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, prior to Bamonte joining the group as keyboardist in 1990.[204]
