Canadian Tire money, officially Canadian Tire 'money',[1] (CTM) is a loyalty program operated by the Canadian retail chain Canadian Tire. It consists of coupons, issued by the company, which resembles real banknotes. It can be used as scrip in Canadian Tire stores, but is not considered a private currency. The notes are printed on paper similar to what Canadian currency was printed on when they were printed on real paper, and were jointly produced by two of the countryâ€™s long-established security printers, British American Banknote Company (BABN) and Canadian Bank Note Company (CBN).[2] Some privately owned businesses in Canada accept CTM as payment (see history below), since the owners of many such businesses shop at Canadian Tire. In Canadian Tire stores, CTM is accepted for Canadian money at par.
