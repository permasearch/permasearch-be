The head drill instructor is called the "Senior Drill Instructor" (SDI) and must be addressed as such by recruits and drill instructors alike. Often referred to simply as "Seniors", the SDIs often bond with the recruits and ensure that the DIs do not push recruits beyond unnecessary barriers or violate regulations.[citation needed] Senior Drill Instructors are usually a Staff Sergeant or higher and are distinguished by wearing a black leather duty belt (whereas other drill instructors wear wide green webbed duty belts).
