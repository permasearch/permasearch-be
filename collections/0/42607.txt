The common myna/Indian mynah (Acridotheres tristis), sometimes spelled mynah, also sometimes known as "Indian myna",[2] is a member of the family Sturnidae (starlings and mynas) native to Asia. An omnivorous open woodland bird with a strong territorial instinct, the myna has adapted extremely well to urban environments.
