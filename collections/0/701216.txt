On January 28, the Browns hired Andrew Berry - a longtime scout with the Indianapolis Colts - as VP of Personnel. Berry, being a Harvard alumnus like DePodesta and Sashi Brown, has been noted as furthering the Browns new analytic approach, and the trio has been dubbed as the "Harvard Connection" (and other similar monikers) by local and national media.[159][160] On March 4, team president Alex Scheiner announced he would be stepping down from his post effective March 31, and would remain with the team as a consultant for the rest of the year.[161] With this move, Paul DePodesta essentially became the top ranked executive of the team in his role as Chief Strategy Officer.[162] This makes DePodesta the fourth different top executive of the team under the Haslams' ownership. On March 11, following two seasons of inconsistent play on the field and numerous highly publicized incidents off the field, the Browns waived quarterback Johnny Manziel.[163] On March 24, the Browns signed quarterback Robert Griffin III to a two-year contract.[164]
