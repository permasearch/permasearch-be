Guidelines and position statements are important on Wikipedia because they present recommended practice. They're not necessarily the best sources for statements of fact, but are nearly always relevant when they convey information of recommended treatment and clinical practice. These sources may be biased, but individual editors should not try to assess this themselves. If reliable sources express concerns of bias this can be included in an article, but never omit a source or add extra qualifiers to a statement based on original claims or low quality sources claiming bias.
