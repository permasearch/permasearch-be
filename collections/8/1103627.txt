Balance training in stroke patients has been supported in the literature.[9][11] Methods commonly used and proven to be effective for this population include sitting or standing balance practice with various progressions including reaching, variations in base of support, use of tilt boards, gait training varying speed, and stair climbing exercises.[9] Another method to improve balance is perturbation training, which is an external force applied to a person's center of mass in an attempt to move it from the base of support.[12] The type of training should be determined by a physiotherapist and will depend on the nature and severity of the stroke, stage of recovery, and the patientâ€™s abilities and impairments after the stroke.
