Allen rejected plans for a retractable roof during the early stages of the stadium's design. The lack of a retractable roof made it open to the elements, provided better views, and reduced the total cost of the project.[31] The roof, at 200,000 sq ft (19,000 m2),[36] covers 70% of the seats but leaves the field open.[27] The roof spans 720 ft (220 m) between concrete pylon supports at the north and south ends of the stadium. Its two expansive sections are held from below by trusses.[37] From above, two arches with additional supports rise 200 ft (61 m) over the field.[36] Post-tensioned cables were used to achieve its final shape and positioning.[38] To minimize damage in the event of an earthquake, the roof has a friction pendulum damper system. This disconnects the roof from the support pylons so that it can move independently of the structure. The technology had never been applied to a large-scale roof before CenturyLink Field.[30]
