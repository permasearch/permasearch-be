Page and Brin originally nicknamed their new search engine "BackRub", because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site.[11][12][13] Eventually, they changed the name to Google; the name of the search engine originated from a misspelling of the word "googol",[14][15] the number 1 followed by 100 zeros, which was picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information.[16] Originally, Google ran under Stanford University's website, with the domains google.stanford.edu and z.stanford.edu.[17][18]
