The term "efficiency-wages" (or rather "efficiency-earnings") has been introduced by Alfred Marshall to denote the wage per efficiency unit of labor.[2] Marshallian efficiency wages would make employers pay different wages to workers who are of different efficiency, such that the employer would be indifferent between more efficient workers and less efficient workers. The modern use of the term is quite different and refers to the idea that higher wages may increase the efficiency of the workers by various channels, making it worthwhile for the employers to offer wages that exceed a market-clearing level.
