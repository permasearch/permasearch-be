The story begins with Kendra and Seth visiting their grandparents in Connecticut while their parents take a 17-day cruise. At first the siblings entertain themselves with an attic full of interesting books and toys, and a pond-like swimming pool surrounded by hummingbirds, brightly colored-butterflies and exotic dragonflies. But soon their attentions wander to the forbidden forest that surrounds their grandparent's house. When Kendra discovers a book entitled Journal of Secrets and follows the directions to "Drink the milk" a whole new hidden and amazing world is revealed to the siblings at Fablehaven. Kendra and Seth find out quickly how dangerous this new magical environment is when rules are broken, thrusting them into the middle of a fight for their lives.
