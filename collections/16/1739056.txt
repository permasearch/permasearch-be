A First National/Warner Bros. horror and mystery film from 1932. Doctor X is a mystery-horror film with tongue-in-cheek comedic elements. In the film, there has been a series of pathological murders that have taken place over a series of months in New York City. The murders always take place at night, under the light of a full moon. Furthermore, each body has been cannibalized after the murder has taken place. Witnesses to the events describe a horribly disfigured "monster" as the killer. The police, a reporter, and the scientist named in the title investigate the murders throughout the film.[7]
