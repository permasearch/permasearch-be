Unlike the military and allowing for regional variations, addressing a police sergeant as "sarge" is not always seen as incorrect. Additionally in some forces (especially the Metropolitan Police) sergeants are referred to as "skippers" and again allowing for regional variations, context and expectations it is not necessarily wrong for a constable to address his/her sergeant as "skip" or "skipper".
