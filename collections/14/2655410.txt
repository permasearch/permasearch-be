Despite his hatred for Archer, Barry agreed to a mission to rescue him from the KGB. After successfully freeing Archer from prison, their situation deteriorated, culminating in Archer allowing Barry to fall from a fire escape. Barry's previously injured leg is amputated by Russian doctors as a result. However, the KGB turns Barry into a cyborg to use as an assassin against Katya Kazanova, a KGB agent in love with Archer and who defected to ISIS. Instead, Barry goes rogue and attempts to kill Archer, an act that becomes his primary obsession. Katya sacrifices herself at their wedding to save Archer's life. Allowing Archer to suffer in emotional turmoil, Barry later usurps Nikolai Jakov, who is potentially Archer's father, as head of the KGB. He then kills Jakov in an explosion, which prevents a paternity test from ever being performed, further affecting Archer emotionally. After Katya is revived as a cyborg by Dr. Krieger, Barry returns to kill Archer and Katya at their second attempt at marriage, only for the fight between the two cyborgs devolve into a sexual encounter, ending Archer's engagement once again. Against Katya's wishes, Barry again attempts to kill Archer on a space station, resulting in Barry becoming stranded in space, during which time Katya takes over as head of the KGB. Upon returning to Earth, Barry resumes exacting his revenge through sabotaging ISIS professionally due to Katya's insistence that he let Archer live. Once Katya breaks up with him, Barry again attempts to kill Archer, this time at the wedding of Pam's sister, Edie. Pam and Archer manage to defeat Barry, whose human skin is burnt off in a grain elevator fire.
