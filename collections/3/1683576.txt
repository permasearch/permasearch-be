Presley and his wife, meanwhile, had become increasingly distant, barely cohabiting. In 1971, an affair he had with Joyce Bova resulted—unbeknownst to him—in her pregnancy and an abortion.[231] He often raised the possibility of her moving into Graceland, saying that he was likely to leave Priscilla.[232] The Presleys separated on February 23, 1972, after Priscilla disclosed her relationship with Mike Stone, a karate instructor Presley had recommended to her. Priscilla related that when she told him, Presley "grabbed ... and forcefully made love to" her, declaring, "This is how a real man makes love to his woman."[233] She later stated in an interview that she regretted her choice of words in describing the incident, and said it had been an overstatement.[234] Five months later, Presley's new girlfriend, Linda Thompson, a songwriter and one-time Memphis beauty queen, moved in with him.[235] Presley and his wife filed for divorce on August 18.[236] According to Joe Moscheo of the Imperials, the failure of Presley's marriage "was a blow from which he never recovered."[237] At a rare press conference that June, a reporter had asked Presley whether he was satisfied with his image. Presley replied, "Well, the image is one thing and the human being another ... it's very hard to live up to an image."[238]
