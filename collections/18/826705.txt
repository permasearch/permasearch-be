The first Prussian corps to arrive in strength was Bülow's IV Corps. Bülow's objective was Plancenoit, which the Prussians intended to use as a springboard into the rear of the French positions. Blücher intended to secure his right upon the Châteaux Frichermont using the Bois de Paris road.[142] Blücher and Wellington had been exchanging communications since 10:00 and had agreed to this advance on Frichermont if Wellington's centre was under attack.[143][ac] General Bülow noted that the way to Plancenoit lay open and that the time was 16:30.[142]
