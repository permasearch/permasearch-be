Starting from the fifth season of The Voice of Holland,[6] if all the coaches rejected one specific contestant, the losing contestant would leave the stage straight away, without any conversations with the coaches, and the chairs would remain unturned. The format is currently used in some versions like The Voice UK, with the latest debut which is on the fifth season of The Voice of Italy. It was used in the fifth season of the Vocea Rom√¢niei[7] and the fourth to sixth season of The Voice Belgique, but then was abandoned in later seasons.
