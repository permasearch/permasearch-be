The elk rut takes place between the middle of August and the middle of October, depending on the climate in which they live. The elk rut occurs around the same time of year throughout the United States. For example the peak rut in Idaho occurs between September 20 and 25, while the peak rut in New Mexico occurs around September 14.[9] The rut tends to last somewhere between 20 and 45 days.[10] This varies on latitude, for in southern areas spring arrives earlier and fall arrives later giving elk a longer calving season, therefore the rut lasts longer.[9] During the rut elk frequently use areas around fresh water, and tend to bed in heavy timber five to six hours per day.[11]:579 A cow elk will remain in estrus for 12 to 15 hours, if they are not bred during this time frame they will normally have another estrus cycle 18 to 28 days later.[9]
