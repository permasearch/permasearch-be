Accurate time-keeping is necessary for the determination of longitude.[22] As early as 1530, precursors to modern techniques were being explored.[22] However, the most accurate clocks available to these early navigators were water clocks and sand clocks, such as hourglass.[22] Hourglasses were still in use by the Royal Navy of Britain until 1839 for the timing of watches.[22]
