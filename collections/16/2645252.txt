An early attempt to create a Max Steel film occurred in December 2009 when Paramount Pictures purchased the rights to the franchise.[12] Taylor Lautner was an early choice for the starring role, although he would later drop out due to commitment to the Stretch Armstrong film.[13] In January 2013, production was suspended when Max Steel was developed into a television series of the same name in 2013.[14] In August 2013, plans for a new film adaptation resumed with Mattel partnering with Dolphin Entertainment to fund the film.[4]
