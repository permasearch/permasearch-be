An expedition commanded by Pizarro and his brothers explored south from what is today Panama, reaching Inca territory by 1526.[76] After one more expedition in 1529, Pizarro received royal approval to conquer the region and be its viceroy. The approval read: "In July 1529 the queen of Spain signed a charter allowing Pizarro to conquer the Incas. Pizarro was named governor and captain of all conquests in New Castile"[77] The Viceroyalty of Peru was established in 1542, encompassing all Spanish holdings in South America.
