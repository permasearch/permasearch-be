Warrior and the WWF engaged in a series of lawsuits and legal actions in 1996 and 1998,[115] where both parties sought a declaration that they owned the characters, Warrior and Ultimate Warrior, under both contract and copyright law. The court ruled that Warrior was legally entitled to use the gimmick, costuming, face paint designs, and mannerisms of the "Warrior" character.[116]
