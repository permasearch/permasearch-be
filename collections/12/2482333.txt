There are various ways in which traditional cooking is done, either by using bamboos, roasting sweet potatoes in the open fire or the ground oven style of cooking called "mumu". Vegetable gardening and tending to livestock is very important to the village people as this is their source of wealth and identity. Vegetables and livestock are given as contribution during funerals, marriages and other festivities.
