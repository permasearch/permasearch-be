Brassica napus grows to 100 cm (39 in) high with lower leaves pinnatifid and glaucous[4][5][6] and the upper leaves clasping the stem. The flowers are yellow and about 17 mm (0.67 in) across. B. napus differs from B. nigra, but can be distinguished by the upper leaves which do not clasp the stem, from B. rapa by its smaller petals which are less than 13 mm (0.51 in) across.[5]
