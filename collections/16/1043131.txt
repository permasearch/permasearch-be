The Great Firewall is a form of trade protectionism that has allowed China to grow its own internet giants: Tencent, Alibaba, and Baidu.[4][38]  China has its own version of many foreign web properties, for example: Youku Tudou/Bilibili(YouTube), Sina Weibo (Twitter), Renren (Facebook), WeChat (WhatsApp), Ctrip (Orbitz and others), Zhihu (Quora).[39]  With nearly one quarter of the global internet population (700 million users), the internet behind the GFW can be considered a "parallel universe" to the Internet that exists outside.[5]
