A potential letdown after defeating No.Â 1 Miami the previous week never materialized for the now 2nd ranked Irish, who used a second half onslaught of power running to down the Falcons 41-13.[16]  Coach Holtz admitted he was scared all week of a potential upset of his young Notre Dame squad.[16]  Of main concern was Air Force's wishbone ground attack, which came into Notre Dame Stadium averaging 46 points and 432 rushing yards a game.[16]  Falcons coach Fisher DeBerry's squad had the best ground gaining offense in the nation.[16]  Holtz's fears seemed to be valid during the rain in the first half as Notre Dame only held a 7-point lead at the half.[16]
