With increased road and marine traffic, a bill was introduced in 1961 by State Senator Richard J. Dolwig to fund a new fixed high-level bridge to replace the 1929 lift-bridge.[12] The modern span, which began construction on 17 July 1961,[5] opened for traffic in 1967 at a cost of US$70,000,000 (equivalent to $514,000,000 in 2017).[2] The originally designed upgrade would retain the existing lift span (along with the attendant delays due to passing ship traffic), adding a second deck to the truss spans and widening the existing trestles to four lanes,[13] but the California Toll Bridge Authority added US$30,000,000 (equivalent to $245,700,000 in 2017) to the project budget in September 1961 to replace the existing lift span with a fixed high-level double-deck span,[13] which would have been similar in appearance to the nearby 1956 Richmondâ€“San Rafael Bridge.[14]
