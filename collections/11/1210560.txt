When it was scheduled to become a night race in 1998, broadcast rights changed to CBS, which also at that time covered the Daytona 500. However, the 1998 event was postponed until October due to Florida wildfires. CBS partner TNN broadcast the race live instead. For 1999â€“2000, the race reverted to live broadcast on CBS in primetime. The 2000 race was the last NASCAR race to be broadcast by CBS. Between 2001 and 2006, the race was shared between NBC and Fox (NBC odd years, Fox even years, the opposite of the Daytona 500 coverage).
