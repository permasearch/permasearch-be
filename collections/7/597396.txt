"Dream On" was first played live in Mansfield, Connecticut, at the Shaboo Inn.[4] In a 2011 interview, Tyler reminisced about his father, a Juilliard-trained musician. He recalled lying beneath his dad's piano as a three-year-old listening to him play classical music. "That's where I got that Dream On chordage," he said.[5]
