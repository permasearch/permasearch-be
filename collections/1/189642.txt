Peter returned in December 2000 after leaving the Navy and the collapse of his marriage to Jessica Midgeley, who left him for another man. He accidentally let it be known that Susan had a teenage son, Adam Barlow (Iain De Caestecker), fathered by Mike. Deirdre told Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin), who then told Mike. Susan (now played by Joanna Foster), who had been visiting at the time, attempted to flee when Mike threatened legal action and she was killed in a car crash. Peter was devastated, blaming himself and Deirdre for Susan's death. He started dating barmaid, Shelley Unwin (Sally Lindsay), but when Peter's old Navy friend, Ciaran McCarthy (Keith Duffy), visited, he made a pass at Shelley, causing a temporary rift between the couple. Peter later met florist, Lucy Richards (Katy Carmichael), while buying flowers for Shelley. He was attracted to her and a brief affair occurred but Peter chose to marry Shelley. Lucy, unknown to Peter, hired his stepsister, Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), to work for her, covering her maternity leave. Tracy informed Peter that her employer was pregnant and Peter realised that he was the child's father. He offered to marry Lucy while still engaged to Shelley, promising her that his other relationship was over. Lucy gave birth to a son, Simon (Oscar and Jake Hartley). When she discovered that Peter was still seeing Shelley, she threw him out and banned him from seeing Simon. Peter was torn between his son and Shelley, but eventually married her, thus committing bigamy. When both women discover Peter's secret, Shelley threw him out and the two women temporarily took over his betting shop. Lucy told Peter that she and Simon would immigrate to Australia alone, threatening to expose his crime if he contested her decision. Peter resigned himself to the situation and moved back to Portsmouth.
