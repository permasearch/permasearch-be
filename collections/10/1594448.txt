Many bird species including treepies, bulbuls, babblers, mynahs and crows were noted.[6] In 2010, the first ever bird survey was conducted in the Sathyamangalam forests. A total of 230 species of birds were recorded in the survey.[19] In 2010, a small population of critically endangered Indian vulture (Gyps indicus) and three other species of vultures were discovered to be thriving in the Moyar river valley. 20 nests were sighted and the population was estimated to consist up of 40 adults.[20] Last sighted in the region in the 1970s, the rediscovery of the vulture, a bird rapidly disappearing from India, has been significant.[21] Diclofenac, which caused the decline of vulture population was banned in 2006 and since then, vulture numbers have started to grow back.[22][23]
