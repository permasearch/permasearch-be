Areolar tissue (/əˈriːələr/ or /ˌɛəriˈoʊlər, ˌær-/[2][3]) is a common type of loose connective tissue (and the most widely distributed type of connective tissue in vertebrates). It is so named because its fibers are far enough apart to leave ample open space for interstitial fluid in between (areola is Latin for a "little open space"). It is strong enough to bind different tissue types together, yet soft enough to provide flexibility and cushioning. It exhibits interlacing,[4] loosely organized fibers,[citation needed] abundant blood vessels, and significant empty space filled with interstitial fluid. Many adjacent epithelial tissues (which are avascular) get their nutrients from the interstitial fluid of areolar tissue; the lamina propria is areolar in many body locations. Its fibers run in random directions and are mostly collagenous, but elastic and reticular fibers are also present. Areolar tissue is highly variable in appearance. In many serous membranes, it appears as a loose arrangement of collagenous and elastic fibers, scattered cells of various types; abundant ground substance; numerous blood vessels. In the skin and mucous membranes, it is more compact and sometimes difficult to distinguish from dense irregular connective tissue.
