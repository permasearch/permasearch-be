Beginning in 2011, Alan Gustafson became the crew chief of the No. 24 team. AARP became the primary sponsor for 22 races, partnering with Gordon to form the "Drive to End Hunger" initiative. Pepsi continued its associate sponsor deal, with DuPont scaling back to 14 races as primary sponsor.[25] The new driver-crew chief combination saw a resurgence for Gordon, as he won at Phoenix, Pocono, and Atlanta and finished 8th in points. The following season, Gordon would be hampered by bad luck during most of the regular season. However, a win at Pocono and a 2nd-place finish at Richmond vaulted Gordon into the 2012 Chase. At the Phoenix race, Gordon would tangle with fellow Chase contender Clint Bowyer, intentionally taking him out late in the race after initial contact early on. Gordon was fined $100,000 by NASCAR for the incident, but came back to take his first win in the season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway, the first time a full works Hendrick team had won at the circuit in Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series. It was also final race for DuPont as Gordon's sponsor after 20 years of sponsorship, as a restructuring of DuPont meant the Performance Coatings group that originally sponsored Gordon would be spun off. That spinoff company, Axalta Coating Systems, owned by The Carlyle Group, replaced DuPont as the primary sponsor for the same 14 races.[40]
