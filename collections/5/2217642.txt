The hoax was finally revealed in February 2013, before the series premiered, by which time the video had received seven million views.[19] In an interview with The New York Times, Fielder marveled at how major press outlets had shared the video: "If we were trying to pull an elaborate hoax on the news, I think we could have pushed further. But we werenâ€™t. We found it interesting that people were sharing it without us saying anything."[19] The video currently stands at around ten million views.[18]
