On April 3, 2013, while Carnival Triumph was docked in Mobile, Alabama for repairs following the February 10 fire, strong winds caused the ship to break free from her moorings and strike a moored United States Army Corps of Engineers vessel, Dredge Wheeler, sustaining a 20 ft (6.1 m) gash and railing damage on her stern above the water line before coming to rest against a cargo ship. The U.S. Coast Guard and tug boats responded on the scene. Two workers were in a guard shack on a 65-foot section of dock that also collapsed during the high winds. One was rescued from the water and hospitalized, but the other was recovered dead nine days later. Repairs for the ship were then delayed by ten days, causing cancellation of two more cruises before the ship service on June 13, 2013.[30][31][32][33]
