The synovial membrane of the elbow joint is very extensive.  On the humerus, it extends up from the articular margins and covers the coronoid and radial fossae anteriorly and the olecranon fossa posteriorly.  Distally, it is prolonged down to the neck of the radius and the superior radioulnar joint.  It is supported by the quadrate ligament below the annular ligament where it also forms a fold which gives the head of the radius freedom of movement.[8]
