Jackson believed in the ability of the people to "arrive at right conclusions."[143] They had the right not only to elect but to "instruct their agents & representatives."[144] Office holders should either obey the popular will or resign.[141] He rejected the view of a powerful and independent Supreme Court with binding decisions, arguing that "the Congress, the Executive, and the Court must each or itself be guided by its own opinions of the Constitution."[145] Jackson thought that Supreme Court justices should be made to stand for election, and believed in strict constructionism as the best way to insure democratic rule.[146] He called for term limits on presidents and the abolition of the Electoral College.[147] Jackson "was far ahead of his timesâ€“and maybe even further than this country can ever achieve."[148]
