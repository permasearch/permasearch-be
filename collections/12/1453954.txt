Robert Zubrin, advocate for manned Martian exploration, said "I don't think the business plan closes it. We're going to go to Mars, we need a billion dollars, and we're going to make up the revenue with advertising and media rights and so on. You might be able to make up some of the money that way, but I don't think that anyone who is interested in making money is going to invest on that basis â€“ invest in this really risky proposition, and if you're lucky you'll break even? That doesn't fly."[103] Despite his criticisms, Zubrin became an adviser to Mars One on 10 October 2013.[104]
