Guinea (/ˈɡɪni/ ( listen)), officially the Republic of Guinea (French: République de Guinée), is a country on the western coast of Africa. Formerly known as French Guinea (French: Guinée française), the modern country is sometimes referred to as Guinea-Conakry in order to distinguish it from other parts of the wider region of the same name, such as Guinea-Bissau and Equatorial Guinea.[5][6][7][8] Guinea has a population of 12.4 million and an area of 245,860 square kilometres (94,927 sq mi).[1]
