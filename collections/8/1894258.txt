The monument is built at the center of Monument Circle, a circular, brick-paved street that intersects Meridian and Market streets at the center of downtown Indianapolis. The neoclassical-style obelisk is built of oolitic limestone from the Romana Stone Company quarries in Owen County, Indiana. It rests on a raised foundation measuring 30 feet (9.1 m) in depth, surrounded by pools and fountains.[19][40] Broad stone steps on the north and south sides, each 70 feet (21 m) in length, lead to two terraces at the base of the monument.[40] The obelisk's base measures 52 feet (16 m) in diameter and 12 feet (3.7 m) in diameter near the top, beneath its capital.[27] The obelisk and its crowning figure of Victory measure 284 ft 6 in (86.72 m) tall.[24][31] It is 15 feet (4.6 m) shorter than New York City's Statue of Liberty.[30] Eight stone eagles support the capital, which includes a balcony and a 19-foot (5.8 m) turret to support the Victory statue.[41]
