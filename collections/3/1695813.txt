More recently, expressions have appeared for other groups, like the Lorentz group SO(3, 1),[11] O(4, 2)[12] and SU(2, 2),[13] as well as GL(n, R).[14] The group O(4, 2) is the conformal group of spacetime, SU(2, 2) its simply connected cover (to be precise, the simply connected cover of the connected component SO+(4, 2) of O(4, 2)). The expressions obtained apply to the standard representation of these groups. They require knowledge of (some of) the eigenvalues of the matrix to exponentiate. For SU(2) (and hence for SO(3)), closed expressions have recently been obtained for all irreducible representations, i.e. of any spin.[15]
