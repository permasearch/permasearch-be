Meanwhile, Death decides to take over the Hogfather's job to make people continue to believe in him. Death starts placing presents in stockings, wearing a long red cloak and a beard, and getting in through chimneys instead of walking through walls. Unlike the real Hogfather, he takes children's letters literally. He is also appalled by the idea that poor children should get only cheap gifts (if any), giving a starving child 'life' as a gift.
