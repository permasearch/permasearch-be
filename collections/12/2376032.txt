Among the Dead Sea Scrolls, a number of Aramaic fragments, found in cave 2, discuss eschatological connections to the eating of shewbread, which Matthew Black links with the sacred community meal discussed in a scroll from cave 1 (1QSVI), and the Messianic meal discussed in another scroll in the same cave (1QSall);[39] Professor Black suggests that the Qumran community may have considered their regular bread sharing to be an enactment of the Sabbath division of shewbread at the Jerusalem Temple.[39]
