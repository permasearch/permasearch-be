Molecules with multiple bonds or multiple lone pairs can have orbitals represented in terms of sigma and pi symmetry or equivalent orbitals. The sigma and pi representation of Erich HÃ¼ckel is the more common one compared to the equivalent orbital representation of Linus Pauling. The two have mathematically equivalent total many-electron wave functions, and are related by a unitary transformation of the set of occupied molecular orbitals.
