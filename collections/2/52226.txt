Either way, the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club was formed in 1899, and continued the hunt and "Groundhog Feast", which took place annually in September.[13][14] The "hunt" portion of it became increasingly a ritualized formality, because the practical procurement of meat had to occur well ahead of time for marinating. A drink called the “groundhog punch” was also served.[f][15][16] The flavor has been described as a "cross between pork and chicken".[17] The hunt and feast did not attract enough outside interest, and the practice discontinued.[13]
