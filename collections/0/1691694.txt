The American Association for the Abolition of Involuntary Mental Hospitalization (AAAIMH) was an organization founded in 1970 by Thomas Szasz, George Alexander, and Erving Goffman for the purpose of abolishing involuntary psychiatric intervention, particularly involuntary commitment, against individuals.[16] The founding of the AAAIMH was announced by Szasz in 1971 in the American Journal of Public Health[17] and American Journal of Psychiatry.[18] The association provided legal help to psychiatric patients and published a journal, The Abolitionist.[19] The organization was dissolved in 1980.[19][20]
