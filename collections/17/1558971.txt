The overwhelming sentiment expressed by multiple reviewers was that the remade game executed admirably on traditional MMORPG features and succeeded at addressing the failures of the original version. For Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot, this steadfast implementation of genre fundamentals was his greatest criticismâ€”that "it does not leap over the shoulders of the games that have come before".[123] However, he was quick to praise the quality of the game's writing, a feature highlighted by a number of other critics.[114][123][124][125] USgamer's Pete Davison was particularly enamored by the story and commended the responsiveness of non-player characters to the player's actions as an effective method of worldbuilding.[126] Many reviewers enjoyed the ability to play as multiple classes on a single character, a feature retained from the original release.[114][124][125] Davison remarked that the differing mechanics of each class made them feel unique in their gameplay styles.[126] Daniel Tack of Forbes magazine singled out the crafting minigame as "one of the most interesting and compelling" aspects of the game.[127]
