Born as Peretz Bernstein in Queens, New York City, New York, he spent his grade-school years in Woodmere, Long Island, and moved to Miami, Florida, with his Jewish family during his teens.[4] His father was a jeweler and his mother was an artist who committed suicide when Farrell was three, an event later noted in the Jane's Addiction songs "Then She Did" and "Twisted Tales." According to a Howard Stern interview on June 3, 1997, Farrell believes aliens visit him and he accepts the knowledge and spirituality they bring.
