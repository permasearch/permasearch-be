The city also makes use of technology in law enforcement, allowing citizens to file police reports with the Sheriff's Department through the city's website.[50] These and other programs are reducing response times to law enforcement incidents. In August, 2012, the city also launched the use of a Cessna 172 aircraft equipped with a remote control camera for use in patrolling the city. Initially, aircraft surveillance was carried out in a single ten-hour shift daily, but its use has been expanded to nighttime hours, as well.[51]
