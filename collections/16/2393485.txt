In 2009, Mexico created a regulatory pathway for GM maize,[313] but because Mexico is maize's center of diversity, concerns were raised about GM maize's effects on local strains.[314][315] A 2001 report found Bt maize cross-breeding with conventional maize in Mexico.[316] The data in this paper was later described as originating from an artifact and the publishing journal Nature stated that "the evidence available is not sufficient to justify the publication of the original paper", although it did not retract the paper.[317] A subsequent large-scale study, in 2005, found no evidence of gene flow in Oaxaca.[318] However, other authors claimed to have found evidence of such gene flow.[319]
