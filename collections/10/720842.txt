A common example of this phenomenon is in β-carotene.[11] β-carotene (C40H56)[12] is a conjugated polyene with an orange color and a molecular length of approximately 3.8 nm (though its chain length is only approximately 2.4 nm).[13] Due to β-carotene's high level of conjugation, electrons are dispersed throughout the length of the molecule, allowing one to model it as a one-dimensional particle in a box. β-carotene has 11 carbon-carbon double bonds in conjugation;[12] each of those double bonds contains two π-electrons, therefore β-carotene has 22 π-electrons. With two electrons per energy level, β-carotene can be treated as a particle in a box at energy level n=11.[13] Therefore, the minimum energy needed to excite an electron to the next energy level can be calculated, n=12, as follows[13] (recalling that the mass of an electron is 9.109 × 10−31 kg[14]):
