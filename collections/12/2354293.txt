Amid the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms that followed the collapse of the Tang Dynasty, the Later Liang governor Liu Yan used his base at Panyu to establish a "Great Yue" or "Southern Han" empire, which lasted from 917 to 971. The region enjoyed considerable cultural and economic success in this period. From the 10th to 12th century, there are records that the large foreign communities were not exclusively male, but included "Persian women".[52][53][n 2] Guangzhou was visited by the Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta during his 14th-century journey around the world;[55] he detailed the process by which the Chinese constructed their large ships in the port's shipyards.[56]
