The song opens with Teddy Riley chanting the chorus "All I wanna do is zooma-zoom-zoom-zoom in a poom-poom." Subsequent verses are rapped by Aqil Davidson, Teddy Riley, and Markell Riley. Teddy Riley's verse is notable for being written by his young protégé Pharrell Williams, later to achieve fame as a member of The Neptunes and a solo artist. It was rumored that Pharrell, along with fellow future-Neptune Chad Hugo, contributed additional production work, but producer Ty Fyffe stated in a 2011 interview that he and Teddy Riley alone produced the song and that Pharrell's only contribution was lyrical.[4]
