It was 5 p.m. at Mount Vernon on April 14, 1789, when Washington received official notification that he had been unanimously selected by the Electoral College to be the nation's first president. The letter had been sent by Senator John Langdon of New Hampshire, the first president pro tempore of the United States Senate, who had presided over the counting of the electoral votes. Washington replied immediately, and set off in the morning two days later,[5] accompanied by David Humphreys and a Mr. Thomson,[6] who was the Messenger appointed by the Senate, that delivered to General Washington the letter containing the news of his election.[7]
