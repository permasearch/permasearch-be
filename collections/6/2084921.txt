On 23 August 2010, HSBC made an offer to buy up to 70% of Nedbank in a deal worth R49.9 billion (US$6.8 billion). If the South African government had approved the deal and it had gone through, the buyout would have given HSBC a strong foothold in Africa's financial services sector.[4] On 15 October 2010 HSBC withdrew its offer to Nedbank following the expiration of the agreed exclusivity period. If the deal had gone through it could have been worth an estimated R45 billion.[5]
