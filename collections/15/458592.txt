A meeting of the Cauvery River Authority was called on 27 August 2002 but the Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalitha walked out of the meeting.  The focus now shifted to the Supreme Court which ordered Karnataka to release 1.25 TMC of water every day unless the Cauvery River Authority revised it.  Karnataka was forced to release water but pressed for another meeting of the Cauvery River Authority which was fixed for 8 September.  The Tamil Nadu Chief Minister this time boycotted the meet citing insufficient notice as the reason.  A minister from her cabinet, however represented Tamil Nadu. The Cauvery River Authority revised the Court's order from 1.25 TMC to 0.8 TMC per day.
