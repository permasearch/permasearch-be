The decision to treat is based on a belief that the child will be disabled by being extremely short as an adult, so that the risks of treatment (including sudden death[5]) will outweigh the risks of not treating the symptom of short stature.  Although short children commonly report being teased about their height, most adults who are very short are not physically or psychologically disabled by their height.[5] However, there is some evidence to suggest that there is an inverse linear relationship with height and with risk of suicide.[6]
