In the season-six premiere, "Jack Bares All", Cindy announced that she was moving out of the apartment to attend UCLA. Her replacement would be Terri Alden, a nurse. Producers of the show were seeking a permanent third roommate and were not confident with Jenilee Harrison in that role. Cindy did, however, continue to make appearances on the show during the sixth season, and was retained as a supporting character (and given cast billing credit). She has many pivotal appearances through midseason, and becomes the trio's part-time housekeeper in the episode "Maid to Order", but still hung out with the trio.
