CTCSS tones are standardized by the EIA/TIA. The full list of the tones can be found in their original standard RS-220A,[2] and the more recent EIA/TIA-603D Standard;[3] the CTCSS tones also may be listed in manufacturers instruction, maintenance or operational manuals. Some systems use non-standard tones.[4] The NATO Military radios use 150.0 Hz, and this can be found in the user manuals for the radios. Some areas do not use certain tones. For example, the tone of 100.0 Hz is avoided in the United Kingdom since this is twice the UK mains power line frequency; an inadequately smoothed power supply may cause unwanted squelch opening (this is true in many other areas that use 50 Hz power). Squelch tones typically come from one of three series as listed below along with the two character PL code used by Motorola to identify tones. The most common set of supported squelch tones is a set of 38 tones including all tones with Motorola PL codes, except for the tones WZ, 8Z, 9Z, and 0Z (zero-Z).[5] The lowest series has adjacent tones that are roughly in the harmonic ratio of 20.05 to 1 (≈1.035265), while the other two series have adjacent tones roughly in the ratio of 100.015 to 1 (≈1.035142). An example technical description can be found in a Philips technical information sheet about their CTCSS products.[6]
