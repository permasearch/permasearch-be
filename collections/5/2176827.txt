The aircraft's designers built a rocket plane after considering alternatives. Turbojets could not achieve the required performance at high altitude. An aircraft with both turbojet and rocket engines would be too large and complex.[7] The X-1 was, in principle, a "bullet with wings", its shape closely resembling a Browning .50-caliber (12.7Â mm) machine gun bullet, known to be stable in supersonic flight.[9] The shape was followed to the extent of seating its pilot behind a sloped, framed window inside a confined cockpit in the nose, with no ejection seat.
