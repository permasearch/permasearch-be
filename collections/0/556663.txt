The song opens with a saxophone sample that introduces the repetitive hook, where the group sings repeatedly the phrase "Give it to me, I'm worth it", backed by heavy bassline and "trappy beats"[19][10][20][12][21] Followed by Kid Ink's rapped verse, Emilee Linder of MTV noted he insists that they "bring it back like they left something".[15] The member Dinah Jane then is introduced, backgrounded with handclaps, Normani Kordei performs the pre-chorus (which is then performed by Ally Brooke after the second verse),[13] while the second verse is sung by Camila Cabello, who delivers the song's most suggestive lines, "Come harder just because/I don't like it, like it too soft/I like it a little rough/Not too much, but maybe just enough".[15][19] According to the sheet music published by Sony Music Publishing at Musicnotes.com, the song is written in the key of C minor and is set in a  44 time signature with a moderate tempo of 100 beats per minute. Fifth Harmony and Kid Ink's vocal range spans from the low note of G3 to the high note of Ab5. The saxophone's melody spans the tonal range of E4 to C6. [22]
