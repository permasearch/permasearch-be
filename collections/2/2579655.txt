In October 1827, Smith and his wife moved from Palmyra to Harmony (now Oakland), Pennsylvania, aided by a relatively prosperous neighbor, Martin Harris.[40] Living near his in-laws, Smith transcribed some characters that he said were engraved on the plates, and then dictated a translation to his wife.[41]
