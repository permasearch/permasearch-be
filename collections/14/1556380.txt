There is very little difference between the top players. Wimbledon champion Doherty was beaten by Irish champ Eaves in Dublin, by Baddeley at the Northern England Championships and by Mahony at the international match, however he has beaten all of them at Wimbledon. Wrenn beats Eaves at the US but loses to Larned in Boston.
