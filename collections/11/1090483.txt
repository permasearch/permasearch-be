Wilde's account suggests that the entire scene was edited into the finished film as a long takeâ€”an idea that has since been corroborated by numerous film historians, including Roger Ebert, who said in his review, "Consider an astonishing unbroken seven-minute take ... Was the shot just a stunt? Not at all; most viewers don't notice it because they're swept along by its flow."[8]
