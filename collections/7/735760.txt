Police Constable Terence "Terry" Hoskins (Christopher Mitchell) appeared in two episodes - May The Force Be With You and To Hull and Back. He works alongside Roy Slater, but doesn't like him. Slater often makes him miss lunch and watch suspects whilst Slater is away. He has a conversation with Del Boy, in which it is revealed Del Boy sold Terry's mother a gas fire. Terry advises Del Boy to tell Slater and make it easier on himself. In To Hull and Back, Terry turns against Slater and hands him into the police force.
