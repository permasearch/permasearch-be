The Federation starship USS Enterprise, following a trail of planets that have been destroyed by unknown means, picks up the automated distress beacon from her sister ship, the USS Constellation and proceed to her location. Upon arrival, they find the Constellation drifting in space, severely damaged and the bridge uninhabitable. Captain Kirk, Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy, Chief Engineer Scott and a damage control team transport to the ship to evaluate her, and in Auxiliary Control discover the only member of the crew still aboard, Commodore Matt Decker, her captain, who is suffering from severe mental trauma.
