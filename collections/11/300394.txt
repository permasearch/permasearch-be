Bill Elliott set the pole position qualifying record on February 9, 1987 when he navigated around the circuit with a 42.782-second lap, which is an average speed of 210.364 miles per hour (338.548 km/h).[3] Since 1988, NASCAR has required teams to install a restrictor plate between the throttle body and the engine. This rule was enacted as an effort to slow the cars speed in response to an accident in which fans suffered minor injuries when Bobby Allison's car blew a tire and crashed at over 200 miles per hour (320 km/h) during a race at Talladega Superspeedway in 1987.[4] Depending upon the sponsor, era, or a specific year, the qualifying races have been referred to as the "Duels" or the "Twins".[5]
