The process saw the Bank of England creating new money for itself, which it then used to purchase assets such as government bonds, secured commercial paper, or corporate bonds.[71] The initial amount stated to be created through this method was £75 billion, although Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling had given permission for up to £150 billion to be created if necessary.[72] It was expected that the process would occur over a period of three months with results only likely in the long term.[70] By 5 November 2009, some £175 billion had been injected using quantitative easing and the effectiveness of the process remained less successful in the long term. In July 2012, the final increase in the asset purchases finance meant QE had peaked at £375 billion, then holding solely UK Government bonds, representing one third of the UK national debt.[73]
