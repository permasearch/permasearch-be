The Impactor section of the spacecraft contains an instrument that is optically identical to the MRI, called the Impactor Targeting Sensor (ITS), but without the filter wheel. Its dual purpose was to sense the Impactor's trajectory, which could then be adjusted up to four times between release and impact, and to image the comet from close range. As the Impactor neared the comet's surface, this camera took high-resolution pictures of the nucleus (as good as 0.2 meters [7.9Â in] per pixel) that were transmitted in real-time to the Flyby spacecraft before it and the Impactor were destroyed. The final image taken by the impactor was snapped only 3.7 seconds before impact.[9]
