Joseph W. Luter Jr. served as Smithfield's chief executive officer (CEO) until his death in 1962.[16] He owned 42 percent of the company when he died.[15] His son, Joseph W. Luter III, was at Wake Forest University at the time and joined Smithfield that year. Working in sales, he borrowed enough to buy a further eight-and-a-half percent of the shares, and in 1966 he became chairman and CEO.[15][16] He told Virginia Living that when he took over Smithfield, the company was killing around 3,000 hogs a day, and when he left in January 1970, the figure was 5,000; the number of employees had risen from 800 to 1,400. In July 1969 he sold the company to Liberty Equities for $20 million; they had asked him to stay on, but in January 1970 they fired him. From then until 1975 he developed a ski resort, Bryce Mountain, in Virginia.[15]
