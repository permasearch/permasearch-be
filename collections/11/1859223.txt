The National Comics/Fawcett Comics rivalry was parodied in "Superduperman",[215] a satirical comic book story by Harvey Kurtzman and Wally Wood in the fourth issue of Mad (April/May 1953).  Superduperman, endowed with muscles on muscles, does battle with Captain Marbles, a Captain Marvel caricature.  Marbles' magic word is "SHAZOOM", which stands for Strength, Health, Aptitude, Zeal, Ox (power of), Ox (power of another), and Money.  In contrast to Captain Marvel's perceived innocence and goodness, Marbles is greedy and money-grubbing, and a master criminal.  Superduperman defeats Marbles by tricking him into hitting himself.
