In Bermuda, payroll tax accounts for over a third of the annual national budget, making it the primary source of government revenue.[5] The tax is paid by employers based on the total remuneration (salary and benefits) paid to all employees, at a standard rate of 14% (though, under certain circumstances, can be as low as 4.75%). Employers are allowed to deduct a small percentage of an employee's pay (around 4%).[6] Another tax, social insurance, is withheld by the employer.
