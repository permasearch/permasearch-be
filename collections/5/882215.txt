June Moone[Note 1] was a freelance artist who was invited to a costume party at an old castle, and stumbled upon a secret chamber where an unknown magical being (later named as Dzamor)[8][Note 2] empowered her to fight an evil presence in the castle. Saying the words "The Enchantress", her appearance changes from blonde-haired June to black-haired and costumed Enchantress and defeats a minotaur creature from a tapestry.[4] Soon after, she defeats a monster at Cape Kennedy[5] and a mirage of a demonic creature manipulated by a crook.[6]
