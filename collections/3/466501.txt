Since the time of Cato, basic pasta dough has been made mostly of wheat flour or semolina,[6] with durum wheat used predominantly in the South of Italy and soft wheat in the North. Regionally other grains have been used, including those from barley, buckwheat, rye, rice, and maize, as well as chestnut and chickpea flours.
