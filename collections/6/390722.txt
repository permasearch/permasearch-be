For the 2017 model year, the one big difference from the redesign in 2015 is the introduction of the GT model, an all-wheel drive (AWD) version of the SXT Plus.[50] The Challenger GT uses the same AWD system and suspension as the Dodge Charger Pursuit. It is available exclusively with the 3.6-Liter V6 Pentastar engine and the 8-speed automatic transmission.
