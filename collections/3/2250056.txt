Kevin is mentioned once more in the season seven episode "Mr. Monk Takes a Punch", when Monk, after learning that he has to pass a physical fitness test to continue his work as a consultant for the police, shows up at a track field dressed in a purple jogging suit. When Natalie asks where he got the suit, Monk reveals that Kevin lent it to him.
