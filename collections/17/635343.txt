Initially, the motive of the rioters was attributed to racial tensions but now they are considered one factor in a larger status quo conflict.[135] Urban sociologist Joel Kotkin agrees, "This wasn't a race riot, it was a class riot."[120] Supporting this is the large misconception that rioters were only African-American; many groups in fact participated. Newsweek reported that "Hispanics and even some whites—men, women and children—mingled with African-Americans."[120] "When residents who lived near Florence and Normandie were asked why they believed riots had occurred in their neighborhoods, they responded of the perceived racist attitudes they had felt throughout their lifetime and empathized with the bitterness the rioters felt.[136] Residents who had respectable jobs, homes, and material items still felt like second-class citizens.[136] A poll by Newsweek asked whether black people charged with crimes were treated more harshly or more leniently and results revealed that 75% of blacks voted more harshly versus 46% of whites.[120]
