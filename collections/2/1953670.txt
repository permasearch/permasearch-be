The list of joints in this subsection does not mention intracranial joints, such are described in the article Cranial kinesis. The concept is not controversial, so it seems strange to me that intracranial joints are not on the list. There ought to be good sources on the subject available to whomever wishes to flesh out the subject with respect to Anatomical. On second thought, is this article about synovial joints only? If so, it ought to make that much clearer.--Quisqualis (talk) 23:16, 12 February 2017 (UTC)
