The FBI kept records on numerous participants in the WLM, both spying on them and infiltrating their organizations.[196] Roberta Sapler, a participant in the movement between 1968 and 1973 in Pittsburgh, wrote an article regarding her attempts to obtain the FBI file kept on her during the period.[197] Similarly, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police spied upon liberationists in Canada,[198] as did the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation surveil WLM groups and participants in Australia.[199] In Germany, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (German: Bundesamt fÃ¼r Verfassungsschutz) kept tabs on activists participating in women's center activities. Merely having lived in a communal housing project or been affiliated with rebellious youth movements made liberationists targets for their meeting places to be searched and materials to be confiscated.[200]
