Santer officially left EastEnders in March 2010, and was replaced by Bryan Kirkwood. Kirkwood's first signing was the reintroduction of characters Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) and Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace),[68] and his first new character was Vanessa Gold, played by ZÃ¶e Lucker.[69] In April and May 2010, Kirkwood axed eight characters from the show,[70][71] Barbara Windsor left her role of Peggy Mitchell, which left a hole in the show, which Kirkwood decided to fill by bringing back Kat and Alfie, which he said would "herald the new era of EastEnders."[72][73] EastEnders started broadcasting in high definition on 25 December 2010.[74] Old sets had to be rebuilt, so The Queen Victoria set was burnt down in a storyline (and in reality) to facilitate this.
