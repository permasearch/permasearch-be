Chemtrail conspiracy theories began to circulate after the United States Air Force (USAF) published a 1996 report about weather modification.[9] Following the report, in the late 1990s the USAF was accused of "spraying the U.S. population with mysterious substances" from aircraft "generating unusual contrail patterns."[5][11] The theories were posted on Internet forums by people including Richard Finke and William Thomas; the theories were also discussed by late-night radio host Art Bell, starting in 1999.[12][7] As the chemtrail conspiracy theory spread, federal officials were flooded with angry calls and letters.[9][2]
