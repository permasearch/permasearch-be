Wally is one of the children given powers from the Titans Project headed by Niles Caulder. Alongside Kole Weathers and Cassie Sandsmark, Wally is one of the first Titans to work for Caulder, even considering him a father. After a struggle with the other experimented children, Vic Stone, Tara Markov, Gar Logan, Tempest, Raven, a repenting Deathstroke and the alien Starfire, Wally turns on Caulder. In this universe, he's takes on the name Impulse instead.[45]
