It was announced 4 September 2012 that she was hospitalized in Germany following a severe bout of food poisoning that lasted for days. Patience fell sick about 10 days earlier, following her hosting of a summit of first ladies from across Africa. Patience was discharged from the Horst Schmidt Klinik in Wiesbaden on 2 October 2012.[13][14] When the national media noticed her unusual disappearance from public view, the approach of her office was to initially deflect attention by denying she was in Germany to utilize the high quality healthcare provision of the country. Her spokesman, Ayo Osinlu, released a statement stating that she had only gone to Germany "to take time off to rest" and not for medical purposes. This was to avoid highlighting the presidential family were avoiding using the low quality healthcare system provided for the Nigerian citizens and prefer higher quality foreign provisions for themselves at taxpayers expense when needed.[15]
