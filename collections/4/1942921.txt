Although Bailey was coming off his worst season, he was released by the Cowboys in a surprise move on September 1,[31] after the team decided to keep Canadian Football League journeyman Brett Maher who although had a solid preseason (including a 57-yard field goal), had never kicked in an NFL regular-season game. Bailey had made his only attempt in the preseason (a 35-yard field goal). The team saved $3.4 million against the salary cap with the move. He leaves the Cowboys as the second most accurate kicker in NFL history (88.2%) and with the club record for career field goals (186).[32]
