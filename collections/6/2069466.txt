A defendant may not expressly waive his rights under the Speedy Trial Act.[12] However, if the trial judge determines that the "ends of justice" served by a continuance outweigh the interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, the delay occasioned by such continuance is excluded from the Act's time limits.[13] The judge must set forth, orally or in writing, his or her reasons for granting the continuance.[14]
