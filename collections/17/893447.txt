The nature of planetary nebulae was unknown until the first spectroscopic observations were made in the mid-19th century. Using a prism to disperse their light, William Huggins was one of the earliest astronomers to study the optical spectra of astronomical objects.[7] On August 29, 1864, Huggins was the first to analyze the spectrum of a planetary nebula when he observed Cat's Eye Nebula.[6] His observations of stars showed that their spectra consisted of a continuum of radiation with many dark lines superimposed. He later found that many nebulous objects such as the Andromeda Nebula (as it was then known) had spectra that were quite similar. Those nebulae were later shown to be collections of stars now called galaxies.
