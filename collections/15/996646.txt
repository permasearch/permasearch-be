Upon encountering the narrator, the little prince asks him to draw a sheep. The narrator first shows him his old picture of the elephant inside the snake, which, to the narrator's surprise, the prince interprets correctly. After three failed attempts at drawing a sheep, the frustrated narrator simply draws a box, claiming that the sheep the prince wants is inside the box. Again, to the narrator's surprise, the prince exclaims that this is exactly the drawing he wanted.
