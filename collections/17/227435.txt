Suigetsu Hozuki (鬼灯水月, Hozuki Suigetsu) is the first member to join. Originally from Kirigakure, his goal is to claim all of the swords wielded by the Seven Swordsmen of the Mist, and from there reform the organization in memory of his late brother Mangetsu, who was a member himself[ch. 523]. Although his dream was initially cut short by Orochimaru, after Sasuke freed him he managed to claim Zabuza's sword, but lost it while battling the Kage. Suigetsu tends to have a sadistic personality, constantly fascinating about cutting things and consequently getting on Karin's nerves, yet sees himself as normal in comparison to most other people. His clan has the ability to turn any part of their body into water, but must stay hydrated to do so[ch. 347]. Suigetsu is voiced by Takashi Kondo in Japanese and by Grant George in the English dub except in Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals, where he is voiced by Todd Haberkorn.
