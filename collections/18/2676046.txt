Subtropical Depression Twenty-two formed from a non-tropical low 450 miles (725 km) southeast of Bermuda on October 8. The system encountered unfavorable conditions, and advisories were discontinued later that night as the system dissipated at 11 p.m. EDT (0300 UTC October 9). The NHC continued to monitor the remnant as it headed towards the east coast of the United States. The extratropical system continued to pull tropical moisture northward (and strengthened to tropical storm intensity)[37] and was, along with Tropical Storm Tammy, a partial cause of severe flooding in New York, New Jersey and New England during early-to-mid-October. The flooding killed 10 people[37] and contributed to the wettest month on record in locales throughout the Northeastern United States.[38]
