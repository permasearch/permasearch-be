The post-First World War years marked a decline in Welsh rugby. An industrial recession struck the principality, and hurt South Wales in particular. Welsh international results in the 1920s mirrored the performance of the economy: of their 42 matches they won only 17, with three drawn.[21] Half-a-million people emigrated from Wales to find work elsewhere during the depression;[22] this included many Welsh rugby union internationals who moved to the professional code of rugby league.[23] Between 1923 and 1928, Wales managed only seven victories â€“ five of them against France. However, even France managed to defeat Wales that decade; achieving their first victory over Wales in 1928.[24] Welsh selection policy reflected the upheavals of the mid-1920s. In 1924, 35 different players were selected for Wales' four matches, with a different captain for each; and only Edward Watkins in the backs and Charlie Pugh in the forwards, playing in all four matches.[21]
