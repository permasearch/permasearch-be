British duvets are sold in steps of 1.5 tog from 4.5 tog (summer) to 16.5 tog (extra-warm). The stated values are minimum, actual values may be up to 3 tog higher. Notice that these tog values assume that there is no duvet cover added that can trap air, and that the sleeper is unclothed. Sleepwear and such other layers can make a significant difference for the lower tog values.
