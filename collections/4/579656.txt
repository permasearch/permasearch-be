In 1982 pianist George Winston included his "Variations on the Kanon by Johann Pachelbel" on his solo piano album December, which has sold over three million copies. That same year, the magazine The New Yorker published a cartoon titled "Prisoner of Pachelbel" in which a prisoner hears over the loudspeaker, "For your listening pleasure, we once again present Pachelbel's Canon."[1]
