The holy book of Islam, the Qur'an, gives many literal descriptions of the condemned in a fiery Hell, contrasting them with the garden-like Paradise (jannah) enjoyed by righteous believers. Suffering in Hell is both physical and spiritual,[79][83] and varies according to the sins of the condemned.[81] In Qur'an, God firmly declared that the majority of mankind and Jinns will be doomed eternally in the fiery Jahannam.[84][85][86]
