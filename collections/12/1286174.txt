Much attention has been given to the special case that the function f is a polynomial, and there are several root-finding algorithms for polynomials. For univariate polynomials of degrees one (linear polynomial) through four (quartic polynomial), there are closed-form solutions which produce all roots. Linear polynomials are easy to solve, but using the quadratic formula to solve quadratic (second degree) equations may require some care to ensure numerical stability. The closed-form solutions for degrees three (cubic polynomial) and four (quartic polynomial) are complicated and require much more care; consequently, numerical methods such as Bairstow's method may be easier to use. Fifth-degree (quintic) and higher-degree polynomials do not have a general algebraic solution according to the Abelâ€“Ruffini theorem (1824, 1799).
