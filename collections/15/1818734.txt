Orville and Wilbur Wright, who made their home in Dayton, had flown for the first time a decade earlier. They were developing aviation in their workshop and the area around Huffman Prairie adjacent to the planned Huffman Dam. They had meticulously documented the flight efforts by using a camera and had an extensive collection of photographic plates. The flood caused water damage in their workshop, creating cracks and blemishes on these photographic plates. Prints made from the plates prior to the flood were better quality than the prints made after the flood.[29] But they made few prints from the glass negatives before 1913 because the Wrights kept evidence of their pioneering work a secret from the public. Those images lost to flood damage were irreplaceable.
