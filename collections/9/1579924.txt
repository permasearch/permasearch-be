The city's three major covered shopping malls are Centre Place (formerly Downtown Plaza)[69] in the CBD, Chartwell Shopping Centre and most recently Te Awa at The Base. After Farmers Hamilton moves from its existing site on corner of Alexandra and Collingwood streets into the redeveloped Centre Place in late 2013,[70] each major mall will have the department store as an anchor tenant.
