In July 2012, it was reported that Andrew Stanton was developing a sequel to Finding Nemo,[16] with Victoria Strouse writing the script and a release date scheduled for 2016.[17] However, the same day the news of a potential sequel broke, Stanton posted a message on his personal Twitter calling into question the accuracy of these reports. The message said, "Didn't you all learn from Chicken Little? Everyone calm down. Don't believe everything you read. Nothing to see here now. #skyisnotfalling."[18] According to a report by The Hollywood Reporter published in August 2012, Ellen DeGeneres was in negotiations to reprise her role of Dory.[19] In September 2012, it was confirmed by Stanton, saying: "What was immediately on the list was writing a second Carter movie. When that went away, everything slid up. I know I'll be accused by more sarcastic people that it's a reaction to Carter not doing well, but only in its timing, but not in its conceit."[20] In February 2013, it was confirmed by the press that Albert Brooks would reprise the role of Marlin in the sequel.[21]
