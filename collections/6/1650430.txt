In December 2015, Old Navy released a series of T-shirts for toddlers with the words "Young Aspiring Artist" on it, but with "artist" crossed out and replaced with either "astronaut" or "teacher". The T-shirt's message angered artists and art enthusiasts,[19] which created the hashtag "#ArtIsACareerToo" on Twitter.[20]
