The recording features musical contributions from only Harrison, Beatles aide Neil Aspinall, and a group of London-based Indian musicians.[5][70] As with his Indian accompanists on "Love You To", Harrison sourced these contributors through the Asian Music Circle in north London.[79] Harrison missed a Beatles recording session to attend one of Shankar's London concerts, an absence that served as part of his preparation for recording "Within You Without You".[6]
