In June 2018, Fox News executives instructed producers to head off inappropriate remarks made on the shows aired by the network by hosts and commentators.[120] The instructions came after a number of Fox News hosts and guests made incendiary comments about  the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant children from their parents.[120] Fox News host Laura Ingraham had likened the child detention centers that the children were in to "summer camps". Guest Corey Lewandowski mocked the story of a 10-year old child with Down's syndrome being separated from her mother; the Fox News host did not address Lewandowski's statement.[120] Guest Ann Coulter falsely claimed that the separated children were "child actors"; the Fox News host did not challenge her claim.[120] In a segment on Trump's alleged use of racial dog whistles, one Fox News contributor told an African-American whom he was debating, "Youâ€™re out of your cotton-picking mind."[120]
