The occurrence of the interchange was first discussed in 1876 by the "father of biogeography", Alfred Russel Wallace.[1][2] Wallace had spent 1848â€“1852 exploring and collecting specimens in the Amazon basin. Others who made significant contributions to understanding the event in the century that followed include Florentino Ameghino, W. D. Matthew, W. B. Scott, Bryan Patterson, George Gaylord Simpson and S. David Webb.[3] The Pliocene timing of the formation of the connection between North and South America was discussed in 1910 by Henry Fairfield Osborn.[4]
