Nationalism is also expressed through the rejection of foreign goods, which was a part of the Swadeshi movement. Sandip was strongly against the sale of foreign goods as Bimala stated that "Sandip laid it down that all foreign articles, together with the demon of foreign influence, must be driven out of our territory" (97). Nikhil on the other hand felt the opposite. He stated that in terms of banishing foreign goods from his Suskar market that he "could not do it" (101) and he refused to "tyrannize" (108). Bimala even pleaded with her husband to "order them to be cleared out!" (108). She also stated that banishing foreign goods "would not be tyranny for selfish gain, but for the sake of the country" (109).
