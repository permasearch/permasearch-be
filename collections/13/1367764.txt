Shooter games have been accused of glorifying and promoting violence and several games have been the cause of notable video game controversies. After school shootings in Erfurt, Emsdetten and Winnenden, German conservative politicians accused violent shooter games, most notably Counter Strike, to incite young gamers to run amok.[6] Several attempts were made to banish the so termed "Killerspiele" (killing games) in Germany and the European Union.[7][8] Shooter games were further criticised when Anders Breivik claimed he used a Call of Duty game to gain target acquisition.[9]
