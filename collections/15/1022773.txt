Eric more than obviously has feelings towards Nell, although it often appears that she doesn't exactly return them. This is often up for debate though, since in the season three episode "Patriot Acts", Nell flirts with Nate (who immediately picks up on her true intentions) in order to get Eric's attention and in "Greed", she avoids the subject of who sent her flowers. One of the bigger signs is when she shows significant signs of jealousy when a new woman has some type of significant relationship with him. This is shown in the episode "Cyber Threat", when she is jealous of Eric's new partner and feels threatened by their relationship, also showing her dislike towards the young woman herself. Also in the episode "Blaze of Glory", when a new college student named Blaze comes to help with an undercover mission and she and Eric show an interest in each other, Nell is seen clearly jealous of the two's growing relationship throughout the episode. She is also visibly disappointed when learning, after the mission, that Eric has made plans to meet up with Blaze and some of her friends in a suite later on.
