Golden eagles are sometimes considered the best fliers among eagles and perhaps among all raptorial birds.[23] They are equipped with broad, long wings with somewhat finger-like indentations on the tips of the wing.[5] Golden eagles are unique among their genus in that they often fly in a slight dihedral, which means the wings are often held in a slight, upturned V-shape.[5] When they need to flap, golden eagles appear at their most laboured, but this is less common than soaring or gliding––.[2] Flapping flight usually consists of 6–8 deep wing-beats, interspersed with 2–3 second glides.[2] While soaring, the wings and tail are held in one plane with the primary tips often spread.[25] A typical, unhurried soaring speed in golden eagles is around 45–52 kilometres per hour (28–32 mph).[26] When hunting or displaying, the golden eagle can glide very fast, reaching speeds of up to 190 kilometres per hour (120 mph).[2][25] When stooping (diving) in the direction of prey or during territorial displays, the eagle holds its legs up against its tail, and holds its wings tight and partially closed against its body. When diving after prey, a golden eagle can reach 240 to 320 kilometres per hour (150 to 200 mph). Although less agile and manoeuvrable, the golden eagle is apparently quite the equal and possibly even the superior of the peregrine falcon’s stooping and gliding speeds.[3][27] This makes the golden eagle one of the two fastest living animals.[10] Although most flight in golden eagles has a clear purpose (e.g., territoriality, hunting), some flights, such as those by solitary birds or between well-established breeding pairs, seem to be play.[3][23][28]
