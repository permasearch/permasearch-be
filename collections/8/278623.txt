Following his impressive drive in Monaco, and a short spell in Formula Two,[28] Pryce was signed by Shadow as replacement for Brian Redman, who had in turn replaced Peter Revson.[29] Pryce made his dÃ©but for the team in the 1974 Dutch Grand Prix. He qualified in 11th position, less than 0.4 seconds slower than his team mate, Jean-Pierre Jarier,[30] who was in his second full season of Formula One competition. Pryce retired on the first lap of the race after a collision with James Hunt at the first corner broke his Shadow DN3's rear suspension.[30] Pryce qualified third in his second Grand Prix for the team, in France, 0.32 seconds slower than Niki Lauda's pole position time but nearly half a second quicker than Jarier.[31] Once again, Pryce's race ended at the first corner, when minor contact with Carlos Reutemann's Brabham deflected Pryce's Shadow into the path of James Hunt.[31] The second collision between the two British drivers in as many races eliminated them both. Later in the season, Pryce received 100 bottles of champagne for finishing fastest in the practice session for the British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch.[32][33] He went on to qualify on the fourth row of the starting grid.
