Don Johnson also designed the Scarab Excel 43 ft, Don Johnson Signature Series (DJSS), and raced a similar one.[61] The Don Johnson Signature Series was powered by twin 650-hp Lamborghini V-12's, which caused some problems to the design of the boat due to their size.[61] Overall the boat cost $300,000 with each engine amounting to between $60–$70,000.[61] His interest in boat racing eventually led Johnson to start his own offshore powerboat racing team, called Team USA.[62] Joining him were Hollywood stars including Kurt Russell and Chuck Norris. Johnson won the Offshore World Cup in 1988 and continued racing into the 1990s.[62]
