Allosaurus had nine vertebrae in the neck, 14 in the back, and five in the sacrum supporting the hips.[16] The number of tail vertebrae is unknown and varied with individual size; James Madsen estimated about 50,[6] while Gregory S. Paul considered that to be too many and suggested 45 or less.[12] There were hollow spaces in the neck and anterior back vertebrae.[6] Such spaces, which are also found in modern theropods (that is, the birds), are interpreted as having held air sacs used in respiration.[17] The rib cage was broad, giving it a barrel chest, especially in comparison to less derived theropods like Ceratosaurus.[18] Allosaurus had gastralia (belly ribs), but these are not common findings,[6] and they may have ossified poorly.[12] In one published case, the gastralia show evidence of injury during life.[19] A furcula (wishbone) was also present, but has only been recognized since 1996; in some cases furculae were confused with gastralia.[19][20] The ilium, the main hip bone, was massive, and the pubic bone had a prominent foot that may have been used for both muscle attachment and as a prop for resting the body on the ground. Madsen noted that in about half of the individuals from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry, independent of size, the pubes had not fused to each other at their foot ends. He suggested that this was a sexual characteristic, with females lacking fused bones to make egg-laying easier.[6] This proposal has not attracted further attention, however.
