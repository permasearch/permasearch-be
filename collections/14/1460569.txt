More than 4,400 square metres (47,000 sq ft) of the museum's 11,200 square metres (121,000 sq ft) is dedicated to exhibits[8] in a series of chronological galleries celebrating the 3.9-billion-year-history of life on Earth. One of the most popular is "Dinosaur Hall", with over 40 mounted dinosaur skeletons, including specimens of Tyrannosaurus rex, Albertosaurus, Stegosaurus and Triceratops.[4] Other exhibits include "Lords of the Land", a gallery of some of the most dangerous theropods known from Alberta, "Burgess Shale", a diorama of dozens of creatures from Yoho National Park in British Columbia;[9] "Devonian Reef", a life-size model of a 375-million-year old reef;[10] the newly renovated "Cretaceous Garden", featuring representatives of the plants that lived in prehistoric Alberta,[11] and "Age of Mammals" and "Ice Ages" which cover mammalian life in the Cenozoic. Dioramas painted by Vladimir Krb. Also on display is the "Triassic Giant", a 1,700 square feet (160 m2) specimen of the world's largest known marine reptile. The 21 metres (69 ft) long ichthyosaur Shastasaurus sikanniensis was recovered from the shores of the Sikanni Chief River in northeastern British Columbia by a team led by Elizabeth Nicholls, former curator of Marine Reptiles. This exhibit pays homage to the work of Nicholls, who died in 2004.[12] In May 2017 the museum displayed an unusually well-preserved nodosaur. [13]
