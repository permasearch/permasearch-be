The Hindu Kush (/kʊʃ, kuːʃ/), also known in Ancient Greek as the Caucasus Indicus (Ancient Greek: Καύκασος Ινδικός) or Paropamisadae (Ancient Greek: Παροπαμισάδαι), in Pashto and Persian as هندوکش‎, is an 800-kilometre-long (500 mi) mountain range that stretches near the Afghan-Pakistan border,[2][3] from central Afghanistan to northern Pakistan. It forms the western section of the Hindu Kush Himalayan Region (HKH).[4][5][6] It divides the valley of the Amu Darya (the ancient Oxus) to the north from the Indus River valley to the south.
