Game 2 of the series featured the Dodgers' Clayton Kershaw off of his Division Series heroics and the Cubs' Kyle Hendricks. Kershaw was dominant from the start, pitching a perfect four innings before giving up a single to Javier Báez. However, the Cubs could get no further. Hendricks also pitched well, allowing a solo home run to Adrian Gonzalez in the top of the second inning. That would be all Kershaw needed as he pitched seven scoreless innings, scattering two hits. Dodgers' closer Kenley Jansen came in the eighth to attempt a six out save. Jansen shut down the Cubs and the Dodgers tied the series at one game apiece heading back to Los Angeles. Cubs batters Addison Russell and Anthony Rizzo continued their struggles, each going 0–3 in the game. Combined, Ben Zobrist, Rizzo, and Russell were 6–60 in the playoffs.[157] The game also marked the Cubs first 1–0 loss in the postseason since Babe Ruth and the Boston Red Sox blanked them in the 1918 World Series opener at Comiskey Park (borrowed by the Cubs because of its larger seating capacity).[158]
