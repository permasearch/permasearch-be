Using cNp has two advantages.  First, the magnitude of the change expressed in cNp is the same whether V1 or V2 is chosen as the reference, since     ln ⁡    V  2    V  1     = − 1 ⋅ ln ⁡    V  1    V  2       {\displaystyle \ln {\frac {V_{2}}{V_{1}}}=-1\cdot \ln {\frac {V_{1}}{V_{2}}}}  .  In contrast,         V  2   −  V  1     V  1     ≈ − 1 ⋅     V  1   −  V  2     V  2       {\displaystyle {\frac {V_{2}-V_{1}}{V_{1}}}\approx -1\cdot {\frac {V_{1}-V_{2}}{V_{2}}}}  , with the approximation error becoming more significant as V2 and V1 diverge.  For example:
