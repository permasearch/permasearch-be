Thematically, the song explores the protagonist's attempts to both strive for better in life while also remaining true to emotional feelings ("when you're feeling down, you should never fake it"). At its climax, Blige asserts that "things will turn out fine" through faith and spirituality. It was composed by Blige, as was the rest of the album, at a dark time in her personal life when she battled drug and alcohol addiction and was engaged in a tumultuous relationship with K-Ci Hailey.
