The Silesian tram network in Poland has two tram roundabouts. In the city centre of Katowice, the tram line passes through the center of the Ziętka Roundabout in a north-south alignment, with a tram stop in the center of the circle.[a] In Będzin, unusually, the tram junction itself forms a circular roundabout, with trams going around the circle; there are tram stops immediately outside the roundabout on each branch.
