Wind speeds as low as 23 knots (43Â km/h) may lead to power outages when tree branches fall and disrupt power lines.[11] Some species of trees are more vulnerable to winds. Trees with shallow roots are more prone to uproot, and brittle trees such as eucalyptus, sea hibiscus, and avocado are more prone to branch damage.[12]
