When Meicoomon appears at the Tokyo International Exhibition Center, the DigiDestined attempt to keep her out of the Real World and trap her in a digital distortion. Meicoomon responds by digivolving into Meicrackmon. Despite T.K.'s attempts to stop him, Patamon digivolves to Angemon and enters the fray, but is overcome by his infection which soon spreads to the other Digimon. When the countdown for the reboot begins, Izzy reveals his countermeasure before the clock strikes zero: the partner Digimon must be placed within a field containing their backup data in order to preserve their memories. As Tentomon struggles with helping the others while fighting off his own infection, he Digivolves into HerculesKabuterimon, captures Meicoomon, and snaps the Digimon out of their infections before using all of his strength to push them back into the distortion before the reboot occurs.
