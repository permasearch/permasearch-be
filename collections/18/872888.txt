For an individual to hold a social position thoroughly and knowledgeably they must be trusted in the[which?] market and reflect it in their behavior. Paul S. Adler says that a review of trends in employment relations, interdivisional relations, and interfirm relations finds evidence suggesting that the effect of growing knowledge-intensity may indeed be a trend toward greater reliance on trust.  He believes the form of trust that is most effective in this context is of a distinctively modern kind - "reflective trust"  - as opposed to traditionalistic, "blind" trust.[12]
