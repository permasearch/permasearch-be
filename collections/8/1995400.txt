Marty speeds up the process by psychically switching on Norenton's hypnosis wheel, then convinces a hypnotised Norenton to invade the Manor House as an animal and a secret agent. Laker is knocked unconscious by the surprisingly powerful Norenton, while Jeff saves himself by convincing Laker's professional killer that his armed double is really him, causing the double to be shot dead as a result. Laker and his henchman are then rounded up by Inspector Large, who demands explanations as he sees the disfigured masked face on the body of Jeff's double on the floor, and Norenton is amusingly left pleading for psychiatric help at the sight of two Jeff Randalls.
