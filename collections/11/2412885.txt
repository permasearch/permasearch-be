However, similar conflicts exist between other countries. Visitors with passport stamp of such countries may have trouble to enter the other countries. Germany allows its citizens to hold several German passports (two or three, in extreme cases up to ten) to circumvent such travel restrictions. However, these additional passports are valid only for a maximum of six years, even if the "main passport" is valid for ten years. Holding a German passport and a foreign passport at the same time, that is, dual citizenship, is restricted under the current German nationality law. Germany allows dual citizenship with other EU countries and Switzerland; dual citizenship with other countries is possible with special permission or if obtained at birth. Dual citizenship is also routinely granted when the other citizenship cannot be renounced or renunciation would be practically impossible.
