In addition to his exceptional shotmaking, Reyes is also widely regarded as the pioneer in the art of "kicking", which is a term used to describe the way in which players escape from a snooker and consequently either landing his/her opponents in a counter-snooker or pocketing the object ball. Reyes also popularized a method of positional play involving the use of multiple rails/cushions to control the speed of the cue ball. He attributes his knowledge of angles and positional play to his mastery of 3-cushion billiards, another popular cue sport variant.
