Economist Larry Summers advocated an approach of focusing on equality of opportunity and not equality of outcomes and that the way to strengthen equal opportunity was to bolster public education.[112] A contrasting report in The Economist criticized efforts to contrast equality of opportunity and equality of outcome as being opposite poles on a hypothetical ethical scale, such that equality of opportunity should be the "highest ideal" while equality of outcome was "evil".[113] Rather, the report argued that any difference between the two types of equality was illusory and that both terms were highly interconnected.[113] According to this argument, wealthier people have greater opportunities––wealth itself can be considered as "distilled opportunity"––and children of wealthier parents have access to better schools, health care, nutrition and so forth.[113] Accordingly, people who endorse equality of opportunity may like the idea of it in principle, yet at the same time they would be unwilling to take the extreme steps or "titanic interventions" necessary to achieve real intergenerational equality.[113] A slightly different view in The Guardian suggested that equality of opportunity was merely a "buzzword" to sidestep the thornier political question of income inequality.[114]
