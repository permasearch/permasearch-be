Charlie prefers to be called Charles Wallace rather than Chuck, as noted in Wind and Planet, but Meg frequently calls him simply Charles. In  A Swiftly Tilting  Planet, he allows Mrs. O'Keefe to call him Chuck, correctly guessing that she is identifying him with someone from her personal past (her brother, as it turns out).
