The 1970s was also when the name "Bollywood" was coined,[22][21] and when the quintessential conventions of commercial Bollywood films were established.[72] Key to this was the emergence of the masala film genre, which combines elements of multiple genres (action, comedy, romance, drama, melodrama, musical). The masala film was pioneered in the early 1970s by filmmaker Nasir Hussain,[73] along with screenwriter duo Salim-Javed,[72] pioneering the Bollywood blockbuster format.[72] Yaadon Ki Baarat (1973), directed by Hussain and written by Salim-Javed, has been identified as the first masala film and the "first" quintessentially "Bollywood" film.[74][72] Salim-Javed went on to write more successful masala films in the 1970s and 1980s.[72] Masala films launched Amitabh Bachchan into the biggest Bollywood movie star of the 1970s and 1980s. A landmark for the masala film genre was Amar Akbar Anthony (1977),[75][74] directed by Manmohan Desai and written by Kader Khan. Manmohan Desai went on to successfully exploit the genre in the 1970s and 1980s.
