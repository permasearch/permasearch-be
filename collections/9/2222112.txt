He is best known as the goalie for the United States in the Miracle on Ice, when the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team defeated the favored Soviet Olympic hockey team. Craig played a key role in one of the landmark moments in United States sports history. In the game against the Soviet Union in the 1980 Winter Olympics, Craig stopped 36 of 39 shots from the Soviet team led by the great Boris Mikhailov and Vladislav Tretiak. Craig's composure was evident in the final moments of the game and allowed the underdog U.S. team to protect their one-goal lead and eventually win 4-3. The U.S. flag that Craig wore after the upset is now displayed at the Sports Museum of America in New York City.[4] Two days later, he again would lead the way to a 4-2 victory over Finland, clinching the gold medal.[2]
