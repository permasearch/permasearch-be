Due to the complete dissociation of strong acids in aqueous solution, the concentration of hydronium ions in the water is equal to the total concentration (ionized and un-ionized) of the acid introduced to solution: [H+] = [A−] = [HA]total and pH = −log[H+]. No acid species stronger than H3O+(aq) can exist in aqueous solution, as any stronger acid is converted to H3O+. The acidity of the stronger acid is said to be leveled to the acidity of hydronium ion.[4]
