Wyatt's stint as Wichita deputy came to a sudden end on April 2, 1876, when Earp took too active an interest in the city marshal's election. According to news accounts, former marshal Bill Smith accused Wyatt of using his office to help hire his brothers as lawmen. Wyatt got into a fistfight with Smith and beat him. Earp was cited and fined $30 for the altercation.[5] The local newspaper described Earp, reporting, "It is but justice to Earp to say he has made an excellent officer." Meagher won the election, but the city council voted against rehiring Earp.[41] His brother James opened a brothel in Dodge City, and Wyatt left Wichita to join him.[23]
