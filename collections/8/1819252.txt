Dance is "a form of cultural representation" that involves not just dancers, but "choreographers, audience members, patrons and impresariosÂ ... coming from all over the globe and from vastly varied time periods."[99] Whether from Africa, Asia or Europe, dance is constantly negotiating the realms of political, social, spiritual and artistic influence."[100] Even though dance traditions may be limited to one cultural group, they all develop. For example, in Africa, there are "Dahomean dances, Hausa dances, Masai dances and so forth."[101] Ballet is an example of a highly developed Western form of dance that moved to the theatres from the French court during the time of Louis XIV, the dancers becoming professional theatrical performers.[102] Some dances, such as the quadrille, a square dance that "emerged during the Napoleonic years in France"[103] and other country dances[104] were once popular at social gatherings like balls,[105][106] but are now rarely performed. On the other hand, many folk dances (such as Scottish Highland dancing and Irish dancing), have evolved into competitions, which by adding to their audiences, has increased their entertainment value. "Irish dance theatre, which sometimes features traditional Irish steps and music, has developed into a major dance form with an international reputation."[107]
