Meanwhile, replacements for Man at the Crossroads were being considered, and Rockefeller Center Inc. approached many artists for possible offers Initially, Picasso showed interest in the commission, but Todd declined the offer because Picasso refused to show a preview of what he was going to paint, and because Picasso would not negotiate from his stated price of $32,000.[62][63] In 1937, Sert agreed to paint the replacement mural for $27,000.[63] The mural, titled American Progress, depicts a vast allegorical scene of men constructing modern America, and contains figures of Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi, and Ralph Waldo Emerson.[64][65] American Progress wraps around the west wall of 30 Rockefeller Plaza's Grand Lobby.[62][65]
