Among the passengers were delegates en route to the 20th International AIDS Conference in Melbourne, including Joep Lange, a former president of the International AIDS Society, which organised the conference.[37] Many initial reports had erroneously indicated that around 100 delegates to the conference were aboard, but this was later revised to six.[38] Also on board were Dutch Senator Willem Witteveen,[39] Australian author Liam Davison,[40] and Malaysian actress Shuba Jay.[41]
