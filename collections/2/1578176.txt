The constant partying took a toll on Thomas and the band.  Thomas concedes that the shows were beginning to suffer.[7]  He gained more than 50 pounds (23Â kg).[15]  The weight gain earned them their first mention in Rolling Stone - an item making fun of Thomas.[16]  The band members decided together that they wanted to be more professional and began cleaning themselves up.  Cocaine use was no longer tolerated.[7]  In 1998, Thomas was named one of People magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People.[4]
