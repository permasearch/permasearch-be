Leptin interacts with six types of receptors (Ob-Raâ€“Ob-Rf, or LepRa-LepRf), which in turn are encoded by a single gene, LEPR.[98]  Ob-Rb is the only receptor isoform that can signal intracellularly via the Jak-Stat and MAPK signal transduction pathways,[99] and is present in hypothalamic nuclei.[100]
