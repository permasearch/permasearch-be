Many stores instruct employees other than those directly involved in theft prevention or security to only confront someone verbally, so as to avoid any possibility of being held liable for injury or unwarranted detention. While this may allow stolen goods to not be recovered, the loss of revenue may be judged to be acceptable in light of the cost of a potential lawsuit or an employee being injured by a fleeing shoplifter.
