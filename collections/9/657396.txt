In July 2014 it was reported that Bon Jovi, Tanenbaum and the Rogers family had joined forces as equal partners to bid on the Bills, with Bon Jovi the proposed controlling owner.[207] Though Tanenbaum and Rogers have significant wealth, it was suggested that the Toronto group's bid was limited by Bon Jovi's resources and his desire to be the controlling partner; NFL regulations require the controlling partner to have a 30% equity stake.[208] Following protests by Buffalo area fans against the Toronto group, including radio stations banning Bon Jovi's music,[209] Bon Jovi wrote a public letter to Bills fans saying that the group's objective was to "make the Bills successful in Buffalo" and committing to work with the government "to identify the best possible site in the Buffalo area for a new stadium".[210] However, it noticeably did not explicitly promise to keep the team in Buffalo.[211] The group planned to meet with developers in the Buffalo region to discuss the construction of a new stadium.[212][213] There was widespread skepticism about the group's intentions to keep the team in Buffalo,[212] with New York Senator Charles E. Schumer stating that the lack of a commitment to do so reinforced his belief that they might move the team.[214] A sports franchise relocation expert quoted as saying that if they did intend to move the club, "I would suggest never saying that publicly" due to the legal implications of selling the team to a group planning on relocating it.[215] The group met with former Bills quarterback Jim Kelly, who had long advocated for the team remaining in Buffalo, about joining their ownership group in a move seen as an attempt to boost their public support,[216][217] but Kelly declined due to concerns about their commitment to Buffalo.[218]
