Young's work has called into question the nature and definition of music.[4] Despite having released very little recorded material throughout his career—much of it currently out of print[5]—Vulture described him as the most influential living composer today.[2] The Observer wrote that his work has had "an utterly profound effect on the last half-century of music."[6] His evolving composition The Well-Tuned Piano, first conceived in 1964, has been characterized as "one of the great achievements of 20th-century music" by The Guardian.[7]
