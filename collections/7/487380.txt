To ensure victory at Hazzard's annual Drag 'N' Fly Derby, Boss Hogg schemes to dispose of the General Lee by hiring Professor Crandall (Walker Edmiston) to hypnotize Luke into believing that the General is no longer roadworthy the next time it breaks down. Boss then orders Rosco to sabotage the General by sneaking on the Duke farm to damage its fuel line, causing another "breakdown." After the General malfunctions; Luke, now under hypnosis, decides to take the General to a local used car dealership to trade it, much to the anger and dismay of Bo and the rest of the Duke family, Bo, Daisy and Uncle Jesse didn't want to get rid of The General Lee because he is part of the family. Boss then buys the General from the dealership and arranges to have it demolished; but while on a call, Cooter notices the unmanned runaway General coasting toward a cliff to meet its would-be doom, but he saves the General by stopping it with his tow truck in the nick of time. Meanwhile, while arguing with Bo, Uncle Jesse, and Daisy; Luke hears Jesse snap his fingers (the sound implemented by Professor Crandall to break Luke's hypnosis), and Luke shows a complete change in his opinions of the General Lee. Bo and Luke make up and then rush to save the day by reclaiming the General Lee, entering it into the derby, and winning it, then The General Lee was saved then the Duke family was happy to have their car back.
