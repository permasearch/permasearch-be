Peanut butter was originally paired with a diverse set of foods, such as pimento, cheese, celery, watercress, and toasted crackers.[2] In a Good Housekeeping article published in May 1896, a recipe "urged homemakers to use a meat grinder to make peanut butter and spread the result on bread." The following month, the culinary magazine Table Talk published a "peanut butter sandwich recipe.[3][4] In the early 1900s, this sandwich was adopted down the class structure as the price of peanut butter dropped. It became popular with children by the 1920s as manufacturers began adding sugar to the peanut butter.[5] Since World War II, both peanut butter and jelly were found on US soldiers' military ration list.[6]
