An extradition plan is passed in the Colombian congress, allowing for narcos to be extradited to the United States when caught. This is a landmark win for Murphy, Peña, and the DEA and a devastating blow to the Medellín cartel. After making successive threats to the Colombian government to repeal the extradition plan, Escobar takes action against Rodrigo Lara Bonilla, the Colombian Minister of Justice and a prominent lawyer in the prosecution of cartel members, by gunning him down in his car. Murphy and Peña are finally making progress when they catch Escobar’s accountant, “Blackbeard”, along with a gigantic cache of incriminating evidence. The evidence is stored in the only place large enough and thought to have security strong enough to thwart any break-in attempts: the Palace of Justice. However, Escobar hires the M-19, his former enemies, to attack the Palace and burn all of the evidence. The DEA is left with nothing after Escobar’s slippery move.
