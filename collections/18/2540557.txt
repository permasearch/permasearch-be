The Day-End Dough-Nation program provides unsold bread and baked goods to local area hunger relief agencies and charities. In 2014, Panera Bread bakery-cafes donated a retail value of approximately $100 million worth of unsold bread and baked goods to local organizations in need. Panera also supports events held by non-profit organizations serving those in need by donating a certificate or fresh bakery products.
