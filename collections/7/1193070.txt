The stage is made entirely of unfinished hinoki, Japanese cypress, with almost no decorative elements. The poet and novelist T≈çson Shimazaki writes that "on the stage of the Noh theatre there are no sets that change with each piece. Neither is there a curtain. There is only a simple panel (kagami-ita) with a painting of a green pine tree. This creates the impression that anything that could provide any shading has been banished. To break such monotony and make something happen is no easy thing."[9]
