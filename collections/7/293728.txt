Manny has inherited his mother's passion for life (although he is terrified of butterflies), though Gloria has also said, "Manny is passionate, just like his father."[19] This causes Manny to be very romantic.[22] Manny is not afraid to take chances, leading him to ask out older girls, and develops a crush on his step-niece Haley, to whom he gave flowers on "Pilot" an even kissed in "Three Turkeys".[22] He idolizes his absentee father, often speaking about him in a positive light, even after being repeatedly disappointed by his father's broken promises. He plays for a football team, fences, and is a skilled chess player. He is often seen wearing or intending to wear his "burgundy dinner jacket." Manny was in the fifth grade in Season 1 and is in the ninth grade in Season 5. Manny and his step-nephew Luke are good friends who each admire the strengths of the other although they spend a lot of scheming against/fighting with each other as well.
