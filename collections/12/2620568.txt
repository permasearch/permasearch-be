There is a challenge regarding the security of the unique sculptures. Also, the temple is getting older so renovation is necessary. The tourist information center has not been managed properly and they have not maintained good records of tourists. The museum is not issuing ticket bills after payments are made by Nepali visitors. Although Changu is only 8 miles east of Kathmandu, bus service is still lacking which means a newly constructed road to Changu has failed to bring in a significant number of tourists.So many tourists willing to come cannot come.There is also the not good facility of restaurants and hotels for tourists to stay.
