An English version of Fist of the Blue Sky was serialized in the now-defunct manga anthology Raijin Comics published by Gutsoon! Entertainment from 2002 to 2004. Four collected volumes were published by Gutsoon under their Raijin Graphic Novels imprint before the company went out of business and ceased publication of all their titles.
