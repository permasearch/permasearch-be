The image to the right showcases a headrest. Headrests like this were used in life to support the head while sleeping. They are also found supporting a mummyâ€™s head in the coffin. This headrest perhaps was made specifically for the tomb, since the offering prayer has been inscribed on the supporting column, although the prayer may have been added after the death of the owner.[5]
