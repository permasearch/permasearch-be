The historic Brahma Sarovar has been renovated with modern facilities and pathways. It is 3600 feet long and 1500 feet broad and is in the shape of perfect rectangular. The tanks are especially crowded during solar eclipse because it is believed that a dip there during the solar eclipse absolves one of all sins. It is considered as one of the largest man-made ponds.[citation needed]
