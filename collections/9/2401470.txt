Mark the Evangelist became the first bishop of the Orthodox Church of Alexandria in about the year 43.[3] At first the church in Alexandria was mainly Greek-speaking. By the end of the 2nd century the scriptures and liturgy had been translated into three local languages. Christianity in Sudan also spread in the early 1st century, and the Nubian churches there were linked to those of Egypt.[4]
