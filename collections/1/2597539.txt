The Hobbit films were produced back to back, like The Lord of the Rings films. Principal photography for The Hobbit films began on 21 March 2011 in New Zealand[21] and ended on 6 July 2012, after 266 days of filming.[22] Pick-ups for An Unexpected Journey were filmed in July 2012 as well.[23] Work on the film was expected to be completed on 26 November, just two days prior to the film's Wellington premiere.[24] Peter Jackson would later comment that Del Toro's sudden exit created problems as he felt he had inadequate preparation time which led to him shooting the films with unfinished scripts and without storyboards [25]
