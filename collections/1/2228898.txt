When the remastered edition of Rumours was released in 2004, "Silver Springs" was included at last, between "Songbird" and "The Chain". The song also appeared on Nicks' compilation album, Crystal Visions - The Very Best of Stevie Nicks. She wrote in the album's liner notes that the song was intended as a gift for her mother, who now refers to it as her "rainy day song", and that the exclusion of the song from Rumours was a source of anger for many years.
