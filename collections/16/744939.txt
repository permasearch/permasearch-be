While Howe and his command conferred, the Hessian artillery on the left opened fire on the hilltop position, where they succeeded in driving the militia into a panicked retreat.  The arrival of McDougall and his brigade helped to rally them, and a defensive line was established, with the militia on the right and the Continentals arrayed along the top of the hill.[20]  Howe finally issued orders, and while most of his army waited, a detachment of British and Hessian troops was sent to take the hill.[23]
