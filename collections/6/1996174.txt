The film's tagline, "Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water...", has become one of the most famous in film history.[32][53] Andrew J. Kuehn, who developed the first film's trailer, is credited with coining the phrase.[7] It has been parodied in numerous films; most notably the tagline of the 1996 feature film adaptation of the television series, Flipper, "This summer it's finally safe to go back in the water."[67]
