The American takeover meant the Philippine Revolution bled into the Philippineâ€“American War, as Filipinos fought for their independence, but U.S. forces, led by military governor General Arthur MacArthur, Jr.[g] had the upper hand by 1900. MacArthur felt the commission was a nuisance, and their mission a quixotic attempt to impose self-government on a people unready for it. The general was forced to co-operate with Taft, as McKinley had given the commission control over the islands' military budget.[24] The commission took executive power in the Philippines on September 1, 1900; on July 4, 1901, Taft became civilian governor. MacArthur, until then the military governor, was relieved by General Adna Chaffee, who was designated only as commander of American forces.[25]
