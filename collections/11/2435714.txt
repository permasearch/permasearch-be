Other than He-Man and Skeletor, the Sorceress of Castle Grayskull is the only character from the original series to make regular appearances, acting as a guide to He-Man. Several other characters are featured in the pilot episode, including King Randor and Queen Marlena, who learn of the dual identity of Prince Adam and He-Man. Teela also makes a later appearance in the series[52][53] Other main characters introduced in this series are He-Man's new allies, the wise sage Master Sebrian, his assistant Mara, and the lead Galactic Guardians Captain Hydron and Flipshot. Other frequently appearing heroic characters included the young shepherd girl Drissi, her little brother Caz, Grot the gardener, councilman Werban, the cyclops Meliac, the Scientists (Alcon, Gepple, Krex and Meldoc) and the remaining Galactic Guardians Sagitar, Tuskador, Spinwit and Artilla, with the final members Kayo, Vizor and Nocturna rarely featuring in the show (although they did appear in the comics and series intro). Skeletor's other allies in Flogg's band of Evil Mutants consisted mainly of Flogg's incompetent second in command Slush-Head, Skeletor's new love interest Crita, and other mutants such as Quakke, Staghorn, B.H., Hoove, Karatti, Optik and Lizorr (with the last few mutants rarely appearing or featuring in the cartoon series).
