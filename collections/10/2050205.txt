Some self-powered hubs do not supply enough power to drive a 500 mA load on every port. For example, many seven port hubs have a 1A power supply, when in fact seven ports could draw a maximum of 7 x 0.5 = 3.5A, plus power for the hub itself. Designers assume the user will most likely connect many low power devices and only one or two requiring a full 500 mA.  On the other hand, the packaging for some self-powered hubs states explicitly how many of the ports can drive a 500 mA full load at once.  For example, the packaging on a seven-port hub might claim to support a maximum of four full-load devices.
