On March 1, 2012 TF Green Airport was given the go-ahead to expand the runway and improve the safety of the secondary runway. The Warwick City Council unanimously voted to approve the expansion, and drop the suit against the RIAC. President Obama signed a bill saying the project will be federally funded. The project will take approximately 2â€“3 years.[33]
