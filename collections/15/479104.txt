Some historians distinguish a field of Islamic criminal law, which combines several traditional categories.[3][51][34] Several crimes with scripturally prescribed punishments are known as hudud.[3] Jurists developed various restrictions which in many cases made them virtually impossible to apply.[3] Other crimes involving intentional bodily harm are judged according to a version of lex talionis that prescribes a punishment analogous to the crime (qisas), but the victims or their heirs may accept a monetary compensation (diya) or pardon the perpetrator instead; only diya is imposed for non-intentional harm.[3][51] Other criminal cases belong to the category of taʿzīr, where the goal of punishment is correction or rehabilitation of the culprit and its form is largely left to the judge's discretion.[3][51] In practice, since early on in Islamic history, criminal cases were usually handled by ruler-administered courts or local police using procedures which were only loosely related to sharia.[4][51]
