Gastropods and cephalopods have paired eyes on their heads (and sometimes tails),[1] but many molluscs do not have clear head regions in which to locate the eyes. Consequently, many molluscs may have a multitude of eyes in more unlikely places, such as along the edge of their shell.[1] Chitons have a dispersed network of tiny eyes over the surface of their shells which may act together as a compound eye.[1] Many gastropods have stalked eyes; the eye can be retracted into the stalk itself in the presence of danger.[1]
