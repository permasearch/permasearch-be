Radiation from the central star heats the gases to temperatures of about 10,000 K.[31] The gas temperature in central regions is usually much higher than at the periphery reaching 16,000–25,000 K.[32] The volume in the vicinity of the central star is often filled with a very hot (coronal) gas having the temperature of about 1,000,000 K. This gas originates from the surface of the central star in the form of the fast stellar wind.[33]
