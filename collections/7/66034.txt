The superheroine subgenre also extensively developed the notion of teams (sentai) of girls working together,[68] like the Sailor Senshi in Sailor Moon, the Magic Knights in Magic Knight Rayearth, and the Mew Mew girls from Mia Ikumi's Tokyo Mew Mew.[69] By today, the superheroine narrative template has been widely used and parodied within the shōjo manga tradition (e.g., Nao Yazawa's Wedding Peach[70] and Hyper Rune by Tamayo Akiyama[71]) and outside that tradition, e.g., in bishōjo comedies like Kanan's Galaxy Angel.[72]
