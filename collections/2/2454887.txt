In 2001, Rhimes wrote Crossroads, the debut film of pop singer Britney Spears.[12] Despite being panned by critics, the film grossed over $60 million worldwide.[13][14] She then moved on to Disney’s sequel to its popular 2001 movie The Princess Diaries. Though 2004's The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (2004) did not score at the box office like its predecessor, Rhimes later said that she treasured the experience if for nothing else – the opportunity to work with its star, Julie Andrews.[7] In 2003, Rhimes wrote her first pilot, about young female globe-trotting war correspondents, for ABC, but the network turned it down.[10][11]
