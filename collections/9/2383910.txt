The two major companies shared peaceful relations between the two iconic tigers. Throughout the time of coexistence the companies combined spent over a billion and a half in advertising in the cereal and petroleum industries.[12] Neither companies faced any issues amongst each other, however, in 1992 this all changed. ExxonMobil opened a new business sector and product line through the promotion of the existing Exxon Tiger.[13] The company failed to expand its federal trademark registration to its newest product line sector.[13] Prior to Exxon's newest business addition of opening convenience stores "Tiger Marts" and selling foods and beverages, the company was cleared of all trademark litigations. After the announcement of ExxonMobil's new product line, Kellogg quickly filed a suit. The latest unnamed tiger Exxon was exploiting to sell food and beverages crossed the trademark boundaries.[13] The confusion of using very similar tigers as a mascot for food products did not sit well with Kellogg.[14] The lawsuit consisted of: trademark infringement and dilution, and seeking an injunction prohibiting the further use of the Exxon tiger.[10] After several court appearances, millions of dollars, different rulings, and years of waiting the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals decision finalized the case.
