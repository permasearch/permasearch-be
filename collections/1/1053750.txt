However, again the problem here is that numerous atheists such as Arthur Schopenhauer, Bertrand Russell, A.C. Grayling and Aristotle who would personally recoil at being labelled "spiritual" or believers in the supernatural would nevertheless still endorse the pursuit of meaning and purpose and personal efforts to transcend the self. Put frankly, those who term themselves spiritual do not have a monopoly on either compassion or civility.[168] Once the views of such humanist philosophers and the results from psychological surveys are accepted, spirituality seems to boil down to a label given to a particular sub-type from among the broader set of compassionate/civil people.
