Under a general change of coordinates the Killing vector transforms as      k  v   =  A  t   v    k  t     {\displaystyle k^{v}=A_{t}^{v}k^{t}}   giving the vectors      k   a ′    = ( 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 )   {\displaystyle k^{a'}=(1,0,0,0)}   and      k   a ′    =  ( − 1 +    2 M  r   , 1 , 0 , 0 )  .   {\displaystyle k_{a'}=\left(-1+{\frac {2M}{r}},1,0,0\right).}
