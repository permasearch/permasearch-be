Security changes in Washington, D.C., after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks significantly affected Old Ebbitt Grill for a while. The restaurant was forced to close for two days when streets near the White House were closed.[119] Over the next two weeks, the restaurant lost half its business (normally 2,000 customers a day, most of them politicians and businesspeople).[120] After First Lady Laura Bush began patronizing the restaurant,[121] business soon returned to normal. The Beltway sniper attacks of fall 2002 did not affect business, which continued to hold steady through February 2003, a time of high alert and anxiety.[122] Due to security restrictions in 2004, Old Ebbitt Grill was nearly prevented from its traditional practice of selling coffee and hot chocolate to spectators watching the inaugural parade, in this case for the landmark election of Barack Obama as President of the United States. That year the Democratic Leadership Council rented the entire restaurant for a private party on Inauguration Day.[123]
