In the season 4 episode, "Un Chien Tangerine", Pam applied to become a field agent. She took the ap test naked (so nobody thinks she would be cheating) and passed it with flying colors. While Malory didn't think Pam could handle herself in actual field work, Pam showed Malory a video where she took on Cyril, Krieger, and Ray who all wore body protection while she was (still) naked, and won. She shadows Lana and Archer as on a mission to The Vatican, during which time she displays an impressive aptitude for learning foreign languages.
