The first social cycle theory in sociology was created by Italian sociologist and economist Vilfredo Pareto (1848â€“1923) in his Trattato di Sociologia Generale (1916). He centered his theory on the concept of an elite social class, which he divided into cunning 'foxes' and violent 'lions'. In his view of society, the power constantly passes from the 'foxes' to the 'lions' and vice versa.
