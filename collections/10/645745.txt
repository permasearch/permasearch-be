For the first nine episodes, the commander of the SIU was Lieutenant A.J. Shimamura (played by Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa in the first two seasons only), a character that was written off after he failed to be promoted to Captain. (The character was said to have returned to his native Hawaii.) Shimamura's departure opened the door for Bridges to be promoted to Captain, and given command of the SIU.
