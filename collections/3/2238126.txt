Brown followed up the strong 2004 season on the field with an extremely successful 2005 recruiting season by securing the top-ranked recruiting class (the 2005 recruiting season is for players entering the University in Fall 2006). With the exception of Cedric Benson, Derrick Johnson, and Bo Scaife, Texas returned most of their key players from 2004–2005, including red-shirt Junior Quarterback Vince Young. The 2005 Texas Longhorns football team was given a pre-season No. 2 ranking (behind defending National Champions University of Southern California) by Sports Illustrated magazine, and was also ranked second in the AP and USA Today coaches' pre-season polls. They maintained those rankings throughout the entire 2005–2006 season.
