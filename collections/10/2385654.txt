GameSpot's Maxwell McGee applauded Dead or Alive 5 for its gameplay system, "impressive" graphics and "outstanding reality" in regards to characters and environments, and did not mind the plot — stating it to be "entertaining in its ridiculousness" — but criticized the game's practice mode and some online features, overall calling it "a dynamic fighter that can be enjoyed by players of all skill types."[83] Andy Hartup of Computer and Video Games called the training modes "absolutely superb", but criticized the game for its "bizarre" story mode and because it "[lacked] the complexity of Street Fighter," summarizing that although DOA5 "isn't perfect", it is "cracking fun, a fighter that's great to watch and feels even better to play."[73] Destructoid's Ian Bonds called it "a delicious surprise" that is "fun without being frustrating, the all-around fighter for everyone. Even the ones who won't admit to enjoying the T&A."[93]
