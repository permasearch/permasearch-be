In 2011, although USC finished in first place in its conference division with a 7-2 record, due to their ineligibility to participate in a bowl game, the UCLA Bruins became champions of the inaugural Pac-12 South Division.[41] In the final regular season game, USC's 50-0 win over UCLA was the largest margin of victory in the rivalry since 1930.
