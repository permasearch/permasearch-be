John Terraine followed Falls in 1963 but did not accept that German losses were as high as 400,000.[159] A. J. P. Taylor in 1972, wrote that Edmonds had performed a "conjuring trick" on the figures and that no one believed these "farcical calculations". Taylor put British wounded and killed at 300,000 and German losses at 200,000.[160] In 1977, Terraine argued that twenty percent needed to be added to the German figures for some lightly wounded men, who would have been included under British casualty definitions, making German casualties 260,400. Terraine refuted Wolff (1958), who despite writing that 448,614 British casualties was the BEF total for the second half of 1917, neglected to deduct 75,681 casualties for the Battle of Cambrai, given in the Official Statistics from which he quoted or "normal wastage", averaging 35,000 per month in "quiet" periods.[161] Prior and Wilson in 1997, gave British losses of 275,000 and German casualties at just under 200,000.[162] In 1997, Hagenlücke gave c. 217,000 German casualties.[57] Sheffield wrote in 2002, that Richard Holmes guessed that both sides suffered 260,000 casualties, which seemed about right.[163]
