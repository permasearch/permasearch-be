In a recent years, antimicrobial stewardship teams in hospitals have encouraged optimal use of antimicrobials.[98] The goals of antimicrobial stewardship are to help practitioners pick the right drug at the right dose and duration of therapy while preventing misuse and minimizing the development of resistance. Stewardship may reduce the length of stay by an average of slightly over 1 day while not increasing the risk of death.[99]
