Nassau County, with its extensive flat land, was the site of many aviation firsts.[45] Military aviators for both World Wars were trained on the Hempstead Plains at installations such as Mitchel Air Force Base, and a number of successful aircraft companies were established. Charles Lindberg took off for Paris from Roosevelt Field in 1927, completing the first non-stop trans-Atlantic flight from the United States. Grumman (which in 1986 employed 23,000 people on Long Island[46]) built many planes for World War II, and later contributed the Apollo Lunar Module to the Space program.[45]
