The music video for "What Makes You Beautiful" was directed by John Urbano. Filmed over two days in July 2011,[66][67] it premiered on 19 August 2011.[68] On each of the five days preceding the video's premiere, One Direction posted a teaser trailer of the video online. Each teaser showed footage from the video and behind the scenes, and one member of the band announcing how many days were left until the video premiere.[69] The video opens with One Direction spending time on a Malibu, California beach intercut with scenes of them driving an orange campervan. During the second verse, a group of three girls joins the band at the beach; in Styles' bridge solo, he intimately sings to one girl, Madison McMillin,[70] individually. During the final choruses the band and girls are shown sitting around a fire, lighting sparklers and taking photographs.[10] On video sharing website MUZU TV, the video was the fourth most-watched music video of 2011 in the UK.[71] The video won two MTV Video Music Awards for Best Pop Video and Most Share-Worthy Video, and earned the group the award for Best New Artist on 6 September 2012.[72] As of April 2018, the music video has received 940 million Vevo and YouTube views.[73]
