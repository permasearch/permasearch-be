The 2007 Georgia Bulldogs are remembered for the "Gator Stomp", a first-quarter mass celebration of the entire Georgia team in the Gators' endzone after Georgia running back Knowshon Moreno's first touchdown, a move that emotionally rallied the underdog Bulldogs.[69] Because of the staged celebration, Georgia received two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties and was forced to kick off from their own 8-yard line.[70] After the game, Georgia coach Mark Richt acknowledged that he ordered his team to draw an excessive celebration penalty after their first touchdown, but intended that only the eleven players on the field would celebrate, not the entire team.[71] The motivational tactic paid off for Richt, as Moreno ran for 188 yards and Georgia's defense sacked Gators quarterback Tim Tebow six times in a 42â€“30 victory.[70] The high-scoring game was the first in series history in which both teams scored thirty or more points.[7]
