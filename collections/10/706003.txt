In 2007, this song was included in the Harmonix music video game Rock Band, exposing Coheed and Cambria to a considerably wider audience. However, the words "whore" and "fucking" were edited to "wolf" and "mucking" respectively.[6] The conclusion of the song was also edited, replacing the fade-out and the strings with a short guitar solo as the player earns the ending bonus points.
