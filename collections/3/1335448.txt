In Norway, the vehicle owner must provide the minimum of liability insurance for his/her vehicle(s) â€“ of any kind. Otherwise, the vehicle is illegal to use. If a person drives a vehicle belonging to someone else, and has an accident, the insurance will cover for damage done. Note that the policy carrier can choose to limit the coverage to only apply for family members or person over a certain age.
