Gallaher was also a national selector from 1907 to 1914,[q] and with George Nicholson co-coached the All Blacks against the 1908 Anglo-Welsh team. A number of Gallaher's team-mates from the 1905â€“06 tour were included in the New Zealand squad for the series; of three Tests, the All Blacks won two and drew the other.[148] During Gallaher's incumbency as a national selector, New Zealand played 50 matches, won 44, lost four and drew two. This included 16 Tests, of which only one was lost and two drawn.[2]
