"Mirrors may be so arranged that we may see whatever we choose and anything in the house or in the street, and everyone looking at those things will see them as if they were real, but when they go to the spot they will find nothing. For the mirrors can be hidden from things in such a way that the images will be in the open and will appear in the air at the intersection of the visual rays and the catheti (perpendicular plane), and therefore those looking at them would run up to the places where they appear and would judge that the objects are there when there is in reality nothing except an image."
