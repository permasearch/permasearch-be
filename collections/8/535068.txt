On July 23, 2014, a video surfaced on YouTube of an unidentified Browns fan desecrating the grave of Modell wearing a Lyle Alzado jersey by urinating on the grave through a catheter, saying in the video that "he had no choice", echoing Modell's comments on moving his team to Baltimore.[39] Baltimore County filed charges for disorderly conduct at the request of Modell's son David Modell once the fan was identified.[40]
