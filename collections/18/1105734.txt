On 20 April, Liverpool mathematically secured their pre-season aim of qualifying for the 2014-15 UEFA Champions League, after winning 2–3 away to Norwich City. They were granted a group stage seat at the same time. However, their title hopes were snatched away after a loss to Chelsea on 27 April and a dramatic draw when Crystal Palace scored three goals in the last ten minutes of the game from 0–3 down. Liverpool finished second on the final day, finishing behind Manchester City by only two points.
