Notes: This episode had a patriotic slant with American flags decorating the cooking stations. The game in the first round, "Shopstacle Course", has only been played in this episode and it involved several piles of boxes and groceries stacked around the store to slow the shoppers down. Joseph won the round 2 culinary quiz so his advantage was getting an extra item that begins with any letter.
