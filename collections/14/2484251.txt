Sales data is compiled by Nielsen SoundScan from a sample that includes music stores, music departments at electronics and stores, Internet sales (both physical and digital) and verifiable sales from concert venues in the United States.[8] Nielsen SoundScan has tracked sales of records in the country since March 1991.[9] SoundScan does not include sales from small retailers without electronic cash registers and nontraditional outlets such as flea markets and drugstores.[10] Prior to the inception of the Top Latin Albums chart, sales of Latin albums were reported by Latin music retailers and distributors and divided into three subcategories: Latin Pop, Tropical/Salsa, and Regional Mexican.[1]
