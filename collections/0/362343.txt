One of the first victims was Northern Rock, a medium-sized British bank.[209] The highly leveraged nature of its business led the bank to request security from the Bank of England. This in turn led to investor panic and a bank run[210] in mid-September 2007. Calls by Liberal Democrat Treasury Spokesman Vince Cable to nationalise the institution were initially ignored; in February 2008, however, the British government (having failed to find a private sector buyer) relented, and the bank was taken into public hands. Northern Rock's problems proved to be an early indication of the troubles that would soon befall other banks and financial institutions.
