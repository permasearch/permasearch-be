The controversy was eventually settled when the city paid substantial additional compensation to the homeowners and agreed to move Keloâ€™s home to a new location.[16]  The land was never deeded back to the original homeowners, most of whom have left New London for nearby communities.[2] Three years after the Supreme Court case was decided, the Kelo house was dedicated after being relocated to 36 Franklin Street, a site close to downtown New London.[17][18] Susette Kelo, however, has moved to a different part of Connecticut.
