A hadith involves two elements: a chain of narrators, called sanad, and the actual wording, called matn. Hadiths can be classified, by studying the narration, as "authentic" or "correct", called Sahih (Arabic: صَحِيْح‎), "good", called Ḥasan (Arabic: حَسَن‎) or "weak", called Ḍaʻīf (Arabic: ضَعِيْف‎) among others. Muhammad al-Bukhari[79] collected over 300,000 hadith, but only included 2,602 distinct hadith that passed veracity tests that codified them as authentic into his book Sahih al-Bukhari,[79] which is considered by Sunnis to be the most authentic source after the Quran.[80][81] Another famous source(s) of hadiths is known as The Four Books, which Shias consider as the most authentic hadith reference.[82][83][84]
