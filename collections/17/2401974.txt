In mid-2012, Middleby Corporation, a publicly traded company engaged in manufacturing commercial foodservice equipment, contacted Carl and made an attractive offer for the company. Approaching the age of 65, Carl consulted with his Stephens partners and, due to timing and the aggressive offer from Middleby, he and his fellow shareholders decided to accept Middleby's offer to acquire Viking. The transaction closed on December 31, 2012.
