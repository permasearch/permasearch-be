During the 1980s, CSPI's campaign "Saturated Fat Attack" advocated the replacement of beef tallow, palm oil and coconut oil at in processed foods and restaurant foods with fats containing less saturated fatty acids,[35] CSPI assumed that trans fats were benign.[36] In a 1986 book entitled "The Fast-Food Guide", it praised chains such as KFC that had converted to partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, which are lower in saturated fat but high in trans fat. As a result of this pressure, many restaurants such as McDonald's made the switch.[35]
