Tom has bought some ad time on television to promote his bait shop, but when Harley sees a commercial her father plans to submit, made eleven years ago, she feels embarrassed over what happened to her in the commercial and does not want everyone to see it. Knowing Ethan's skill as a film maker, Harley proposes to make a new commercial for the shop, but also knowing Ethan's tendency to quit whatever he sets out to do, she is willing to stick with the old commercial should the project fail. To ensure Ethan stays focused, she secretly monitors his filming activity while building a camera rig to use for the final part of the commercial. Difficulties arise while Ethan is filming, including Daphne's being jinxed by Lewie and Beast, Rachel and Suzy's trying to buy Adele concert tickets, and Georgie's looking after her coach's pet parrot Leo. It becomes a huge mess leading Ethan to quit, but Harley talks sense into him about not giving up. Even with the limited footage, Ethan puts together a commercial worthy of airing on television.
