Neal came to New York City in his early twenties. Mozzie saw Neal con a man out of $500 and later approached him about pulling a long con on a CEO named Vincent Adler. For about approximately six months, Neal worked for Adler at Adler Financial Management under the alias Nicholas Halden. It is through Adler that Neal met fellow thief Alexandra "Alex" Hunter when she attempted to steal information from Adler. The two ended up spending the night together after their first encounter. He fell in love with Adler's assistant, Kate Moreau, who eventually became his girlfriend. Before Neal could complete the con, Adler figured out Neal's true identity and his con and ran off with a billion dollars, leaving all of his employees—including Neal and Kate—jobless and broke. Adler left only one dollar in the account Neal was after and a password that was an anagram for "Nice Try Neal". After this, Neal, Kate, and Mozzie began running cons together. Neal refers to Vincent Adler as "the man who made me who I am today." He follows Adler's advice to "assault the commonplace every chance we get, from the clothes we wear to the art we collect, to the women in our lives." (Forging Bonds | Season 2: episode 11)
