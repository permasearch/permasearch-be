On 1 December 1886, munitions workers in Woolwich, now South East London, formed Arsenal as Dial Square, with David Danskin as their first captain.[a] Named after the heart of the Royal Arsenal complex, they took the name of the whole complex a month later.[14][13] Royal Arsenal F.C.'s first home was Plumstead Common,[13] though they spent most of their time in South East London playing on the other side of Plumstead, at the Manor Ground. Royal Arsenal won Arsenal's first trophies in 1890 and 1891, and these were the only football association trophies Arsenal won during their time in South East London.[15][16] In 1891, Royal Arsenal became the first London club to turn professional.[17]
