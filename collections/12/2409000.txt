In 1997 an animated screensaver themed video game entitled Wallace & Gromit Cracking Animator was released. Screensaver games were made by Dibase.[66] Players could create their own multimedia animations through the collation of things like sound effects, sets, characters, and props. Players could manipulate the facial movements of characters in order to synchorise their expressions with dialogue.[67] Players could choose to make their finished creation their screensaver, or choose one of the pre-made screensaver games.[67] The manual can be found at the British Library.[68] The Mail on Sunday deemed the program "disappointing".[69] Meanwhile, The Boston Herald offered a rating of 2.5 stars, noting that creativity is limited.[70]
