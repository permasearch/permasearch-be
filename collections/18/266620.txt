Further expansion of the postseason began in 1995, with eight teams entering the playoffs each year (further expanded to ten teams in 2012). In this era, the Braves entered the postseason 14 consecutive years from 1991 to 2005 (again not counting 1994), while the Yankees had a streak of 13 appearances from 1995 to 2007. However, all other postseason appearance streaks of 5 years or more predate the expanded-postseason era and are mentioned above, except for 5-year runs by the Cleveland Indians (1995–1999), the Philadelphia Phillies (2007–2011), the St. Louis Cardinals (2011–2015), and the Los Angeles Dodgers (2013–2017).
