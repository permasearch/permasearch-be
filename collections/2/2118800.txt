Capiz is known for the Placuna placenta oyster shell that has the same name locally and is used for decoration and making lampshades, trays, window and doors. Likewise, the province is known as the "Seafood Capital of the Philippines"[3] and was among the top 15 most frequently visited places in the Philippines.[4] Capiz is the site of the famous coral-stone Santa Monica Church in the town of Pan-ay, home to the largest Catholic Church bell in Asia. The bell was made from 70 sacks of gold and silver coins donated by the townsfolk. Measuring seven feet in diameter, five feet in height and weighing 10,400 kilograms or just over 10 metric tons, the Pan-ay bell is popular among tourists visiting Capiz.
