A goal of the pro-Adams press was to depict Jackson as a "mere military chieftain."[12] Edward Coles recounted that Jefferson told him in a conversation in August 1825 that he feared the popular enthusiasm for Jackson: "It has caused me to doubt more than anything that has occurred since our Revolution." Coles used the opinion of Thomas Gilmer to back himself up; Gilmer said Jefferson told him at Monticello before the election of Adams in 1825, "One might as well make a sailor of a cock, or a soldier of a goose, as a President of Andrew Jackson."[12] Daniel Webster, who was also at Monticello at the time, made the same report. Webster recorded that Jefferson told him in December 1824 that Jackson was a dangerous man unfit for the presidency.[13] Historian Sean Wilentz described Webster's account of the meeting as "not wholly reliable."[14] Biographer Robert V. Remini said that Jefferson "had no great love for Jackson."[15]
