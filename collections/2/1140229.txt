Under the advice of John D. Rockefeller, Jr., Maclaurin chose Rockefeller's personal architect, MIT graduate William Welles Bosworth, to lead the next round of designs. In no small part, he was chosen because of his willingness to work for clients with strong personal convictions.[13] Bosworth was trained in the Beaux-Arts style and was influenced by the City Beautiful movement which was at its height at the time.[14][15]
