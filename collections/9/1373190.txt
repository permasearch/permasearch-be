Final Fantasy was first re-released for the MSX2 system and was published by Microcabin in Japan in June 1989.[24] It had access to almost three times as much storage space as the Famicom version but suffered from problems not present in Nintendo's cartridge media, including noticeable loading times. There were also minor graphical upgrades, much-improved music tracks, and sound effects.
