London's critics almost uniformly panned the show, criticising the concept and direction. The Guardian wrote that the premise "really is as sixth form as it sounds", called the production "ruthlessly packaged and manufactured" and opined that the "sometimes funny" libretto exists mainly to "devise more unlikely ways to wring out another Queen song."[5] The Daily Mirror wrote that "Ben Elton should be shot for this risible story."[6] The Daily Telegraph described it as "guaranteed to bore you rigid" and "prolefeed at its worst."[7] However, some individual performances received praise[6] and the production remains a popular success.
