At that time in the United States, there were two primary standards for track gauge, as defined by the distance between the two rails. In England, the standard gauge was 4 ft 8 1⁄2 inch (1.435 m), and this had been adopted by the majority of northern railways. But much of the south had adopted a 5-foot gauge. Transferring railway cars across a break of gauge required changing out the wheel trucks. Alternatively, cargo was offloaded and reloaded, a time-consuming effort that delayed cargo shipments. For the transcontinental railroad, the builders adopted the English standard, what is now called standard gauge.[48]
