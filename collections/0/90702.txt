Cooling towers originated in the 19th century through the development of condensers for use with the steam engine.[2] Condensers use relatively cool water, via various means, to condense the steam coming out of the cylinders or turbines. This reduces the back pressure, which in turn reduces the steam consumption, and thus the fuel consumption, while at the same time increasing power and recycling boiler-water.[3] However the condensers require an ample supply of cooling water, without which they are impractical.[4][5] The consumption of cooling water by inland processing and power plants is estimated to reduce power availability for the majority of thermal power plants by 2040â€“2069.[6] While water usage is not an issue with marine engines, it forms a significant limitation for many land-based systems.
