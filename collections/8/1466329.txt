"Right Said Fred" was famously recorded as a single by Bernard Cribbins and released by Parlophone in 1962. It reached number 10 in the UK Singles Chart.[4] Cribbins recorded it at the Abbey Road Studios with musical accompaniment directed by Johnnie Spence. Sound effects were added by the producer George Martin, who would later become famous for his work with the Beatles.[5] The B-side was the comedy love song "Quietly Bonkers", another Dicks-Rudge composition.
