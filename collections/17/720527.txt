Synucleinopathies. Dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia are clinically similar after dementia occurs in Parkinson's disease.[11]  Delusions in Parkinson's disease dementia are less common than in DLB,[4] and persons with Parkinson's disease are typically less caught up in their visual hallucinations than those with DLB.[25] There is a lower incidence of tremor at rest in DLB than in Parkinson's disease, and signs of parkinsonism in DLB are more symmetrical.[6] In multiple system atrophy, autonomic dysfunction appears earlier and is more severe, and is accompanied by uncoordinated movements, while visual hallucinations and fluctuating cognition are less common than in DLB.[4]  Urinary difficulty is one of the earliest symptoms with multiple system atrophy, and is often severe.[10]
