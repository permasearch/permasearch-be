Elena and Jeremy decide to try and kill Kol because he is trying to stop them from getting the cure. Since Jeremy needs to kill vampires to complete the map to the cure, they conclude that if they kill Kol, which also kills his whole line of vampires, the map will be complete. Elena lures Kol into the house and waits for Jeremy to bring Bonnie, but he does not make it in time. Elena and Jeremy are talking later when Kol appears, storms into the house and tries to cut off Jeremy's hunting arm. Elena rescues Jeremy and corners Kol in the kitchen. During the altercation, Jeremy showers Kol in water mixed with vervain. While Kol is stunned, Jeremy stabs him with the white oak stake and he dies. Meanwhile, Klaus is watching in the doorway, furious, unable to help his brother because he has not been invited in. He vows to avenge his brother's death, swearing to kill Jeremy, Elena and anyone else involved.
