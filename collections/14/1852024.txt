Some Circassian organizations objected to the Games being held on land their ancestors held until 1864,[150][151] when most of them were vanquished at the end of the Russian-Circassian War (1763â€“1864), in what they consider to be ethnic cleansing or genocide.[152][153] The use of Krasnaya Polyana ("Red Hill" or "Red Glade") as an event site was considered sensitive, as it was named for a group of Circassians who were defeated in a bloody battle with Russians while attempting to return home over it in 1864.[154][155] Some Circassian groups demanded that the Games be cancelled or moved unless Russia apologized for their actions.[156] Other groups did not outright object to the Games, but suggested that symbols of Circassian history and culture be incorporated into the Games, as Australia, the United States and Canada did for their indigenous cultures in 2000, 2002, and 2010 respectively.[157]
