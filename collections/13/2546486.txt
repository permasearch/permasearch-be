Limewater is used in the preparation of maize for corn tortillas and other culinary purposes using a process known as nixtamalization. This unlocks proteins in the cornmeal, making it more nutritious for the consumer. Eating maize-based foods without nixtamalization or supplementation with legumes or meat leads to a nutritional deficiency known as pellagra.
