When the Secret Service was established, its head was called the Chief of the Secret Service. In 1965, the title was changed to the Director of the Secret Service, four years into the term of James Joseph Rowley (1961â€“1973).[9] The longest serving head of the Secret Service was William H. Moran, who served under five presidents from 1917 to 1936.
