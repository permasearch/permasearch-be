The Energy Policy Act of 2005, as approved by the U.S. House of Representatives, did not include a provision for shielding MTBE manufacturers from water contamination lawsuits. This provision was first proposed in 2003 and had been thought by some to be a priority of Tom DeLay and Rep. Joe Barton, then chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee.[20] This bill did include a provision that gives MTBE makers, including some major oil companies, $2 billion in transition assistance while MTBE was phased out over the next nine years.[21] Due to opposition in the Senate,[22] the conference report dropped all MTBE provisions. The final bill was signed into law by President George W. Bush.[23] The lack of MTBE liability protection is resulting in a switchover to the use of ethanol as a gasoline additive.
