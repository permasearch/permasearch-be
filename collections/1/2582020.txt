The images were obtained via the online storage offered by Apple's iCloud platform for automatically backing up photos from iOS devices, such as iPhones.[11] Apple later reported that the victims' iCloud account information was obtained using "a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions", such as phishing and brute-force guessing.[6][7][12] It was initially believed that the images were obtained using an exploit in the Find My iPhone service.[11] Court documents from 2014 indicated that one user created a fake email account called "appleprivacysecurity" to ask celebrities for security information.[13] The photos were being passed around privately for at least a couple of weeks before their public release on August 31. There are claims that unreleased photos and videos exist.[14] The Daily Mail cited anonymous posters from 4chan and Deadspin who stated that a ring of hackers, traders, and sellers had been operating for months leading up to the mass release.[3]
