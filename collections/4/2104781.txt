In 2006, Copperfield bought eleven Bahamian islands called Musha Cay.[56] Renamed "The Islands of Copperfield Bay",[56] the islands are a private resort.[57] Guests have reportedly included Oprah Winfrey and John Travolta. Google co-founder Sergey Brin was married there.[58] Copperfield has said that the islands may contain the Fountain of Youth, a claim that resulted in him receiving a Dubious Achievement Award from Esquire Magazine in 2006.[59]
