Six main types of Anglo-Saxon knife have been identified, based on blade shapes.[55] Anglo-Saxon seaxes were commonly constructed using pattern-welding, even in late Anglo-Saxon England when this practice had become uncommon for swords.[56] The blades were sometimes decorated with incised lines or metal inlays,[57] and a number of examples contain inscriptions bearing the name of the owner or maker.[58] The seax was kept in a leather sheath, the sheaths themselves sometimes being decorated with embossed designs and silver or bronze fittings.[59] Evidence from graves suggests that the sheath was belted to the carrier, with the hilt on the right-hand side of the body.[60]
