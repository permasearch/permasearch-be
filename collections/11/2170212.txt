After the overthrow of President Victor Yanukovych during the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, the territories of Sevastopol and Crimea were seized by the Russian Federation; integration was formalized following a referendum in which 96% of the Crimean population purportedly voted “Yes”, and the Crimean peninsula became part of Russia. This move was denounced by the new Ukrainian government and disregarded by the Venice Commission (an advisory body of the Council of Europe in the field of constitutional law) which argued that the referendum was illegal under the Ukrainian constitution[22] and contravened international norms.[which?] The Crimean authorities justified themselves by saying that the Kosovo precedent made it comply with international norms beginning in 2010.[23] The integration was condemned by most of the UN members and international supranational bodies.[24][25][26][27]
