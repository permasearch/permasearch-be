In spite of criticism, cast members' performances were usually well received â€“ in particular, Palmer's portrayal of Akeelah. Ebert said, "The movie depends on her, and she deserves its trust."[52] Hornaday opined that "Palmer's Akeelah is that cinematic rara avis, the kid who is cute without being too cute, sympathetic without being cloying, and believable without being tiresome."[55] Evening Chronicle stated Palmer does it "with effortless grace" and that she "carries the film and doesn't strike a single wrong emotional note."[98] Fuchs felt that most of the film's strengths "have to do with Palmer's winning performance."[99] Ingman declared Atchison's "ensemble is wonderful, and his star, Palmer, is a fantastically assured young actress who conveys Akeelah's maelstrom of 11-year-old feelings with no apparent effort."[51] Turan complimented how Fishburne and Bassett's "presence and ability give this film a welcome integrity."[50] Mohan stated, "Although Fishburne and Bassett can do these roles in their sleep, the kids are actually quite engaging."[102] Tourmakine felt there were "fine performances all around" and that Fishburne and Bassett "lend fine support in utterly believable roles".[95]
