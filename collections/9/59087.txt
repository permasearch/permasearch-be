However, due to their limited use, two-dollar bills are not printed as frequently in a new series like other denominations, which are produced according to demand.[7] Though some cash registers accommodate the bill, its slot is often used for things like checks and rolls of coins. Some bill acceptors found in vending machines, self checkout lanes, and other automated kiosks are configured to accommodate two-dollar bills, even if the fact is not stated on the label.[8] Although they are generally available at most banks, two-dollar bills are usually not handed out arbitrarily except upon specific request by the customer, and even then, may cause a delay with a trip to the vault.[9]
