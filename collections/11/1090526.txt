On December 1, 2016, CBS announced an agreement with the National Football League to allow clearance of regional NFL games carried by CBS on CBS All Access from Week 13 of the 2016 NFL season on. At the time, the games were blacked out on non-Verizon Wireless mobile devices due to that provider's exclusivity agreement as part of their "official wireless provider" sponsorship of the league.[13] In the 2018 NFL season, a new agreement with Verizon ending that exclusivity will allow CBS All Access to stream games to all mobile devices.
