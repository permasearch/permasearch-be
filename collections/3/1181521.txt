(*) Note 1: Super Bowl I was simulcast on both CBS (at the time the sole NFL network) and NBC[15] (the AFL network). From Super Bowl II onward, the networks began rotating exclusive coverage of the game on an annual basis. Super Bowls Iâ€“VI were blacked out in the television markets of the host cities, due to league restrictions then in place.
