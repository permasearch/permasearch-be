In November 2014, The Washington Post inadvertently published a photograph of all seven of the TSA master keys in an article[129] about TSA baggage handling. The photograph was later removed from the original Washington Post article, but it still appears in some syndicated copies of the article.[130] On August 22, 2015, Twitter user Luke Rudkowski (@Lukewearechange) noticed the photograph and posted it on Twitter,[131] and from there it quickly spread across social media, gaining the attention of news sites.[132] Using the photograph, security researchers and members of the public have been able to reproduce working copies of the master keys using 3D printing techniques.[133][134] The incident has prompted discussion about the security implications of using master keys.[132]
