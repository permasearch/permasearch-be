The survivors have the option to utilize up to four perks per match that affect how they play each game. Each of the survivors has a set of three unique-to-them perks that are only available to that survivor until the ability to teach them to other survivors is unlocked. These perks can be unlocked and upgraded in the Bloodweb using Bloodpoints and each Bloodweb can only hold up to two perks. These perks can range from giving a burst of speed when running from the killer, to being able to self-heal without a first aid kit, to unlocking the ability to sabotage meat hooks without a toolbox. There are also a multitude of 'universal' perks that are available to unlock by any survivor.
