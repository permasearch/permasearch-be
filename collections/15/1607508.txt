Between 1999 and 2006, Bicycling magazine named Boston three times as one of the worst cities in the US for cycling;[272] regardless, it has one of the highest rates of bicycle commuting.[273] In 2008, as a consequence of improvements made to bicycling conditions within the city, the same magazine put Boston on its "Five for the Future" list as a "Future Best City" for biking,[274][275] and Boston's bicycle commuting percentage increased from 1% in 2000 to 2.1% in 2009.[276] The bikeshare program called Hubway launched in late July 2011,[277] logging more than 140,000 rides before the close of its first season.[278] The neighboring municipalities of Cambridge, Somerville, and Brookline joined the Hubway program in the summer of 2012.[279] In 2016, there are 1,461 bikes and 158 docking stations across the city.[280] PBSC Urban Solutions provides bicycles and technology for this bike-sharing system.[281]
