Strawberry cultivars vary widely in size, color, flavor, shape, degree of fertility, season of ripening, liability to disease and constitution of plant.[7] On average, a strawberry has about 200 seeds on its external membrane.[8] Some vary in foliage, and some vary materially in the relative development of their sexual organs. In most cases, the flowers appear hermaphroditic in structure, but function as either male or female.[9] For purposes of commercial production, plants are propagated from runners and, in general, distributed as either bare root plants or plugs. Cultivation follows one of two general modelsâ€”annual plasticulture,[10] or a perennial system of matted rows or mounds.[11] Greenhouses produce a small amount of strawberries during the off season.[12]
