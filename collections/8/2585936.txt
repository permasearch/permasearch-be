Named for the famous corner at Spa-Francorchamps, the Eau Rouge is a Formula One inspired concept car based on the Q50 premium sports sedan, with aerodynamic styling treatments and design elements influenced by Infiniti's partnership with Infiniti Red Bull Racing. Changes include bespoke carbon fibre bodywork (carbon fibre front splitter, rear diffuser and side sill skirts, carbon fibre roof and door mirror casings), 20-inch lightweight forged alloy wheels, a dual-exit exhaust sports system below a large integrated rear spoiler, 20mm wider wheel arches, red body color with overlaid tinted clear coat, matching carbon fibre door and center console panes, a high-grip sports steering wheel with Formula One-style paddle-shifters.
