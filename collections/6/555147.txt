Elena and Gail's wedding is imminent, but Jez is busy plotting how to get rid of Gail and win Elena back. Elena tells Jez that she and Gail are moving to Quebec after the wedding. Mark, although conflicted about becoming a father, is worried that Jeff is becoming a potential rival dad. Sophie convinces a reluctant Mark to learn to drive so that he can take her to the hospital. However, he gives up trying to learn during his first lesson, because the instructor is terrible. Elena doesn't want Jez at the wedding, but Gail invites him. Jez and Gail get into a rowing boat and Gail accidentally falls into the water. Mark pretends he has passed his test and tries to drive Sophie to the hospital. Mark gets out of the car and Jez drives â€“ almost running over Gail. Sophie realises that Mark can't drive and Jez tells Gail about his affair with Elena. Sophie drives to the hospital with the boys in the back seat.
