The Holden Adventra is Holden's first all-wheel drive variant built on the wagon platform. It was produced between 2003 and 2005 also acting as the basis of commercial derivates in the form of the Crewman Cross 8 and Holden Special Vehicles sports variants. The Adventra is based on the VY II Commodore station wagon, but features an all-wheel drive configuration as opposed to a rear-wheel drive running gear. Available in two equipment levels—CX8 and LX8—with a standardised driveline consisting of a single powertrain combination. That being, a 5.7-litre Generation III V8 engine rated at 235 kilowatts (315 hp) and a four-speed automatic transmission.
