Initially, Hill specified that the stamps should be 3/4 inch square,[4][5] but altered the dimensions to 3/4 inch wide by 7/8 inch tall[6] (approx 19 x 22Â mm) to accommodate the writing at the bottom.  The word "POSTAGE" at the top of the design distinguishes it from a revenue stamp, which had long been used in the UK; "ONE PENNY." at the bottom shows the amount pre-paid for postage of the stamped letter. The background to the portrait consists of finely engraved engine turnings.
