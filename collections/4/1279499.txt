The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA receptor) – a type of ionotropic glutamate receptor – is a voltage-dependent ligand-gated ion channel that is gated by the simultaneous binding of glutamate and a co-agonist (i.e., either D-serine or glycine).[11] Studies show that the NMDA receptor is involved in regulating synaptic plasticity and memory.[12][13]
