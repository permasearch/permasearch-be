Although he had Ward’s protection, the film was also in Black Panther territory. While they were filming bottles and trash cans would be thrown off the roof by Black Panther party members. In order for filming to run smoothly, an additional deal had to be made with Huey Newton and Bobby Seale, who were then put in charge of providing extras for the film. About halfway through the production of the film Frank Ward was shot and killed while in his Rolls Royce. There was speculation that the Black Panthers were responsible for Ward’s death, so the filmmakers and cast relocated to safer areas for filming. Despite the tension, the film opening was held in Oakland with all of the proceeds going towards the Black Panthers' milk fund.[5]
