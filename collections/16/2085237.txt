Complications with measles are relatively common, ranging from mild complications such as diarrhea to serious complications such as pneumonia (either direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia), bronchitis (either direct viral bronchitis or secondary bacterial bronchitis), otitis media,[19] acute brain inflammation[20] (and very rarely SSPEâ€”subacute sclerosing panencephalitis),[21] and corneal ulceration (leading to corneal scarring).[22] Complications are usually more severe in adults who catch the virus.[23] The death rate in the 1920s was around 30% for measles pneumonia.[24] People that are at high risk for complications are: Infants and children aged <5 years, adults aged >20 years, pregnant women, and people with compromised immune systems, such as from leukemia and HIV infection.[25]
