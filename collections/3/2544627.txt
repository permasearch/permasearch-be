In 1914, the Indian Army was one of the two largest volunteer armies in the world[4] with a total strength of 240,000 men,[7] (The British Army had a strength of 247,432 regular volunteers at the outbreak of the war) and by November 1918 it contained 548,311 men, being considered the Imperial Strategic Reserve.[8] It was regularly called upon to deal with incursions and raids on the North West Frontier and to provide garrison forces for the British Empire in Egypt, Singapore and China.[9] This field force was divided into two armies: The Northern Army which stretched from the North-West Frontier to Bengal with five divisions and three brigades under command and the Southern Army which stretched from Baluchistan to southern India and it in turn had four divisions under command and two formations outside the subcontinent.[10] The two armies contained 39 cavalry regiments, 138 infantry battalions (including 20 Gurkha),[7] a joint cavalry-infantry unit the Corps of Guides, three sapper regiments and 12 mountain artillery batteries.[4]
