Season Three starts just twenty minutes after the Season Two finale, when Pete finds Violet lying unconscious on the floor of her house, bleeding to death. Katie cut the baby out of Violet and ran away with him. Pete saves Violet and, together with Naomi, rushes her to hospital, where Addison and Naomi perform surgery on her. In the meantime, Katie appears in the hospital with Violet's baby, and is apprehended by Pete, Cooper, and the security team.
