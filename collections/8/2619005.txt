Brad and Eric Ward are Luke Ward's younger twin brothers. When they first appeared in season 1, they were around 12. After their parents divorced, Luke decides to live with their father and the twins are not seen; they presumably stayed behind in Newport with their mother. They later returned in season 4 and are classmates and friends with Kaitlin Cooper. Eric resembles Luke more than Brad and both are often seen flirting with female classmates.
