St. Anthony, initially based in Smithtown, began its sports legacy with Philip Gully, their first Cross Country Coach.  Gully began his career with the "galloping Friars" in the late 50's with a small group of boys and by 1964 his Varsity and Freshman runners simultaneously swept the Nassau-Suffolk cross country championship at Sunken Meadow park. With the help of Brother's Noel and DePaul, the Name of St.Anthony track  arrived on the sports pages of Newsday and others, weekly. In addition to their local prowess, the Friars branched out to New York city  where at van cortlandt park  and  Randall's Island the took on their "city cousins". In 1967, winning the mile relay at the Penn Relays,  St. Anthony took center stage on Long Island and thus began the influx of athletes for all sports especially the newly designed Football program.
