Born in Birmingham, Sturridge spent four years in the Aston Villa academy before moving to Coventry City. He then signed for Manchester City in 2003. He continued his development at City and played in two FA Youth Cup finals. He made his first-team debut in the 2007–08 season, becoming the only player ever to score in the FA Youth Cup, FA Cup and Premier League in the same season. He left City in 2009 and signed for Chelsea, where he was loaned out to Bolton Wanderers for the second half of the 2010–11 season. After a successful spell at Bolton, scoring eight goals in 12 appearances, he returned to Chelsea for the 2011–12 season. He left Chelsea to join Liverpool in January 2013, where he formed the so-called SAS attacking partnership with Luis Suárez, with Liverpool scoring more than 100 league goals in the 2013–14 season with Sturridge scoring 21 – the pair of them having a 1–2 in the goal scoring stats of the league.[3] The following two seasons were curtailed by a myriad of injuries, limiting Sturridge to very few appearances.[4]
