Friedman voiced Ellen, a character with Down syndrome, in the Family Guy episode "Extra Large Medium", her first role as a voice actress.[5] In the episode, Friedman's character stated "My dad's an accountant and my mom is the former Governor of Alaska", referencing Sarah Palin's son, Trig, who has Down syndrome. However, per Friedman, "Sarah Palin said that was insensitive and cruel" and Friedman felt "it was only a joke."[6] In an email concerning Palin's criticism of the episode, she said, "I guess former Governor Palin does not have a sense of humor."[7][8] She concluded, "In my family we think laughing is good. My parents raised me to have a sense of humor and to live a normal life."[8]
