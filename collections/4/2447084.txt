Walker's second album for Asylum-Curb was first announced in June 2009.[46] Its first single, "She Won't Be Lonely Long", was given an official release date of December 2009,[47] although it had already entered the country charts in late November.[48] In advance of his ninth album, Walker released an extended play titled She Won't Be Lonely Long.[49] The album, also titled She Won't Be Lonely Long, was released on June 8, 2010. It includes a cover of Alabama's 1980 single "Feels So Right" with a backing vocal from Alabama's lead singer, Randy Owen.[46] Allmusic reviewer Thom Jurek praised the album for its "straight-up, mainstream contemporary country" sound but said that it did not reflect a change in sound from Fall.[50]
