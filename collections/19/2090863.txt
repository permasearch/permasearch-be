Lola first appeared in "The End Of The Affair?" in a chance meeting with Rufus and Lily Humphrey.[2] She later reappeared as a caterer at the wedding of Blair Waldorf to Louis Grimaldi. During this job she meets Nate Archibald where, despite his insistence for a romantic relationship, she declines. Catering Nate's party for The Spectator, Lola bumps into Ivy Dickens, whom unbeknownst to her has spent the past year posing as her. The two chat about their acting until Nate interrupts and upon Ivy leaving he tells Lola that Ivy is called Charlie Rhodes. Baffled by this new information, she searches for her online and discovers that Ivy has been posing as her.[3]
