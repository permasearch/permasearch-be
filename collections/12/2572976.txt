Adolphus Busch was the first American brewer to use pasteurization to keep beer fresh; the first to use mechanical refrigeration and refrigerated railroad cars, which he introduced in 1876; and the first to bottle beer extensively.[1][14][15] By 1877, the company owned a fleet of 40 refrigerated railroad cars to transport beer.[15] Expanding the company's distribution range led to increased demand for Anheuser products, and the company substantially expanded its facilities in St. Louis during the 1870s.[16] The expansions led production to increase from 31,500 barrels in 1875 to more than 200,000 in 1881.[16]
