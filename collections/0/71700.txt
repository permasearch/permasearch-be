Gibraltar was given the Gibraltar Constitution Order 2006 by Britain which established a form of government whereby the Governor of Gibraltar is responsible for the conduct of external affairs, defence, internal security and for certain appointments to public office, and the Government of Gibraltar is made responsible for all other matters. The UK believes that as an independent territory, recognised by the United Nations Gibraltar enjoys the individual and collective rights that are set out in the 2006 constitution and the right of self-determination. Spain disputes the legality of the constitution and claims that it does not change the position of Gibraltar as a colony of the UK with only the UK empowered to discuss Gibraltar matters on the international scene.[6]:4/16
