The Mighty Ducks is a series of three live-action films released in the 1990s by Walt Disney Pictures. The movies revolve around a Twin Cities ice hockey team, composed of young players that stick together throughout various challenges. Despite its negative reviews by movie critics, the trilogy's commercial success paved the way for the creation of the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim (now the Anaheim Ducks) NHL team as well as a related animated series called Mighty Ducks.
