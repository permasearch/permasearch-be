All five seasons of Friday Night Lights were filmed in Austin and Pflugerville.[18] With the show yielding roughly $33 million a year in revenue,[19] other states courted the production company after the state of Texas failed to pay all the rebates it had promised to the show's producers.[18] The Texas legislature authorized funding to match the offers of other states, and the production company preferred to stay near Austin, so the show remained in Texas.[19]
