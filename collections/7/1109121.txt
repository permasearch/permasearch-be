After Eddard Stark convinces King Robert not to join the tourney, the crowd watches a jousting match between the fearsome Ser Gregor "The Mountain" Clegane, brother of the Hound, and Ser Loras Tyrell, the "Knight of Flowers". The Mountain is a formidable opponent, but Loras cleverly defeats him in the joust by riding a mare in heat, distracting Clegane's stallion. Furious, Clegane beheads his horse and attempts to kill Loras. Sandor "The Hound" Clegane comes to Tyrell's rescue and defends him against his brother until Robert orders them to stop. Grateful for being rescued, Loras calls Sandor a hero when he is cheered by the crowd.
