In the table above (and the two tables which follow), "Active pins" include the GPIO and ADC pins with which you can attach external devices to the ESP8266 MCU. The "Pitch" is the space between pins on the ESP8266 module, which is important to know if you are going to breadboard the device. The "Form factor" also describes the module packaging as "2 Ã— 9 DIL", meaning two rows of 9 pins arranged "Dual In Line", like the pins of DIP ICs. Many ESP-xx modules include a small on-board LED which can be programmed to blink and thereby indicate activity. There are several antenna options for ESP-xx boards including a trace antenna, an on-board ceramic antenna, and an external connector which allows you to attach an external Wi-Fi antenna. Since Wi-Fi communications generates a lot of RFI (Radio Frequency Interference), governmental bodies like the FCC like shielded electronics to minimize interference with other devices. Some of the ESP-xx modules come housed within a metal box with an FCC seal of approval stamped on it. First and second world markets will likely demand FCC approval and shielded Wi-Fi devices.
