The coldest region is the Snowy Mountains where the snow and frost continues for quite long period during the winter months. The Blue Mountains, Southern Tablelands and Central Tablelands, which are situated on the Great Dividing Range, have mild to warm summers and cold winters, although not as severe as those in the Snowy Mountains. Interestingly, some places situated in or around the Range have recorded freezing and near-freezing lows in nearly every month of the year, a feat not experienced in many other places of similar latitude and altitude in the northern hemisphere.
