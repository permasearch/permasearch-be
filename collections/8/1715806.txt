Oob (ウーブ, Ūbu), known as Uub in the English anime dub, is the human reincarnation of the evil Majin Boo. After Boo was destroyed, Goku asked for him to be reincarnated as a good person, so they may battle again.[ch. 518] Goku eventually senses Oob's hidden power and seeks him out ten years later, when Oob attends the tournament to gain money for his village.[ch. 518] Goku ends up deciding to train him to be Earth's new guardian and as an opponent that he can battle.[ch. 519] In Dragon Ball GT, Mr. Boo merges with Oob's body, slightly altering his appearance, transforming him into "Majoob" ("Majuub" in the English dub) or Super Oob (スーパーウーブ, Sūpā Ūbu) to face threats such as Baby, Super #17, and Omega Shenron. He is voiced by Megumi Urawa in Dragon Ball Z and Atsushi Kisaichi in GT, and by Kara Edwards and Sean Teague in the Funimation dub.
