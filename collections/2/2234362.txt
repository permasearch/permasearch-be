Swift performed "Picture to Burn" to close the main set, before commencing the encore[55] on all venues of her first headlining concert tour, the Fearless Tour (2009â€“10). During 2009 performances, Swift donned a black cocktail dress with sparkly ornaments along the stomach,[56] as she roamed throughout the stage, which was projected with images of searing flames, singing the song. In the 2010 extension, Swift bared a spangly, violet mini-dress.[55] Jim Harrington of the San Jose Mercury News believed "Picture to Burn"'s performance on April 11, 2010 at the HP Pavilion in San Jose, California demonstrated how versatile Swift was as a performer, feeling equally at gusto with tender ballads and uptempo rockers.[13] Of the performance at the tour's final concert on June 5, 2010 at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, Jay N. Miller of The Patriot Ledger said, "She strutted down the catwalk chastising another hapless ex-boyfriend".[55] Attending the same concert, Molly Trust of Billboard deemed the performance one of the most energized moments of the night,[57] while Susan McDonald of The Sun Chronicle deemed it simple, yet the most powerful.[58]
