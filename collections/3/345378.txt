Sabo (サボ) is the chief of staff of the Revolutionary Army and sworn brother to Luffy and Ace.[ch. 585, 744] Introduced as a noble from the Goa Kingdom years before the series' present, Sabo leaves his home and family to live in the Gray Terminal. After he and Ace befriend Luffy, the three of them exchange cups of sake and become "brothers". Sabo's ship is destroyed by a Celestial Dragon. Though he is thought to have been killed in the attack, Sabo survives and is rescued by Monkey D. Dragon, though he suffers from amnesia. At some point he joins the Revolutionary Army and becomes its chief of staff. After reading of Ace's death in the newspaper, Sabo's memory returns and, like Luffy, is devastated by his death. Sabo becomes determined to obtain Ace's Devil Fruit, the Flame-Flame Fruit, in order to inherit Ace's will. He later finds it as the prize of a tournament on Dressrosa, where he takes Luffy's place by using Luffy's alias "Lucy".[ch. 744] After winning the tournament, Sabo eats the fruit and battles Admiral Fujitora and Jesus Burgess in an effort to protect Luffy.
