The Lingayat monasteries have associated priestly class who are referred to as the Jangamas, but this class is not part of the monastery and often householders.[110] Anyone, from any social class, can become a Lingayat monk and join its monastery, and the internal organization has allowed social mobility from its earliest days.[110] The Jangamas often officiate rites of passage, such as wedding.[110] The succession in Lingayat branch monasteries may be appointed either by the main monastery, or the local chief may name his successor.[110]
