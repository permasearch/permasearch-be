In 1693, the College of William and Mary was founded at Middle Plantation (soon renamed Williamsburg). The college included a common school for Virginia Indians, supplemented by local pupils, which lasted until a 1779 overhaul of the institution's curriculum.[45] The college, located in the capital and heart of the Tidewater region, dominated the colony's intellectual climate until after independence.[45][46]
