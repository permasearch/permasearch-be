Marx and Engels do not claim that socialism is impossible in one country, but they do say that "in all probability, the proletarian revolution will transform existing society gradually and will be able to abolish private property only when the means of production are available in sufficient quantity" (Engels' The Principles of Communism, Sections 17 and 19).[6] The Communist Manifesto alludes to Marx's view that the dominance of the bourgeoisie is a necessary prelude to that of the proletariat: "the bourgeoisie therefore producesÂ ... its own grave-diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable'.[7] In this sense, Trotsky's version of the theory represents both a development and (to some observers) a contradiction of the expressed opinions of Marx and Engels.
