The term "Five Civilized Tribes" derives from the colonial and early federal period in the history of the United States. It refers to five Native American nationsâ€”the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek (Muscogee), and Seminole.[1] These are the first five tribes that Anglo-European settlers generally considered to be "civilized" according to their own worldview.[2] Examples of colonial attributes adopted by these five tribes include Christianity, centralized governments, literacy, market participation, written constitutions, intermarriage with white Americans, and plantation slavery practices. The Five Civilized Tribes tended to maintain stable political relations with the Europeans.
