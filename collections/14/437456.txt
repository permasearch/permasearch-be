At St Patrick's Day three years later, Kelly encourages The Mother to go out and date again, bringing her to the same bar where Ted and Barney are celebrating. The two women run into Mitch, her old orchestra instructor who was then a music teacher at a Bronx public school. Inspired by his work, The Mother offers Mitch her cello and they head back to her apartment to get it. However, The Mother prepares the cello only to see Mitch pull off The Naked Man. She is disgusted at his move, but remembers her yellow umbrella at the bar and goes out to get it, leaving behind Kelly (who earlier rebuffed Barney at the bar) to have sex with Mitch. She learns that a "super inconsiderate person" (Ted) took the umbrella. The Mother expresses her desire to end poverty by taking up economics in college.
