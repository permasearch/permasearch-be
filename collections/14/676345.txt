Little Richard's voice was able to generate croons, wails, and screams unprecedented in popular music.[24] He was cited by two of soul music's pioneers, Otis Redding and Sam Cooke, as contributing to that genre's early development. Redding stated that most of his music was patterned after Little Richard's, referring to Little Richard's 1953 recording "Directly From My Heart To You" as the personification of soul, and that he had "done a lot for [him] and [his] soul brothers in the music business."[168] Cooke said in 1962 that Little Richard had done "so much for our music".[169] Cooke had a top 40 hit in 1963 with his cover of Little Richard's soulful 1956 hit 'Send Me Some Loving'.[170]
