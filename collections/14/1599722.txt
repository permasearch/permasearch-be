Aleksandr Petrovsky (Mikhail Baryshnikov), referred to by Carrie occasionally as "The Russian" or "My Lover" is a famous conceptual artist who becomes Carrie's lover in the final season. He sweeps her off her feet with huge romantic gestures and shows her the foreign pockets of New York that she has never seen before. Her relationship with him brings up all sorts of questions in Carrie's mind about finding love past "a certain age" and whether or not she wants children. When he's preparing to return to Paris for a solo exhibit he invites Carrie to come live with him, which, after several deliberations (and one fight) with her friends, she does. After spending some time with him in Paris, she realizes that he will never reciprocate the level of emotional involvement that she offers because his life and career will always come first. (Casting Baryshnikov as Petrovsky was noteworthy because in real life, Candace Bushnell, the author on whom Bradshaw is based, married real life ballet dancer Charles Askegard of the New York City Ballet.)
