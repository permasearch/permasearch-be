It is a volatile romance and Denise ends it several times so Kevin is pursued by Elaine Jarvis (Si√¢n Reeves). However, Kevin supports Denise through the abuse of her ex-husband Owen Turner (Lee Ross), so the couple reunite and move in together. In late 2006, the Wicks family go on holiday to Dorset. Kevin's ex-wife, Shirley, finds them and tries to reunite with her children, Deano and Carly, until Kevin orders her to leave them alone.

When Kevin tries to make her leave, Shirley threatens to tell her children that Kevin is not their father. The truth eventually comes out and both Carly and Deano shun Kevin. Deano eventually forgives Kevin for lying, but Carly will not. Devastated, Kevin leaves Walford, not telling anyone where he is going and is missing for several months, it is later confirmed he is alive after bank records show he emptied his account in Hastings.
