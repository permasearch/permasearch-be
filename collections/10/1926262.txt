In April 1996, Robert McGlohon, who had worked as a briefing attorney for one of the appeals court judges, had been a lawyer for less than three years when he was appointed by the court to handle Ricky Kerr's state habeas corpus petition. He filed only one claim, a challenge to the law itself, rather than raise issues that might have granted Kerr a new trial. Thus, per Texas law, he forfeited Kerr's right to raise other issues later.[4][5]
