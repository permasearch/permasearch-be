Canada's largest and most powerful icebreaker, the 120-metre (390 ft) CCGS Louis S. St. Laurent, was delivered in 1969. Her original 3 steam turbine/9 generator/ 3 electric motor system produces 27,000*shaft horsepower. A multi-year mid-life refit project (1987–1993) saw the ship get a new bow, and a new propulsion system. The new power plant consists of 5 diesels/ 3 generators/ 3 electric motors giving about the same SHP. On 22 August 1994 Louis S. St-Laurent and USCGC Polar Sea became the first North American surface vessels to reach the North Pole. The vessel was originally scheduled to be decommissioned in 2000 however a refit extended the decommissioning date to 2017.
