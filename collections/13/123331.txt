Breastfeeding practices have been shown to have a dramatic effect on the incidence of diarrheal disease in poor populations. Studies across a number of developing nations have shown that those who receive exclusive breastfeeding during their first 6 months of life are better protected against infection with diarrheal diseases.[66] One study in Brazil found that non-breastfed infants were 14 times more likely to die from diarrhea than exclusively breastfed infants.[67] Exclusive breastfeeding is currently recommended for the first six months of an infant's life by the WHO,[68][69] with continued breastfeeding until at least two years of age.[69]
