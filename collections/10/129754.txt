The ACT was given its first federal representation in 1949, when it gained a seat in the House of Representatives, the Division of Australian Capital Territory,[177] under the 1948 Representation Act which increased the size of the House of Representatives.[178] The ACT member could only vote on matters directly affecting the Territory.[178] In 1974, the ACT and the Northern Territory were each allocated two Senate seats. In 1974, the House of Representatives seat was divided into two, the Division of Canberra and Division of Fraser.[177] A third, the Division of Namadgi, was created in 1996, but was abolished in 1998 after an updated assessment of changes to the regional demographic distribution.[179] Both House of Representatives seats have mostly been held by the Australian Labor Party,[179][180] while ALP and the Liberal Party of Australia have always each held one Senate seat.[181]
