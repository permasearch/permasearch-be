As the result of a 1991 referendum in Houston, the two-year term was amended to elected officials who can serve up to three terms until 2015 where the three term limit and two year terms were replaced with a two four-year terms - a mayor is elected for a four-year term (previously the mayor, controller, and councilmembers are elected to a two-year term prior to the November 3, 2015 city elections), and can be elected to as many as two consecutive terms. City council members, who also have a three-term limit, are elected from eleven districts in the city, along with five at-large council members, who represent the entire city. Term limits with the City of Houston are absolute - past elected officeholders are prohibited from campaigning for their former council positions (which includes the Mayor and City Controller). The current Mayor of Houston is Sylvester Turner.
