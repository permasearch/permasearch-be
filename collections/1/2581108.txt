Henri Philippe Benoni Omer Joseph Pétain (24 April 1856 – 23 July 1951), generally known as Philippe Pétain (French: [fi.lip pe.tɛ̃]) or Marshal Pétain (Maréchal Pétain), was a French general officer who reached the distinction of Marshal of France, and later served as the Chief of State of Vichy France also known as the French State (Chef de l'État Français), from 1940 to 1944. Pétain, who was 84 years old in 1940, ranks as France's oldest head of state. Today, he is considered by many the French equivalent to his contemporary Vidkun Quisling in Norway. He was sometimes nicknamed The Lion of Verdun.
