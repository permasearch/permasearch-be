In April 2015, after the Second Battle of Idlib, the interim seat of the Syrian Interim Government was proposed to be Idlib, in the Idlib Governorate. However, this move was rejected by the al-Nusra Front and Ahrar al-Sham-led Army of Conquest, which controls Idlib.[74] According to the Syrian National Coalition, there are 404 opposition-aligned local councils operating in villages, towns, and cities controlled by rebel forces.[75]
