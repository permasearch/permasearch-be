Director D. W. Griffith was the first to make a motion picture in Hollywood. His 17-minute short film In Old California (1910) was filmed for the Biograph Company.[21][22][23] Although Hollywood banned movie theaters—of which it had none—before annexation that year, Los Angeles had no such restriction.[24] The first film by a Hollywood studio, Nestor Motion Picture Company, was shot on October 26, 1911.[25] The H. J. Whitley home was used as its set, and the unnamed movie was filmed in the middle of their groves at the corner of Whitley Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard.[26][27]
