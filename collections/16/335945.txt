After the Ancients' ascension they continued to oppose their former nemesis, the Ori, who had also reached Enlightenment. Although the two factions were deadlocked in strength, the Ori were still bent on destroying the Ancients once and for all. The Ancients probably outnumbered the Ori as the ranks of the ascended Ori were not swelled by new ascendants, rather they preferred to hoard the energy they derived from their own mortal worshipers, sapping power from this second evolution of humanity created in their own galaxy to gather enough strength to, ultimately, attack the Ancients. In response, the Ancients chose to hide their own second evolution created in the Milky Way from the Ori[1] with the sole purpose of protecting the Milky Way humans from being coerced into forced religious servitude to the Ori, and thus used as a resource for the Ori to empower themselves. To this end they also probably influenced the association of fire, the central icon of the Ori religion, with demonic imagery.[8] Still, they refused to take direct action because of their strict self-imposed edict of self-determination.[7]  It is also likely that the Ancients knew the slippery slope of addiction to empowerment by way of the worship of `Lowers` and understood that there was a danger in this reliance, giving the Ori and later Adria a weakness despite `God` like powers. There are several examples of "lowers" praying and giving thanks to the Ancients/Ancestors in the Pegasus Galaxy. Such as "The Tower", even an exiled Ancient on a planet where the people worship her as "Athar" in the Stargate Atlantis episode, "Sanctuary."
