"Not Afraid" was included on Eminem's set list as the final song before Eminem's "Lose Yourself" encore in his performance at the T in the Park festival, which took place on July 10, 2010.[87] This would be his first European concert in five years.[88] Eminem wore black shorts and a hoodie.[89] He commented on the weather, saying, "I know it's muddy and sloppy and shit but this is fun", and also thanked the crowd for supporting him. "Everybody who's an Eminem fan, I just wanna say thank you so much for the support you've shown over the years, for not giving up on me," he said, "I hope you enjoyed the show as much as we did tonight. Peace."[87] At the end of the performance, Eminem said, "Edin-borg, did you enjoy yourself tonight?"[90] That evening, members of the audience accused Eminem of lip syncing, but others defended him of such accusations.[91] The T in the Park performance of "Not Afraid" is included as the second track on the "Love the Way You Lie" CD single.[92] Eminem performed "Not Afraid" for a small audience in a small room at the beginning of the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards; he performed the song once again at the Los Angeles Nokia Theatre, the main site of the ceremony, and performed "Love the Way You Lie" with Barbadian singer Rihanna.[93] The audience voted his performance the best with 34 percent of all votes.[94]
