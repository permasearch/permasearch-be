In the music video, Gwen Stefani and Eve are shown stopping at a red light. Eve brings in a gang of party crashers, and she tells Gwen to tag along. Gwen gets out of her car and gets into the all-terrain vehicle.  They arrive at the party where to crash it after parking their ATV. Then, they are arrested for disrupting a formal party (whose attendees include actor Udo Kier) with their loud music and rowdiness. An older woman appears in the video: the woman shares a strong resemblance to Leona Helmsley. She tells police officers about the disturbance as Stefani and Eve disrupt the party. Dr. Dre also makes an appearance at the end of the video when he comes to jail and pays the bail for Eve and Stefani. Fellow Ruff Ryders Jadakiss and Styles P appear in a scene in which Eve acts as a bartender.
