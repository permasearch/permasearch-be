Lancelot encounters a cart-driving dwarf, who says he will tell Lancelot where Guinevere and her captor went if Lancelot agrees to ride in his cart. Lancelot boards the cart reluctantly since this is a dishonorable form of transport for a knight.[5] Gawain, not about to demean himself, chooses to follow them on horseback. Along this journey they encounter many obstacles, the most prominent one arising because of other people being unwilling to talk to Lancelot since he is thought to be of a lowly status because he is riding in the cart. His first trial comes when a maiden offers a bed for the knights, but refuses to let Lancelot lie on it. It is then revealed to be a trap to kill the knights, but it does not faze Lancelot.
