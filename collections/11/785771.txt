This is the magnitude of the acceleration of the particle and the vector dT/ds is the acceleration vector. Geometrically, the curvature รยบ measures how fast the unit tangent vector to the curve rotates.[3] If a curve keeps close to the same direction, the unit tangent vector changes very little and the curvature is small; where the curve undergoes a tight turn, the curvature is large.
