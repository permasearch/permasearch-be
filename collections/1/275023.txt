Through the 2014 season, the NFL had a blackout policy in which games were 'blacked out' on local television in the home team's area if the home stadium was not sold out. Clubs could elect to set this requirement at only 85%, but they would have to give more ticket revenue to the visiting team; teams could also request a specific exemption from the NFL for the game. The vast majority of NFL games were not blacked out; only 6% of games were blacked out during the 2011 season,[103] and only two games were blacked out in 2013 and none in 2014.[104] The NFL announced in March 2015 that it would suspend its blackout policy for at least the 2015 season.[104] According to Nielsen, the NFL regular season since 2012 was watched by at least 200 million individuals, accounting for 80% of all television households in the United States and 69% of all potential viewers in the United States. NFL regular season games accounted for 31 out of the top 32 most-watched programs in the fall season and an NFL game ranked as the most-watched television show in all 17 weeks of the regular season. At the local level, NFL games were the highest-ranked shows in NFL markets 92% of the time.[105] Super Bowls account for the 22 most-watched programs (based on total audience) in US history, including a record 167Â million people that watched Super Bowl XLVIII, the conclusion to the 2013 season.[106]
