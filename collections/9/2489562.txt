On April 26, 2008, an appeals court upheld the civil case verdict, but cut Blake's penalty assessment in half, to $15 million. Blake's attorneys had protested that jurors improperly discussed the Michael Jackson and O. J. Simpson verdicts during deliberations of his case, but the appeals judge ruled that such discussions were not improper.[33][34]
