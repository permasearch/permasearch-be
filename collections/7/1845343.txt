As production of the B-47 came to an end, the Wichita factory was phased in for B-52D production, with Seattle responsible for 101 D-models and Wichita 69.[71] Both plants continued to build the B-52E, with 42 built at Seattle and 58 at Wichita,[72] and the B-52F (44 from Seattle and 45 from Wichita).[73] For the B-52G, it was decided in 1957 to transfer all production to Wichita, which freed up Seattle for other tasks (in particular the production of airliners).[74][75] Production ended in 1962 with the B-52H, with 742 aircraft built, plus the original two prototypes.[76]
