Executive Order 6102 also led to the extreme rarity of the 1933 Double Eagle gold coin. The order caused all gold coin production to cease and all 1933 minted coins to be destroyed. About 20 illegal coins were stolen, leading to a standing United States Secret Service warrant for arrest and confiscation of the coin.[citation needed] A legalized surviving coin sold for over $7.5 million in 2002, making it one of the most valuable coins in the world.[6]
