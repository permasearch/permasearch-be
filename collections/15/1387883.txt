Addala travelled to Yanam and other places in East Godavari district to study the mentality and behaviour of the local people.[64] He noticed that about 80 percent of the families had good fathers, and their sons (who were struggling to find jobs and establish themselves) reconciled easily after small disagreements. Addala decided to convey in the film that life would be easier if small problems can be corrected.[64] Most of the characters, except Seetha, are drawn from real life; Mahesh's character represents youth, and Venkatesh and Prakash Raj's characters exemplify an elder brother and a middle-class father.[64]
