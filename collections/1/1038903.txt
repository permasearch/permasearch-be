Alexandra "Alex" Drake is a fictional character created by I. Marlene King and portrayed by Troian Bellisario on the American television series Pretty Little Liars. She was officially introduced during the series finale, revealed to be Spencer Hastings' identical twin sister as well as the elusive "A.D.". Alex believed the Liars knew who was accountable for Charlotte Drake's homicide and was also set on physically replacing Spencer due to being jealous of the upbringing that she was able to have. She was adopted by a wealthy British family that later abandoned her, forcing Alex to bounce around foster homes and orphanages for a large portion of her childhood. She is believed to be the deadliest antagonist of the series.
