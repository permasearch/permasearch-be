Lauren Tingle of CMT gave the song a positive review, writing "it definitely sounds like it could have been born in Timberlake's musically rich home state of Tennessee. The pop singer's high tenor and Stapleton's gravely melisma accent the song's driving acoustic rhythm guitars, horns and syncopated percussion."[6] In Billboard, Natalie Maher stated the climax of the song occurs "as the two are joined by a full choir, and added band, and then slowly comes down off itself with the line, "maybe it's greatest to say nothing.""[12] Stephen Trageser of Nashville Scene deemed the track "an anthemic tune about something ostensibly honorable," and went on to interpret the lyrics.[8] Cillea Houghton of Taste of Country called the song a "jam" where the singer "trade lines on an upbeat, genre-less track that could easily nestle into country radio."[16] Emily Yahr of The Washington Post said the song "has a guitar-driven sound that could theoretically fit into the modern country world."[17] Billboard's critics ranked it among the best songs of the first half of 2018.[18]
