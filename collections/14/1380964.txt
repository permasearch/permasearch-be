The large boltface combined with the maximum pressure means that the .338 Lapua Magnum should only be chambered in rifles that are capable of handling such large high pressure cartridges and thus high bolt thrust safely. Chambering such powerful super magnum cartridges in rifles intended for normal magnum rifle cartridges and using high pressure loads can cause serious or fatal injury to the shooter and bystanders.
