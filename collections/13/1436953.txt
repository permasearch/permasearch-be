On 19 February, after overdubs onto "Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing", recording resumed on "You Gotta Pay Your Dues", with Starr overdubbing another lead vocal.[3] Harrison was not present at the session that evening, although Eric Clapton may have been involved.[4] During the session, Starr decided to remake the song; a new basic track was then taped between 7 and 11 pm. Take 30 was labelled "best" and onto this take, two bass parts were added. This version was also discarded, however, since Starr again decided to remake the song.[3]
