In analyzing the bonding, it is a complex of Rh(I), a d8 transition metal ion. From the perspective of the 18-electron rule, the four ligands each provides two electrons, for a total of 16-electrons. As such the compound is coordinatively unsaturated. Furthermore, in solution the complex undergoes fast dynamic exchange processes both intermolecular (one of the PPh3 is labile and is constantly exchanged between the inner coordination Rh sphere and the solution, although this fast equilibrium is really balanced towards the starting triphosphine complex, K = 10âˆ’5 M) and intramolecular (fluxionality).[7]
