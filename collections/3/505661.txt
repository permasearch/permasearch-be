In the 2014–15 season, the Penguins led the Metropolitan Division for the first half of the season. However, after losing players such as Olli Maatta—shoulder surgery—and Pascal Dupuis—a blood clot in his lungs—to injuries and illnesses including the mumps, the team fell to fourth in the Division. The team also led the League in penalty minutes throughout the season. As a result, the Penguins were in danger of elimination from playoff contention with one game remaining in the regular season. In the final game, however, the Penguins clinched the eighth and final playoff spot with a win against Buffalo, which simultaneously eliminated Boston from playoff contention after the team's loss to Tampa Bay. Nonetheless, Pittsburgh would lose in five games to the New York Rangers in the first round of the playoffs.
