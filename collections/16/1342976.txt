The Arrernte Aboriginal people[8] have made their home in the Central Australian desert in and around the site of the future Alice Springs for thousands of years, with evidence suggesting Indigenous occupation of the region dating back at least 30,000 years.[9] The Aboriginal name for Alice Springs is Mparntwe.[10] Many Arrernte people also live in communities outside of Alice Springs and on outstations.[citation needed]
