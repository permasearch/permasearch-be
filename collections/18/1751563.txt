In the United States, racial profiling of minorities by law-enforcement officials has been called racial discrimination.[38] Within the criminal justice system in the United States, minorities are convicted and imprisoned disproportionately when compared to the majority.[39][40] As early as 1866, the Civil Rights Act and Civil Rights Act of 1871 provided a remedy for intentional racism in employment by private employers and state and local public employers. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 expanded the damages available in Title VII cases and granted Title VII plaintiffs the right to a jury trial.
