Five years later, Reilly discovers that May Parker is dying from a stroke, so he returns to New York. There, Reilly encounters Peter Parker, who has become bitter and angry following several tragedies. While they initially come to blows, they quickly begin working together, Ben donning his old Spider-Man mask and gloves over his civilian clothes in his first outing. Soon after, Reilly dons a makeshift but more detailed costume, consisting of an all-red suit and mask under a blue sleeveless hoodie with a black spider motif, and is dubbed the "Scarlet Spider" by the press.
