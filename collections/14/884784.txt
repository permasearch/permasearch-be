Milton prepares for a live-action role-playing battle (L.A.R.P.) but his friends don't want to participate because they think it's uncool (except for Rudy who thinks it sounds like fun). But after thinking of all the things Milton has done for them, they decide to join him and show up just in time to help him beat the Dark Knights and win the game. Meanwhile, Jerry tries to impress Kelsey Vargas but keeps lying to her.
