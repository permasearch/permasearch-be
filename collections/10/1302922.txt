After Vaughan's divorce with Lenora "Lenny" Darlene Bailey became final, recording for Double Trouble's fourth and final studio album, In Step, began at Kiva Studios in Memphis, Tennessee, working with producer Jim Gaines and co-songwriter Doyle Bramhall.[170] Initially, he had doubts about his musical and creative abilities after achieving sobriety, but he gained confidence as the sessions progressed. Shannon later recalled: "In Step was, for him, a big growing experience. In my opinion, it's our best studio album, and I think he felt that way, too."[164] Bramhall, who had also entered rehab, wrote songs with Vaughan about addiction and redemption.[171] According to Vaughan, the album was titled In Step because "I'm finally in step with life, in step with myself, in step with my music."[172] The album's liner notes include the quote "Thank God the elevator's broken," a reference to the twelve-step program proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).[173]
