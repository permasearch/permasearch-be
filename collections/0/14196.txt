At Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 8, 2009, it was announced that the 13-inch unibody MacBook would be upgraded and re-branded as a MacBook Pro,[39] leaving only the white polycarbonate MacBook in the MacBook line.[40] It was also announced that the entire MacBook Pro line would use the non user-removable battery first introduced in the 17-inch MacBook Pro.[41] The updated MacBook Pro 13- and the 15-inch would each have up to a claimed seven hours of battery life, while the 17-inch would keep its eight-hour capacity.[39][41] Some sources even reported up to eight hours of battery life for the 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pros during casual use,[42] while others reported around six hours.[34] Like the 17-inch MacBook Pro, Apple claims that they will last around 1,000 charge cycles while still containing 80 percent of their capacity.[43] Graphics card options stayed the same from the previous release, although the 13-inch[44] and the base model 15-inch, came with only the GeForce 9400M GPU.[45] The screens were also improved, gaining a claimed 60 percent greater color gamut.[44][45] All of these mid 2009 models also included a FireWire 800 port and all except the 17-inch models would receive an SD card slot.[31] The 17-inch model would retain its ExpressCard/34 slot.[41] For the 13-inch MacBook Pro, the Kensington lock slot was moved to the right side of the chassis.[46] In August 2009, Apple extended the "matte" anti-glare display option to the 15-inch MacBook Pro.[47]
