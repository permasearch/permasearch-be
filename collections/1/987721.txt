Hot Dog Guy (voiced by Dan Russell, season 2-4; Alex Jordan season 4 onward) is a guy who, when in contact, is awkward with Gumball. He made periodic appearances prior to the episode "The Hug", when Gumball hugs him several times to prove he is not predictable to Darwin. In "The Awkwardness", Gumball wants to buy ketchup for a hot dog before running into the Hot Dog Guy many other times in the episode. In "The Nest" he is seemingly eaten by the carnivorous baby turtles, but came back. His butt exploded in “The Castle” and he has eaten alive by Gumball in a bus in “The Awkwardness”.
