In 2017, critics have called for Suu Kyi's Nobel prize to be revoked, citing her silence over the persecution of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar.[224][225] Some activists criticised Aung San Suu Kyi for her silence on the 2012 Rakhine State riots[226] (later repeated during the 2015 Rohingya refugee crisis), and her perceived indifference to the plight of the Rohingya, Myanmar’s persecuted Muslim minority.[227][228] In 2012, she told reporters she did not know if the Rohingya could be regarded as Burmese citizens.[229] In a 2013 interview with the BBC's Mishal Husain, Suu Kyi did not condemn violence against the Rohingya and denied that Muslims in Myanmar have been subject to ethnic cleansing, insisting that the tensions were due to a “climate of fear” caused by “a worldwide perception that global Muslim power is ‘very great’.” She did condemn “hate of any kind” in the interview.[230] According to Peter Popham, in the aftermath of the interview, she expressed anger at being interviewed by a Muslim.[231] Husain had challenged Suu Kyi that almost all of the impact of violence was against the Rohingya, in response to Suu Kyi’s claim that violence was happening on both sides, and Peter Popham described her position on the issue as one of purposeful ambiguity for political gain.[232][page needed]
