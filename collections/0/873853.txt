The older part of downtown has a well defined grid of broad, tree-lined avenues, with the center point of the grid at Tabernacle and Main Street in the heart of the historic district. All streets parallel to Tabernacle run east-west and streets parallel to Main run north-south. The campus of Dixie State University lies several blocks east of the historic district along University Avenue. Despite decades of rapid growth and new development in the city, the tallest buildings remain low-rise at no more than five to six stories tall.
