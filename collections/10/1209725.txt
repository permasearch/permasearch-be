Dry gangrene is the end result of chronic ischemia without infection. If ischemia is detected early, when ischemic wounds rather than gangrene are present, the process can be treated by revascularization (via vascular bypass or angioplasty).[medical citation needed] However, once gangrene has developed, the affected tissues are not salvageable.[medical citation needed]
