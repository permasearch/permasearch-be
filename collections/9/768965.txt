In April 2002, eWeek announced a rumor that Apple had a version of Mac OS X code-named Marklar, which ran on Intel x86 processors. The idea behind Marklar was to keep Mac OS X running on an alternative platform should Apple become dissatisfied with the progress of the PowerPC platform.[100] These rumors subsided until late in May 2005, when various media outlets, such as The Wall Street Journal[101] and CNET,[102] announced that Apple would unveil Marklar in the coming months.[103][104][105]
