Christianity had been introduced into the British Isles during the Roman occupation.[56] The early Christian Berber author, Tertullian, writing in the third century, said that "Christianity could even be found in Britain."[57] The Roman Emperor Constantine (306–337), granted official tolerance to Christianity with the Edict of Milan in 313.[58] Then, in the reign of Emperor Theodosius "the Great" (378–395), Christianity was made the official religion of the Roman Empire.[59]
