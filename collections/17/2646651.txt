John Watson McCrindle published a reconstructed version of Indica in 1887, but his reconstruction is not universally accepted. For example, the earliest confirmed description of Gangaridai appears in the writings of the 1st century BCE writer Diodorus. McCrindle believed that Diodorus' source for this description was the now-lost book of Megasthenes. However, according to A. B. Bosworth (1996), Diodorus obtained this information from Hieronymus of Cardia: Diodorus described Ganges as 30 stadia wide; it is well-attested by other sources that Megasthenes described the median or minimum width of Ganges as 100 stadia.[13]
