Ben Tramer attends Haddonfield High School with Laurie Strode. It is revealed by Laurie in the original Halloween film that she has a crush on Ben when she tells Annie that she would like to go to the dance with him. Later in the film, Annie tells Laurie that she called Ben and told him, and that he was interested. However, Laurie is embarrassed by this and asks Annie to call him back and tell him that she was only kidding. But Annie tells Laurie that she would only consider doing so if she babysits Lindsey while she goes to pick up her boyfriend, to which Laurie agrees.
