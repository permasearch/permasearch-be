Hughes started the 2009–10 Premier League campaign with a 2–0 away win at former club Blackburn,[49] followed by a 1–0 win over another former club, Barcelona, in the Joan Gamper Trophy at a capacity Camp Nou.[50] City then won 1–0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers at Eastlands,[51] followed by Crystal Palace in the League Cup 2–0 and Portsmouth 1–0 to maintain a 100% clean sheet start to the season.[52] City continued in good form, beating Arsenal 4–2 and West Ham 3–1 either side of a 4–3 derby day defeat to Manchester United. City would then, however, go on a run of seven-straight draws.[53]
