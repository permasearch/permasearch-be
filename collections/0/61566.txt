During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, but nothing was confirmed by Victor Salva or the movie studio.[6] On August 16, the AMC Theaters website stated Jeepers Creepers 3 opens on September 26, 2017. On August 29, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night. Fathom Events then announced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Jonathan Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.[7] A second showing in theaters on October 4 was later added.[8] Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after, "this Fall, the Creeper returns. See the next film in the iconic horror franchise when Jeepers Creepers 3 returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4."[9] Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters[10] and Galaxy Theaters[11]
