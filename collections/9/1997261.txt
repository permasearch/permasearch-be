Q. Mr. President, I wonder if we could retrace that reference to the atom bomb? Did we understand you clearly that the use of the atomic bomb is under active consideration?Truman: Always has been. It is one of our weapons.Q. Does that mean, Mr. President, use against military objectives, or civilian—Truman: It's a matter that the military people will have to decide. I'm not a military authority that passes on those things.Q. Mr. President, perhaps it would be better if we are allowed to quote your remarks on that directly?Truman: I don't think—I don't think that is necessary.Q. Mr. President, you said this depends on United Nations action. Does that mean that we wouldn't use the atomic bomb except on a United Nations authorization?Truman: No, it doesn't mean that at all. The action against Communist China depends on the action of the United Nations. The military commander in the field will have charge of the use of the weapons, as he always has.[88]
