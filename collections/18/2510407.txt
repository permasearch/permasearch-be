Heaven, Heartache and the Power of Love was recorded in Nashville, Tennessee, United States in three separate locations: the Sound Emporium, Rukkus Room, and Compass Studio.[1] The album itself consisted of 13 tracks of recorded material. Thom Jurek of Allmusic found that the album's production did not include any "studio gimmicks" such as "compression trickery". He also enjoyed the fact that musical instruments such as electric guitars and drums sounded traditional and not like 1970s rock arena music.[2] Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine found Heaven, Heartache and the Power of Love to be a significant departure from any of Yearwood's previous releases. Keefe mentioned that the most recognizable departure was that it was recorded under an independent label, however the label has given more attention than thought of.[3] Jim Malec of The 9513 believed that the album combined the genres of Contemporary country, Western, Americana, Blues, and traditional country music,[4] while Jurek thought all of the album's tracks were recorded in a "country vein".[2]
