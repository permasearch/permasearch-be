The lair was quiet as the finale opened. Suddenly, a surge of energy poured forth from Stan Lee's television screen, traveling down the wires and out of the lair, activating televisions around the city. Stan Lee announced from "every channel" that he would soon be crowning the next great superhero. As Lee gazed at comic book covers featuring Feedback and Fat Momma, he reviewed the various challenges they had faced and the superheroic traits they had exhibited through the course of the competition. Matthew went 1st and spoke again of how his father, suffering from chronic pain, had killed himself. Following his father's suicide, Matthew looked to Lee and his comics for male role models. Lee, he said, was his hero. As he had before, Lee said how touched he was by Matthew's words. Nell said that her best moment during the show was when Lee told her he was proud of her. She said that her father was her hero. She believed that a strong man was the center of a strong family and that with her father growing older she knew that he wouldn't be with her much longer, so she cherished every day she had with him. Lee then told Fat Momma that she was one of his heroes. As the season ended, Feedback flew off-screen and was seen flying through space.
