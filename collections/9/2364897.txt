A triggering incident that led to the kindling of Telugu people's self-respect in Hyderabad state occurred on 12 November 1921, in the Nizam State "social conference" when a Telugu lawyer, Mr. Allampalli Venkata Rama Rao, spoke in Telugu on a resolution. Allampalli Venkata Rama Rao was heckled and shouted at by those in attendance in the audience, among whom were speakers who earlier spoke freely in English, Urdu and Marathi. This event is thought to have mobilized the sentiment of Telugu-language speakers and the perception of that language's "true position" in Hyderabad State .
