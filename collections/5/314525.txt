The series was renewed before the airing of the second season episode "The Carpet". Series star Jenna Fischer noted that "It is rare in this business to hear news of a pickup so early", but that NBC was very pleased with how well the show was doing.[6] It had previously, and erroneously, been advertised that the show would finish its run at the end of March 2006. Fischer later explained that while the season would end – actually in May – the show would continue.[6]
