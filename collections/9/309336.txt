Oliver becomes jealous when Kaz begins spending time with Chase to build a drone for a drone race. Chase agrees to implement Kaz's unusual ideas into the drone design, but reveals to Oliver that he plans to remove the designs before the competition to increase the chances of winning. After Oliver tells Kaz about Chase's plans, they decide to take one of Davenport's drones to enter it in the competition against Chase. At the competition, Chase tells Kaz and Oliver that the drone they activated is an attack drone designed to destroy any threat it senses. Chase also reveals that he chose to leave Kaz's design ideas intact. Meanwhile, Perry reveals that she comes from a family of circus people, and that the women in her family were skilled tightrope walkers. Perry, feeling the need to achieve an accomplishment of her own, decides to tightrope-walk between two skyscrapers, which makes Bree nervous for Perry's safety. Perry dresses up with a circus outfit and umbrella for the stunt. Perry slips from the tightrope after the attack drone flies past her, although she manages to grab onto the rope before falling. The attack drone targets Perry, who destroys it with her umbrella.
