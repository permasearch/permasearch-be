Because of their strategic position, the abbey and the village were involved in military events. In 577 a raid of the Lombards, led by Zotto, forced the monks to leave Monte Cassino to seek refuge in Rome. They came back only after more than a century. In 744, thanks to the donation of Gisulf II of Benevento, the monastery became the capital of a new state, called Terra Sancti Benedicti ("Land of Saint Benedict"). Few years later the town was re-founded by abbot Bertharius and called Eulogimenopoli, meaning "The City of Saint Benedict". In 883 the monastery and the town were again attacked, this time by Saracens, and Bertharius was killed along with some other monks.
