In 1993, Don Schultz and his team published the first text-book dedicated to IMC.[71] Their work, simply entitled, Integrated Marketing Communications, described IMC as a totally new way of looking at the whole of marketing communications, rather than looking at each of the parts separately. And, in the same year, the Medill School at Northwestern University changed their curriculum to include a focus on this new idea of integrated marketing communications rather than the traditional program which had emphasised advertising.[72] IMC emerged from an "academic department that, for several decades, had been recognized as the number one advertising program.[73] Since the mid-1990s, virtually every text-book on the subject of marketing communications has adopted an integrated perspective or has added chapters on IMC in new editions of standard works.[74] Collectively these books focus on the IMC planning processes and this represents the third distinct stage in the evolution of IMC â€“ an emphasis on managing and organising IMC.[75]
