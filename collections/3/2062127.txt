Once World War II ended in 1945, female munitions workers were expected to give up their jobs to returning male veterans and go back home to have, and care for children put off by the war.[249] In 1946, 4,000,000 women were fired from their jobs.[249] But for many women, work was an economic necessity, and they simply went back to the sort of low-paying jobs they had held before the war.[249] However, most people in the 1950s felt that ideally women should be homemakers and men should be breadwinners.[250] A booming economy helped to make this possible; by the mid-1950s, 40% of Americans were living in the suburbs with, on average, 3.8 children, two cars and two television sets.[250] This lifestyle affected the aspirations of housewives and mothers: only 38% of women went to college in 1958 compared to 47% in 1920, despite the availability of more federal aid to pay for university education in the post-war America.[251] Furthermore, although 46% of women worked during the 1950s, 75% of them worked in simple clerical or sales jobs.[250] The average working woman in the 1950s earned 60% of the average working man's salary.[250]
