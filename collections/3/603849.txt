Object relations involves the ability to form and maintain coherent representations of others and of the self.  The concept refers not only to the people one interacts with in the external world but also to significant others who are remembered and represented within the mind.  Adequate functioning implies the ability to maintain a basically positive view of the other, even when one feels disappointed, frustrated, or angered by the other's behavior.  Disturbances in object relations may manifest themselves through an inability to fall in love, emotional coldness, lack of interest in or withdrawal from interactions with others, intense dependency, and/or an excessive need to control relationships (Berzhoff, Flanagan, & Hertz, 2011).
