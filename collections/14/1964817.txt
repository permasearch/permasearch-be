It will be noted that several triads could fulfill different functions depending on the context. In the simplified theory where the functions in major and minor are on the same degrees of the scale, the possible functions of triads on degrees I to VI of the scale could be summarized as in the table below[14] (degrees II in minor and VII in major, diminished fifths in the diatonic scale, are considered as chords without fundamental).
