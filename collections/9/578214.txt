When the male staff hear Mrs. Slocombe talking to Miss Brahms about a "happy event", they think that Mrs. Slocombe is pregnant. However, it turns out that it is her cat that is expecting, and Mrs. Slocombe asks Mr. Rumbold if the cat can give birth in the fitting room so she can be near it. When he refuses, Mr. Harman smuggles it in. Meanwhile, Young Mr. Grace tries to show the staff how to improve sales.
