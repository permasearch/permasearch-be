Originating in Europe, the "blonde stereotype" is also associated with being less serious or less intelligent.[93] Blonde jokes are a class of jokes based on the stereotype of blonde women as unintelligent.[93][136] In Brazil, this extends to blonde women being looked down, as reflected in sexist jokes, as also sexually licentious.[137] It is believed the originator of the "dumb blonde" was an eighteenth-century blonde French prostitute named Rosalie Duth√© whose reputation of being beautiful but dumb inspired a play about her called Les Curiosites de la Foire (Paris 1775).[93] Blonde actresses have contributed to this perception; some of them include Marilyn Monroe, Judy Holliday, Jayne Mansfield, and Goldie Hawn during her time at Laugh-In.[93]
