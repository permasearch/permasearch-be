The Church was responsible for the system of tithes, a levy of 10% on "all agrarian produce... other natural products gained via labour... wages received by servants and labourers, and to the profits of rural merchants".[78] Tithes gathered in the form of produce could be either consumed by the recipient, or sold on and bartered for other resources.[79] The tithe was relatively onerous for the typical peasant, although in many instances the actual levy fell below the desired 10%.[80] Many clergy moved to the towns as part of the urban growth of the period, and by 1300 around one in twenty city dwellers was a clergyman.[81] One effect of the tithe was to transfer a considerable amount of agriculture wealth into the cities, where it was then spent by these urban clergy.[81] The need to sell tithe produce that could not be consumed by the local clergy also spurred the growth of trade.[82]
