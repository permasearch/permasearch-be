Cirrus forms from tropical cyclones, and is commonly seen fanning out from the eyewalls of hurricanes. A large shield of cirrus and cirrostratus typically accompanies the high altitude outflow of hurricanes or typhoons,[9] and these can make the underlying rain bands—and sometimes even the eye—difficult to detect in satellite photographs.[15]
