Cocaine prevents the reuptake of the neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine.[20] Thus they stay in the synapse longer, causing excitement of the sympathetic nervous system and evoking a stress response.[21] The euphoria experienced by cocaine users is thought to be largely due to the way it prevents the neurotransmitter serotonin from being reabsorbed by the presynaptic neuron which released it.[31][14][20]
