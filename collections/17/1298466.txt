For using rock/metal instrumentation the band is sometimes classified as a rap rock/rap metal group.[4] The double album Skull & Bones consists of a pure rap album ("Skull") and an entire CD of rap/rock/nu metal songs ("Bones"). In the live album Live at The Fillmore some of the old classics are played in a rock/metal version, with Sen Dog's band SX-10 and Eric Bobo playing the rock instrument.
