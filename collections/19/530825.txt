The first use of X-rays under clinical conditions was by John Hall-Edwards in Birmingham, England on 11 January 1896, when he radiographed a needle stuck in the hand of an associate.[26] On 14 February 1896 Hall-Edwards was also the first to use X-rays in a surgical operation.[27] In early 1896, several weeks after RÃ¶ntgen's discovery, Ivan Romanovich Tarkhanov irradiated frogs and insects with X-rays, concluding that the rays "not only photograph, but also affect the living function".[28]
