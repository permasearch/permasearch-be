Candida in its pathogenic hyphal form is occasionally seen in biopsies of idiopathic leukoplakia. It is debated whether candida infection is a primary cause of leukoplakia with or without dysplasia, or a superimposed (secondary) infection that occurs after the development of the lesion. It is known that Candida species thrive in altered tissues.[25] Some leukoplakias with dysplasia reduce or disappear entirely following use of antifungal medication.[1] Smoking, which as discussed above can lead to the development of leukoplakia, can also promote oral candidiasis.[1] Candida in association with leukoplakia should not be confused with white patches which are primarily caused by candida infection, such as chronic hyperplastic candidiasis ("candidal leukoplakia").[17]
