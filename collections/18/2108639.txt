NIMD ran further tests in 2010 and 2011. Hair from 700 Taiji residents were tested for mercury; 117 males and 77 females who showed over 10 ppm underwent further neurological tests. Again, no participant displayed any signs of mercury poisoning.[27] In August 2012, a research project to investigate the health effects of mercury on children was launched by NIMD.[28]
