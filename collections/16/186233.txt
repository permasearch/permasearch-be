Since the early 1980s, and particularly since 1989, by means of vigorous monitoring and the strict maintenance of standards, United Nations human rights organizations have encouraged China to move away from its insistence on the principle of noninterference, to take part in resolutions critical of human rights conditions in other nations, and to accept the applicability to itself of human rights norms and UN procedures. Even though China has continued to suppress political dissidents at home, and appears at times resolutely defiant of outside pressure to reform, Ann Kent argues that it has gradually begun to implement some international human rights standards.[77] On human rights issues, the PRC has been increasingly influential by the bargaining of its robust Macroeconomics growth[78] for the domestic social equality.[79] In 1995, they won 43 percent of the votes in the General Assembly; by 2006 they won 82 percent.[80]
