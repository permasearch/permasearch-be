On May 19, 2014, the United States House of Representatives voted to pass H.R. 2203, a bill that would award Nicklaus the Congressional Gold Medal "in recognition of his service to the nation in promoting excellence and good sportsmanship."[84] The bill says that Nicklaus' "magnetic personality and unfailing sense of kindness and thoughtfulness have endeared him to millions throughout the world."[85] Congressman Thomas Massie objected to a voice vote, and demanded a roll call vote.[86] He then tried to rally opposition to the measure, but the vote passed easily over Massie's objection: 371â€“10.[86]
