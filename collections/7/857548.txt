The most popularly significant case decided by the Mason court was the Mabo case (1992),[99] in which the court found that the common law was capable of recognising native title. The decision was one of the High Court's most controversial of all time and represented the tendency of the Mason court to receive "high praise and stringent criticism in equal measure."[98] Other controversial cases included the War Crimes Act case (1991),[100] regarding the validity of the War Crimes Act 1945; Dietrich v The Queen (1992),[101] in which the court found that a lack of legal representation in a serious criminal case can result in an unfair trial; Sykes v Cleary (1992),[102] regarding the disputed election of Phil Cleary; and Teoh's case (1995),[103] in which the court held that ratification of a treaty by the executive could create a legitimate expectation that members of the executive would act in accordance with that treaty.
