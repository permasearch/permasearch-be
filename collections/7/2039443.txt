By early 1933, Bell's opinion on the NFL had changed, and he wanted to become an owner of a team based in Philadelphia.[38] After being advised by the NFL that a prerequisite to a franchise being rendered in Philadelphia was that the Pennsylvania Blue Laws would have to be mollified,[39] he was the force majeure in lobbying to getting the laws deprecated.[39] He borrowed funds from Frances Upton,[40] partnered with Wray,[40] and he procured the rights to a franchise in Philadelphia[40] which he christened as the Philadelphia Eagles.[41]
