On December 3, 1993, Tribune Broadcasting signed an affiliation agreement with WGN-TV/Chicago to become a charter affiliate of The WB Television Network, a joint venture between the Warner Bros. Television unit of Time Warner, the Tribune Company and original network president Jamie Kellner (the latter two partners held minority ownership stakes in the network); this made the station an affiliate of a broadcast network for the first time since the August 1956 shutdown of the DuMont Television Network (WGN-TV had been a primary CBS/secondary DuMont affiliate from its sign-on on April 6, 1948, before becoming exclusively affiliated with DuMont after CBS moved to WBKB-TV (channel 4, now WBBM-TV on channel 2) in 1953).[15] Through the agreement and Tribune's ownership interest in The WB – which resulted in most of the company's independent stations becoming charter affiliates of the network – The WB allowed the WGN superstation feed to nationally distribute its prime time (and when it was added by The WB in September 1995, children's) programming, in order to make the network available to areas of the United States that did not initially have a local affiliate. The WB was the second network to make its programming available directly to pay television providers to designated "white areas" without broadcast affiliate clearances; Fox had earlier launched Foxnet, a cable channel created specifically for the same impetus behind the WGN-WB agreement, which operated from June 1991 to September 2006.[16]
