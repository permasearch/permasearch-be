Around 529 A.D. St. Benedict of Nursia (480-543 A.D.), later a Christian saint, the founder of western monasticism and the Order of St. Benedict, today the patron saint of Europe, established the first monastery in Europe (Monte Cassino) on a hilltop between Rome and Naples, that became a model for the Western monasticism and one of the major cultural centers of Europe throughout the Middle Ages, where he wrote the "Rule", containing directions for monks and Christians. The Rule of Saint Benedict is one of the most important written works in the shaping of Western civilian society because it included a written constitution, authority limited by law, and a degree of democracy. Besides, it mandated the moral obligations to care for the sick. In Monte Cassino St. Benedict founded a hospital that is considered today to have been the first hospital in Europe of the new era. There Benedictine monks took care of the sick and wounded according to the Benedict's Rule. The monastic routine called for hard work. The care of the sick was such an important duty that those caring for them were enjoined to act as if they served Christ directly. Benedict founded twelve communities for monks at nearby Subiaco (about 64Â km to the east of Rome), where hospitals were settled too as adjuncts to the monasteries in order to provide charity and care for soldiers and patients. Since that time the Benedictines were very involved in healing and caring for the sick and dying, so in many cases early Medieval medicine was closely connected with Christianity and the Benedictines in particular. This is why very often the early Middle Ages are called "the Benedictine centuries".
