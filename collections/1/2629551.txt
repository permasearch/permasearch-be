The Confederation of African Football (CAF) is the governing body for association football in Africa. It organizes three club competitions: the CAF Champions League (formerly African Cup of Champions Clubs), the CAF Confederation Cup and the CAF Super Cup. CAF was also responsible for the African Cup Winners' Cup and the CAF Cup, until their merging in 2004 when CAF Confederation Cup took their places. Together with Asian Football Confederation (AFC), it also organized the Afro-Asian Club Championship, which was last held in 1998, before its replacement by FIFA's Club World Cup .
