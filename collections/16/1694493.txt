The cadenza is also novel in that it is written out as part of the concerto[9] and located before the recapitulation.[10] In a typical Classical concerto, the cadenza is improvised by the performing soloist and occurs at the end of a movement, after the recapitulation and just before the final coda. Mendelssohn's written cadenza was not included in the first published version of the concerto, but instead a "streamlined" version by Ferdinand David without the contrapuntal complexity of the original. This is the most played version today, although some artists, e.g. Arabella Steinbacher, play Mendelssohn's original.[16] Joshua Bell performs the concerto with his own cadenza.[17]
