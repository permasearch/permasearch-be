In 629 C.E, an expedition was prepared to take punitive action against the Ghassanids, a vassal state of Eastern Roman empire. Muhammad appointed Zayd ibn Harithah as the commander of the force. In the event of Zayd's death, the command was to be taken over by Ja`far ibn Ab카 T훮lib, and if Jafar were to be killed, the command would be in the hands of `Abd Allah ibn Rawahah. In the event that all three were killed, the men of the expedition were to select a commander from amongst themselves.[18]
