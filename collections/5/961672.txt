The Concorde supersonic airliner could use reverse thrust in the air to increase the rate of descent.  Only the inboard engines were used, and the engines were placed in reverse idle only in subsonic flight and when the aircraft was below 30,000 ft in altitude. This would increase the rate of descent to around 10,000 ft/min.[citation needed]
