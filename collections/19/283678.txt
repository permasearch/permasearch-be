Since October 19, 2016, Thomas Sanders runs on YouTube a web series, Sanders Sides, co-written with Joan,[102] in which he discusses personal or existential issues with four main characters, collectively known as the titular "Sanders Sides". On the series, the Sanders Sides are "physical mental projections" of Thomas' mind,[103] and represent different aspects of Thomas'[Note 3] one and only personality. Sanders repeatedly made this clear as he saw some viewers calling them "personalities", as if Thomas was portrayed having dissociative identity disorder, which is something different to what Sanders wants to portray on the series, comparing the series instead to Inside Out, a movie which Sanders claims as an inspiration for Sanders Sides.[104] Sanders Sides consists of two seasons with a total as of October 2018 of 26 episodes released on a variable periodicity, but generally, barring occasional longer hiatuses, on a fortnightly to monthly average basis. Season 1 has 19 episodes released from October 19, 2016 to July 19, 2017. Season 2 began on September 1, 2017 and as of October 2018, it has 7 episodes.[105] The Sanders Sides are usually all played by Sanders himself, even though on occasion they have also been played by Joan, Valerie Torres-Rosario, Terrence Williams Jr. and Talyn.[106] Stokes and Talyn also collaborate extensively with Sanders on the production of the series, researching for the main topics of each episode, making props, decorating sets, designing and hand sewing some pieces of costume, doing some of the makeup, and helping with editing and visual effects.[107] Sanders Sides has featured sometimes appearances of guest stars like Lilly Singh[108] or Butch Hartman who, apart from appearing as himself, created an animated sequence exclusively for Sanders Sides where Thomas and his Sides became cartoon characters. Tara Strong, who had already appeared in several Vines and Sanders Shorts, also made a voice cameo in Hartman's episode.[109]
