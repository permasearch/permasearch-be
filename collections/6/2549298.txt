Slimer had an antagonist named Professor Norman Dweeb, an archetypical mad scientist usually accompanied by a sidekick pink poodle named Elizabeth. Dweeb wants to capture Slimer to experiment on him and to gain personal glory. Dweeb also made three appearances in the main series, one a clip show from the last two seasons. Other enemies of Slimer include an alley cat named Manx, a dog named Bruiser, a tough woman named Mrs. Stone, and the ghost gangsters Goolem and Zugg as well as their boss Scareface. One of the ghosts from the Slimer cartoons, the Sleaze, also reappeared in The Real Ghostbusters to be captured a second time.
