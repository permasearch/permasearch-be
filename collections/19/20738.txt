As a result of its extreme rarity in nature,[179] most francium is synthesised in the nuclear reaction 197Au + 18O â†’ 210Fr + 5 n, yielding francium-209, francium-210, and francium-211.[191] The greatest quantity of francium ever assembled to date is about 300,000 neutral atoms,[192] which were synthesised using the nuclear reaction given above.[192] When the only natural isotope francium-223 is specifically required, it is produced as the alpha daughter of actinium-227, itself produced synthetically from the neutron irradiation of natural radium-226, one of the daughters of natural uranium-238.[193]
