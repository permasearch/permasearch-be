From 1949 to 1966, most Academy Awards for Best Costume Design in Black and White were given to a contemporary movie. On the other hand, epics, fantasies, and musicals dominated the color category.[10] Since the merger into one singular category for color films in 1967, films set in modern times have won only three times.[11] The three contemporary-set winners have been Travels with My Aunt, All That Jazz, and The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.[11] All other winners during this period have been set in the past or in a science-fictional or fantasy setting.
