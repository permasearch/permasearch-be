During the off-season, West Bromwich Albion made several improvements to their stadium, The Hawthorns. The club increased the number of wheelchair bays from 145 to 171 and installed Changing Places toilets, which are a special type of accessible toilet.[5][6] They also installed new giant screens inside the stadium,[7] created a sensory area—to cater for young fans on the autism spectrum—and added "nostalgic" artwork to the concourses.[5] The club's season ticket sales hit a seven-year high following a reduction in prices.[8]
