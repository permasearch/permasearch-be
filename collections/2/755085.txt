On 3 June 2016, Arsenal made a bid of £22 million for Vardy, triggering a release clause in his contract. Leicester offered him improved terms, and 20 days later he agreed to a new four-year deal, to be signed on his return from UEFA Euro 2016. Vardy rejected Arsenal's offer due to not being assured that he would be played in his normal position, and because of the differences between the two club's tactics, with Arsène Wenger favouring possession and Leicester playing on the counter-attack.[71]
