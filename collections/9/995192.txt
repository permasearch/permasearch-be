Kierkegaard questioned how a person changes. Some, like Hegel and Goethe, believed that an external event was required for a new epoch to begin. Kierkegaard disagreed because something might never happen in an external way that would cause a person to change and a possibility for a better life might be lost.  Marx followed after Hegel and Goethe but Tolstoy agreed more with Kierkegaard in his "view of life".[31]
