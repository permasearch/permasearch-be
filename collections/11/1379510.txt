Aditya (Akshay Kumar), an automobile engineer, is passionate about cars. Not only is he an engineer, he is also a test driver for the company. He is engaged to marry Sonia (Bipasha Basu), a budding fashion designer. Aditya and Sonia are not on the same wavelength; while he is a traditionalist, she is an ultra-modern woman for whom career comes first. Much as Aditya tries to overlook these facts, they keep coming in the way of their relationship. Nevertheless, their wedding date is fixed and their families are preparing for the event.
