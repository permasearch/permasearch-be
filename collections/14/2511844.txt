The effects of Hurricane Wilma in Florida were catastrophic, becoming the second costliest Florida hurricane ever recorded. Hurricane Wilma was first evident near Jamaica and was classified as a hurricane on October 18. Initially, orange future prices soared on October 19, 2005. As the system drew closer, schools and government offices closed on October 21. Professional and college sports games were rescheduled during Wilma's advance towards Florida. Evacuations were ordered for southwestern Florida and the Keys. As the storm made landfall, a storm surge swept into coastal sections of southern Florida and high winds led to significant damage near and along Wilma's path, particularly to the power grid. Some locations were without power for 2–3 weeks after the storm. Wilma spawned ten tornadoes in Florida.[1] At least 35 Wilma-related deaths were reported in the United States, all in Florida. Wilma was also blamed for at least 26 indirect deaths.[2][3] Damage in Florida totaled $20.6 billion (2005 USD; $22.7 billion 2008 USD).[4]
