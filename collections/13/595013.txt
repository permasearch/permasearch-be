Bend, near the geographic center of the state, is one of the ten fastest-growing metropolitan areas in the United States.[80][better source needed] In southern Oregon, Medford is a rapidly growing metro area and is home to the Rogue Valley International-Medford Airport, the state's third-busiest airport. To the south, near the California border, are the communities of Ashland and Grants Pass.
