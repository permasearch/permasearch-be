Angry, Jimmy goes to a bar run by his brother Clyde (Adam Driver), an Iraq War veteran who, on account of losing part of his left arm, wears a prosthetic hand. Max Chilblain (Seth MacFarlane), a pretentious British businessman, and his friends arrive and insult Clyde before getting in a fight with Jimmy. Meanwhile Clyde sets fire to their car with a molotov cocktail. On his way out, Jimmy yells "cauliflower", which Clyde recognizes as an old code word from when they used to commit crimes as young boys. Next day, Jimmy explains his plan to rob Speedway, exploiting his knowledge of pneumatic tube system for moving money.
