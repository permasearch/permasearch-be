This project was first commenced by the FASB and the IASB in 2006, and the IASB issued IFRS 16, Leases, on January 13, 2016. The FASB issued an ASU to improve the accounting for lease transactions on February 25, 2016. The improvements in this ASU requires organizations engaged in leasing arrangements to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with terms of 12 months or longer. Organizations are also required to recognize both operating leases and capital leases on their balance sheets, and disclose information pertaining to the lease amount, time, and uncertainties of cash flows.[55]
