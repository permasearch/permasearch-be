Lwin reunited with the former bass player from Bow Wow Wow in 1997, recreating the sound of the original band for a US tour. The reunion included appearances by a range of musicians from the young up and coming, such as Eshan Khadaroo of Beat Kitchen, (Blue Man), and the established, including Adrian Young from (No Doubt), both playing drums in place of original member Dave Barbe. The original guitarist of Bow Wow Wow, Matthew Ashman, had died of complications from diabetes in 1995, and various guitarists filled in.
