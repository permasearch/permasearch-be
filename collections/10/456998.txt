The project did not provide 5,000 jobs as expected—as of June 1964, workers numbered fewer than 100. The project did, however, incite other riverfront restoration efforts, totaling $150 million. Building projects included a 50,000-seat sports stadium, a 30-story hotel, several office towers, four parking garages, and an apartment complex.[17] The idea of a Disneyland amusement park that included "synthetic riverboat attractions" was considered but later abandoned.[63][64] The developers hoped to use the arch as a commercial catalyst, attracting visitors who would use their services.[17] One estimate found that since the 1960s, the arch has incited almost $503,000,000 worth of construction.[65]
