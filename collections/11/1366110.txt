The GAA & GPA All Stars Young Footballer of the Year (often called simply Young Footballer of the Year) is an annual award given at the end of the Championship season to a young footballer under the age of 21 who is adjudged to have been the best in Gaelic football. Players from Mayo have won this award more times (4) than players from any other county since the award was instituted in 1997. Cillian O'Connor is the only multiple winner ever of the award, and with his brother Diarmuid winning in 2015, they are also the only set of brothers to win the award.
