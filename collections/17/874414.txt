A siphon spillway in a dam is usually not technically a siphon as it is generally used to drain elevated water levels.[34] However, a siphon spillway operates as an actual siphon if it raises the flow higher than the surface of the source reservoir, as sometimes is the case when used in irrigation.[35][36] In operation, a siphon spillway is considered to be 'pipe flow' or 'closed duct flow'.[37] A normal spillway flow is pressurized by the height of the reservoir above the spillway whereas a siphon flow rate is governed by the difference in height of the inlet and outlet.[38] Some designs make use of an automatic system that uses the flow of water in a spiral vortex to remove the air above to prime the siphon. Such a design includes the volute siphon.[39]
