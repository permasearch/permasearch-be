The final of the Emperor's Cup, the national football (soccer) elimination tournament in Japan, takes place on New Year's Day, generally in the Olympic Stadium in Tokyo, though it can be moved if the stadium is under renovation. The final has taken place on New Year's Day since 1969 and is usually aired on NHK.
