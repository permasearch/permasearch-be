The terms "exceptional obedience" and "work to rule" appear to be modern variations of a similar expression frequently used by the Wobbliesâ€”"striking on the job." This tactic went by other names (and descriptions) as well. In her introduction of the 1916 pamphlet "Sabotage", Elizabeth Gurley Flynn observed that "sabotage [is] an instinctive defense [that] existed long before it was ever officially recognized by any labor organization. Sabotage means primarily: the withdrawal of efficiency."[157] (See Sabotage section, below.)
