Interesting. The expressions,      v  =     p   c  2      m  2    c  4   +  p  2    c  2        {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} ={\frac {\mathbf {p} c^{2}}{\sqrt {m^{2}c^{4}+p^{2}c^{2}}}}}   and      p  =    m  v    1 −  v  2    /   c  2        {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} ={\frac {m\mathbf {v} }{\sqrt {1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}}}  , are mathematically equivalent. Yet I take it that you consider the latter to be more accessible to the lay reader. I guess I could agree with that. On the flip side, the     ∫  v  ⋅ d  p    {\displaystyle \int \mathbf {v} \cdot d\mathbf {p} }   formulation calls out for doing the math as a function of p rather than of v, yes? (For instance, if there were yet another way to relate momentum to velocity, kinetic energy might most easily be derived by first writing v in terms of p and then integrating.) Maybe there is some way to have it both ways; perhaps by first proving the formula "that seems to be falling from the sky" and then proceeding with p. Thoughts?
