Worldwide, 0.05–2% of the population is estimated to experience anaphylaxis at some point in life.[3] Rates appear to be increasing.[3] It occurs most often in young people and females.[7][8] Of people who go to a hospital with anaphylaxis in the United States about 0.3% die.[9] The term comes from the Ancient Greek: ἀνά, translit. ana, lit. 'against', and the Ancient Greek: φύλαξις, translit. phylaxis, lit. 'protection'.[10]
