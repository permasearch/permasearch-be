The outer panels are generally thought to depict the creation of the world,[10] showing greenery beginning to clothe the still-pristine Earth.[11] God, wearing a crown similar to a papal tiara (a common convention in Netherlandish painting),[8] is visible as a tiny figure at the upper left. Bosch shows God as the father sitting with a Bible on his lap, creating the Earth in a passive manner by divine fiat.[12] Above him is inscribed a quote from Psalm 33 reading "Ipse dixit, et facta sunt: ipse mandāvit, et creāta sunt"—For he spake and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.[13] The Earth is encapsulated in a transparent sphere recalling the traditional depiction of the created world as a crystal sphere held by God or Christ.[14] It hangs suspended in the cosmos, which is shown as an impermeable darkness, whose only other inhabitant is God himself.[8]
