Following Corey's eviction, the HouseGuests engaged in their final battle in the Hang In There Kitty Part 1 of the Final Head of Household competition. In this competition, HouseGuests had to follow a laser which would lead them to one of three endurance stations. Once the laser stops, they have fifteen seconds to climb onto the station. If the laser re-appears, they must jump off of their station and follow it again. If they fail to climb onto their station within 15 seconds or if they fall before the laser re-appears, they will be eliminated. The last HouseGuest standing will win Part 1 of the competition and automatically advance to Part 3. Paul was the winner. James and Nicole then faced off in the Snap Shot Part 2 of the Final Head of Household competition. In this competition, James and Nicole competed individually. They had to read a clue and place the three HouseGuests that applied to the clue into the roller coaster car. They had to push the car down the track, then take a snapshot of the HouseGuests while in frame. If they are incorrect or the HouseGuests are not in frame, they must try again. The HouseGuest who finishes all three snapshots faster will win Part 2 and advance to Part 3 against Paul. Nicole was the winner. Paul and Nicole had the final showdown in the Scales of Just-Us Part 3 of the Final Head of Household competition. In this competition, Nicole and Paul were read a series of statements made by the jurors. The HouseGuests were required to guess how the juror completed each statement. The HouseGuest with the most points after eight questions will be the final Head of Household of the season. Paul became the final Head of Household by a score of 4-3. On Day 99, after Paul cast the sole vote to evict James, he became the final member of the jury. On Day 99, after receiving Da'Vonne, Zakiyah, Paulie, Natalie and Corey's votes, Paul received $50,000 as the runner-up, Nicole received $500,000 and was declared the winner of Big Brother 18, the first female winner since Rachel Reilly in Big Brother 13 and the first female to win against a male in the final two and, Victor was revealed to be America's Favorite HouseGuest and received $25,000, bringing his cash winnings to $30,000.
