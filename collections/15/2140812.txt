The Slug Student (voiced by Bill Hader) is a student that attended Monsters University. When school starts, the Slug Student slithers to get to his class. By the time he gets to his classroom in the post-credits, he learns from the janitor (voiced by Philip Proctor) that the school year is over and slithers home.
