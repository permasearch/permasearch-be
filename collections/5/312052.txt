Skunks as Pets Canada leader Vivianne Chernoff and other activists subsequently persuaded the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to legalize importation of pen-bred skunks.[citation needed] Although NRC does not recognize the CFIA laws, the CFIA assured Chernoff that NRC cannot confiscate a micro-chipped skunk whose legality is documented with import papers and a health certificate. In 2004, Canadian activists were working on having a tear duct rabies test legalized for skunks.
