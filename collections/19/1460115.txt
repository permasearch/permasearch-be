In 2012, when the company expanded into China, the Chinese government required Mary Kay to comply with Chinese law that requires animal testing on all health and beauty products. The Chinese government carries out this testing, not Mary Kay. Thus Mary Kay has been removed from PETA's "Don't Test on Animals" list to the "Do Test" list.[55]
