Based in Germany, Spanish producer, DJ Sammy, featuring Yanou and Do on vocals re-worked an old Bryan Adams track from 1985, "Heaven" and took it to the top. Bryan Adams only managed to take the track to #38. Only lasting a week at the summit, the song was quickly overtaken by the boyband that could do no wrong. Celebrating the 50th anniversary of the UK charts, since when they first started back in 1952, the 941st No.1 came from Westlife yet again, with their 11th No. 1 single, "Unbreakable". This gave them more chart toppers than the queen of pop herself, Madonna. Only Elvis Presley, the Beatles and Cliff Richard had received more No. 1 singles than Westlife now. After a week, US superstar, Christina Aguilera returned to the top of the UK charts for the 3rd time promoting a new raunchier image with her first single from her second album, Stripped. "Dirrty" came with an overtly sexual video and despite its massive popularity in the UK, it failed to reach the Top 20 in her US homeland.
