Warren played college basketball at UCLA, where he was a three-year varsity letterman and starting guard from 1966 to 1968. Led by Lew Alcindor, the Bruins posted records of 30–0 in 1967 and 29–1 in 1968. Both teams, coached by legendary coach John Wooden, captured the NCAA national championship. Warren, the smallest Bruins starter at 5 ft 11 in (1.80 m), averaged 12.4 points as a junior in 1967. He was named to the NCAA All-Tournament team and was a consensus All-American in 1968, one of three on that UCLA team along with Alcindor and guard Lucius Allen. The team is considered one of the best in college basketball history. Warren also earned the award as the Bruins' best defender in 1966, and he won the award as the Bruins' best "team player" in 1967 and 1968.[3] Alcindor and Warren later crossed paths when Warren was an extra in the hospital flashback scene in the 1980 feature film Airplane! Warren was inducted into the UCLA Athletic Hall of Fame.[4]
