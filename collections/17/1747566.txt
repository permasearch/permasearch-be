The American M16 rifle, which replaced the M14, was lighter and considered more accurate than the AK-47 but was prone to malfunction. Often the gun suffered from a type II malfunction known as failure to extract or "brass low", which meant that a spent cartridge case remained lodged in the chamber after a bullet flew out the muzzle. According to a congressional report, the malfunction was caused primarily by a change of gunpowder in the ammunition, which was done without adequate testing and reflected a decision for which the safety of soldiers was a secondary consideration.
