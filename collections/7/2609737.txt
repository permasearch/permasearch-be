Prior to 2011, treatments consisted of a combination of pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin for a period of 24 or 48 weeks, depending on HCV genotype.[15] This produces cure rates of between 70 and 80% for genotype 2 and 3, respectively, and 45 to 70% for genotypes 1 and 4.[78] Adverse effects with these treatments were common, with half of people getting flu like symptoms and a third experiencing emotional problems.[15] Treatment during the first six months is more effective than once hepatitis C has become chronic.[28] In those with chronic hepatitis B, treatment for hepatitis C results in reactivation of hepatitis B in about 25%.[79]
