The host read a clue to a song and the contestants alternated bidding as to how few notes they needed to identify the song. Each contestant stated their bid to their opponent in the infamous format "I can name that tune in X", where X was any whole number with 1 being the lowest note and 7 being the highest notes. Bidding ended when one contestant challenged the other to "Name That Tune". Bidding also ended when one contestant bid one note or (rarely) zero notes, with intent to identify the song from only the clue read by the host. The first contestant to name three tunes won a special prize (like a Hi-Fi system), and the third had to be either earned naturally, or by default.
