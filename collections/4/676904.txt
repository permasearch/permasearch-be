After inviting reporters in mid-April, Samsung launched the Galaxy SÂ III during the Samsung Mobile Unpacked 2012 event at Earls Court Exhibition Centre, London, United Kingdom, on 3 May 2012, instead of unveiling their products earlier in the year during either the World Mobile Congress or Consumer Electronics Show (CES).[14][37] One explanation for this decision is that Samsung wanted to minimize the time between its launch and availability.[38] The keynote address of the hour-long event was delivered by Loesje De Vriese, Marketing Director of Samsung Belgium.[39]
