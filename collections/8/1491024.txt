With the retirement of Justice John Paul Stevens, Ginsburg became the senior member of what is sometimes referred to as the court's "liberal wing".[26][59][60] When the court splits 5â€“4 along ideological lines and the liberal justices are in the minority, Ginsburg often has the authority to assign authorship of the dissenting opinion because of her seniority.[59][g] Ginsburg has been a proponent of the liberal dissenters speaking "with one voice" and, where practicable, presenting a unified approach to which all of the dissenting justices can agree.[26][59]
