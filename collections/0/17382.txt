In 1964, using a long coal-black wig, the brunette Jones began playing Morticia Addams on the television series The Addams Family, a role which brought her success as a comedian and a Golden Globe Award nomination. She guest-starred on the 1960s TV series Batman, playing Marsha, the Queen of Diamonds,[12] and in 1976 appeared as the title character's mother, Hippolyta, on the Wonder Woman TV series. In 1977 she played a madam running a rural whorehouse in Tobe Hooper's follow-up movie after The Texas Chain Saw Massacre which was Eaten Alive, and featured Neville Brand, Roberta Collins, and Robert Englund. Her last role was that of Myrna, the scheming matriarch of the Clegg clan, on the soap opera Capitol from the first episode in March 1982 until March 1983, though she already knew that she was dying of cancer. During her occasional absences, veteran actress Marla Adams subbed for her.
