The television special motivated Elvis and he began recording at the American Sound Studios in Memphis owned by Chips Moman. Filled with new energy, he recorded so many songs, that RCA Records needed a year and a half to release them all. Included in these sessions were hits such as "Suspicious Minds" which went to No.1 on the Billboard Charts, "In the Ghetto" and "Kentucky Rain." He was signed on to perform for a month at the then-new and just-completed International Hotel in Las Vegas. Every show was sold out with thousands being turned away at the door. This success led to a five-year contract for appearances twice a year, with the largest fee ever paid to any singer in history. Unfortunately, his renewed popularity brought a large increase in the number of death threats, requiring a significant increase in personal security.
