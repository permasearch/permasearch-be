In the episode "Purgatory," Dean Winters and Lauren Vélez guest star as Mike Stoat and Lois Melago, a duo of dirty cops. Det. Robert Goren is the other partner of this duo as he goes undercover to take down a high-level drug-dealer named John Testarossa (Danny Mastrogiorgio) in order to prove himself while he is under suspension pending a psychiatric evaluation. When Law & Order: Criminal Intent returned from the Writer's Guild strike on 8 June 2008, it was the lead-in to the premiere of new series In Plain Sight – that series' star, Mary McCormack, appeared in her role as U.S. Marshal Mary Shannon in "Contract," on 15 June 2008. In the episode "Betrayed", Brenda Strong portrayed Kathy Jarrow, a woman who becomes a suspect in the disappearance of her husband and his lover. She gets close to old friend Captain Ross, hoping to keep him and the detectives from solving the case; Senator Charles E. Schumer also makes a cameo appearance in the episode. In "Assassin," Indira Varma plays Bela Kahn, a Tamilian freedom fighter and political activist who survives an assassination attempt at JFK when she returns from her house arrest in Sri Lanka.
