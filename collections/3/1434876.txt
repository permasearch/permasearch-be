The next day at Vamonos Pest, Mike is skeptical that the GPS tracker was planted by the DEA because of its crude placement on the bottom of the barrel. When informed by Jesse that it was Lydia who spotted it first, Mike concludes that Lydia planted it herself in order to get out of the deal she made with him. He vows to kill her although it will slow down business. Jesse pleads for Mike to show mercy and asks for Walt's opinion. Walt votes to keep her alive so no time is lost finding a new precursor supplier. Jesse later gives Walt a TAG Heuer Monaco wristwatch as a birthday present, which pleases Walt. At home, Walt informs a chain-smoking Skyler that more money is coming. He shows off Jesse's gift as proof that Skyler will eventually accept him, as "the person who gave me this present wanted me dead, too. He changed his mind about me, Skyler, and so will you." Walter goes to bed with time on the watch ticking away.
