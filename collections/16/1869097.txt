A large 12-story granite store in Philadelphia, known as the "Wanamaker Building", designed by famous Chicago architect Daniel H. Burnham, was completed in 1910 and dedicated by US President William Howard Taft. The store stands on the site of "The Grand Depot", encompassing an entire block at the corner of Thirteenth and Market Streets across from Philadelphia's City Hall. The new store, The Wanamaker Building, which still stands today, became a Philadelphia institution and has remained an integral part of the Philadelphia culture.
