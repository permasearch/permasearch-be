Anyone who fails to render assistance to a person in danger will be found liable before French Courts (civil and criminal liability). The penalty for this offence in criminal courts is imprisonment and a fine (under article 223â€“6 of the Criminal Code) while in civil courts judges will order payment of pecuniary compensation to the victims.[36]
