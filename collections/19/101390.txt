Tommy dreams that he and the other Rugrats are captured by aliens that resemble his parents and his grandfather. Angelica steals a planet-atomizing remote from Stuvon (Stu as an alien) and escapes with help from a talking fish. Meanwhile, the babies wander into the space ship's control room and play with the controls, thinking that they are toys.
