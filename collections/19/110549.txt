Government expenditure on healthcare is about 2.9% of GDP (2014).[276] Every citizen is protected under the National Health Insurance (Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional, JKN), a scheme to implement universal health care launched by the Ministry of Health in 2014. It is expected that spending on healthcare will increase by 12% a year and reach US$46 billion a year by 2019.[277] Under JKN, all citizens will receive coverage for a range of treatments via health services from public providers as well as private organisations that have opted to join the scheme. Although health indicators have significantly improved in recent decades such as improvement in life expectancy (from 63 in 1990 to 71 in 2012)[278] and declining child mortality (from 85 deaths per 1,000 births in 1990 to 27 deaths in 2015),[279] Indonesia continues to face health challenges that include maternal and child health, low air quality, malnutrition, high rate of smoking,[277] and communicable diseases.
