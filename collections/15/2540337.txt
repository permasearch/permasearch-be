Rose water is used as a perfume in religious ceremonies (Muslim, Hindu and Zoroastrian). Water used to clean the Kaaba, the Qibla for Muslims located in Mecca, combines water from the Zamzam Well with rose water as an additive.[citation needed] In the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia during Muslim burials, rose water is often sprinkled in the dug grave before placing the body inside. Rose water is used in some Hindu rituals as well. Rose water also figures in Christianity, particularly in the Eastern Orthodox Church.[11] In the Baha'i Faith, the Most Holy Book (Kitab-i-Aqdas 1:76) orders the believers to make use of rose water.
