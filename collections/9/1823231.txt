The Canadian government began the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway between eastern Canada and British Columbia in 1881, with the aim of opening up the north-western territories for settlement.[71] In response, the mounted police moved their headquarters to the town of Regina, the new territorial capital which had been founded alongside the railway line.[72] The force was increased in size to 500 in 1882 to cope with the increased tasks being demanded of it, and the police began to use the railway to bring in recruits more easily from the eastern provinces.[73]
