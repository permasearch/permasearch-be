Riker subsequently hails the Stargazer but Picard continues to believe he is being attacked by the Enterprise. Knowing the Picard Maneuver is coming, Riker asks Data to devise a counter. Picard jumps the Stargazer to warp, executing the Picard Maneuver. Data, expecting the move, uses the Enterprise's tractor beam to seize the real Stargazer and limit its field of fire. Riker tells Picard about the orb; Picard seems to understand and fires his phaser at the orb, causing it to explode. After a few moments, Picard hails the Enterprise and requests a transport. Kazago hails Riker to inform him that Bok has been relieved of command "for engaging in this unprofitable venture".
