The game has been unanimously praised for its visuals;[12][18][55][56][59] Electronic Gaming Monthly's Eric L. Patterson complimented it saying "this is the most impressive ... fighting game I've even seen (or played) when it comes to the graphics on display,"[54] while Earnest Cavalli of Engadget declared that "[f]rom a purely aesthetic standpoint," Guilty Gear Xrd -Sign- is "faultless."[57] Other very praised aspect was its accessibility,[54][57] attributed to its equally praised tutorials.[12][48][55][70] GameCentral affirmed it can "may well be the best yet for any fighting game."[48] Darry Husky of IGN asserted, "Guilty Gear Xrd does an admirable job of making it all accessible not only for those of us making the jump from other fighting games, but for those checking the genre out for the very first time."[2]
