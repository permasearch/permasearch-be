The Yankees scored the first run of the game in the third inning on a Babe Ruth home run into the right field bleachers.[42](p35) In the following half inning, the Cardinals came back to take a 3â€“1 lead over the Yankees. Jim Bottomley lined a one-out single into left field to start the Cardinals' fourth inning rally. Les Bell just barely made it to first base after shortstop Mark Koenig accidentally kicked the ball while trying to field it. With runners at first and second base, Chick Hafey hit a bloop single into left field, which loaded up the bases for catcher Bob O'Farrell. This time, left fielder Bob Meusel made an error by dropping O'Farrell's fly ball, so Bottomley scored to tie the game, and the bases remained loaded. Tommy Thevenow followed with a two-run single to right fielder Ruth. Hoyt struck out the next batter, and Wattie Holm hit into a force play at second base.[59] All three runs in the inning were charged as unearned on Hoyt, due to the two Yankee errors.[18](p148)
