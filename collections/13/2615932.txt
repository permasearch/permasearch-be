Bhadrachalam and Nuguru Venkatapuram taluks of East Godavari district (part of coastal Andhra Pradesh), which are on the other side of the river Godavari, were merged into Khammam district on grounds of geographical contiguity and administrative viability. Earlier, Aswaraopeta was also part of West Godavari district and was added to Khammam district in 1959. Similarly, Munagala mandal was added to Nalgonda district and removed from Krishna district in 1959.
