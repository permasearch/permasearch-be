The General Assembly enacted the statute nine years after an incident that occurred on the night of March 19, 2001, in which one or both of the co-owners of a cement company in Glyndon, Maryland opened fire on three intruders on the company's premises, killing one of them and wounding the other two.[3] The company's premises had also been burglarized the two previous nights, and the two co-owners (who were brothers) were staying overnight at the business to guard it. In February 2004, the estate and young son of the deceased intruder sued the two brothers and their company for damages.[4] According to online records of the Maryland court system, the plaintiffs dropped the lawsuit on January 28, 2005.[5] It is not stated in the online records whether or not the case was settled.[6]
