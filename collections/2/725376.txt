Though it was never released on any of Springsteen's studio albums, in concert beginning with his Darkness Tour Springsteen would often perform the song with his own lyrics. The song was first performed live at a Patti Smith concert at the CBGB's Theater in New York City on December 30, 1977 (Patti's 31st birthday)  with Springsteen joining on vocals and guitar.[5] The only two commercially released recordings of a Springsteen version of the song were in the 1986 box set Live/1975â€“85, where Smith was listed as co-writer; and the 2010 compilation album The Promise (using the original recording from the Darkness on the Edge of Town sessions, but using Smith's lyrics).
