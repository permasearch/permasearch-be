The New Zealand national rugby union team, commonly called the All Blacks, represent New Zealand in men's rugby union, which is regarded as the country's national sport.[1] The side has won the last two Rugby World Cups, in 2011 and 2015, as well as the inaugural tournament in 1987. They have a 77% winning record in test match rugby, and are the only international side with a winning record against every opponent. Since their international debut in 1903, they have lost to only six of the 19 nations they have played in test matches.[a] Since the introduction of the World Rugby Rankings in 2003, New Zealand has held the number one ranking longer than all other teams combined.[2] The All Blacks are statistically the best side to have played the game, and jointly hold the record for the most consecutive test match wins for a tier one ranked nation.
