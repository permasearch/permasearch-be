During their first sessions, Voitinskiy left the project. Shapovalov hired Elena Kiper to co-write and co-produce the music of Taty. Together, they wrote "Ya Soshla s Uma".[5] The duo, alongside several other Russian producers and songwriters, completed the group's first album 200 Po Vstrechnoy.[6] The album was a large success in Europe, selling over one million units.[7][8] Shapovalov persisted in trying to sign the group with an international label, visiting North America and meeting with several record companies. He eventually settled a deal with a Russian division of Universal Music Group and Interscope Records.
