Carey is the only artist to have earned two number-one singles in 2005 after "Don't Forget About Us" topped the chart in the final calendar issue of Billboard HotÂ 100. "Don't Forget About Us" is Carey's 17th number-one single, placing her second in the list of acts with most number ones in the United States,[3] tying with Elvis Presley.  "We Belong Together" is the best-performing single of the chart year, topping the Top Hot 100 Hits of 2005; this gave Carey her first number-one single in the year-end chart.[8]
