In 1967â€“68, his second season, injuries limited Orr to just 46 games in which he scored 11 goals and had 20 assists. Prior to the season, Orr had injured his right knee during a charity game in Winnipeg during the summer requiring five weeks in a cast. In December, a Frank Mahovlich check caused a fracture of Orr's collar bone and a shoulder separation. Orr returned in January in time to play in the NHL All-Star Game, his first of eight appearances overall. Orr had to sit out five games afterwards due to soreness in his left knee. In February, he had to leave a game against Detroit after his left knee went stiff. He would receive the first of his many operations on the knee, repairing ligament and removing cartilage.[39] Orr did return to finish the season, but required an operation during the off-season to remove a bone chip.[40] Despite the injuries, Orr won the first of a record eight consecutive Norris trophies and was named to the NHL's First All-Star team and finished fourth in the voting for the Hart Trophy.
