"Halo" and "Ego" were initially planned for simultaneous release in the US, following the 2008 dual lead singles "If I Were a Boy" and "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)".[8] But the release of "Ego" was canceled and replaced with "Diva".[26] "Halo" was taken from a different disc of I Am... Sasha Fierce to "Diva"; the intention was to demonstrate the concept that Beyoncé has conflicting personalities—the central theme of the album.[11][27][28] The motif was demonstrated by placing the album's ballads and uptempo tracks on separate discs.[10][28] "Halo" was sent by Music World Entertainment and Columbia Records to contemporary hit radio playlists on January 20, 2009,[29] while "Diva" was classified for rhythmic contemporary and urban contemporary radio playlists.[30][31] A digital extended play (EP) containing a radio edit and four remixes of "Halo" was later released on April 14, 2009.[32]
