Along with coconut oil, palm oil is one of the few highly saturated vegetable fats and is semisolid at room temperature.[4] Palm oil is a common cooking ingredient in the tropical belt of Africa, Southeast Asia and parts of Brazil. Its use in the commercial food industry in other parts of the world is widespread because of its lower cost[5] and the high oxidative stability (saturation) of the refined product when used for frying.[6][7] One source reported that humans consumed an average 17 pounds (7.7Â kg) of palm oil per person in 2015.[8]
