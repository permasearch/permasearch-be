Chief Ministers of several Indian states like Mamata Banerjee,[100] Arvind Kejriwal[101] and Pinarayi Vijayan[102] have criticised and led major protests against the decision in their states and in parliament. Initially, the move to demonetise and try to hinder black money was appreciated, but the manner in which it was carried out by causing hardships to common people was criticised.[103] A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was filed in Madras High Court by M Seeni Ahamed, General Secretary of the Indian National League, to scrap the decision. The High Court dismissed the PIL stating that it could not interfere in monetary policies of the government.[104] Similar PILs were also filed in the Supreme Court of India.[105] Supreme Court of India is yet to decide on the matter. It is listed for hearing on 2 December 2016.
