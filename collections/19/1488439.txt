In the United States, people facing criminal charges in any situation are given rights by the Constitution.[3] These are the Miranda Rights and they are read to anyone facing criminal charges. These rights include things like the right to remain silent, habeas corpus, and the right to an attorney. It is important for someone facing criminal charges to know their rights so they can take the proper action using their rights. An officer is required to read the following rights before any questioning of a suspect: "You have the right to remain silent and refuse to answer any questions, anything you do say may be used against you in the court of law, you have the right to consult an attorney before speaking to the police and have an attorney present during questioning now or in the future, if you cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for you before any questioning if you wish, and if you decide to answer questions now without an attorney present you will still have the right to stop answering at any time until you talk to an attorney."[3]
