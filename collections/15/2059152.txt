Kilkenny have won the All-Ireland Hurling Championship the most times - thirty-six titles as of 2016. Kilkenny have been runner-up more often than any other team (26 times). Two teams have won the Championship on four consecutive occasions Cork (1941–44) and Kilkenny (2006–09). Only three teams have won the Championship on three consecutive occasions - Cork (1892–94, 1941–44 (4 times)), 1952–54 & 1976–78), Tipperary (1898–1900, 1949–51) and Kilkenny (1911–13, 2006–09 (4 times)). Kilkenny, Galway (1987–1988) and Wexford have all achieved the "double" by winning back-to-back titles over the years. Antrim hold the unfortunate record of appearing in two All-Ireland Finals (1943 and 1989) without ever winning the cup.
