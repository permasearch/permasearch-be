Graf followed this with easy victories in her next four tournaments at Washington, D.C., San Antonio, Texas, Boca Raton, Florida, and Hilton Head, South Carolina. The Washington, D.C. tournament was notable because Graf won the first twenty points of the final against Zina Garrison.[34] In the Boca Raton final, Graf lost the only set she conceded to Chris Evert in their final seven matches.[35]
