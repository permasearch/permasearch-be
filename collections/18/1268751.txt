With a release scheduled for early summer, the studio press agents swung into high gear early in 1951. Hitchcock, promotionally photographed many times over the years strangling various actresses and other women — some one-handed, others two — found himself in front of a camera with his fingers around the neck of a bust of daughter Patricia;[27] the photo found its way into newspapers nationwide.[42] He was also photographed adding the letter "L" to Strangers on the official studio poster for the film.[27]
