On March 15, 2016, in the presidential primaries, Florida voters expressed their preferences for the Democratic, Republican, Libertarian, America's Party, Constitution, and Socialism and Liberation parties' respective nominees for President (Green on July 31). Registered members of each party only voted in their party's primary, while voters who were unaffiliated weren't able to vote in any primaries. Florida is a winner-take-all voting state for Republicans, but is a proportional voting state for Democrats. Trump won the Republican presidential primary in Florida, while Clinton won the Democratic primary in the state.
