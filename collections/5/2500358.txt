Organized extracurricular activities have yielded a positive relationship with high academic performance[15] including increasing attendance rates, school engagement, GPA, postsecondary education, as well as a decrease in drop out rates and depression.[16] Additionally, positive developmental outcomes have been found in youth that engage in organized extracurricular activities.[17] High school athletics have been linked with strong academic performance, particularly among urban youth.[18] However, involvement in athletics has been linked to increased alcohol consumption and abuse for high school students along with increased truancy.[19]
