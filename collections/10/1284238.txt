Similar to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures series from Archie Comics, IDW Publishing released a spin-off comic title named New Animated Adventures featuring original adventures, starting July 2013. The series was cancelled after 24 issues, and was succeeded by a revised story program entitled Amazing Adventures, which was launched in August 2015. One of the main reasons for this revision was the inclusion of the Shredder as a vital character into the comic stories, which had been neglected in New Animated Adventures.[61][62] Amazing Adventures was published until September 2017, with a total of fourteen regular issues, one special story guest-starring Carmelo Anthony, a three-issue story arch titled Robotanimals, and the crossover mini-series Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures.
