Paul and the Twelve Apostles traveled extensively establishing communities in major cities and regions throughout the Empire. The first Christian communities outside of Jerusalem appeared in Antioch, Ephesus, Corinth, and the political center of Rome. The original church communities were founded by apostles and numerous other Christians, soldiers, merchants, and preachers[75] in northern Africa, Asia Minor, Arabia, Greece, and other places.[76][77][78] Over 40 churches were established by 100,[77][78] many in Asia Minor.
