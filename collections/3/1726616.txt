Maximillian "Wizard" Epper was a Canadian born professor who taught at Trinity College in Dublin, teaching Jack West, Jack's future wife Zoe Kissane & two Scottish students (his personal favourites) Lachlan & Julian Adamson "The Cowboys". He first met Jack when he joined the class he was teaching and they went on from there. In 1996, Wizard was involved in saving Lily. Wizard and Lily have always hit it off, so naturally Lily was one of the most hurt when Wizard died tragically, killed by Jack's father, Wolf, in Five Greatest Warriors at Genghis Khan's arsenal and tomb.
