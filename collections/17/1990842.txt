The children's novel series A Series of Unfortunate Events features a large cast of characters created by Lemony Snicket. The series follows the turbulent lives of the Baudelaire orphans after their parents, Bertrand and Beatrice, are killed in an arsonous structure fire. As such, many of the characters (including the series's primary antagonist, Count Olaf) are introduced as legal guardians to the Baudelaires until custody is either legally removed, voluntarily rescinded, or terminated by death. Numerous characters are also members of the secret organization V.F.D. or accomplices of Count Olaf. The series's protagonists, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire, are the talented and resourceful orphans of a wealthy family secretly involved in vigilantism. Although the children depend on the aid of their parents' estate executor Arthur Poe in the outset, they swiftly begin to rely on one another. The series's antagonist, Count Olaf, is a professional actor and former member of V.F.D. Along with the assistance of his theater troupe and his girlfriend Esm√© Squalor, the count repeatedly attempts to embezzle the Baudelaires' inheritance, bringing about the serial slaughter and holocaust of a multitude of characters. Eventually the children are falsely accused in Count Olaf's murder, forcing them to run away and hide in the boondocks. As the Baudelaires' actions become less and less conventional, they are faced with the ethical paradox of becoming like Olaf in order to escape him. The series is narrated by Lemony Snicket (the nom de plume of Daniel Handler), who plays a major role in the plot himself. Although the series is given no distinct location in the English-speaking world, other real persons appear in the narrative as well, including the series's illustrator, Brett Helquist, and Daniel Handler himself.
