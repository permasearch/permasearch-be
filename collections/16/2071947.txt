The faunal remains recovered include specifically: fish,[20] shellfish, birds, tortoise and ostrich egg shell [21] and mammals of various sizes.[21][22] The amount of shell fish recovered from the various Middle Stone Age units show that people were regularly collecting them at the shore and bringing them back to the cave for consumption. Common species include the giant periwinkle (Turbo sarmaticus), limpets (Patella spp.) and brown mussels (Perna perna).
