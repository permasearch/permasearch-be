In Europe, logic was first developed by Aristotle.[19] Aristotelian logic became widely accepted in science and mathematics and remained in wide use in the West until the early 19thÂ century.[20] Aristotle's system of logic was responsible for the introduction of hypothetical syllogism,[21] temporal modal logic,[22][23] and inductive logic,[24] as well as influential terms such as terms, predicables, syllogisms and propositions. In Europe during the later medieval period, major efforts were made to show that Aristotle's ideas were compatible with Christian faith. During the High Middle Ages, logic became a main focus of philosophers, who would engage in critical logical analyses of philosophical arguments, often using variations of the methodology of scholasticism. In 1323, William of Ockham's influential Summa Logicae was released. By the 18th century, the structured approach to arguments had degenerated and fallen out of favour, as depicted in Holberg's satirical play Erasmus Montanus.
