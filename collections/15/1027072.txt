Sugar gliders are highly social animals. They live in family groups or colonies consisting of up to seven adults, plus the current season's young. Up to four age classes may exist within each group, although some sugar gliders are solitary, not belonging to a group.[24] They engage in social grooming, which in addition to improving hygiene and health, helps bond the colony and establish group identity.
