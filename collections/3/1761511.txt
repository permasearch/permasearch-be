In the series four opener "Partners in Crime" (2008), Donna has become dissatisfied with regular life for two years and more interested in the bigger picture after her father died. When both are investigating the alien connection to Adipose Industries' Miss Foster (Sarah Lancashire), she and the Doctor are re-united, and she joins him in the TARDIS as a regular companion.[1][7][8] In "The Fires of Pompeii", Donna shows her compassion when she argues and convinces the Doctor to save a family in Pompeii from the eruption of Mount Vesuvius.[9] In "Planet of the Ood", Donna and the Doctor go to the Ood-Sphere and Donna defends the Ood from the abuses they suffer at the hands of humans.[10] In the two-parter "The Sontaran Stratagem" and "The Poison Sky", Donna meets former companion Martha Jones who works for UNIT and together they stop the Sontarans from using ATMOS to choke the world.[10] In "The Doctor's Daughter", it is Donna who names the eponymous character "Jenny" (Georgia Moffett) and subsequently convinces the Doctor to accept Jenny.[11] The Doctor and Donna meet Agatha Christie (Fenella Woolgar) in "The Unicorn and the Wasp" and have to solve their very own murder mystery.[10] The two-parter episodes of "Silence in the Library" and "Forest of the Dead" introduces River Song and the Doctor accidentally shoves Donna into a cyberworld while attempting to keep her safe from the Vashta Nerada.[10] "Midnight" gives Donna a break with a spa day while the Doctor has the most terrifying bus ride of his life.[10] The episode "Turn Left" features a parallel universe wherein Donna never met the Doctor; consequently, the Doctor died and the world comes to an end much sooner.[12] In finale episodes "The Stolen Earth" and "Journey's End", Donna touches the Doctor's energised severed hand and is imbued with the totality of his knowledge, using which, she is able to stop Davros (Julian Bleach) and his plan to destroy reality. However, because her mind cannot handle the knowledge, the Doctor is forced to wipe her memory of him against her wishes when she tries to begs him not to send her back the way she was and hope that they never meet again, lest she remember and her mind "burn up".[13][14] Donna reappears in the two-part The End of Time (2009–10). Early in the story, she buys her grandfather a book written by the episode's villain, which the Doctor takes to mean that the "DoctorDonna" is still trying to subconsciously lend a hand. When every member of the human race (apart from herself and Wilf) becomes a clone of the Doctor's nemesis the Master (John Simm), Donna's memories are nearly restored; however, a fail-safe installed by the Doctor protects her. In the story's concluding moments, Donna is last seen when she marries new fiancé Shaun Temple (Karl Collins), becoming Donna Temple-Noble; the dying Doctor anonymously delivers her a winning lottery ticket to ensure her financial future, having borrowed the purchase price from Donna's late father in the past, making it a present from both him and the Doctor.[15]
