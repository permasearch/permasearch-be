Jack Spade, a fictional name, is the men's complement to the Kate Spade brand. The style of Jack Spade reflects different aspects than the Kate Spade New York Company does, and not only because it is a male line. While Kate Spade is a clean cut line that represents a sleek, upper east side, preppy style, Jack Spade is more of a rugged style. The styles are completely different because they are based on what trends that specific gender is wearing in the upper east side. Jack Spade is composed more of darker colors rather than bright lively colors(Winters 36). Its founder and principal designer was Andy Spade. In recent years, Kate Spade has been featuring designs and special editions by guest designers and is no longer the sole artistic vision of the husband and wife team. All the Jack Spade stores were permanently closed in January 2015, but the brand continued to sell online and at Nordstrom.[15]
