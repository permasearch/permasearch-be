Most birds found in the Marshall Islands, with the exception of those few introduced by man, are either sea birds or a migratory species.[21] There are about 70 species of birds, including 31 seabirds. 15 of these species actually nest locally. Sea birds include the black noddy and the white tern.[22] The only land bird is the house sparrow, introduced by man.[20]
