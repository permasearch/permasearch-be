Such a system allows a large range of disparity to appear from a limited set of genes, but such theories linking this with the explosion struggle to explain why the origin of such a development system should by itself lead to increased diversity or disparity. Evidence of Precambrian metazoans[37] combines with molecular data[128] to show that much of the genetic architecture that could feasibly have played a role in the explosion was already well established by the Cambrian.
