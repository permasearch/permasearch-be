Half-blood refers to those wizards and witches who have magic and Muggle ancestors in their family trees. Half-bloods are the most common wizard blood, far outnumbering pure-bloods and Muggle-borns. Rowling has stated that, of the Hogwarts annual intake, 50% are half-bloods. Pure-blood supremacists view half-bloods as inferior to them, although superior to Muggles and Muggle-borns. The Malfoy family, a family of wealthy Wizards who showed disdain to Muggles, attempted to maintain blood purity, but found it acceptable to marry half-bloods if there was a dearth of marriageable pure-bloods.
