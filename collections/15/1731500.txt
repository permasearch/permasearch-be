When the Abbasid caliph, al-Mansur, founded a completely new city for his capital, he chose the name Madinat al-Salaam or City of Peace. This was the official name on coins, weights, and other official usage, although the common people continued to use the old name.[21][22] By the 11th century, "Baghdad" became almost the exclusive name for the world-renowned metropolis.
