The Unicorns (voiced by Sam Marin, J. G. Quintel, Mark Hamill, and S. Scott Bullock) are the main villains in "The Unicorns Have Got to Go". Mordecai and Rigby befriend them at Margaret's cafe, but end up causing trouble for them and the park gang. They and Skips set up a drag race (which unicorns never say no to), leading the Unicorns to drive off a ramp and being blown up by Benson.
