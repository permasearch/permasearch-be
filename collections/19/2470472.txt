Cruz's administration continues her predecessor Jorge Santini's plans for the revitalization of the Río Piedras district.[26] The first phase of this plan consisted of the restoration of historic buildings in the subdivision.[26] An economic plan spearheaded by José Rivera-Santana promoted incentives for housing and establishment of new businesses in Río Piedras, in an attempt to salvage the economic importance that the district once had.[26] This was complemented with direct communication and collaboration with the local community and several institutions, including the University of Puerto Rico.[26] Among the initiatives to revitalize the municipal economy, Cruz proposed the absolute elimination of the 7% sales tax (IVU) in Río Piedras for a period of four years.[27] This would be the first time that any zone would receive such an exemption, giving small and local businesses a strategic edge over "big box" corporations.[27]
