The cost of hosting the 2002 Commonwealth Games was estimated at approximately £300 million.[34] Prior to the games, a £100 million was required to fill a financial black hole and the government agreed to provide the funding required,[35] despite some believing that £300 million was too much.[36] In comparison to other sporting events, the 2002 games were marked by financial discipline. The cost of the 2010 Commonwealth Games were estimated at $4.1 billion,[37] the London 2012 Summer Olympics are estimated to cost £9 billion, while the 2014 Commonwealth Games could cost as much as £500 million.[38]
