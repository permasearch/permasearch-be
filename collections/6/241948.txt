After section 208's failure to control NPS water pollution, in 1987 Congress passed the Water Quality Act and created the new section 319 to address the problem of nonpoint sources. However, some critics have argued that section 319 provides little improvement over section 208.[24] The section requires states to identify water bodies that cannot meet water-quality standards without control of nonpoint sources.[29]  The states must then identify best management practices and measures for those impaired sources, along with an implementation plan.[29] The EPA approves these plans, and if a state fails to develop a plan, the EPA must do so for the state. However, there are a number of problems with these provisions. Funding to develop the plans has been scarce.[24]  The section does not actually place limits on NPS pollution, and states are not even required implement the plans they create.[24] Another problem with 319 (and 208) is that there is no enforcement mechanism[30] In the case Natural Resource Defense Council v. EPA, 915 F.2d 1314, 1318 (9th Cir. 1990), the court held that "Section 319 does not require states to penalize nonpoint source polluters who fail to adopt best management practices; rather it provides for grants to encourage the adoption of such practices."
