The Liberal Democrats have been strongly in favour of European integration. The party maintains a "strong and positive" commitment to the European Union;[132][133] the Liberal Democrats and its predecessors (the SDPâ€“Liberal Alliance) have been consistently in favour of British EU membership, with the Liberal Party originally proposing membership into the predecessor European Coal and Steel Community.[134] However, the Liberal Democrats oppose the European federalism espoused by their counterparts.[135]
