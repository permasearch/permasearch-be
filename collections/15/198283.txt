There is some inconsistency over Williams' full name. In the series 3 episode "Don't Take the Micky" we hear his thoughts and he uses the name Tudor Bryn Williams to refer to himself, but in the final episode he reads out the name on his newly-issued ration book as "B.H. Williams". It is possible that "Tudor" is a play on the actor's own name, but this is unconfirmed.
