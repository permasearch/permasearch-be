The pharmacokinetic properties of sitagliptin and vildagliptin appear unaffected by age, sex or BMI.[18] Clinical researches have shown that sitagliptin and vildagliptin do not have the side effects that tend to follow type 2 diabetes treatment, e.g. weight gain and hyperglycemia, but however, other side effects have been observed, including upper respiratory tract infections, sore throat and diarrhea.[5]
