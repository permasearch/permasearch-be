The university has two campuses and two extension facilities. The 388 acres (1.57 km2) campus opened in 1963 on St. Thomas, at the time named College of the Virgin Islands.[7] The Albert A. Sheen campus is on St. Croix.[8] The extensions include an academic center and an environment research facility, both on St. John.[8] The St. Croix campus is located on Estate Golden Grove in mid-island. The latter campus is three miles (5 km) from Charlotte Amalie, the capital of the territory. The St. Thomas campus is situated on two hills and it has its own beach (John Brewer's Bay beach) which can be directly accessed off the main road which cuts through the campus.[9]:107 The majority of the buildings on the St. Thomas campus are made of volcanic rock and cement. This makes the campus not only aesthetically pleasing but it also improves the structural integrity of the structures as the U.S. Virgin Islands are known for experiencing very active hurricane seasons.
