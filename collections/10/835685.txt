"Adam's Song" is generally considered one of the band's more serious songs, one "that hints at the emotional maturity they'd show on later releases," particularly their eponymous 2003 release.[40] Richard Harrington of The Washington Post deemed the song "a powerful exploration of exhaustion and depression."[41] Alex Pappademas, writing for Spin, compared the song to the music of Weezer.[42] Katy Kroll of Billboard recognized it among her top 10 singles of 2000, calling it "a good old-fashioned depressing song with mainstream flair."[43] Geoff Boucher, writing for the Los Angeles Times, called it "a poignant essay on a teen mulling over suicide";[44] conversely, Steve Appleford of the Los Angeles Times dubbed it a "moving if unremarkable examination."[45] Scott Mervis of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette called it a "rare departure from the usual Blink fare."[46]
