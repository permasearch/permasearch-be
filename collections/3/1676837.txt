Collingwood dominated the second quarter. They won the clearances 16–6, and won the inside-50s 21–5, giving St Kilda almost no opportunity to score. Overall, Collingwood managed ten shots at goal, but took many from long distance, which affected their overall accuracy: their total score for the quarter was 3.6 (24) with one out on the full. Goals were scored by Cloke in the 3rd minute, Macaffer in the 18th minute from a holding the ball free kick against Eddy and 50-metre penalty against Ray, and O'Brien in the 26th minute; of their remaining shots, three fell short and were touched or rushed for behinds, while Cloke missed two relatively easy shots—one from a 25m set shot directly in front and one from a snap shot 30m out—in the final two minutes of the quarter. So dominant was Collingwood in the second quarter that St Kilda managed only two shots on goal, both set shots from outside 50m: one goal to Koschitzke in the 12th minute, and one from Peake in the 21st minute which fell short and was rebounded.
