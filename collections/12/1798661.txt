The map should be updated to include the accurate information about the ratification of the amendment by the state of Mississippi. The amendment was technically ratified in 1995 by the MS legislature. However, due to clerical errors at the MS Secretary of State's Office the bill ratifying the amendment was never made official. The state officially ratified the amendment on February 7, 2013 after the current Secretary of State corrected the error and reported the ratification to the Office of the Federal Register.
