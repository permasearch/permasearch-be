Summer Smith (voiced by Spencer Grammer[1]) – Morty's 17-year-old older sister, a more conventional and often superficial teenager, who is obsessed with improving her status among her peers. Summer is generally similar to her mother, as she is often shown to be very smart and humorous, but she has also shown elements of Jerry's approval-seeking. She occasionally expresses jealousy that Morty gets to accompany Rick on his inter-dimensional adventures. In the second season, she accompanies Rick and Morty on adventures more frequently and sometimes will even prove herself to be more competent than Morty, especially when emotional nuance is required. Summer has, on occasion, been shown to think similar to Rick, such as quickly figuring out a way to save herself and Rick from execution, and correctly deducing that dead flies in Rick's garage were more than they appeared. Summer cares about Rick, and sees him as a hero. In "The Rickshank Rickdemption", she is the only member of the family who wants to rescue Rick despite the pleas of her brother that Rick is nothing more than a selfish jerk. When their parents agreed on a divorce, Summer began resenting her father and started showing her dark side, until she reconciles with him.
