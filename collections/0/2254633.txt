On May 6, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police began leading convoys to move 1,500 vehicles from oil sand work camps north of Fort McMurray, south along Highway 63 to Edmonton.[41] The fire continued to grow out of control, spreading to 100,000 hectares (250,000 acres) by May 6,[41][42] and 156,000 hectares (390,000 acres) by May 7.[43] As the fire grew to the northeast, the community of Fort McKay, which hosted 5,000 evacuees from Fort McMurray, was itself put under an evacuation notice. Albertan officials anticipated that the fire would double in size, and reach the Saskatchewan border to the east.[44][45]
