The current San Ysidro Land Port of Entry facility was constructed in the 1970s to meet the needs of the time and the projected growth in the coming years. Nearly forty years later, this port of entry has reached its adequate operational capacity and after eight years of planning, it is ready for a major facelift. Current data ranks this port as the busiest international port of entry in the world in terms of individual crossers and vehicle movements from one country to another.[3]
