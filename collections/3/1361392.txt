The other featured preliminary match was Kurt Angle versus Booker T in a singles match. On an episode of SmackDown!, Angle, Booker T, Big Show and JBL took part in a Fatal four-way match to determine the number one contender to the WWE championship, which JBL won.[11] The following week, Angle challenged Booker T to a match at Judgment Day, which Booker accepted. Prior to that, Angle had insulted Booker T's wife, Sharmell, which led to Booker T attacking and accepting Angle's challenge.[13] On the May 12 episode of SmackDown!, Angle admitted he would like to have "perverted sex" with Sharmell.[16] That same night, Angle and Booker T were scheduled in a match, which led to Angle leaving the ring and going backstage to Sharmell. Booker T went backstage and found Sharmell on the floor crying. This led to Angle attacking Booker T from behind and pushing him towards a pair of steel lockers.[16] The following week, Long was scripted to suspend Angle and demanded that Angle apologize for his actions.[14] Angle apologized, but admitted that he actually kissed Sharmell and let her fondle his "private parts" before Booker T made his way to the locker room.[14]
