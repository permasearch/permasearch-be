On December 12, 2013, Warner Bros. set for a June 26, 2015 release, with Joe Wright as director.[30] The release was pushed back several times,[31][32] and the studio eventually decided on October 9, 2015, in part to avoid box office competition from summer blockbusters such as Ant-Man and Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation.[33]
