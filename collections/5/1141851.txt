On July 19, 1979, the frigate USS Samuel Eliot Morison was launched, honoring Morison and his contributions to the United States Navy. Morison's legacy is also sustained by the United States Naval History and Heritage Command's Samuel Eliot Morison Naval History Scholarship.[14] Boston's Commonwealth Avenue Mall features a bronze statue depicting Morison in sailor's oilskin.
