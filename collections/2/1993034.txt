After employee Shania Lowry (Michaela Coel) warns Cole to beware of Daly, he covertly takes a disposed coffee cup of Cole's and uses her DNA to replicate her consciousness within his development build. Cole awakens aboard the USS Callister, confused and distraught. Lowry explains that they are digital clones of Callister Inc. staff members. Cole attempts to escape as Captain Daly arrives, but is teleported back to the bridge. She refuses to cooperate with his commands, so he removes her facial features and suffocates her until she relents.
