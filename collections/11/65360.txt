A child must never put a parent to shame, or speak arrogantly to a parent.[34] A person who is told to do something by his/her mother for which his father does not like the result is not permitted to tell his/her father that his/her mother said to do that. This is because this could lead to his/her father cursing his/her mother.[35] A child is not permitted to interrupt or contradict a parent, or to disturb a parent's sleep.[36]
