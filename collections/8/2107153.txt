In disruptive conflict or post-conflict situations, many people find that difficulties in completing simple administrative procedures are exacerbated.[16] Such obstacles may affect the ability of individuals to complete procedures such as birth registration, fundamental to the prevention of statelessness in children. Whilst birth registration alone does not confer citizenship on a child, the documentation of place of birth and parentage is instrumental in proving the link between an individual and a state for the acquisition of nationality.[17] The United Nations Childrenâ€™s Fund (UNICEF) estimated in 2013 that 230 million children under the age of 5 have not been registered.[18]
