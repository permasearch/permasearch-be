Arnold is Josh's former boyfriend. They met at a party at Josh's house through friends. Arnold is coincidentally staying at the same hospital as Rose. Arnold and Josh's relationship is turbulent, and constantly caused Arnold's anxiety to flare up. Arnold comes out to his family as a result of his relationship with Josh, and Josh learns how to help manage Arnold's anxiety. At Arnold's request, they define themselves as an "open relationship," which causes two major rifts in their relationshipâ€”most notably in regards to a failed threesome they attempt at the beginning of season four. Josh breaks up with Arnold following Josh's admission that he no longer connects with the person Arnold has evolved into. Afterwards, Arnold begins a relationship with Kyle, the third man in their "threesome", who only had eyes for Arnold.
