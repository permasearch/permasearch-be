The second generation RDX was revealed during January 2012 at the North American International Auto Show going on sale in April.[2] The turbocharged four-cylinder engine was replaced by a 3.5-liter V6 mated to a six-speed automatic, improving gas mileage to an EPA estimated 20/28/23 mpg (city/highway/combined) by using variable displacement (VCM).[3] The SH-AWD system will be replaced with a simpler and less costly AWD setup.
