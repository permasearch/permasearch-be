Colbert described his new set as being "intimate"; it features a multi-tier design, with extensive use of LED lighting and video projection backdrops, and a larger desk area than that of Letterman.[18] Exposed for the new show, the Sullivan's dome is lit up with a digital projection system which is used to display images above the theater, such as a kaleidoscopic pattern featuring images of Colbert's face and the CBS logo.[18] New, larger audience seats were installed, reducing the overall capacity to 370 from 461.[18] The theater's new marquee was designed to have a "glitzy" appearance appropriate for Broadway; CBS late-night executive Vincent Favale joked that Colbert's marquee made one installed at 30 Rockefeller Center for The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon look like a mall kiosk in comparison.[18]
