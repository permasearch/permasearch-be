Chibs is one of the Sons who accompanies Jax to Belfast to look for Abel. There, Chibs is reunited with his estranged wife and his daughter. Although Kerrianne's display of affection is initially hesitant, she and Chibs eventually hug, and she calls him "Da". In "Firinne", Chibs is involved in the capture of McGee and the shootout between Jimmy's men and SAMCRO. Chibs also loses his nephew Padraic in a truck explosion set up by SAMBEL's then sergeant-at-arms Liam O'Niell, which deeply upsets Chibs. In the Season 3 finale, Chibs finally gets his revenge on Jimmy O by giving him the same Glasgow Smile Jimmy gave him and subsequently stabbing him to death. He then uses Jimmy's own blood to paint a Real IRA symbol on the rear windshield of Stahl's cruiser, to make it look like the Real IRA committed the hit.
