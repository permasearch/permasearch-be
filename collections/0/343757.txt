Red and Blanca send text messages from Humphrey' phone to Piscatella claiming the inmates are not armed anymore and encouraging him to break into the prison via a window at night. He takes the information to the CERT, who blow him off. Aleida does a live TV interview with Meredith Vieira and Judy King, who breaks the news about Humphrey being shot. She does not remember the shooter's name but describes Daya, leaving Aleida in shock. The news reaches Piscatella, who is mocked by the CERT members. Figueroa returns to the prison, this time as a negotiator for MCC. She claims they cannot afford to meet the inmates' demands, but Taystee — who has done her research via the Internet and Caputo's files — shuts her down. However, once Figueroa receives a phone call about Humphrey, she says amnesty for all the inmates is off the table. After a discussion with Piper and others, Taystee agrees to hand over Daya, who first calls Mendez's mother to ask her to adopt her daughter out of foster care and asks her to give the child some space due to Aleida's control she received when she was younger. Gloria learns that her son is in the ICU after being severely beaten. Piscatella, after texting "Humphrey" that he was going to stand down, enters the prison after dark instead.
