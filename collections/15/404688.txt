Following his commissioning, Fiedler was assigned to Pearl Harbor as a translator of intercepted intelligence in 1943. He transferred to the flagship of the fleet sent to engage the Japanese at the Battle of Iwo Jima as an intelligence officer primarily responsible for POW interrogations in 1944. At Iwo Jima, he witnessed the raising of the flag on Mount Suribachi and the photographed recreation that ensued.[citation needed] After subsequent assignments in Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and China—the latter involving the repatriation of Japanese citizens following the resolution of the war—Fiedler was discharged from the Navy at his commissioned rank in early 1946; his certificate of discharge stated that he was "employed in a position of special trust and no further information regarding his service in the Navy can be disclosed."[This quote needs a citation]
