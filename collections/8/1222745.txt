The fare for the ferry remained a nickel when the subway fare was increased to 10 cents in 1948.[136] Despite the ferry's growing operational shortfalls in the 1950s, the five-cent fare remained, regardless of inflation.[131] By 1968, the Citizens Budget Commission was proposing to hike fares to close the subsidy deficit, with Staten Island commuters to pay 20 cents, and others 50 cents, for a one-way trip.[206] In May 1970, then-Mayor John V. Lindsay proposed that the fare be raised to 25 cents, pointing out that the cost for each ride was 50 cents, or ten times what the fare was bringing in.[208] As part of a city budget passed in June of that year, the nickel fare was kept.[209] Due to the city's financial crisis in the mid-1970s, Mayor Abraham Beame submitted a proposal to increase the fare in July 1975.[136] On August 4, 1975, the fare was increased to 25 cents for a round trip, collected in one direction only. The fare increase was intended to earn the ferry service an extra $1.35 million in annual revenue.[210]
