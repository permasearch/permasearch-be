Loggerheads may display multiple paternity.[64] Multiple paternity is possible due to sperm storage. The female can store sperm from multiple males in her oviducts until ovulation.[65] A single clutch may have as many as seven fathers, each contributing sperm to a portion of the clutch.[66] Multiple paternity and female size are positively correlated.[64][66] Two hypotheses explain this correlation. One posits that males favor large females because of their perceived higher fecundity (ability to reproduce).[64] The other states, because larger females are able to swim more quickly to mating grounds, they have longer mating periods.[64]
