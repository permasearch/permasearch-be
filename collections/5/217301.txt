According to the Kalpasutra, Mahavira was born at Kundagrama in present-day Bihar, India.[8][17] This is assumed to be the modern town of Basu Kund, which is about 60 kilometres (37 miles) north of Patna, the capital of Bihar.[18][3] However, it is unclear if the ancient Kundagrama is the same as the current assumed location, and the birthplace remains a subject of dispute.[4][8][19] Mahavira renounced all his material wealth and left his home when he was twenty-eight by some accounts,[20] or thirty by others,[21] then lived an ascetic life and performed severe austerities for twelve years, and thereafter preached Jainism for a period of thirty years.[20] The location where he preached has been a subject of historic disagreement between the two major sub-traditions of Jainism – the Svetambaras and the Digambaras.[8]
