Inactivation of the proton pump can also lead to health problems. A study in mice by Krieg et al.[18] found that a mutation of the pump’s α subunit led to achlorhydria which resulted problems with iron absorption, leading to iron deficiency and anemia. The use of PPIs has not been correlated with an elevated risk of anemia, so the H+/K+ ATPase is thought to aid iron absorption but is not necessarily required.[18]
