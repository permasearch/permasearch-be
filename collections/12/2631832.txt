The screenplay for Vanishing Point was written by G. Cabrera Infante, under the pseudonym Guillermo Cain. The story was based on two actual events: the disgraced career of a San Diego police, officer and a high-speed pursuit of a man who refused to stop and was killed when he crashed into a police roadblock.[5] Infante modeled the character of Super Soul after legendary rock and roll singer The Big Bopper.[5] His script reflected the popular counterculture lifestyle of the time, containing elements of rebellion, drugs, sexual freedom, and rock and roll.[6]
