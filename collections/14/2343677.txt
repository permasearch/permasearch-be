Driven by the "Phantom Four" backfield of halfback Carl Brumbaugh, fullback Rainey Cawthon, quarterback Clyde Crabtree and halfback Royce Goodbread, the 1928 Gators led the nation in points scored with 336.[84] The team also produced the Gators' first first-team All-American, end Dale Van Sickel, Florida's first member of the College Football Hall of Fame.[85] Crabtree and Van Sickel were both unanimous All-Southern selections.[86] Crabtree was ambidextrous and could throw passes with either hand or punt with either foot, while on the run or stationary,[87] The 1928 team's sole loss was to Robert Neyland's Tennessee, 12â€“13, in the final game of the season.[88] Thick mud hampered the Florida offense in a game in which coach Bachman had his players convinced they were playing for a shot at a Rose Bowl berth.[84] The Florida players accused Tennessee of watering the field.[89]
