In response, Jerry bounces himself on the counter making the cat flinch. The mouse continues bouncing across the counter, but does not see the sink full of water. He jumps out and doesn't realize the polish has washed off. Tom grins and allows Jerry to bounce and hit himself with the hammer. Not knowing he's been exposed, Jerry hits himself even harder and ends up bruising himself. Tom then takes the hammer and pounds Jerry into the counter like a nail. He then grabs Jerry by the tail and takes him to the mirror to show him devoid of the polish. After giggling bashfully in an attempt to laugh the whole thing off, Jerry is then thrown out of the house by Tom.
