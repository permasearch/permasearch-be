Kilkenny's Colin Fennelly was a major doubt for the final after picking up a hamstring injury in a club match.[18] However, he recovered sufficiently to be named in the starting team. The Kilkenny team had one change from the team that had beaten Waterford in the semi-final. Eddie Brennan was included, replacing TJ Reid at right half forward.[19]
