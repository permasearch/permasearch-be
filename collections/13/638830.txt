The Ultimate Marvel version of Ben Reilly appears as an African-American lab assistant at Empire State University that worked with Dr. Curt Connors. Ironically, he combines Spider-Man's DNA with Lizard's along with the Venom suit to make the Carnage organism, and later steals a second sample of Spider-Man's from the lab.[55] Reilly later helps Doctor Octopus with the creation of Spider-Man's five clones while employed by the CIA. However, Carnage attacks the lab and the four clones escape. One clone has Kaine's insane personality and facial scars, and wears a makeshift version of Ben Reilly's costume. On a related note, Spider-Woman's character plays the same role that Scarlet Spider (Ben Reilly) did from the original "Clone Saga" did.[56]
