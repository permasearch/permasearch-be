One-on-one date: Desiree. Sean has set up a fake Art Museum to see Desiree's (self-nicknamed "Des") response to a prank. Taken through the art show and having met the artist, Sean escorts Des into an art room where she can see a sculpture that is to be the pinnacle of the exhibit; soon he is "asked" to return to the exhibit hall, and leaves Des with the art, saying he will return. Going to a back room with Chris (host), Sean is able to watch Des in the art room. Although she does nothing, the sculpture falls and shatters into many pieces. First the exhibit manager and then the artist come into the room and they ask Des what she has done to the precious artwork. Des does not know how to respond...and Sean returns to the room to save her, telling her that the art staff are actually professional actors and the artpiece is worth $5.00. Then Sean accompanies Des in his TV home for dinner; she receives a rose for being a good sport.
