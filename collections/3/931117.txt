In 2004, after a nine-hour interrogation, Omar Pena (Guillermo DÃ­az), a seaman in the US Navy, confesses to Detective Olivia Benson to the brutal rape of Ariel Baskins (Samantha Soule), who was tied up, gagged with a scarf, cut up, and got ammonia poured into her eyes. Omar has claimed his innocence since, saying his confession was made under extreme duress.
