Several Old English poems are adaptations of late classical philosophical texts. The longest is a 10th-century translation of Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy contained in the Cotton manuscript Otho A.vi.[43] Another is The Phoenix in the Exeter Book, an allegorisation of the De ave phoenice by Lactantius.[44]
