On Day 1, the original sixteen HouseGuests entered the house.[32] HouseGuests Jen and Ryan, a couple outside of the house,[33] were aware of each other's presence while ex-couple Jacob and Sharon were surprised to find one another in the house.[34][35] Following their entrance, the HouseGuests learned of the season's twist, in which they would be partnered with their "soulmate" and compete as a couple.[36] The HouseGuests then learned the identity of their soulmates; Adam & Sheila were paired together, while Alex & Amanda, Allison & Ryan, Chelsia & James, Jacob & Sharon, Jen & Parker, Joshuah & Neil, and Matt & Natalie were paired together.[37] HouseGuests Adam & Sheila immediately began to clash, annoying their fellow HouseGuests.[38] The couples then learned of the Power Couple twist, in which the winner of this title would choose to evict one of the couples from the house in a matter of days.[39] HouseGuests then competed in the "Falling For You" Power Couple competition.[40] For this competition, one person from each couple was hooked onto a zipline, while their partner had to hold onto them while being suspended in the air. The last couple remaining suspended without falling would be the winning team.[41] Midway through the competition, it was revealed that if a couple managed to get a pillow laying below them and went on to win the competition, they would earn a $10,000 prize.[42] Ultimately, Jen & Parker won the Power Couple competition, as well as the $10,000 prize.[43][44] On Day 2, in an attempt to cause drama, Jacob began telling some of the HouseGuests that Parker was a "snake" and not to trust him.[45] When Jen found out, she informed Parker of this, leading to a confrontation during which Jacob claimed he had been told this by another HouseGuest.[46] Sharon, in an attempt to save herself and her partner, implied to Parker that Ryan had made the statement.[47] Fearing that Parker would vote to evict Ryan, Jen informed Parker that she and Ryan were a couple outside of the house; Ryan then told Allison, as he felt it was unfair for her not to know.[48][49] On Day 3, Jen & Parker cast the sole vote to evict Jacob & Sharon from the house.[50][51][52]
