Though Austin's brand of legal positivism was greatly influential in the late 19th and early 20th centuries,[2] it is widely seen as overly simplistic today.[3] Critics such as H. L. A. Hart have charged that Austin's account fails to recognize that: (1) Most legal systems include rules that do not impose sanctions, but rather empower officials or citizens to do certain things (e.g., to make wills), or specify ways that legal rules may be identified or changed. (2) In many modern legal systems, such as that of the United States, lawmaking power is dispersed and it is very difficult to identify a "sovereign" in Austinâ€™s sense. (3) Defining legal duties in terms of "habits of obedience" to a determinate sovereign makes it hard to explain why laws remain in force when one government replaces another. (4) Mere threats do not give rise to obligations. If they did, there would be no essential difference between a gunman's threat ("Your money or your life") and an ordinary piece of legislation.[4]
