The signature play of the game came in the 4th quarter with Texas trailing 14â€“8. The Longhorns, normally a conservative power running team, faced 4th and 3 and chose to gamble with a deep play action pass. Quarterback James Street was so surprised by the call that he asked head coach Darrell Royal "Are you sure?" before heading to the huddle. Despite double coverage, Street hit Randy Peschel with a 44-yard pass to keep the drive alive. Texas scored to take the lead 2 plays later.
