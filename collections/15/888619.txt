The first Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) living wild in Scotland in over 400 years was captured in the River Tay in 2007 because it may have been illegally released or not of the proper genetic stock. There is an earlier undocumented sighting of a beaver in the River Earn, a Tay tributary, in May 2001. The Tay watershed beaver may be escapees from Tayside captive beaver enclosures.[7] The beaver became extinct in Great Britain towards the end of the 18th century, the last reference to beavers in England dating to 1789.[8] It is estimated that at least 20, and possibly up to 100, beavers live on the Tay River, although these were targeted for trapping by the Scottish Natural Heritage,[9] a decision was made to allow them to stay.[10]
