For financial and scripting reasons the last book was divided into two films, shot back to back,[38][39] which drew criticism from the series' fanbase. Radcliffe defended the split, stating that it would have been impossible to properly adapt the final novel into a single film.[40] He added that the last movie was going to be extremely fast-paced with a lot of action, while the first part would be far more sedate, focusing on character development; he added that, had they combined them, those things would not have made it to the final cut.[41] Filming lasted for a year, concluding in June 2010 and on the last day of shooting, like most of the cast and crew, Radcliffe openly wept.[42]
