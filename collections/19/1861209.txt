For the 2004 season Shepherd Racing Ventures switched to Dodge. The team increased their schedule, attempting 32 of the 36 races. Shepherd had a good start to the season, qualifying for the first race he attempted at Las Vegas. The No. 89 team did not have sufficient sponsorship money to complete the races, so Shepherd sometimes had to park his car early to save money. Shepherd had his best run at the spring race of Martinsville, finishing in 32nd position. Shepherd last finished a Cup race in 1999. Shepherd also ran the full race at the summer Daytona race, finishing in 33rd place. Shepherd qualified for 19 races that year. Shepherd started his 500th Cup start at the Siemens 300 at the New Hampshire International Speedway. He qualified in 41st position and finished in 40th place after running 192 of the 300 laps. He finished 42nd in the final points standings.
