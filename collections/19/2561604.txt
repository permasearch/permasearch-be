In the 60th Anniversary Edition and the 2010 special edition of Disney's Fantasia, Corey Burton voiced all of Deems Taylor's voice-over work. The original audio elements for Deems Taylor's commentaries were getting so deteriorated that they could not be used anymore. Disney decided to have Corey Burton re-record all of Deems Taylor's commentaries for consistency.
