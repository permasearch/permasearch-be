After the tragedy of the September 11, 2001 attacks, Ponce joined a group of 100 Latin American singers, who united to pay tribute to the victims by recording "Ultimo Adios" ("Last Good-Bye"). The proceeds of the recording were donated to families of the victims. That same year Ponce participated in Televisa production, Sin Pecado Concebido, along with Mexican actress, Ang√©lica Rivera. In 2002, he recorded his third studio album, Ponce; later that year he signed a contract with Telemundo to host a reality show called Protagonista de la Musica", which became one of the most popular Hispanic programs in the U.S. and Puerto Rico.[1][2][3]
