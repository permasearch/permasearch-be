The militants were able to claim a safe haven in the most sacred place for the Sikhs due to the whole or part support received by them from the key sikh religious leaders and  institutions such as the SGPC, AISSF and Jathedar (head) of the Akal Takht. The support was either voluntary or forced by using violence or threat of violence.[27] Several religious leaders who spoke against the occupation of Akal Takht were murdered by followers of Bhindranwale.[28]
