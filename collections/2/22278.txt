While shooting a video to show to one of her friends back in Texas, Jessie puts on an expensive tiara that Morgan bought for Christina when they got married. While shooting the video on the terrace, she accidentally drops the tiara into Mrs. Chesterfield's pool. Mrs. Chesterfield does not give the tiara back when asked and threatens to tell Morgan and Christina that Jessie was using it. To distract Mrs. Chesterfield, Jessie forces Bertram to ask Mrs. Chesterfield out on a date.
