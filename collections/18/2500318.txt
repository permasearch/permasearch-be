Notably, J. S. Bach's two books of The Well-Tempered Clavier, composed in 1722 and 1744 respectively, differ considerably in their application of Picardy thirds, which occur unambiguously at the end of all of the minor-mode preludes and all but one of the minor-mode fugues in the first book.[9] In the second book, however, fourteen of the minor-mode movements end on a minor chord, or occasionally, on a unison.[10] Manuscripts vary in many of these cases.
