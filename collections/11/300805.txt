Lichens occur from sea level to high alpine elevations, in many environmental conditions, and can grow on almost any surface.[8] Lichens are abundant growing on bark, leaves, mosses, on other lichens,[7] and hanging from branches "living on thin air" (epiphytes) in rain forests and in temperate woodland. They grow on rock, walls, gravestones, roofs, exposed soil surfaces, and in the soil as part of a biological soil crust. Different kinds of lichens have adapted to survive in some of the most extreme environments on Earth: arctic tundra, hot dry deserts, rocky coasts, and toxic slag heaps. They can even live inside solid rock, growing between the grains.
