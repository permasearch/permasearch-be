Peer-to-Peer P2P Lending for both real estate-secured and non-real estate-secured transactions by either investors or borrowers, is a mature industry in Canada. Peer-to-Peer P2P lending in real estate-secured transactions is regulated by members of the Mortgage Broker Regulators' Council of Canada (MBRCC),[78] including: the Financial Services Commission of Ontario (FSCO),[79] the Real Estate Council of Alberta (RECA) [80] and the Financial Institutions Commission of British Columbia (FICOM BC).[81] Starting as early as April 9, 2005 PrivateLender.org: Canada's Private Lending Network® is incontestably [the word "incontestable" is legislatively defined, pursuant to Canada's Federal Trade-marks Act R.S.C., 1985, c. T-13)[82]] recognized by Canadian federal government public records[83] as Canada's first network devoted to peer-to-peer P2P lending in both regulated mortgages (real-estate secured) and non-regulated loans (non-real-estate secured). Proof of federal recognition, registration and "date of first use as April 09, 2005" is found at the Canadian Intellectual Property Office (CIPO).[83] Since inception, member individuals and organizations who use the PrivateLender.org: Canada's Private Lending Network® platform are continuously registered with Canadian federal or provincial mortgage securities regulators including (but not limited to): the Financial Services Commission of Ontario (FSCO),[84] the Real Estate Council of Alberta (RECA) [85] and the Financial Institutions Commission of British Columbia (FICOM BC).[81] PrivateLender.org: Canada's Private Lending Network® has the further distinction of being the world's first and only peer-to-peer P2P network with continuous registration to ISO 9001:2015[86] since May 9, 2008.[87] ISO 9001:2015 is published by the International Organization for Standardization [88] and is the National Standard for Quality Management Systems in 119 countries[89] and registration thereto provides legislators, regulators, customers, prospective customers and other interested parties with at-a-glance "confidence that their products are safe, reliable and of good quality.".[90] Canadian Capital Markets Securities Regulators (members of the Canadian Securities Administrators)[91] are recent entrants to Canadian Peer-to-Peer P2P lending and are only issuing interim approvals "...in order to test their products, services and applications throughout the Canadian market on a time limited basis.,[92] through "Regulatory Sandbox" programs including the CSA Regulatory Sandbox[92] and the Ontario Securities Commission Sandbox, branded as "OSC Launchpad".[93]
