The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism was Weber's third major work on the sociology of religion. In this work he deals with the structure of Indian society, with the orthodox doctrines of Hinduism and the heterodox doctrines of Buddhism, with modifications brought by the influence of popular religiosity and finally with the impact of religious beliefs on the secular ethic of Indian society.[94] In Weber's view, Hinduism in India, like Confucianism in China, was a barrier for capitalism.[88] The Indian caste system made it very difficult for individuals to advance in the society beyond their caste.[88] Activity, including economic activity, was seen as unimportant in the context of the advancement of the soul.[88]
