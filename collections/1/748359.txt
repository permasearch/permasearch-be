The church set was built over a six-week period in a vacant lot on the corner of 13th Street and Sixth Avenue,[61] near residential homes.[54] The one-room, 2,000-square-foot (190Â m2) building seats approximately 80 people and is estimated to be worth $250,000 to $350,000.[61] Special-effects coordinator Will Purcell subdued concerns about the church burning scene by stating that the building would not actually be set on fire. The intended menacing effect is "all camera angles. It is a safe environment for actors to do their work." Several techniques were used to simulate the fire, including the use of propane pipes to shoot flames through the church windows.[62] At the end of filming, Cyrus hoped to fly the church set back to her family's estate in Tennessee. Disney agreed to donate the building to the island after Tybee officials lobbied to keep it, with the condition that its connection to The Last Song not be advertised.[61] The set will be moved to a new location and brought up to code for use as a non-denominational chapel for island weddings; renovations are expected to cost approximately $600,000.[63]
