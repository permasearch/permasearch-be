InSight was initially known as GEMS (Geophysical Monitoring Station), but its name was changed in early 2012 following a request by NASA.[17] Out of 28 proposals from 2010,[18] it was one of the three Discovery Program finalists receiving US$3 million in May 2011 to develop a detailed concept study.[19] In August 2012, InSight was selected for development and launch.[11] Managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) with participation from scientists from several countries, the mission is cost-capped at US$425 million, not including launch vehicle funding.[20]
