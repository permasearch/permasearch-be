Dean Peter Tufano started the Oxford 1+1 MBA programme which allows students to pair the one-year full-time MBA programme with one of a selection of one-year MSc programmes offered by other University of Oxford departments. For example, students can acquire an MBA in conjunction with a MSc from the Department of Computer Science or the Department of Education. The idea behind the Oxford 1+1 programme is to combine the depth of a specialised, one-year master's degree with the breadth of a one-year MBA.[14]
