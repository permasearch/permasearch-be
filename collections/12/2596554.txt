Short-term memory (STM) is the ability to store small amounts of information for a limited amount of time. The Miller's Law that the capacity of an average person's STM is 7Â±2 objects, and lasts for a matter of seconds.[25] This means that when given a series of items to remember, most people can remember 5-9 of those items, the average being 7. However, this limit can be increased by rehearsing the information. Information in STM can be transferred to long-term memory (LTM) by rehearsal and association with other information previously stored in LTM. Most of the research on stress and memory has been done on working memory (WM), as opposed to STM.
