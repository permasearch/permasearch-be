Many different domino sets have been used for centuries in various parts of the world to play a variety of domino games.  Each domino originally represented one of the 21 results of throwing two six-sided dice (2d6). One half of each domino is set with the pips from one die and the other half contains the pips from the second die. Chinese sets also introduce duplicates of some throws and divide the dominoes into two suits: military and civil.[9] Chinese dominoes are also longer than typical European dominoes.
