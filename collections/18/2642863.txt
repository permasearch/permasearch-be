During September 2014, It was announced by the University of South Wales that the Caerleon campus would close in 2016[23] with courses being integrated into the remaining campuses. The University intends to sell the campus for housing development but there is strong opposition to the proposed re-development from local residents.[24] The Caerleon Civic Society has asked Cadw, the body that looks after historic monuments and buildings in Wales, to give the Edwardian main building Grade II Listed building status to save it from demolition.[25] On 7 August 2016 the Welsh Government announced that they would recommend that the main building, gatehouses and gate-piers be listed as ‘buildings of special architectural and historic interest’. The University of South Wales expressed their continued opposition to the proposed listing but the announcement was welcomed by local politicians and the Caerleon Civic Society.[26] Grade II listing of the Main Building, the Principal’s Residence, Gate Piers and Caretaker’s / Gardener’s Lodge was confirmed on the 3 March 2017 .[27]
