The proposed bill sparked protests from the people of both Agoo and Aringay who did not want the merger because it would subject them to the same high local taxes as Agoo, because the people of Agoo don't want their area to expand too much, and because of concerns that Agoo and Aringay would lose their cultural identities.[25] The proposed merger did not push through within term of the 16th congress.[25]
