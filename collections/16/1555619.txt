Carbon, aluminium, phosphorus and selenium continue the theme. Carbon, in black powder, is a constituent of fireworks rocket propellants, bursting charges, and effects mixtures, and military delay fuses and igniters.[192][n 21] Aluminium is a common pyrotechnic ingredient,[183] and is widely employed for its capacity to generate light and heat,[194] including in thermite mixtures.[195] Phosphorus can be found in smoke and incendiary munitions, paper caps used in toy guns, and party poppers.[196] Selenium has been used in the same way as tellurium.[191]
