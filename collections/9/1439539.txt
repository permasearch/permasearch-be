The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 80% of visual impairment is either preventable or curable with treatment.[3] This includes cataracts, the infections river blindness and trachoma, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, uncorrected refractive errors, and some cases of childhood blindness.[10] Many people with significant visual impairment benefit from vision rehabilitation, changes in their environment, and assistive devices.[2]
