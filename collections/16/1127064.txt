In Reynolds v. Sims, the Court ruled that the right to vote is a “fundamental right,” establishing a strict scrutiny test. Further, the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees “equal protection of the laws” to all persons. However, Section 2 of this Amendment allows states to remove voting privileges from anyone who has participated in “rebellion or other crime.”[14] A 1972 Supreme Court ruling found that this article applied to disenfranchisement of ex-felons. The Civic Participation and Rehabilitation Act, allowing for ex-felons to vote, has been introduced at the beginning of every legislative session since 1994, but has never made it to the floor of Congress.
