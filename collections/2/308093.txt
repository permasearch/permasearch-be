Clock management is also a component of the game of basketball. In that sport, the rules governing the game clock are simpler; the clock stops when the ball is dead and runs when it is live. Most clock management in basketball centers around both the game clock and the shot clock. An offense nearing the end of a game and holding a slim lead will attempt to use up as much of both clocks as possible before shooting the ball to give the opposing team as little time as possible to respond.
