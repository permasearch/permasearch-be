During manual body cavity searches, an inmate is temporarily transferred to an offsite clinic to be examined by a licensed physician of the same gender; body orifices are probed using fingers or instruments. The circumstances in which these inspections may be done are often restricted, such as on individuals refusing to offer to consent to a visual body cavity search for reasons other than anxiety or in situations where there is a strong evidence to suspect the presence of contraband, and require a court order.
