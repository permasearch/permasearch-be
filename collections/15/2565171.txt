Statoconia (also called otoconia) are numerous grains, often spherical in shape, between 1 and 50 µm; collectively[citation needed]. Statoconia are also sometimes termed a statocyst. Otoliths (also called statoliths) are agglutinated crystals or crystals precipitated around a nucleus, with well defined morphology and together all may be termed endolymphatic infillings.[1][6][7]
