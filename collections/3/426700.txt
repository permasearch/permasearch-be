Back in the Urbana Caves, the helicopter that broke off from Ringer and Cassie's air attack lands. Zombie, Nugget and Megan prepare for the battle. Tear gas is thrown into the caves, but Ringer had preemptively warned them how they would be attacked and everyone is wearing gas masks. Next, the soldiers cave-in the only two entrances to the cave. Zombie had expected this and plants a homemade bomb in the front cave-in to make an escape. Once Zombie and Nugget make it through (Megan is too scared and stays behind) a shot is fired at Zombie and just misses him thanks to Nuggets asking him why a red dot is on his face. The 2 of them crawl away and move towards the pit of dead bodies. Zombie tells Nugget to hide inside and starts to head back to save Megan. While crawling back he is shot at 2 more times. One shot lands in front and another brushes his bicep. Zombie believes that they are toying with him as they try to kill him. At that moment he remembers that he forgot to place the dead soldiers tracker in his mouth, upon doing so his signature disappears from the soldiers lenses. Zombie makes his way to the cave entrance and gets Megan out. The whole time praying that if he is killed, (which he is certain will happen in this battle) that at least Megan and Nugget survive. As he leaves the cave with Megan, he is shot in the back of the head and everything goes white...
