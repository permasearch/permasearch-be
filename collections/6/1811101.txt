Major birds of prey as well as terrestrial mammals in the park include bald eagle, golden eagle, Dall's sheep, Alaskan moose, caribou, peregrine falcon, and wolf packs. Smaller mammals include coyote packs, marten, red fox, wolverine, river otter, beaver and Canadian lynx. Marine mammals include sea lion, beluga whale, harbor seal, and porpoise. Both black and brown bear species are present in the park. Black bears use all areas of the park and preserve, except the higher elevations. Brown bears are most numerous along the coast. A recent survey found that about 219 bears graze in salt marshes during the summer in the coastal areas of the park.[31] Caribou have recently declined in population size from 200,000 to 30,000 due to an unknown cause.[32]
