The song was featured in the 8th and 9th seasons of the NBC sitcom Seinfeld. In "The Bizarro Jerry"' Cosmo Kramer (Michael Richards) accidentally begins working at a financial services company. The song is played during a montage of Kramer's "work" experience. In "The Butter Shave", George Costanza (Jason Alexander) gets a job at a playground equipment company and the boss thinks he's handicapped due to his use of a cane as he had learned to walk again following the events in "The Summer of George". George takes advantage of this and the song is played during a montage.
