Loyola was established as St. Ignatius College on June 30, 1870, by Jesuit priest and educator Fr. Arnold Damen.[8] At that time Chicago was a much smaller, but rapidly growing, city just shy of 300,000 people, and as a result the original campus was much closer to the city center along Roosevelt Road. In 1909 the school was renamed Loyola University, and in 1912 it began to move to the current Lake Shore Campus; today the original building is part of St. Ignatius College Prep, adjacent to the University of Illinois at Chicago.
