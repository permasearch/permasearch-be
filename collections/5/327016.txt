With 15 players left, a tribe swap occurred. Shonee and Tegan were sent to the Champions, while Lydia, Monika, and Sharn were sent to the Contenders. Benji and Robbie immediately aligned with the former Champions, with Shonee and Tegan attempted to align with the majority Champion alliance of Mat R, Samuel, Shane and Steve W. This initially worked, as Mat R. decided Jackie could not be trusted and sent her home, but despite Brian attempting to form an alliance with Shonee and Tegan plus Shane, Shane stuck with the Champions and targeted Tegan. Tegan was offered another reprieve, as the Contenders were given the chance to save her, but Benji and Robbie worked with the former Champions to send her out of the game for good. The new alliance then eliminated Teganâ€™s best friend Heath, leaving the tribes at six players each.
