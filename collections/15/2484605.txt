Like Ricky, Julian, and Bubbles, Ray's surname was never spoken on-screen. However, in Season Eleven, when Julian and Bubbles are trying to determine whether or not Lahey is Ricky's biological father, they discover that Ray's last name was "Flower", which he later changed to "LaFleur" because of the other truckers' habit of mocking his last name.
