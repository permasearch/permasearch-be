It is unforeseen how the first human landing on Mars will change the current policies regarding the exploration of space and occupancy of celestial bodies. In the 1967, United Nations Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, it was determined that no country may take claim to space or its inhabitants. Since the planet Mars offers a challenging environment and dangerous obstacles for humans to overcome, the laws and culture on the planet will most likely be very different from those on Earth.[92] With Elon Musk announcing his plans for travel to Mars, it is uncertain how to the dynamic of a private company possibly being the first to put a human on Mars will play out on a national and global scale.[93][94] With NASA having recently taken a cut in funding, it is no longer certain that they will be a leading force in the journey to Mars.[95] It is likely that the values and culture on Mars will be determined by the group that establishes human contact with the planet first.
