On 11 July 2015, Ronaldinho announced his return to Brazil and signed an 18-month contract with Fluminense,[104] but on 28 September, Ronaldinho reached a mutual agreement with the club to terminate the deal.[105] He made nine appearances during his two-month stint at the club, failing to impress and being heavily criticized by the fans.[106] Fluminense sporting director Mario Bittencourt stated, "Ronaldinho asked us for a meeting. He respectfully told us he didn't feel he was able to perform as good as he wanted and that it was a bad situation for him. He made a great gesture in saying he wasn't being the player he felt he could be right now. I'll never speak about whether or not he is retiring. That's not something you say about a player of his calibre. He was always spectacular, as player and person."[106]
