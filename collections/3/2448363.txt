On that day in August 1894, Lodge demonstrated the reception of Morse code signalling via radio waves using a "coherer". He later improved Branly's coherer by adding a "trembler" which dislodged clumped filings,[75] thus restoring the device's sensitivity.[76] In August 1898 he got U.S. Patent 609,154, "Electric Telegraphy", that made wireless signals using a Ruhmkorff coil for the transmitter and a Branly coherer for the detector. This patent utilized the concept of "syntonic" tuning. In 1912 Lodge sold the patent to Marconi.
