Time magazine was an early adopter if not originator of the "World War III." Perhaps the first usage appears in its November 3, 1941, issue (preceding the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941) under its "National Affairs" section and entitled "World War III?" about Nazi refugee Dr. Hermann Rauschning, who had just arrived in the United States.[2] In its March 22, 1943, issue under its "Foreign News" section, Time reused the same title "World War III?" with regard to statements by then-Vice President Henry A. Wallace: "We shall decide some time in 1943 or 1944... whether to plant the seeds of World War III."[3][4] Time continued to entitle with or mention in stories the term "World War III" for the rest of the decade (and onwards): 1944,[5][6] 1945,[7][8] 1946 ("bacterial warfare"),[9] 1947,[10] and 1948.[11] (Time persists in using this term, e.g., this 2015 book review, entitled "This Is What World War III Will Look Like."[12])
