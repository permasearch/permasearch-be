The partition of Bengal in 1905 along religious lines led to mass protests, making Calcutta a less hospitable place for the British.[37][38] The capital was moved to New Delhi in 1911.[39] Calcutta continued to be a centre for revolutionary organisations associated with the Indian independence movement. The city and its port were bombed several times by the Japanese between 1942 and 1944, during World War II.[40][41] Coinciding with the war, millions starved to death during the Bengal famine of 1943 due to a combination of military, administrative, and natural factors.[42] Demands for the creation of a Muslim state led in 1946 to an episode of communal violence that killed over 4,000.[43][44][45] The partition of India led to further clashes and a demographic shiftâ€”many Muslims left for East Pakistan (present day Bangladesh), while hundreds of thousands of Hindus fled into the city.[46]
