India has the world's 4th largest coal reserves. In India, coal is the bulk of primary energy contributor with  56.90% share equivalent to 411.9 Mtoe in 2016.[5] India is the third top coal producer in 2013 with 7.6% production share of coal (including lignite) in the world. Top five hard and brown coal producing countries in 2013 (2012) are (million tons): China 3,680 (3,645), United States 893 (922), India 605 (607), Australia 478 (453) and Indonesia 421 (386). However, India ranks fifth in global coal production at 228 mtoe (5.9%) in 2013 when its inferior quality coal tonnage is converted into tons of oil equivalent.[31] Coal-fired power plants account for 59% of India's installed electricity capacity.[57][58] After electricity production, coal is also used for cement production in substantial quantity.[59] In 2013, India imported nearly 95 Mtoe of steam coal and coking coal which is 29% of total consumption to meet the demand in electricity, cement and steel production.[31] Pet coke availability, at cheaper price to local coal, is replacing coal in cement plants.[60]
