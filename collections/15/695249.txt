San Pablo itself is known for its seven crater lakes, the largest of which is Lake Sampaloc. Apart from the Laguna de Bay and the Seven Lakes of San Pablo, there are also two reservoir lakes that can be found in Laguna, the Lake Caliraya and Lumot Lake. These two man-made lakes were formed by the creation of the Caliraya Dam and the Lumot Dam.
