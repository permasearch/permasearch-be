Each episode opens with the banner graphic "Creating Excellence" over a video package of past and current Ring of Honor talent competing in various matches as well as the series's theme song, before going to an introduction and the opening match. An episode typically features 3 to 4 matches as well as interviews from the wrestlers regarding their upcoming matches or current storylines. The show typically ends after the main event (the final match on an episode) and goes to a closing graphic.[19]
