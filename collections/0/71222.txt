The song was written by Mitch Murray,[2] who offered it to Adam Faith and Brian Poole but was turned down.[4] George Martin of EMI decided to pick it up for the new group he was producing, the Beatles, as the A-side of their first record.[4] The Beatles recorded the song but opposed releasing it, feeling that it did not fit their sound, but worked out changes from Murray's demo-disc version. These included a new introduction, vocal harmony, an instrumental interlude, small lyric changes and removal of the half-step modulation for the last verse.[4] They recorded the song in September, 1962; although Murray disliked their changes, the decision not to release the Beatles' version was primarily a business one.[5] "Love Me Do" was their first single instead. The recording was officially released in November 1995 on the Beatles retrospective Anthology 1 album.
