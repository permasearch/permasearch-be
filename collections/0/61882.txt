With the lyrics "Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?", Del Rey adds a hint of desperation which parallels the idiosyncrasies faced by the characters in F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel The Great Gatsby.[9] Del Rey's dreamy vocals are draped over sedated strings and canned percussion.[9] The soft and dreary vocals, falling in line with Del Rey's retro affectation, fits the atmosphere of the 1920s when the novel is set.[10] The lyrics rotate around the themes of pleasing a lover, nostalgia, and the gloom of aging.[11] The Cedric Gervais remix of the song was released on October 11, 2013.
