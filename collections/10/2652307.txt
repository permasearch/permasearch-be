Shortly after being sheltered in the Coven, Marie Laveau (Angela Bassett) steals a newborn baby from a hospital in the middle of the nightâ€”after being reminded of an old agreement with dark forces in the form of Papa Legba (Lance Reddick). The next day, Fiona (Jessica Lange), finding out Hank (Josh Hamilton) was hired by Laveau, is furious that Cordelia (Sarah Paulson) allowed witch hunters into the Coven and plans a scheme against them before they strike again.
