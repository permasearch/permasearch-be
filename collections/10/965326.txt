Uther Pendragon (portrayed by Anthony Head) was the king of Camelot. He was a competent ruler of Camelot for many years, leading the realm into prosperity. His wife, Ygraine, was unable to have children, so Uther made a magical deal to enable her to bear him a son; however, she died shortly after, leading Uther to hate magic and all who would practice it. He began "The Great Purge", which led to a near extinction of magic in the realm. Later on, he would take in Morgana (who secretly was his daughter) and raise her alongside Arthur. At the end of Series 3, he is taken prisoner and tortured, but is eventually rescued by Arthur and his knights, with Merlin. Uther is unable to lead the realm afterwards, and Arthur takes over with assistance from his uncle Agravaine. In the series 4 episode The Wicked Day, Uther protects Arthur from an assassin (hired by Odin) by placing himself between his son and the assassin's knife. Uther is critically wounded, and Merlin attempts to heal him with magic, but is unsuccessful, as unbeknownst to him, Morgana and Agravaine have placed a necklace on Uther to make Merlin's magic harmful. Uther dies, making Arthur the king.
