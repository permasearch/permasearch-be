The Seebeck effect refers to an electromotive force whenever there is a temperature gradient in a conductive material. Under open-circuit conditions where there is no internal current flow, the gradient of voltage (      ∇  V    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}V}  ) is directly proportional to the gradient in temperature (      ∇  T    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}T}  ):
