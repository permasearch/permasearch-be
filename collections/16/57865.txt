Henry Jackman returned from Winter Soldier to score the sequel.[162] He found the movie to be tonally different from the previous one, which necessitated a much more symphonic and orchestral score. This culminates in the final fight between Captain America, Winter Soldier, and Iron Man, the music for which Jackman described as "somewhat operatic and ... almost classical in its style".[163] Though Jackman reprised and developed his themes for Captain America and the Winter Soldier from the previous film,[164][165] and introduced motifs for the new characters Spider-Man, Black Panther, and Zemo,[163] he was wary of pushing the audience to one side of the central conflict or the other by using character-specific music; Jackman composed a new main theme for the film to represent the Civil War, "a generic theme to balance everything out",[166] "toward which all the characters can gravitate. It wrapped them all up and it helped to bind the movie together rather than do endless disparate themes."[167] Jackman also wrote a thriller theme that appears whenever the mystery surrounding Zemo's plan is explored. This was inspired by the works of Jerry Goldsmith.[164] The score was released on a soundtrack album by Hollywood Records on May 6, 2016.[168]
