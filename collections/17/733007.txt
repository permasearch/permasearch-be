In December 2004, an 10.6-mile (17.1 km) widening project was completed from US 15/US 501 (exit 270), in Durham, to NC 147 (exit 279), in the RTP. The project expanded lanes from four to six-lanes.[84] In March 2005, construction crews returned for eight weeks to replace asphalt used in the widening project, which began to deteriorate not long after the lanes opened to the public.[85] However, the paving mistakes were more severe and NCDOT contracted Lane Construction Corp to replace all the bad concrete used in the botch widening project, at a cost of $21.7 million.[86][87]
