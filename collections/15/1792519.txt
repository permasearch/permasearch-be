Icke believes that the "Brotherhood" uses human anxiety as energy, and that the Archons keep humanity trapped in a "five sense reality", so they can feed off the negative energy created by fear and hate.[13][16] Claiming the more of these emotions that can be stimulated the more energy the reptilians have to work with. Icke wrote in 1999: "Thus we have the encouragement of wars, human genocide, the mass slaughter of animals, sexual perversions which create highly charged negative energy, and black magic ritual and sacrifice which takes place on a scale that will stagger those who have not studied the subject."[130] Icke proposes that human sacrifice 'to the gods' in the ancient world, was for the benefit of the reptilians, especially sacrifice of children, because "at the moment of death by sacrifice a form of adrenalin surges through the body, accumulating at the base of the brain and is, apparently more potent in children", claiming "this is what the reptilians and their crossbreeds want." Icke suggests that these sacrifices continue to this day.[130] He also claims the reptilians and their hybrid bloodlines engage in pedophilia, and cannibalism.[142]
