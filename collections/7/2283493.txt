Mitsubishi redesigned the Pajeros for a second generation, which debuted in January 1991, although exports did not commence until later in the year. Just about everything was now new and further enhanced. A new, larger body was available in four different versions; Metal Top, Canvas Top Convertible (short wheelbase), Semi High Roof Wagon and High Roof Wagon (long wheelbase). The short wheelbase models were stretched by 70 millimetres (2.8 in) and the long-wheelbase models by 30 millimetres (1.2 in). The available engines included a 3.0-liter 12-valve SOHC (6G72) with ECI-Multi electronic fuel injection and a 2.5-liter turbocharged diesel engine (4D56T) with an intercooler.
