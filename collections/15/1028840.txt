Prior to the first winter games in 1924, the winter sports of Figure skating and Ice hockey had been contested in the Summer Olympics. The creation of the first winter games allowed for many athletes of the era to compete in both sets of games in the same discipline,[2] and on this page these athletes are listed below the main list. The Russian athlete Nikolai Panin is unique in having competed in both a summer sport (shooting in 1912) and a winter sport (figure skating in 1908) but only competing at the Summer Olympics.[3]
