On February 9, 2017, Governor Robert J. Bentley named Luther Strange, the Attorney General of Alabama, to fill the vacancy until a special election could take place. Bentley controversially scheduled the special election to align with the 2018 general election instead of sooner.[2][3] When Kay Ivey succeeded Bentley as Governor, she rescheduled the special election for December 12, 2017.[4]
