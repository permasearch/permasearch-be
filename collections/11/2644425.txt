The Island achieved notoriety in 1993 when Derek Beackon of the British National Party became a councillor for Millwall ward, in a by election. This was the culmination of years of resentment by local residents of perceived neglect by both Liberal Democrat and Labour Party politicians.[18] Labour regained the ward in the full council election of May 1994, and held all three seats until a further by election in September 2004.
