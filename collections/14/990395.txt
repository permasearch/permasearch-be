Namaá¸¥ means 'bow', 'obeisance', 'reverential salutation' or 'adoration'[10] and te means 'to you' (singular dative case of 'tvam'). Therefore, Namaste literally means "bowing to you". [11] In Hinduism, it also has a spiritual import reflecting the belief that "the divine and self (atman, soul) is same in you and me", and connotes "I bow to the divine in you".[4][6]
