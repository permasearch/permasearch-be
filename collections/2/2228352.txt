In October 2012, the European Union's commissioner for health and consumer policy, John Dalli, resigned,[12] following an investigation by the European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF), into a complaint made by tobacco producer Swedish Match.  OLAF found that an unnamed Maltese entrepreneur approached Swedish Match using his contacts with Mr. Dalli, seeking payments in exchange for influence over possible snus legislation. The new EU's Tobacco Products Directive was expected to be appointed during autumn 2012.
