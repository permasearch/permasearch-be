In June 2014, it was announced that from 1 September 2014, the presenters would move to a weekly Monday night slot, from 9pm to 10pm, to a show that would continue to be fully visualised.[6] In August 2014, it was announced that this new show would be a different format, with new presenters from the online world (including Troye Sivan and Tyler Oakley among others) hosting shows; Dan and Phil would present the first broadcast of each month.[7] This show is known as the Internet Takeover, and incorporates some features from the original Dan and Phil show, such as the Internet News and the audience's music videos (though listeners are unable to request songs to be played).
