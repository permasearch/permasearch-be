In the next sequence, the previously peaceful friend begins rallying a crowd of oppressed-looking people. We see a man wearing a bandana spray an X over a poster with a picture of the now-dictator-like friend on it, and then the word "LIAR" below that. We then see a crowd of people, led by the rebellious friend, advancing on the tower. They are stopped by a line of heavily armed riot-control officers, with shields displaying a fist and submachine guns, who proceed to kill the entire crowd. The bandana wearing man is killed first by a sniper, following many more deaths. The corporate friend looks on in horror as he sees his friend shot down dead and lying on the floor.
