1871, was a decisive transition from 15 years of warfare in the Crimea and in Germany and France, to the 40 years of peace in Europe.[98][99] With the triumphant founding of the German Empire, and the humiliation of France at signing of the Treaty of Frankfurt (May 10, 1871). Otto von Bismarck emerged as the decisive figure in European and world history, 1871-1890. He not only retained his control over Prussia, he added a new level of control over the foreign and domestic policies of the new German Empire. Bismarck had built his reputation as a war-maker, but changed overnight into a peacemaker. He skillfully used balance of power diplomacy to maintain Germany's position in a Europe which, despite many disputes and war scares, remained at peace. For historian Eric Hobsbawm, it was Bismarck who "remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, [and] devoted himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers."[100]
