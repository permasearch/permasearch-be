When Justinian succeeded to the throne in 527, two years after the marriage, Theodora became co-ruler, Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. She shared in his plans and political strategies, participated in state councils, and Justinian called her his "partner in my deliberations."[13] She had her own court, her own official entourage, and her own imperial seal.[14]
