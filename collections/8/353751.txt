Myola is close to the watershed. A stream flowing from Myola is part of the headwaters of Eora Creek on the northern watershed.[45] On the northern part of the track, its course, to Deniki, is determined by Eora Creek. It follows along the side of the steep valley formed by the creek. It crosses the creek from one side to the other at several points along its course. From Deniki, the track descends to the Kokoda plateau.[46]
