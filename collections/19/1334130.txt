Elements of both the rationalist and normative theories of compliance are evident in South Africa’s current environmental regime. Historically, wildlife and conservation authorities adopted a rationalist approach, relying on the deterrence theory, with enforcement being very much secured through arrest and criminal prosecution. On the other hand, compliance and enforcement in the industrial sector, “perhaps under the influence of large corporations,” has focused more on the normative theory, adopting “a far more conciliatory approach to compliance and enforcement.”[79]
