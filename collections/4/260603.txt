Anthropogenic carbon emissions exceed the amount that can be taken up or balanced out by natural sinks.[90] As a result, carbon dioxide has gradually accumulated in the atmosphere, and as of 2013[update], its concentration is almost 43% above pre-industrial levels.[11][12] Various techniques have been proposed for removing excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in carbon dioxide sinks. Currently about half of the carbon dioxide released from the burning of fossil fuels is not absorbed by vegetation and the oceans and remains in the atmosphere.[91]
