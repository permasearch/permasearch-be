Some authors believe CIA officer John Paisley was a member of the Plumbers. Paisley was assigned to the CIA's Office of Security (OS), of which Watergate burglar James McCord was once a member. On August 9, 1971, David Young's memo indicates he met with Paisley and OS Director Howard Osborn, in which Paisley provided a list of objectives for the Special Investigations Unit.[4]
