In September the discussion turned toward an outright declaration of independence from Spain, and a document announcing the act was drawn up and debated. The 15 September council meeting at which independence was finally declared was chaired by Gabino Gaínza,[4] and the text of the Act itself was written by Honduran intellectual and politician José Cecilio del Valle[5] and signed by representatives of the various Central American provinces, including José Matías Delgado, José Lorenzo de Romaña and José Domingo Diéguez.[1] The meeting was held at the National Palace in Guatemala City, the site of which is now Centennial Park.
