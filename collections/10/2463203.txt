A year after the GMS contract variation came into effect, many GPs were continuing to use 0844 numbers in defiance of the ban.[148][149][150][151][152][153][154][155][156][157][158][159][160][161] In March and May 2011, more than 1300 GP surgeries were still using the banned 0844 (and 0845/0870) numbers.[162][163] It was becoming clear that local decision makers (i.e. PCTs and GPs) had failed to understand the 0844 revenue share mechanism as well as the price regulations that apply uniquely to BT and make their call rates atypical when compared to other providers.[164] At least one PCT claimed that they did not know what patients were paying for calls and further claimed that they had no way of finding out,[161] seemingly unaware that every telecoms supplier publishes a detailed price list on their respective websites.
