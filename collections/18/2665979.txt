Major venues for concerts include BIC, Pavilion Theatre and O2 Academy.[103] Built in 1984, the BIC is also a popular place for party political conferences and has been used by all three major political parties.[104] Its four auditoria make it the largest venue on the south coast.[105] The O2 and Pavilion are older and are both Grade II listed buildings. The O2, which opened in 1895 as the Grand Pavilion Theatre, was initially used as a circus and later for music hall theatre. The Pavilion opened in 1929 as concert hall and tea room while also providing a venue for the municipal orchestra. It continues to provide traditional entertainment today, presenting West End stage shows, ballet and operas.[106][107][108] Bournemouth has more than 200 listed buildings, mainly from the Victorian and Edwardian eras, including three grade I churches; St Peter's, St Clement's and St Stephen's.[108]
