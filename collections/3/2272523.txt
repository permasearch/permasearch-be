Article 48 was used by President Paul von Hindenburg in 1930 to deal with the economic crisis of the time. During spring and summer 1930, Chancellor Heinrich Br端ning[7] found his government unable to obtain a parliamentary majority for its financial reform bill, which was voted down by the Reichstag,[8] but the government did not seriously try to negotiate with the Parliament to find a modus vivendi. Instead, Br端ning asked Hindenburg to invoke Article 48 in order to promulgate the bill as an emergency decree and thereby give Br端ning's government the authority to act without the consent of the Reichstag.[9] When Hindenburg gave his authority and issued the decree, the Reichstag repudiated the decree, by a small majority[10] on 18 July 1930. Under Article 48, this vote by a majority of the Reichstag members invalidated the presidential decree. Faced with a breakdown of parliamentary rule at a time when the economic situation demanded action, Br端ning asked Hindenburg to dissolve parliament and call for new elections. The Reichstag was accordingly dissolved on 18 July and new elections were scheduled for 14 September 1930.[11][12]
