Law 5 of the Laws of Cricket,[4] as the rules of the game are known, state that the length of the bat may be no more than 38 in (965 mm), the width no more than 4.25 in (108 mm), the overall depth no more than 2.64 in (67 mm) and edge no more than 1.56 in (40 mm). Bats typically weigh from 2 lb 7 oz to 3 lb (1.2 to 1.4 kg) though there is no standard. Appendix B of the Laws of Cricket set out more precise specifications.[5] This rule was introduced following the Monster Bat Incident of 1771.
