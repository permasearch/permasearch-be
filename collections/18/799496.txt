The legion was drawn up in three lines of battle, with the thermae and the velites placed as the situation required. The hastati in front and the principles behind were stationed in a line of maniples like chess pieces, 10 per line, separated from each other. The two centuries of a maniple fought side-by-side. The line of principes was offset so as to cover the gaps in the hastati, and the triarii, somewhat more thinly-spread, covered the principes.
