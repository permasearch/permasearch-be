By 1960, no compound with a covalently bound noble gas atom had yet been synthesized.[6] The first published report, in June 1962, of a noble gas compound was by Neil Bartlett, who noticed that the highly oxidising compound platinum hexafluoride ionised O2 to O+ 2. As the ionisation energy of O2 to O+ 2 (1165 kJ mol−1) is nearly equal to the ionisation energy of Xe to Xe+ (1170 kJ mol−1), he tried the reaction of Xe with PtF6. This yielded a crystalline product, xenon hexafluoroplatinate, whose formula was proposed to be Xe+[PtF 6]−.[4][7] It was later shown that the compound is actually more complex, containing both XeFPtF5 and XeFPt2F11.[8] Nonetheless, this was the first real compound of any noble gas.
