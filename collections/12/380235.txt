Crevasses can form in several different ways.  Transverse crevasses are transverse to flow and form where steeper slopes cause a glacier to accelerate.  Longitudinal crevasses form semi-parallel to flow where a glacier expands laterally.  Marginal crevasses form from the edge of the glacier, due to the reduction in speed caused by friction of the valley walls.  Marginal crevasses are usually largely transverse to flow.  Moving glacier ice can sometimes separate from stagnant ice above, forming a bergschrund.  Bergschrunds resemble crevasses but are singular features at a glacier's margins.
