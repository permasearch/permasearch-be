If it appears to the magistrate, on the materials submitted, that a death took place, and that it was not due to natural causes, the magistrate causes an inquest to be instituted.[528] If the inquest is to be held in another district, or before a judge or regional magistrate, the magistrate forwards the papers accordingly.[529]
