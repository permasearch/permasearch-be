It is the responsibility of the buyer of real property to ensure that he or she obtains a good and marketable title to the landâ€”ie., that the seller is the owner, has the right to sell the property, and there is no factor which would impede a mortgage or re-sale. Some jurisdictions have legislated some protections for the buyer, besides the ability for the buyer to do searches relating to the property.
