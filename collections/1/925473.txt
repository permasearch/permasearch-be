On 13 May, a third independent MP, Prabakaran Parameswaran, who won in the constituency of Batu, announced that he would also join PKR, increasing Pakatan's total tally in the Dewan Rakyat to 124.[57] He was endorsed by PKR during the election after PKR's original candidate, Tian Chua, was disqualified from contesting due to a RM2,000 fine.[58]
