Writers Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi took over the script during July 2008 and used Beacham's draft as a starting point. They focused on the mythology and telling the story through Leterrier's eyes. Hay and Manfredi had to rewrite the script in less than a year using a very active process.[15] Leterrier sought Ray Harryhausen's involvement,[11] and reunited with Hulk concept artist Aaron Sims, who had already been working on Clash of the Titans with Norrington.[16]
