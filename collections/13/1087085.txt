In 1914, Arizona's first famous coach, James Fred "Pop" McKale was lured away from a teaching and coaching job at Tucson High School to take over as Athletic Director and coach basketball, football, baseball and track.[13] McKale took things to a new level, posting a 9â€“0 record his first season as a basketball coach.[13] Moreover, McKale elevated the program to intercollegiate play.[13] While basketball was his least favorite of the many sports he coached while at UA, He chalked up three undefeated seasons and a career-winning average of .803, which has never been bested by a UA coach who has held the post for at least three years.[13] The McKale Memorial Center, the main arena for Arizona basketball, is named in his honor.[13]
