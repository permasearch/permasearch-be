Boer (/ˈboʊ.ər, bɔːr, bʊər/;[2] Afrikaans: [buːr]) is the Dutch and Afrikaans noun for "farmer", or, as a present tense verb, "to farm". In Afrikaans it still is the only unqualified, context-independent translation of "farmer".[3] In South African contexts, it also denotes the descendants of the then Dutch-speaking settlers of the eastern Cape frontier[4] in Southern Africa during the 18th and much of the 19th century. For a long time the Dutch East India Company controlled this area, but it was eventually taken over by the United Kingdom and incorporated into the British Empire.[5]
