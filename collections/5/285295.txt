President Roslin and Admiral Adama sit with Dr. Cottle and Gaeta discussing Baltar's situation. Cottle feels that Baltar's hunger strike and the sleep deprivation imposed upon him aren't helping his mental state. Roslin wants to get information out of Baltar by any means necessary and orders Cottle to force feed him. Gaeta believes that Baltar trusts him and might talk to him but Adama thanks Gaeta for his help and tells him to leave the interrogation to himself and the President.
