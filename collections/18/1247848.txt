Australia was settled by the British without a treaty or recognition of the indigenous population[14]. Subsequent Australian Government laws and policies denied the indigenous population citizenship, voting rights, and land rights, and instead sought to create a single, uniform white culture with the White Australia Policy and forcible removal of Aboriginal children from their families (See articles on the Stolen Generations and the Intervention). Like other international civil rights movements, the push for progress has involved protests (See Freedom Ride (Australia) and Aboriginal Tent Embassy) and seen riots in response to social injustice (See 2004 Redfern Riots and 2004 Palm Island death in custody. While there has been significant progress in redressing discriminatory laws[15], Indigenous Australians continue to be at a disadvantage compared to their non-indigenous counterparts, on key measures such as: life expectancy; infant mortality; health; and levels of education and employment.[16].
