In rural UK, Fontinalis antipyretica was traditionally used to extinguish fires as it could be found in substantial quantities in slow-moving rivers and the moss retained large volumes of water which helped extinguish the flames.  This historical use is reflected in its specific Latin/Greek name, the approximate meaning of which is "against fire".
