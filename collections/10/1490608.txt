During the 1960s, the Vale fans witnessed numerous good cup runs, though never reaching close to their 1954 semi-final appearance.[6] In 1967, Stanley Matthews took over (from Jackie Mudie who spent two years as manager), his reign ended in tears in 1968 as Vale were expelled from the Football League over seemingly 'illegal payments' made to players (this punishment was reduced on appeal to a re-election vote, which the club won).[8]
