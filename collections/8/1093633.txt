William Friese-Green created the first three-dimensional anaglyphic motion pictures in 1889, which had public exhibition in 1893. 3-D films enjoyed something of a boom in the 1920s. The term "3-D" was coined in the 1950s. As late as 1954 films such as The Creature from the Black Lagoon were very successful. Originally shot and exhibited using the Polaroid system, "The Creature from the Black Lagoon" was successfully reissued much later in an anaglyph format so it could be shown in cinemas without the need for special equipment. In 1953, the anaglyph had begun appearing in newspapers, magazines and comic books. The 3-D comic books were one of the most interesting applications of anaglyph to printing.
