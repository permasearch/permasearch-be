In 1796, Napoleon Bonaparte - still a general - occupied and ruled Lombardy for nearly two decades. The Palace was renamed the National Palace and became the seat of the main governing bodies of the new republic, namely the military command, first and then the Directory. When the Austro-Russians regained control of Milan in 1799, the French government hastily sold most of the furnishings of the building at auction as well as allowing the looting of other halls by the population.
