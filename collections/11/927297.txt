Nordic countries, such as Denmark and Sweden, also have low rates of teenage birth (both have 7 births per 1,000 women aged 15–19 in 2002[5]). However, Norway's birth rate is slightly higher (11 births per 1,000 women aged 15–19 in 2002[5]) and Iceland has a birth rate of 19 per 1,000 women aged 15–19 [5] (nearly the same as the UK). These countries have higher abortion rates than the Netherlands.
