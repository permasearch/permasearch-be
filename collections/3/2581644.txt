One possible cause for this inflation was the rating floor, which for a long time was at 2200, and if a player dropped below this they were stricken from the rating list. As a consequence, players at a skill level just below the floor would only be on the rating list if they were overrated, and this would cause them to feed points into the rating pool.[28] In July 2000 the average rating of the top 100 was 2644. By July 2012 it had increased to 2703.[29]
