Variety reviewed the film, stating that it "looks and feels like a rush job, but improves on its predecessor in nearly every way."[19] The A.V. Club gave the movie a rating of B-, as they felt that it "largely skews a bit underbaked to meet the promise of its own third act, and lacks the strength of Ellen Burstyn as its central figure, but thereâ€™s enough of the all-out V.C. Andrews flavor to make this installment worth a look for those who want to catch up with a family of soap people 30 years in the making."[20] Entertainment Weekly described the film as being "muted", similarly to the first one, and stated that the actors shouldn't have taken the material as seriously as they did. Despite this, they found the film to have numerous instances that either meet or exceed the book's "ludicrous level".[21]
