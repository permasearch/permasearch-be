The hostage-takers, declaring their solidarity with other "oppressed minorities" and "the special place of women in Islam", released one woman and two African Americans on November 19.[69] Before release, these hostages were required by their captors to hold a press conference in which Kathy Gross and William Quarles praised the revolution's aims,[70] but four further women and six African-Americans were released the following day.[69] The only African-American hostage not released that month was Charles A. Jones, Jr.[71] One more hostage, a white man named Richard Queen, was released in July 1980 after he became seriously ill with what was later diagnosed as multiple sclerosis. The remaining 52 hostages were held until January 1981, up to 444 days of captivity.
