Having quit Dunder Mifflin, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) settles for a job at Staples. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) relishes the thought of becoming Michael Scott's (Steve Carell) new Number Three and begins to pester Michael for attention. When Andy begins to irritate his co-workers, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), after getting no support from Karen Filippelli (Rashida Jones) or Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), recruits Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) to play a prank on Andy by hiding his cell phone (which plays Rockin' Robin, sung a cappella by Andy himself) in the ceiling and continually calling it.
