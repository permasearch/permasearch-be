The A.V. Club's A. A. Dowd gave the film an A−, calling it a "charitable and even poignantly hopeful take on the subject [of being in a relationship with an artist]" and said that "in the simple, refined timelessness of its technique, Phantom Thread is practically a love letter to classic aesthetic values—cinematic, sartorial, or otherwise".[16] Guardian writer Mark Kermode gave the film five stars, describing it as "a deftly spun yarn", and praised Daniel Day-Lewis' performance, describing his role as a "perfect fit [in a] beautifully realised tale of 50s haute couture".[30]
