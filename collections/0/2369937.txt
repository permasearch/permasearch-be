The episode received mixed reviews. The London Free Press listed it as one of the "best bets" to watch the evening it originally aired.[10] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said the small-town government setting and story lines of the show were working, but felt the writing for the Leslie character has been uneven and that individual situations involving her in "The Reporter" were not funny or effective.[11] Matt Fowler of IGN said the Leslie character was funny, particularly when she talks about her failure to remove graffiti penises from a city wall. ("To this day, I am haunted by those remaining penises.") But Fowler said the Scrabble subplot between Tom and Ron was "silly," and said the Ron character is too one-note and unfunny.[6]
