Fiyero is disillusioned about what transpired, but he is taken by Elphaba's passion. She begins to fall in love with him and they share a tender moment before he leaves to free the lion cub. Elphaba reminds herself that it's pointless to wish for something to happen between them ("I'm Not that Girl"). Madame Morrible comes and tells her that the Wizard has decided to meet her. Nessarose and Glinda come to see her off, and Fiyero meets her too. Glinda tries to win his respect by changing her name to "Glinda", in solidarity with Dr. Dillamond, who always mispronounced her name. But Fiyero isn't impressed, saying goodbye to Elphaba instead. Elphaba invites Glinda to the Emerald City with her ("One Short Day").
