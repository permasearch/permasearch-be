Transport in the North has been shaped by the Pennines, creating strong north-south axes along each coast and an east-west axis across the moorland passes of the southern Pennines.[302] Northern England is a centre of freight transport and handles around one third of all British cargo.[303] Both passenger and freight links between Northern cities remain poor, which is a major weakness of the Northern economy.[304]
