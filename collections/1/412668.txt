4K streaming requires a 4K-compatible device and display, both supporting HDCP 2.2. 4K streaming on personal computers requires hardware and software support of the Microsoft PlayReady 3.0 digital rights management solution, which requires a compatible CPU, graphics card, and software environment. Currently, this feature is limited to Intel Kaby Lake (seventh-generation Intel Core), Windows 10, Nvidia Geforce 10 series graphics cards, and running through Microsoft Edge web browser, or the UWP Netflix app.[211][212][213][214]
