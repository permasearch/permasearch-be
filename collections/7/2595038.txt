Leaving about forty men to garrison San Diego, Fremont continued on to the Pueblo de Los Angeles where on 13 August, with the United States Navy band playing and colors flying, the combined forces of Stockton and FrÃ©mont entered the town without a man killed or gun fired. United States Marine Major Archibald Gillespie, Fremont's second in command, was appointed military commander of Los Angeles, the largest settlement in Alta California with about 1,500 residents. Gillespie had an inadequate force of from thirty to fifty troops stationed there to keep order and garrison the city. The USS Congress is credited with capturing the Los Angeles harbor and port at San Pedro Bay on 6 August 1846. The Congress later helped capture Mazatlan, Mexico on 11 November 1847.[8]
