The prehistoric Beifudi site near Yixian in Hebei Province, China,  contains relics of a culture contemporaneous with the Cishan and Xinglongwa cultures of about 8000â€“7000 BCE, neolithic cultures east of the Taihang Mountains,  filling in an archaeological gap between the two Northern Chinese cultures. The total excavated area is more than 1,200 square meters and  the collection of neolithic findings at the site consists of two phases.[2]
