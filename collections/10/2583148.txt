On February 22, Benchmark U.S. crude rose 6.2 percent to $31.48 and Brent crude went up 5.1 percent to $34.69 after news that supplies were expected to grow more slowly.[240] By the end of the week, WTI was up 3 percent to $32.78, and Brent was up 7 percent to $35.12 after rising as high as $37, the most since January 5. Pipeline outages in Nigeria and Iraq, a lower number of active U.S. rigs, and lower gasoline inventories for the first time since November were reasons.[241] Gas was $1.73, down 10 cents from the previous month, but with the switch to summer blend in California, gas was $2.34 and on its way back up.[242]
