Still, in recent years a renewed interest in pre-Christian religion and culture has led to renewed interest in Walpurgis Night as well.[12] In 1999, suspicions were raised among local Reformed party members in Putten, Gelderland of a Walpurgis festival celebrated by Satanists. The party called for a ban. Whether such a festival even existed, however, and whether it was 'Satanic', was doubted by others.[13] It is known that Satanic sects celebrate Walpurgis Night, and so the local Church in Dokkum, Friesland organized a Service in 2003 to pray for the Holy Spirit to counter Satanic action.[14]
