Individual countries, regions, or major cities are served by particular churches known as dioceses in the Latin Church, or eparchies in the Eastern Catholic Churches, each overseen by a bishop. As of  2008[update], the Catholic Church has 2,795 dioceses.[66] The bishops in a particular country are members of a national or regional episcopal conference.[67]
