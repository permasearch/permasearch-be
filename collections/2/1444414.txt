In July 1992, the government announced a relaxation of the regulation for the lower two English leagues (known now as League One and League Two). The Football Spectators Act does not cover Scotland, but the Scottish Premier League chose to make all-seater stadiums a requirement of league membership.[90] In England and Wales all-seating is a requirement of the Premier League[91] and of the Football League for clubs who have been present in the Championship for more than three seasons.[92] Several campaigns have attempted to get the government to relax the regulation and allow standing areas to return to Premiership and Championship grounds.[93]
