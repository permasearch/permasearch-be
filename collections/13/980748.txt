The Army has had to make several adjustments to address demands on its personnel and equipment. The US Army has utilized its stop-loss policy and has required more of its combat personnel to serve more tours of duty than before, due to the need for experienced personnel. As opposed to Vietnam, there was no involuntary draft of enlisted males into the Army. Instead, the service employed its Total Force model and mobilized/recalled to active duty numerous Army National Guard and Army Reserve combat arms, combat support and combat service support units and personnel, often deploying many of them repeatedly to the Southwest Asia combat zone in a manner similar to their Regular Army counterparts.
