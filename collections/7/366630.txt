Grande re-released "One Last Time" as a charity single in June 2017, following the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing at her concert. This resulted in the song reaching a new peak of number 2 in the UK Singles Chart following the One Love Manchester concert, as well as reaching a new peak of number 15 in the Irish Singles Chart. Grande will donate all proceeds to the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund to aid the victims of the bombing and their families.[1]
