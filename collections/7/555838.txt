The 1930s represented an important time of transition for the NFL.  League membership was fluid prior to the mid-1930s.  1936 was the first year where there were no franchise moves,[157] prior to that year 51 teams had gone defunct.[143]  In 1941, the NFL named its first Commissioner, Elmer Layden. The new office replaced that of President. Layden held the job for five years, before being replaced by Pittsburgh Steelers co-owner Bert Bell in 1946.[158]
