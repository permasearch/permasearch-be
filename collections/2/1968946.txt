American modernist poet T S Eliot wrote that the great philosophers of India "make most of the great European philosophers look like schoolboys".[75][76] Arthur Schopenhauer, in the preface to his book The World As Will And Representation, writes that one who "has also received and assimilated the sacred primitive Indian wisdom, then he is the best of all prepared to hear what I have to say to him"[77] The 19th-century American philosophical movement Transcendentalism was also influenced by Indian thought.[78][79]
