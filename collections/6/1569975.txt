After suffering its first defeat to the West in the First Opium War in 1842, the Qing court struggled to contain foreign intrusions into China. Efforts to adjust and reform the traditional methods of governance were constrained by a deeply conservative court culture that did not want to give away too much authority to reform. Following defeat in the Second Opium War in 1860, the Qing tried to modernize by adopting certain Western technologies through the Self-Strengthening Movement from 1861.[3] In the wars against the Taiping (1851–64), Nian (1851–68), the Muslims of Yunnan (1856–68) and the Northwest (1862–77), the traditional imperial troops proved themselves incompetent and the court came to rely on local armies.[4] In 1895, China suffered another defeat during the First Sino-Japanese War.[5] This demonstrated that traditional Chinese feudal society also needed to be modernized if the technological and commercial advancements were to succeed.
