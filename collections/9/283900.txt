The iPhone 6S is nearly identical in design to the iPhone 6. In response to the "bendgate" design flaws of the previous model, changes were made to improve the durability of the chassis: the 6S was constructed from a stronger, 7000 series aluminum alloy,[29] "key points" in the rear casing were strengthened, and touchscreen Integrated circuits were re-located to the display assembly.[29] Alongside the existing gold, silver, and space gray options, a new rose gold color option was also introduced.[30]
