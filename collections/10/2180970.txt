Producers Lindelof and Cuse were worried about how the new characters would be received by fans, after the unhappy reaction to new characters Nikki (Kiele Sanchez) and Paulo (Rodrigo Santoro), introduced in season three.[25] However, following their introduction in "Confirmed Dead", the four characters were well received, with Paige Albiniak of the New York Post citing them as a reason behind the show's improved ratings.[26] IGN's Chris Carabott described Daniel, as well as the other new characters from the freighter, as "great" and "exciting".[27] James Poniewozik of Time liked the introduction of the new characters from the freighter because "Each got just one flashback and a little time on the island, and yet by the end of the episode, [he] felt [he] had a true handle on what they were like as individuals".[28] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV called it the "perfect introduction".[29] Michael Ausiello of TV Guide also liked their introduction, and praised the actors' performances.[30] Jeff Jensen from Entertainment Weekly liked that the "fascinating" new characters brought "mind-blowing new possibilities, and exciting new theory fodder".[31]
