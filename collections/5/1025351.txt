Squirmy is a light blue and dark blue striped worm who personifies a person from the country and is cousin to Slimey and Sloppy. She has only ever been introduced in the book The City Worm and the Country Worm by Linda Hayward, in which Slimey and Squirmy exchange visits, with Slimey going to the country and Squirmy going to the city, or more specifically Sesame Street. In the end both decide that their own environment is best for themselves.
