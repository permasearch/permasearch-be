Crookes tubes were unreliable and temperamental. Both the energy and the quantity of cathode rays produced depended on the pressure of residual gas in the tube.[10][11][12] Over time the gas was absorbed by the walls of the tube, reducing the pressure.[13][10][11][12] This reduced the amount of cathode rays produced and caused the voltage across the tube to increase, creating more energetic cathode rays.[12] In Crookes X-ray tubes this phenomenon was called "hardening" because the higher voltage produced "harder", more penetrating X-rays; a tube with a higher vacuum was called a "hard" tube, while one with lower vacuum was a "soft" tube. Eventually the pressure got so low the tube stopped working entirely.[12] To prevent this, in heavily used tubes such as X-ray tubes various "softener" devices were incorporated that released a small amount of gas, restoring the tube's function.[10][11][12]
