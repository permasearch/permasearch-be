It is said that the Dwarf population began to dwindle because most male Dwarves did not desire wives, or could not find one that they desired. It does not help that Dwarf women are less than a third of the population (and many of them choose not to marry, as well).[30] Yet much is still left a mystery in Dwarvish history; the Dwarves' true fate is left unknown.
