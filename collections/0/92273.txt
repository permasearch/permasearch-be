Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 premiered in Tokyo on April 10, 2017 and was released in the United States on May 5, in 3D and IMAX 3D. It grossed more than $863Â million worldwide, making it the seventh highest-grossing film of 2017, while also outgrossing its predecessor. The film received generally positive reviews, particularly for its visuals, soundtrack, and cast, though critics deemed it not as "fresh" as the original. It also received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 90th Academy Awards. A sequel, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, is being developed, with Gunn returning to write and direct. It is scheduled to be released in 2020.
