After a brief call-up in 2006, when he hit just .191 in 89 at-bats,[12] Pedroia became the regular second baseman for the Red Sox in 2007 replacing Mark Loretta. Pedroia suffered through an early-season hitting slump, but recovered, later putting up a 13-game hitting streak and a five-hit game against the Giants.[13] He notably made a diving stop to preserve fellow rookie Clay Buchholz's no-hitter on September 1.[14] Pedroia won the AL Rookie of the Year award and was selected to the 2007 Topps Major League Rookie All-Star Team.[15][16]
