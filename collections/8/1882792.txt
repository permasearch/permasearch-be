"Fleas" was written by Amanda Segel and directed by Rosemary Rodriguez. The subplot involving Twitter addressed the growing popularity and influence of the blogosphere, demonstrating how even unsubstantiated claims and gossip on social networking sites can trickle into the public consciousness and eventually the mainstream media.[1] The cutbacks and financial difficulties facing Stern, Lockhart & Gardner were also reflective of the global recession affecting much of the industrialized world at the time the episode first broadcast.[1] The episode derives its title from a line in which Harrison Rivers accuses Will of being complicit with the criminals he is defending, claiming, "You wake up with fleas, counselor."[2] "Fleas" marked the second in a string of guest appearances by Alan Cumming as Eli Gold, a political operative said to be based on White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel. Both are political operatives from Chicago noted for bullying tactics and their use of foul language.[2][3] "Fleas" also included an appearance by Ana Gasteyer, a comedian best known from her work on the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live. Gasteyer portrayed Judge Patrice Lessner, who presides over the Eric Dorfman case and displays animosity toward Will.[2]
