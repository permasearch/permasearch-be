King William (Dakin Matthews), widowed father of newborn Princess Odette, and Queen Uberta (Sandy Duncan), widowed mother of young Prince Derek, decide to betroth their children in the hopes of uniting their kingdoms. Unbeknownst to the royal duo, the evil sorcerer Rothbart (Jack Palance), concerned by Odette's birth, is planning to take William's kingdom for himself by mastering a type of dark magic known as The Forbidden Arts. But before he can make his move, he is attacked by William's men. Rather than sentencing him to death, however, King William spares Rothbart's life by banishing him from the kingdom. Before leaving, Rothbart swears to William that he will get his power back and steal everything that he had.
