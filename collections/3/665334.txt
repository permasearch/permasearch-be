Castle is an author of mystery fiction, with 26 bestsellers. His first novel, In a Hail of Bullets, accrued at least 21 rejections before being accepted by a publisher (he keeps the first rejection letter he received framed on his office wall as motivation)[17] and winning the Nom DePlume Society's Tom Straw Award for Mystery Literature.[18] The books have made Castle wealthy; he has a large multi-floor Manhattan apartment and, when Alexis is kidnapped, can pay a $3 million ransom.[19]
