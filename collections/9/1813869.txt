The sale of Kaká to Real Madrid in 2009 broke the eight-year-old world football transfer record held by Zinedine Zidane, costing the Spanish club €67 million[87] (about £56 million[88]). That record, however, lasted for less than a month, broken by Cristiano Ronaldo's £80 million transfer.[89] This record, however, is in terms of nominal British pound rates, not adjusted to inflation or the real value of the euro. Madrid bought Zidane for €77.5 million in 2001,[90][91] about £46 million at that time.
