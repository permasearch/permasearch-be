Economic historians vary in their calculations of the gross domestic product of the Roman economy during the Principate.[284] In the sample years of 14, 100, and 150 AD, estimates of per capita GDP range from 166 to 380 HS. The GDP per capita of Italy is estimated as 40[285] to 66%[286] higher than in the rest of the Empire, due to tax transfers from the provinces and the concentration of elite income in the heartland.
