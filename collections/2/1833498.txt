Due to Newfoundland's high debt load, arising from World War I and construction of the Newfoundland Railway, and decreasing revenue, due to the collapse of fish prices, the Newfoundland legislature voted itself out of existence in 1933,[67] in exchange for loan guarantees by the Crown and a promise it would be re-established.[68]:8â€“10[69] On February 16, 1934, the Commission of Government was sworn in, ending 79 years of responsible government.[67] The Commission consisted of seven persons appointed by the British government. For 15 years no elections took place, and no legislature was convened.[70]
