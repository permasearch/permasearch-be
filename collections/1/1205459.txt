Eritrea claimed that 19,000 Eritrean soldiers were killed during the conflict;[69] most reports put the total war casualties from both sides as being around 70,000.[13][70][71][72][73][74] All these figures have been contested and other news reports simply state that "tens of thousands" or "as many as 100,000" were killed in the war.[14][18] Eritrea accused Ethiopia of using "human waves" to defeat Eritrean trenches. But according to a report by The Independent, there were no "human waves" because Ethiopia instead outmaneuvered and overpowered the Eritrean trenches.[75]
