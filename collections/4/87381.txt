In the West, the law of celibacy became mandatory by Pope Gregory VII at the Roman Synod of 1074.[29][30] This law mandated that, in order to become a candidate for ordination, a man could not be married. The law remains in effect in the Latin Church, although not for those who are priests of the Eastern Catholic Churches, who remain under their own discipline. The issue of mandatory celibacy in the Latin Church continues to be debated.[citation needed]
