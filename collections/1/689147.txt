The character's profile on official ABC website describes Jackson as "hardworking, driven, observant" and "eager." However, at times, Jackson can be too confident and "overly competitive," and very "stubborn." He has a habit of teasing his coworkers.[1] Williams revealed to Essence.com that his character is very "ambitious. He doesn't takes sides or deal with any drama. He's there to work and not really get involved in the pettiness." When compared to himself, Williams Jackson is way more "cavalier," and bold.[6] Matt Webb Mitovitch described Jackson as having a "sense of entitlement," while Williams described Jackson's demeanor as "swagger." Because his work environment is extremely competitive, Jackson acts as if he belongs and refuses to second guess himself.[5] Upon arrival at Seattle Grace, he is "kind of a wise ass surgeon." He feels he is an "invader" in the new team and "he decides to deal with it kind of aggressively and not shy away from it and show his personality. He is very confident and likes to say what is on his mind."[9] Williams also said: "Jackson is more of a lone wolf. He's not really built to go seek support and a shoulder to cry on."[10] "He's always been trying to make it on his own. Jackson doesn't want to live off his legacy and his name, which also conflicts with him wanting to be close to his mother."[11]
