In 1973, she hired 27-year-old Juan Hamilton, a potter, as a live-in assistant and then a caretaker. Hamilton taught O'Keeffe to work with clay and helped her write her autobiography. He worked for her for 13 years.[21] O'Keeffe became increasingly frail in her late 90s. She moved to Santa Fe in 1984, where she died on March 6, 1986 at the age of 98.[73] Her body was cremated and her ashes were scattered, as she wished, on the land around Ghost Ranch.[74]
