Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja 5, known in Japan as, Naruto Shippuden: Narutimate Accel 2 (ＮＡＲＵＴＯ－ナルト－ 疾風伝 ナルティメットアクセル２, Naruto Shippuden: Narutimetto Akuseru 2), is the fifth installment in the Ultimate Ninja series, and was released in Japan on December 20, 2007. It was released in Europe on November 27, 2009 and Australia on December 3, 2009.[3] The game features 62 characters and continues the Naruto Shippuden storyline, going up to the end of Sasuke and Sai arc, following the manga (the anime have not done on the arc by then). One of the new gameplay additions is the introduction of assist characters. Assist characters are chosen during character selection, and can be called in during a match to deal extra damage. Certain combinations of characters create unique jutsus in a match; these combinations reflect the associations of those characters in the anime and manga. Many of the character's jutsus from the previous game were updated. There are many updated ultimate jutsus, including the aforementioned assist-specific ones. Summons have been removed from the game. The assist characters cannot be turned off. The game retains the RPG mode from previous game, now allowing the player to control characters other than Naruto (such as Sakura Haruno and Kakashi). However, the Hero's History mode that retells the events of the original series have been discarded, though the characters itself remain in the game. It was also the last of the Ultimate Ninja Series for the PlayStation 2. The game was not released in North America.
