A state trumpeter of either of the two Household Cavalry regiments plays "The Trot" to signal the beginning of the sitting trot-past.  "The Keel Row" is traditionally played, and much dust is raised by the horses. Both the King's Troop's lead gun and the Queen's Cavalry Standard are trotted in the presence of the Queen and the Royal Colonels as they salute them.
