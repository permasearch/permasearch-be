Several changes were made in adapting the film from the book. Many unused characters were eliminated or combined into composite ones. John Kelso was based upon Berendt. The multiple trials were combined into one on-screen trial. Williams' real life attorney, Sonny Seiler, played Judge White, the presiding judge of the trial. Advertising for the film became a source of controversy when Warner Bros. used elements of Jack Leigh's famous photograph in the posters without permission.
