Blood serum paraprotein levels of more than 30 g/L is diagnostic of multiple myeloma, according to the diagnostic criteria of the International Myeloma Working Group,[6] which were updated in 2009.[7] Detection of paraprotein in serum of less than 30 g/L is classified as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance in cases where clonal plasma cells constitute less than 10% on bone marrow biopsy and there is no myeloma-related organ or tissue impairment.[6][7]
