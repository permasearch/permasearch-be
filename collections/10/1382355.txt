Resection is an option in cholangiocarcinoma, but fewer than 30% of cases of cholangiocarcinoma are resectable at diagnosis. After surgery, recurrence rates are up to 60%.[40][41] Liver transplant may be used where partial resection is not an option, and adjuvant chemoradiation may benefit some cases.[26]
