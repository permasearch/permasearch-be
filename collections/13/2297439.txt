In AD 711, Muhammad bin Qasim conquered the Sindh and Indus Valley, bringing South Asian societies into contact with Islam, succeeding partly because Raja Dahir was a Hindu king that ruled over a Buddhist majority and that Chach of Alor and his kin were regarded as usurpers of the earlier Buddhist Rai dynasty[6][7] this view is questioned by those who note the diffuse and blurred nature of Hindu and Buddhist practices in the region,[8] especially that of a royalty to be patrons of both and those who believe that Chach himself may have been a Buddhist.[9][10] The forces of Muhammad bin Qasim defeated Raja Dahir in alliance with the Jats and other regional governors.
