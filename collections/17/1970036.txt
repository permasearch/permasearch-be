The most common type of sold-separate clamp has a single horizontal bolt-with-nut which goes behind the top of the seat post. Tightening this bolt brings together four pieces of metal (two on each side) which have round slots to grab and hold standard-size rails. The inner rail grabbing pieces have interlocking grooves on the other side that interface into disc shapes on the outer sides of the central post-grabbing piece. Continued tightening of the bolt causes the central piece to close very slightly around the top of the post. To adjust the saddle's position for comfort, loosening the bolt allows the rails to slide forward and backward and to tilt up and down around the axis of the bolt.[9]
