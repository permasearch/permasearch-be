BI Publisher supports the generation of XML data from SQL queries, web services, XML files and XML HTTP servers,  LDAP queries, MDX queries (starting 10.1.3.4.1), Oracle ADF view objects (11g) and Microsoft EXCEL files (11g). While previous version allowed the simple addition through a UI, linking of queries required the creation of an XML configuration file. In 11g the data model can be created using a web based visual data model builder.
