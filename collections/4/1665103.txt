The first, in D major, known as the Ghost, is one of his best known works in the genre (rivaled only by the Archduke Trio).  The D major trio features themes found in the second movement of Beethoven's Symphony No. 2.  The All-Music Guide states that "because of its strangely scored and undeniably eerie-sounding slow movement,  it was dubbed the 'Ghost' Trio. The name has stuck with the work ever since. The ghostly music may have had its roots in sketches for a Macbeth opera that Beethoven was contemplating at the time."[1] According to Lewis Lockwood, Beethoven's pupil Carl Czerny wrote in 1842 that the slow movement reminded him (Czerny) of the ghost scene at the opening of Shakespeare's Hamlet, and this was the origin of the nickname.[2] James Keller also attributes the nickname to Czerny, adding, "You may discard as erroneous the oft-encountered claim that this movement of the Ghost Trio is a reworking of music Beethoven originally sketched as the Witches Chorus for his Macbeth.[3]
