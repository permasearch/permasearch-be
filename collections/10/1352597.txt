Treatment for a rotator cuff tear can include rest, ice, physical therapy, and/or surgery.[9] A published review of 14 trials involving 829 patients found that there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate whether surgery is any better than non-surgical options.[10] A review of manual therapy and exercise treatments found inconclusive evidence as to whether these treatments were any better than placebo, however "High quality evidence from one trial suggested that manual therapy and exercise improved function only slightly more than placebo at 22 weeks, was little or no different to placebo in terms of other patient-important outcomes (e.g. overall pain), and was associated with relatively more frequent but mild adverse events."[11]
