However, in 2016 and 2017, the Street Festival's organizers were forced to move their event to a distant location in Washington, D.C.[162][163] The Festival's relocation became necessary after the Trump Organization negotiated a deal with the Government of the District of Columbia that requires a 20 feet (6Â m)-wide lane on Pennsylvania Avenue to remain open to the Trump International Hotel's customers and valet parking service except during major events such as presidential inaugural parades, thus leaving insufficient space on the Avenue for the festival's activities and for those of other events formerly held near the building.[162]
