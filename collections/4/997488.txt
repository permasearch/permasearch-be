In Guernsey, legislation refers to the Crown in right of the Bailiwick,[31] and the Law Officers of the Crown of Guernsey submitted that "[t]he Crown in this context ordinarily means the Crown in right of the rÃ©publique of the Bailiwick of Guernsey"[32] and that this comprises "the collective governmental and civic institutions, established by and under the authority of the Monarch, for the governance of these Islands, including the States of Guernsey and legislatures in the other Islands, the Royal Court and other courts, the Lieutenant Governor, Parish authorities, and the Crown acting in and through the Privy Council".[33] This constitutional concept is also worded as the Crown in right of the Bailiwick of Guernsey.[34]
