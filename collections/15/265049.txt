In the United Kingdom, Home and Away was first broadcast on ITV from 11 February 1989 until 8 June 2000.[57][58] Home and Away was shown twice a day on ITV, with a lunchtime showing and a tea time repeat; many regions aired it at around 5:10 pm, while others at 6:00 pm or even 6:30 pm.[59][60] The show attracted up to eight million viewers, making it one of ITV's top 30 rated programmes.[60][61] It also helped boost audiences for ITV's regional and early evening news bulletins.[61] During the show's last year on ITV, Home and Away attracted an average audience of 4.4 million for its early-evening repeats.[58] In February 2000, it was announced that Home and Away would be moving to rival Channel 5 after they bought the rights to the show in a £40m auction deal.[60][61] ITV reportedly offered twice the amount by Channel 5, but the Seven Network in Australia were swayed by Channel 5's commitment to the long-term future of the show in a deal of more than five years.[60][61] After its run on ITV ended, Home and Away went off air for 12 months as ITV had an exclusivity clause that prevented any other broadcaster from airing the show for a year.[60][61] After a delay in screening, Home and Away made its debut on Channel 5 on 16 July 2001.[62] Channel 5 currently airs Home and Away at 1:15 pm each week day, with a repeat at 6:00 pm.[63] UK viewers are able to catch up with episodes on 5* and online via Demand 5.[63] From July 2018, Home and Away is available for catch up on Paramount Network, a channel operated by Channel 5.
