For general negative resistance circuits with reactance, the stability must be determined by standard tests like the Nyquist stability criterion.[100] Alternatively, in high frequency circuit design, the values of      Z  L   ( j Ï‰ )   {\displaystyle Z_{L}(j\omega )}   for which the circuit is stable are determined by a graphical technique using "stability circles" on a Smith chart.[17]
