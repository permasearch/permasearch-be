For a time, the Jungle Planet Transformers were leaderless leaving their world torn by violence and poverty. Many were taken under the tutelage under Zen-master Backstop in the way of non-violence and self-defense. Eventually, Scourge, a student of Backstop, grew impatient with his people's suffering, and forced a rebellion against those taking advantage of the chaos, strong-arming his way into leadership position in a series of battles to determine who would be strong enough to become leader. Corrupted by his new-found power and position, Scourge forced a "peace through tyranny" campaign, bringing his people the peace and prosperity he promised them, but only through a dictatorship ruled by the credo of 'might makes right'. However, Scourge couldn't totally rid himself of his old master's teachings, and he enforced a strict series of laws regulating disputes being settled only through formal duels of strength, with sabotage and especially unjustified death of a defeated foe as the planet's highest offense.
