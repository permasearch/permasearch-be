It is a hardy breed, and can be stubborn, leading to issues with training. A Westie may need to have its training refreshed on occasion during its lifetime. Having a typical terrier prey drive, it tends to be highly interested in toys, especially chasing balls. It does retain the instincts of an earth-dog, including inquisitive and investigative traits,[7] as well as natural instincts to both bark and dig holes.[6] It is ranked 47th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs.[8]
