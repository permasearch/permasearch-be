Capturing wives and exogamy was a tradition among early tribes and continued up to the modern era, although on some occasions in Bohemia and the Ukraine men did not chose the spouse but women.[158]For fornication the sentence among Pagan Slavs was described as capital punishment by travelers, Ibn-Fadlan: “Men and women go to the river and bathe together naked … but they do not fornicate and if anyone would be guilty of it, no matter who is he and she … he and she would be pinked by pole-axe … then they hang out each part both of them on a tree”, Gardizi: “If someone makes fornication, he or she would be killed, without accepting any apologies”[159]
