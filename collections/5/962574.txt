Taft made it a priority to restructure the State Department, noting, "it is organized on the basis of the needs of the government in 1800 instead of 1900."[72] The Department was for the first time organized into geographical divisions, including desks for the Far East, Latin America and Western Europe.[73] The department's first in-service training program was established, and appointees spent a month in Washington before going to their posts.[74] Taft and Secretary of State Knox had a strong relationship, and the president listened to his counsel on matters foreign and domestic. According to Coletta, however, Knox was not a good diplomat, and had poor relations with the Senate, press, and many foreign leaders, especially those from Latin America.[75]
