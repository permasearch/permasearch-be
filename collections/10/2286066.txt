The February fires commenced on a day when several localities across the state, including Melbourne, recorded their highest temperatures since records began in 1859.[12] On 6 February 2009—the day before the fires started—the Premier of Victoria John Brumby issued a warning about the extreme weather conditions expected on 7 February: "It's just as bad a day as you can imagine and on top of that the state is just tinder-dry. People need to exercise real common sense tomorrow".[13] The Premier went on to state that it was expected to be the "worst day [of fires conditions] in the history of the state".[13]
