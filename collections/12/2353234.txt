Production of the original 221 lasted from 1932 through to 1936. These engines can be identified by having the water pumps located at the front of the heads.  A similar 221 flathead was used in Fords for 1937 and 1938 but the block was revised to have the water pumps mounted on the block. The new design also relocated the water outlet from the front of the heads to the top center of the heads. These, designated V8-78, were offered with standard 6.2:1 compression aluminum or 7.5:1 compression iron cylinder heads, rated at 85 hp (63 kW) and 144 lb⋅ft (195 N⋅m) (aluminum) or 94 hp (70 kW) (iron).[14] The 1932 through 1938 motors used twenty one studs to hold down each head and are known as "21 stud" motors. This motor continued to be made into the 1950s in Europe.
