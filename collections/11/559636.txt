Phelps was chosen to be the American flag bearer at the opening ceremony, which was the first Olympic opening ceremony that he would attend.[211][212] Phelps was also voted by the U.S. Olympic swim team as one of six team captains for the US delegation to the Olympics.[213] He displayed a relaxed sociable demeanor in the athletes' village and in press conferences; this pleasant behavior was in stark contrast to his isolation in previous Olympics.[203] He was accompanied by fiancÃ©e Nicole Johnson and son Boomer.[214]
