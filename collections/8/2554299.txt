If a widowed peeress's son predeceases her, her daughter-in-law does not use the title of Dowager, but is styled, e.g. "The Most Hon. Mary, Marchioness of London", until her mother-in-law dies, at which point she may use the title of "Dowager Marchioness". In more recent times, some widows choose to be styled with their Christian names, instead of as Dowager,  e.g. "Olave, Lady Baden-Powell" ("The Lady Olave Baden-Powell" would incorrectly imply she was the daughter of a duke, marquess or earl).
