They are generally inshore feeders.[70] The use of data loggers has provided information of the diving behaviour of little penguins. 50% of their dives go no deeper than 2 m and the mean diving time is 21 seconds.[71] Yet, they are able to dive as deep as 20 m and remained submerged as long as 60 seconds.[72] Little penguins play an important role in the ecosystem as not only a predator to parasites but also a host. Recent studies have shown a new species of feather mite that feeds on the preening oil on the feathers of the penguin.[73]
