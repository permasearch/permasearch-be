Esteban Ramírez (played by Adrian R'Mante) – Esteban is the head bellman at the Tipton. His signature quotes are "This is a disaster!" and "Oh Mr. Moseby!" He is very close to his heritage, which in "I Want My Mummy" is revealed to be Peruvian. It is revealed during the series that his full name is "Esteban Julio Ricardo Montoya de la Rosa Ramírez". He owns a domestic chicken with blue feet named Dudley, to whom he seems to be quite attached. Esteban wants to manage the Tipton and he is a gifted dancer. He addresses the twins as "little blond peoples", even when he is only talking to one of them, in which case he often has to correct himself. Though he frequently does stupid, naïve, or clumsy things, he is smarter than he has given credit for and has a huge heart, displayed many times throughout the series. In the dancing episode, after he and the nurse, Shannon Quine, dance, they are briefly shown kissing. It is also stated he is descended from royalty in several episodes and in one becomes temporarily rich because of his royal family. However, his royal family is deposed. In "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad Hotel" it is revealed that Esteban has a crush on Carey. He guest-stars on The Suite Life on Deck in which he has his wedding on the SS Tipton with Francesca (Marisa Ramirez). It is also revealed in that episode that he has been promoted from bellhop to assistant night manager of the hotel. Despite being a recurring character, Esteban has appeared very often throughout the show, only being absent in a handful of episodes.
