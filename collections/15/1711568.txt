Riluzole has been found to modestly prolong survival by approximately two to three months.[70][7] It may have a greater survival benefit for those with a bulbar onset.[7] It is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) (England and Wales). Riluzole does not reverse damage already done to motor neurons[71] but affects neurons by reducing their activity through blocking Na+ entrance into the neurons and thus blocking the release of the chemicals that causes the activity of the motor neurons.[72] The reduction in activity prevents the ruining of the neuronal muscle and so the drug can act as a protective chemical.[72] Studies have shown that the function of this drug is dependent on the amount taken at a given time. The higher the concentration, the better the drug will protect the neurons from ruin.[72] The recommended dosage of Riluzole is 50Â mg, twice a day for people with known ALS for more than 5 years.[3]
