Klaus shows Stefan that his blood (hybrid blood) is the cure to the werewolf bite but he wants to make a deal with Stefan first before give it to him; if Stefan wants to save his brother he has to do whatever Klaus tells him for ten years. Stefan agrees to the deal even if he does not want to. After the agreement, Klaus starts feeding him human blood to make him a ripper again and when he is sure that Stefan will follow him, he gives Katherine the cure and compels her to take it to Damon letting her go.
