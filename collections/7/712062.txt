Within a week of unveiling the Model 3 in 2016, Tesla revealed they had taken 325,000 reservations for the car, more than triple the number of Model S sedans sold by the end of 2015. These reservations represent potential sales of over US$14 billion.[11][12] By August 2017, there were 455,000 net reservations, and an average of 1,800 reservations were being added per day.[13][14]
