Beatles writer Bill Harry credits Lennon as the main composer,[6] although McCartney claims it was a 50 / 50 collaboration.[2] McCartney recalls using Lennon's Menlove Avenue home as the writing base for the song; this was rare as Lennon's Aunt Mimi, whom he still lived with at the time, was disapproving of the Beatles.[6]
