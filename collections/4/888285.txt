Chronic hepatitis C is a major cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.[114] It is a common medical reason for liver transplantation due to its severe complications.[114] It is estimated that 130–180 million people in the world are affected by this disease representing a little more than 3% of the world population.[80][90][114] In the developing regions of Africa, Asia and South America, prevalence can be as high as 10% of the population.[90] In Egypt, rates of hepatitis C infection as high as 20% have been documented and are associated with iatrogenic contamination related to schistosomiasis treatment in the 1950s–1980s.[14][90] Currently in the United States, approximately 3.5 million adults are estimated to be infected.[115] Hepatitis C is particularly prevalent among people born between 1945–1965, a group of about 800,000 people, with prevalence as high as 3.2% versus 1.6% in the general U.S. population.[14] Most chronic carriers of hepatitis C are unaware of their infection status.[14] The most common mode of transmission of hepatitis C virus is exposure to blood products via blood transfusions (prior to 1992) and intravenous drug injection.[14][90] A history of intravenous drug injection is the most important risk factor for chronic hepatitis C.[114] Other susceptible populations include individuals with high-risk sexual behavior, infants of infected mothers, and healthcare workers.[90]
