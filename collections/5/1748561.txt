Lopez first previewed the song during her set at Calibash in January 2018, which took place at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. She included it as part of a dance medley with "Bitch Better Have My Money" by Rihanna and "Bodak Yellow" by Cardi B.[24][25] Lopez officially performed "Dinero" for the first time at the 2018 Billboard Music Awards which took place at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on May 20. She wore a "bedazzled" bustier and white pants, later sporting a white blazer and fedora to complete the look. She was surrounded by a group of "'40s era gangster-styled dancers".[26] Khaled, surrounded by piles of money, appeared on a separate stage to introduce Lopez; Cardi B was not present due to her pregnancy, but appeared via a black-and-white video.[27] Leila Cobo of Billboard said the performance was "ridiculously fun to watch", calling it "A lot of bling, a lot of style, some kick-ass dancing (JLo does not disappoint) and a whole lotta cash flying around".[27] Refinery29 writer Kathryn Lindsay stated that "the multi-hyphenate proved she's going back to her roots with a passionate and colorful performance", but noted: "The one thing people didn't like about the performance? DJ Khaled. The artist was there, seemingly, to throw around money and yell some of his signature phrases during the song, but fans just wanted more J.Lo."[28]
