Prior to the airing of the first episode the lap-board had been pre-populated with ten lap-times by a selection of cars. The laps themselves were not shown, only their lap-times. The first car to be shown, with an on-screen lap-time, was a 2016 BMW M2 with a time of 1:26.2 set by Skinner. The Eboladrome is also used for general filming and testing by the presenters, meaning that other vehicles – such as a Ferrari 488 used in episode one – may appear on the track, but do not set a lap-time set by the racing driver.
