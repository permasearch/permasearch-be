Omani society is largely tribal[81][114][115] and encompasses three major identities:[81] that of the tribe, the Ibadi faith, and maritime trade.[81] The first two identities are closely tied to tradition and are especially prevalent in the interior of the country, owing to lengthy periods of isolation.[81] The third identity pertains mostly to Muscat and the coastal areas of Oman, and is reflected by business, trade,[81] and the diverse origins of many Omanis, who trace their roots to Baloch, Al-Lawatia, Persia, and historical Omani Zanzibar.[116] Consequently, the third identity is generally seen to be more open and tolerant towards others,[81] and is often in tension with the more traditional and insular identities of the interior.[81]
