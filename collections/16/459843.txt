On February 27, Frank Buckles died of natural causes.[32] His death generated an outpouring of emotion, including an effort to have him lie in state in the United States Capitol rotunda.[33] On March 8, Rep. Poe introduced new legislation, the Frank Buckles World War I Memorial Act (H.R. 938). Like Cleaver's bill from the previous Congress, it established both a memorial and a centennial commission. Poe's bill differed from past efforts, however, in that it designated both the Liberty Memorial and the District of Columbia War Memorial as the National World War I Memorial.[25][d] This represented an agreement by the Missouri delegation (which now included Senator Roy Blunt, as Kit Bond had retired), Thune, and Poe.[23] As with his 2009 bill, Poe's new effort authorized the World War I Memorial Foundation to raise funds, design the memorial, and oversee its erection.[23][34] Poe's bill was referred to both the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the House Committee on Natural Resources. On January 24, 2012, the Natural Resources Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Federal Lands held hearings on the bill.
