On 26 August 1835, Governor Bourke issued a Proclamation which formally declared that agreements such as Batman's Treaty were "void and of no effect as against the rights of the Crown" and declared any person on "vacant land of the Crown" without authorization from the Crown to be trespassing.[2] The proclamation was approved by the Colonial Office on 10 October 1835. The official objection to the treaty was that Batman had attempted to negotiate directly with the Aboriginal people, whom the British did not recognise as having any claim to any lands in Australia.[15] Also, Batman had purchased the lands for the Association, and not for the Crown.[citation needed]
