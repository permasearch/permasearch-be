The period 1930â€“1935 was characterised by grave illness.[5] Sister Alphonsa took her permanent vows on 12 August 1936.[1] Two days later she returned to Bharananganam from Changanacherry. She then taught high school at St. Alphonsa Girl's High School, but was often sick and unable to teach.[3] For most of her years as a Clarist Sister she endured serious illness.
