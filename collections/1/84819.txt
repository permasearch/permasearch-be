The Catholic Church teaches that the Lord's name is holy and should be introduced into one's speech only to bless, praise or glorify that name.[37] The name should be used respectfully, with an awareness of the presence of God.[38] It must not be abused by careless speech, false oaths, or words of hatred, reproach or defiance toward God, or used in magic.[39] Since Jesus Christ is believed to be the Messiah, and "the image of the invisible God,"[40] this commandment is applied to the name of Jesus Christ as well.
