Oundle was where Dickinson became attracted to hard rock, after hearing Deep Purple's "Child in Time" being played in another student's room.[12] As a result, the first album he ever bought was Deep Purple's In Rock, which created his interest in rock music.[13] After In Rock, he went on to buy Black Sabbath's debut, Jethro Tull's Aqualung and Tarkus by Emerson, Lake & Palmer.[13] Every term, a band would play at the school, the first of these which Dickinson saw was called Wild Turkey, featuring former Jethro Tull bassist Glenn Cornick.[13] After that, he saw Van der Graaf Generator and Arthur Brown.[13]
