The novel begins with a frame tale in which the unnamed narrator describes the narrative that follows as "the great secret of my life."[6]  The narrator notes that he is taking a substantial risk by composing the narrative, but that it is one he feels compelled to record, regardless.  The narrator also chooses to withhold the name of the small Georgia town where his narrative begins, as there are still living residents of the town who might be able to connect him to the narrative.
