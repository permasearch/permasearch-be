According to tradition, the Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca around the year 570.[24] His family belonged to the Quraysh. When he was about forty years old, he began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations delivered through the angel Gabriel, which would later form the Quran, enjoining him to proclaim a strict monotheistic faith, warn his compatriots of the impending Judgement Day, and castigate social injustices of his city.[5] Muhammad's message won over a handful of followers and was met with increasing opposition from notables of Mecca.[6] In 618, after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle Abu Talib, Muhammad took flight to the city of Yathrib (subsequently called Medina) where he was joined by his followers.[25] Later generations would count this event, known as the hijra, as the start of the Islamic era.[26]
