The film posters showed that the film would utilise performance capturing technology, which was used in films such as Avatar and The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn. During production, Kochadaiiyaan was the first Indian film to utilise the technology. However, Maattraan, another Tamil feature, which also made use of the technology, was released before Kochadaiiyaan, making it the second Indian film to utilise the technology.[76][77][78] K. S. Ravikumar, story writer of the film, announced that the filming would commence from 15 January 2012.[79] The first schedule of indoor shooting started with Rajinikanth's base actions being filmed as per the motion capturing norms.[40]
