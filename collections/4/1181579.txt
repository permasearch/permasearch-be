Burke portrays Delta Bishop, a young woman with dreams of writing and singing country music. She became a hairstylist at Mona's House of Hair, married Charlie Bishop and thought she had found happiness. After eight years of marriage, Delta became restless: she was eager to follow in the footsteps of her childhood idol, Patsy Cline, and become a country music star. She quits her job, leaves her husband and friends behind and travels to Nashville, Tennessee. In Nashville, Delta finds an apartment over the garage of a home owned by her cousin, Lavonne Overton (Gigi Rice) and her husband, Buck (Bill Engvall). She also finds a job waiting tables at The Green Lantern, a local bar that hosts an amateur night which Delta believes that if she could sing her songs there, it could jumpstart her career.
