Environmental stewardship is a key role the Port of San Diego plays. The Port engages in public education for both adults and school children regarding pollution prevention. The Port protects San Diego bay through stormwater management and endangered species management. In addition, the bay is protected and improved through removal of hazardous waste and contaminated sediments.
