Onam is the official state festival of Kerala with public holidays that start four days from Uthradom (Onam eve).[12]. Major festivities take places across 30 venues in Thiruvananthapuram[13], capital of Kerala. It is also celebrated by Malayali diaspora around the world.[9] Though a Hindu festival, non-Hindu communities of Kerala participate in Onam celebrations considering it as a cultural festival.[9][14][12] However, some non-Hindus in Kerala denounce its celebration as a cultural event because they consider it as a religious festival.[15][16]
