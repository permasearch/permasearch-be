On May 19, 1961, after only five weeks of play, the St. Louis Cardinals abandoned their plans to place their Triple-A International League affiliate in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and moved the team, nicknamed the Marlins, to Charleston to finish out the season. This club – Charleston's second Triple-A franchise – stayed only those few months and relocated to Atlanta, for the 1962 season to become the Atlanta Crackers.
