Max Thunderman (portrayed by Jack Griffo) is also one of the main characters. He is the antagonist-turned-anti-hero, being the twin brother Phoebe and older brother to Billy, Nora, and Chloe. Despite being raised within a family of superheroes, Max originally aspired to become supervillain for the first three seasons. In the Season 3 finale, he finally had a change of heart and made a life-changing decision to abandon the dark side and become a fighter for justice, using his powers and high-tech gadgets for the greater good. The fourth and final season focuses on Max readjusting to his new daily life as a superhero instead of an evil-doer, as he tackles challenges working with Phoebe in Z-Force training, which jeopardizes his friendship with Dr. Colosso. His basement bedroom serves as his secret lair, filled with high-tech gadgets and posters of The Villain League (especially Dark Mayhem). As of the fourth and final season, his lair now has posters of the Z-Force, and other superhero posters. His lair is accessible through a slide leading to his bed underneath a tea table next to the couch in the living room and it is also where he keeps his best friend and mentor, Dr. Colosso, a supervillain Thunder Man turned into a rabbit. Max has the same superpowers as Phoebe: telekinesis, ice breath, and heat breath. , and like his twin sister, he is 14 at the beginning of the series.[1]
