The causes of the Great Vowel Shift have been a source of intense scholarly debate and as yet there is no firm consensus. The greatest changes occurred during the 15th and 16th centuries. Some scholars[who?] have argued that the rapid migration of peoples from northern England to the southeast following the Black Death caused a mixing of accents that forced a change in the standard London vernacular. Others argue that the influx of French loanwords was a major factor in the shift.[5] Yet others assert that because of the increasing prestige of French pronunciations among the middle classes (perhaps related to the English aristocracy's switching from French to English around this time), a process of hypercorrection may have started a shift that unintentionally resulted in vowel pronunciations that were less like French instead of more.[6] An opposing theory states that the wars with France and general anti-French sentiments caused hypercorrection in order to deliberately make English sound less like French.[7]
