Selection sort is not difficult to analyze compared to other sorting algorithms since none of the loops depend on the data in the array. Selecting the minimum requires scanning     n   {\displaystyle n}   elements (taking     n − 1   {\displaystyle n-1}   comparisons) and then swapping it into the first position. Finding the next lowest element requires scanning the remaining     n − 1   {\displaystyle n-1}   elements and so on. Therefore, the total number of comparisons is
