On September 7, 2013, it was announced that Oculus director Mike Flanagan was set to direct a horror film called Somnia he co-wrote with Jeff Howard for Intrepid Pictures, and that the producers would be Trevor Macy and William D. Johnson, with Demarest Films' Sam Englebardt co-producing and co-financing the film with MICA Entertainment headed by Dale Armin Johnson.[3] Focus Features International initially handled international sales of the film.[3] On November 7, 2013, it was announced that Sierra/Affinity would now handle all international rights which were previously held by FFI.[4] On April 4, 2014, Relativity Media acquired the US distribution rights to the film.[5] In March 2015, the title was changed to ''Before I Wake", apparently over Flanagan's objections.[6]
