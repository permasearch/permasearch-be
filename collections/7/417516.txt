Bahrain and mainland Qatar had been seized by the Portuguese in 1521.[32][67] After the Portuguese claimed control, they constructed a series of fortresses along the Arabian Coast.[67] However, there have been no significant Portuguese ruins found in Qatar.[21] The Portuguese focused on creating a commercial empire in Eastern Arabia, and exported gold, silver, silks, cloves, amber, horses and pearls.[68] The population of Al-Hasa submitted voluntarily to the rule of the Ottomans in 1550, preferring them to the Portuguese.[69]
