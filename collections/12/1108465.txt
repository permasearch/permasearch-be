In the early 1970s, Britain and Iceland almost got into a shooting war over fishing rights after Iceland unilaterally implemented the 200-mile (370Â km) fishing limit; there were numerous confrontations between vessels, some armed and others with armed escort ships. These events were called the "cod wars". Cod prices went from the low $2 range to mid-$3, which sent the low-priced fish restaurants into a tailspin, and all the companies retrenched.
