Under CPR ownership, the resort operated with numerous guests during the 20th century.  As the majority of guests arrived at St. Andrews by passenger train, CPR built a large transfer station at the junction between the St. Andrews line and the Saint John-Montreal main line in McAdam.  This station also included a large 30-room hotel on its second floor, largely built to service the patrons of the St. Andrews resort.
