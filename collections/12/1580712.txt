Housing in the United Kingdom ranks in the top half of EU countries.[1][2] However the increasing cost of housing is leading many to claim there is a "housing crisis".[3][4][5] Most though still find the UK a desirable place to live. London is resident to the highest number of ultra-high-net-worth individuals in the world.[6] For some this is a cause for concern as it is leading to gentrification. The average house costs £290,000 to buy (September 2015), has 2.8 bedrooms, and is semi-detached.[7] Housing represents the largest non-financial asset in the UK with a net value of £5.1 trillion (2014).[8]
