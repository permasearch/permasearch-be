Stalin was a capable actor who could play many different roles to different audiences,[738] and was adept at deception, often lying or deceiving others as to his true motives and aims.[739] He was a good organiser,[740] with a strategic mind,[741] and judged others according to their inner strength, practicality, and cleverness.[742] He could be rude and insulting, traits in his personality that he publicly acknowledged.[743] Despite his short temper and tough-talking attitude, he could be very charming;[744] when relaxed, he cracked jokes and mimicked others.[734] Montefiore suggested that it was his charm which represented "the foundation of Stalin's power in the Party".[745] Several historians have seen it appropriate to follow Lazar Kaganovich's description of there being "several Stalins" as a means of understanding his multi-faceted personality.[746]
