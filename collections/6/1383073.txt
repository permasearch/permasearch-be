The Labour governments did not privatise many publicly owned services because most had been privatised by the previous government. However, some government-owned businesses such as Qinetiq were privatised. But a great deal of infrastructure and maintenance work previously carried out by government departments was contracted out (out-sourced) to private enterprise under the publicâ€“private partnership, with competitive bidding for contracts within a regulatory framework. This included large projects such as building new hospitals for the National Health Service, building new state schools, and maintaining the London Underground. These privatisations were never offered to the general public to buy shares, they were all offered to commercial companies only.[citation needed]
