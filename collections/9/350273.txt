On 21 August 2012, J. Michael Gilmore wrote that he would not approve the Operational Test and Evaluation master plan until his concerns about electronic warfare testing, budget and concurrency were addressed.[261] On 7 September 2012, the Pentagon failed to approve a comprehensive operational testing plan for the F-35.[262] Instead, on 10 September 2012, the USAF began an operational utility evaluation (OUE) of the F-35A entire system, including logistical support and maintenance, maintenance training, pilot training, and pilot execution.[263] By 1 October, the OUE was reported as "proceeding smoothly", pilots started on simulators prior to flying on 26 October.[264] The OUE was completed on 14 November with the 24th flight, the four pilots involved having completed six flights each.[265]
