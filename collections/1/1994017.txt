During the U.S. Civil War, Texas, along with most other southern slave states, declared that they had seceded from the Union to join the Confederacy. The Confederacy had some support from the areas Anglo residents, like Col. Hugh Stephenson, but as elsewhere in Texas, far less support from Mexicans, who were the majority. Confederate forces controlled Fort Bliss in 1861 until the city's occupation by the Union California Column in 1862.[6] It was then headquarters for the 5th Regiment California Volunteer Infantry until December 1864.[8] After the war concluded, the town's population began to grow.
