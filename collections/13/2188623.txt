Paul Reynaud resigned because he believed a majority of his government favoured an armistice. He was succeeded by a patriarchal figure, 84-year-old World War I veteran Maréchal Philippe Pétain. On June 16, the new French President of the Council, Philippe Pétain (the President of the Republic office was vacant from July 11, 1940 until 16 January 1947), began negotiations with Axis officials. On June 17, 1940, Marshal Pétain delivered an infamous appeal to the French people via radio ordering them « it is necessary to cease to fight » (« il faut cesser le combat »).[21]
