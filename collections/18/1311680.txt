Separate US-based breeding efforts had begun around 1950,[5] and a breeder known to sources simply as Mrs. Goforth received breed recognition from the Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) near the end of 1957 for the Himalayan.[5] Early breeders were mostly interested in adding Siamese colouration to long-haired cats, and therefore reinforced the stock by outbreeding to Persians only to retain the Persian trait dominance.[5] However, by the 1960s, some were re-introducing Siamese stock and producing less "Persian-style" cats,[5] In the 1980s, a concerted effort to re-establish the breed along more formally Persian lines ultimately caused the breed to be merged into Persian as a variant in some registries (e.g. in 1984 by CFA), and a decline in the "old" or Siamese-like specimens.[5]
