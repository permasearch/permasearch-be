In "Burn This", Emily stumbles upon an auto shop that appears to be fixing the same car that almost ran her over. After asking if anyone had brought in a dark gray SUV, one of the mechanic insists they can't help her. Emily comes backs to snoop around and lifts up a tarp covering a car. She sees paint and takes a picture of it before the same mechanic she had confronted earlier demands to know why she was there again. Emily tells him the car she was talking about matches the one she was investigating and asks if he knows who drove it last night. He says "Maybe I lent it to a friend. I can't remember". Emily holds up a picture of Melissa and asks if she was his friend. The mechanic denies, before looking back at the other guys and ordering Emily to leave. Later, Emily spots a pink dice keychain on Mona's keys as she's walking over to her car after leaving Hanna's engagement party. The object happens to fit the description of whomever called Charlotte the night she was killed. After being confronted by Emily, Mona states she can't talk about that subject outdoors. At the end of the episode, we see the mechanic that interacted with Emily wiping paint off the SUV, before reaching into the car and finding an enveloping containing several hundred dollars and smiling.
