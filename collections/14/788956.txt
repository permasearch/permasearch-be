The Oklahoma City Thunder are a professional basketball team based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. They play in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and are a member of the NBA Western Conference's Northwest Division. The Thunder were founded in 1967 as the Seattle SuperSonics as one of two franchises that joined the NBA in the 1967–68 season. The SuperSonics moved to Oklahoma City after the 2007–08 season. The move from Seattle to Oklahoma City marks only the second time that a current franchise won a title in one city and moved some time afterwards to another city (the 2nd are the Atlanta Hawks who left St. Louis after winning the 1958 title there).
