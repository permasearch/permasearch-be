Guam has been occupied for over 450 years by the Spanish, the Japanese, and the United States. In 2016, Governor Eddie Calvo planned a decolonization referendum that the indigenous Chamorro people of Guam would solely participate in, in which the three options would be given, including statehood, independence, and free association. However, this referendum for the Chamorro people was struck down by a federal judge on the grounds of racial discrimination. In the wake of this ruling, Governor Calvo has suggested that two ballots be held: one for the Chamorro People and one for eligible U.S. citizens who are non-indigenous residents of Guam. The Governor hopes for a decolonization plebiscite to occur in 2018.[49][50][51] It is also possible that in 2018, Guam and its neighbor, the Northern Mariana Islands (a U.S. Commonwealth) may vote on a reunification referendum.[52][53]
