In response to the creation of Cleatus, Fox Sports created Digger, an animated gopher mascot for Fox NASCAR telecasts; the character was originally seen only during the races when the in-track cameras knowns as the "Digger Cam" were shown, but his role soon expanded. Unlike Cleatus, however, Digger was not well received by fans, and sparked an internet and Twitter outcry for his removal from the broadcast. While Digger was featured heavily in 2009, he only made cameo appearances in 2010 before being phased out completely the following year. Starting in 2014 Frank Krimel is the driver of Fox Sports 1 Cleatus competing in Monster Jam.
