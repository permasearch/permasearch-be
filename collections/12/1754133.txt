The club cost over $250 million to build, making it one of the most expensive golf courses in history.[5] Club designers added amenities such as an on-site helistop, yacht services, a spa and a restaurant.[5] Nine hundred adjacent homes, slated to be built in the coming years, are said to cost from $1.5 million to $5 million.[5] Liberty National is noted as a unique course because of its proximity to both the Statue of Liberty and Manhattan, as well as the fact it was built on a former landfill.[4]
