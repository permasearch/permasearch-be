Sticklebacks and killifish have been shown to prefer shoals made up of healthy individuals over parasitized ones, on the basis of visual signs of parasitism and abnormal behaviour by the parasitized fish.[108][109][110][111] Zebrafish prefer shoals that consist of well-fed (greater stomach width) fish over food-deprived ones.[112]
