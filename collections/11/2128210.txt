Guame the Immoveable (グァーム, Gwāmu) is one of the Spiral King's Four Supreme Generals, who specialises in ground combat. Guame is the representation of the classical element of earth. His appearance is like that of a crocodile and armadillo and the oldest of the four generals, revealed in the parallel works to be originally an animal-like figure seen by Lordgenome's side as a parallel to Boota, living as long as or almost as long as the Spiral King has. In episode nine, he, along with the two other generals, reported the death of Thymilph to the Spiral King. He gives off the impression of one with a perverted mind and showed why when he made snide comments about the relationship between Thymilph and Adiane. Guame appears to merely respect the Spiral King, unlike the other Beastmen, who worship him as a god. When questioned by Cytomander after he boldly asked the king to let him go after Team Dai-Gurren, Guame explains his relation to King of being ages old (he later referred to Cytomander as a "pup of two-hundred-years age", implying that he is significantly older than Cytomander, enough for 200 years to seem like nothing). Succeeding in capturing the Dai-Gurren's crew, Guame had Nia brought to him and reveals to her the truth he thought on why she was abandoned while attempting to offer to spare her life if she accepts to be leader of the "Beauty Village" where the Spiral King gets his consorts from. But Nia refused and Guame was forced to retreat when Team Dai-Gurren escaped and fought back.
