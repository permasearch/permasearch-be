The American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO), formed in 1914 to help establish roadway standards, began to plan a system of marked and numbered "interstate highways" at its 1924 meeting.[24] AASHO recommended that the Secretary of Agriculture work with the states to designate these routes.[1]
