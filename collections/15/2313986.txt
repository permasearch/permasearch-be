These techniques are now extinct in all regions of sub-Saharan Africa, except for some very remote regions of Ethiopia.  In most regions of Africa they fell out of use before 1950.  The main reason for this was the increasing availability of iron imported from Europe.  Blacksmiths still work in rural areas of Africa to make and repair agricultural tools, but the iron that they use is imported, or recycled from old motor vehicles.
