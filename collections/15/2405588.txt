Sudden death also occurs in computer gaming when both teams have the same score and a method of breaking a tie is needed. For example, in a Capture the Flag area for Quake III Arena, when neither team has scored, or if no team leads, a sudden death match will decide who will be the victor. All the teams have to do is get the flag and deliver it to the base one time only in order to win automatically. Sometimes, players share a handicap in order to end the game faster; for example, in a Super Smash Bros. sudden death match, players fight beginning at 300% damage, amplifying how much they are knocked back to the extent that most attacks will KO them in a single blow. In games where the players normally would respawn, like Team Fortress 2, sudden death often means that respawning is disabled and the last team standing wins.
