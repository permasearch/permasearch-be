The Old English word for dinner, disner, means to break a fast, and was the first meal eaten in the day until its meaning shifted in the mid-13th century.[3] It was not until the 15th century that “breakfast” came into use in written English to describe a morning meal,[2]:6 which literally means to break the fasting period of the prior night; in Old English the term was morgenmete meaning "morning meal."[4]
