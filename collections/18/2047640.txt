The storyline for the Botcon fan convention from 1998 to 2000 featured Unicron's life force ending up on prehistoric Earth following the destruction of his body in Transformers: The Movie. It is eventually found by a lowly Predacon known as the Hunter, who fashions a container for it that he dubs the Decepticon Matrix of Conquest. Taking the name Shokaract, this villain seems to become one with Unicron himself, with the pair of them laying waste to Shokaract's Cybertron and the rest of the universe. However, the instability of the timestream means that Unicron's lifeforce, also known as the Dark Essence, is in danger of being pulled away from prehistoric Earth before the Hunter can find it, which would undo Shokaract's timeline. Shokaract thus dispatches two of his Heralds, Antagony and Cataclysm, to safeguard the Dark Essence, only for Antagony to be captured by Megatron's Predacons and Cataclysm to perish in battle with the Maximal hero Windrazor. Shokaract travels back in time to secure the Essence and destroy the Maximals, only to be engaged in battle by the Covenant of Primus. With the aid of other Transformers from across time and space, the Covenant succeeds in defeating Shokaract, and the Dark Essence of Unicron is drawn back into time, erasing Shokaract's timeline.
