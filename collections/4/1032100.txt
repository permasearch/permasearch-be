The company was founded by its namesake, Fred C. Koch, in 1940 after he developed an innovative crude oil refining process.[11] Fred C. Koch died in 1967 and his majority interest in the company was split amongst his four sons. In June 1983, after a bitter legal and boardroom battle, the stakes of Frederick R. Koch and William "Bill" Koch were bought out for $1.1 billion and Charles Koch and David Koch became majority owners in the company.[12] Charles and David Koch each own 42% of the company and trusts for the benefit of Elaine Tettemer Marshall, the daughter in-law of J. Howard Marshall and Anna Nicole Smith, and her children, Preston Marshall and E. Pierce Marshall Jr., own 16% of the company.[3][13]
