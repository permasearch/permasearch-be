A major use of formic acid is as a preservative and antibacterial agent in livestock feed. In Europe, it is applied on silage (including fresh hay) to promote the fermentation of lactic acid and to suppress the formation of butyric acid; it also allows fermentation to occur quickly, and at a lower temperature, reducing the loss of nutritional value.[6] Formic acid arrests certain decay processes and causes the feed to retain its nutritive value longer, and so it is widely used to preserve winter feed for cattle.[20] In the poultry industry, it is sometimes added to feed to kill E. coli bacteria.[21][22] Use as preservative for silage and (other) animal feed constituted 30% of the global consumption in 2009.[11]
