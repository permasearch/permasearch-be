The Western half of Campus contains most of the residential parts of campus. Dalton-Voigt Hall opened in Fall 2015 and houses upperclass students and currently has its first two floors divided among the four active sororities on campus with the top two floors for all upperclass students. This $7 million 144-bed facility offers suite-style living and common spaces for studying and activities.[27] Jefferson Davis Hall and Henry Clay Hall were demolished in June 2015 to make space for construction of Pioneer Hall and Bassett Hall, which are similar to Dalton-Voigt and opened in January 2017.[28]
