The Gambler wins half the ranch in a card game. The Gunslinger is not pleased with losing half a ranch. The Girl loves the Gunslinger. A band of a few hundred bandits invade with plans for a new nation. The US army plans to blow everything up to defend the USA. The Gambler likes the Girl, and stays on to help, saving the Gunslinger because of her. Then Gambler and Gunslinger blow up a few rebels. The Gambler, the Girl and the Gunslinger live happily (maybe) ever after on the ranch.
