Additionally the Standard Model contains[citation needed] a high energy unification of the electroweak theory with the strong force, described by quantum chromodynamics. It also postulates a connection with gravity as yet another gauge theory, but the connection is as of 2015 still poorly understood. The theory's successful prediction of the Higgs particle to explain inertial mass was confirmed by the Large Hadron Collider,[53] and thus the Standard model is now considered the basic and more or less complete description of particle physics as we know it.
