Later, Owen, Claire, Zach, and Gray arrive at the laboratory and discover that InGen had cleared the laboratory, taking dinosaur embryos with them. Hoskins reveals his plan to use the Indominus rex as a weapon. Delta appears and kills Hoskins as Owen, Claire and the boys escape. Outside, they are confronted by the other raptors. Owen is able to establish his bond with the raptors. They attack the Indominus, aided by Owen, but Delta and Echo are killed, and Blue seemingly. Claire releases the Tyrannosaurus from its paddock and lures it into a fight with the Indominus. Blue, revealed to have survived, returns and attacks the Indominus as it pins down the T. rex. The T. rex and Blue force the Indominus toward the park lagoon where the Mosasaurus grabs it and drags it underwater. Owen sees Blue one last time before Blue runs off. Owen and Claire decide they will remain together.
