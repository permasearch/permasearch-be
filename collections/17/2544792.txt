While the AFL's Mitchell and Gompers nurtured their alliance with the Democrats,[18] the IWW changed its Constitution in 1908 to prohibit just such alliances. The 1908 Constitution states, "to the end of promoting industrial unity and of securing necessary discipline within the organization, the I. W. W. refuses all alliances, direct or indirect, with existing political parties or anti-political sects..."[43] This language is essentially unchanged in the 2011 IWW Constitution.[44]
