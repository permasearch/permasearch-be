Although the game's story diverges in several places and features a completely different protagonist, several levels mirror passages from Lovecraft's novella The Shadow over Innsmouth. It also contains elements of the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game's campaign Escape from Innsmouth, such as the Marsh Refinery raid. A major sub-plot of the game is inspired by Lovecraft's novella The Shadow Out of Time.
