The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983[1] changed the name of the organisation from the "Australian Broadcasting Commission" to the "Australian Broadcasting Corporation", effective 1 July 1983.[1] At the same time, the newly formed Corporation underwent significant restructuring. The ABC was split into separate television and radio divisions, with an overhaul of management, finance, property and engineering.[20] Geoffrey Whitehead[21] was the initial managing director; however, following his resignation in 1986, David Hill (at the time chair of the ABC Board) took over his position.
