Now able to live in the outside world, Alex meets her next door neighbor named Nathan, who she forms a relationship with. Nikita works with Ryan Fletcher, a CIA analyst who agrees to help Nikita after she saves his life, and Owen Elliot, a former Division agent who killed Nikita's fiancÃ©, to try to find Division's black boxes, which keep a record of all of their former operations. The boxes are protected by Guardians, special agents designated to protect each box. Owen has a black box, which Nikita destroys. She believes destroying the boxes will remove any insurance Division may have. She also faces a new enemy in the form of GOGOL, a Russian criminal organisation and spin-off from Division, led by Ari Tasarov, which is trying to take over from Division.
