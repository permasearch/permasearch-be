In 1893, the first Parliament of the World's Religions was held in Chicago.[11] The conference included NRMs of the time such as spiritualism and Christian Science. The latter was represented by its founder Mary Baker Eddy. Henry Harris Jessup addressing the meeting was the first to mention the Bahá'í Faith in the United States.[12] Also attending were Soyen Shaku, the "First American Ancestor" of Zen,[13] the Buddhist preacher Anagarika Dharmapala, and the Jain preacher Virchand Gandhi.[14] This conference gave Asian religious teachers their first wide American audience.[7]
