The country's population-growth rate was among the highest in the world in the 1960s and 1970s, when its population grew from 65 to 110Â million. With the promotion of birth control in the 1980s, Bangladesh's growth rate began to slow. Its total fertility rate is now 2.55, lower than India's (2.58) and Pakistan's (3.07). The population is relatively young, with 34 percent aged 15 or younger and five percent 65 or older. Life expectancy at birth was estimated at 70 years in 2012.[100] Despite the rapid economic growth, 43% of the country still lives below the international poverty line on less than $1.25 per day.[219]
