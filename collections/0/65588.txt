A customer asks a bank for a cashier's check, and the bank debits the amount from the customer's account immediately, and assumes the responsibility for covering the cashier's check. That is in contrast with a personal check, in which the bank does not debit the amount from the customer's account until the check is deposited or cashed by the recipient.
