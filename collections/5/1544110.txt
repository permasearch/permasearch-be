From 1943 on, Hergé with the help of Edgar P. Jacobs started redrawing and colouring the early Tintin adventures, while also collaborating in the production of new stories. The old stories, usually a bit over 100 pages long, were restructured to fit into 62 pages. Jacobs eventually ended the collaboration in 1947 when Hergé refused to share the credit with him. They remained friends regardless of the fact.
