Numerous objects, both natural and artificial, have gone over the Niagara Falls. These events have been the result of both stunts and accidents, some of which have resulted in fatalities. The first recorded person to survive going over the falls was Annie Edson Taylor, who went over the falls in a barrel in 1901. 72 years previously, however, Sam Patch had jumped from a platform adjacent to Goat Island.[1][2]
