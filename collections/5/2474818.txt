Acid rock drainage has recently been a hindrance to the completion of the construction of Interstate 99 near State College, Pennsylvania. However, this acid rock drainage didn't come from a mine; rather, it was produced by oxidation of pyrite-rich rock which was unearthed during a road cut and then used as filler material in the I-99 construction.[citation needed] A similar situation developed at the Halifax airport in Canada.[citation needed] It is from these and similar experiences that the term acid rock drainage has emerged as being preferable to acid mine drainage, thereby emphasizing the general nature of the problem.
