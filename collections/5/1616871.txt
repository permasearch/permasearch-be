An official air traffic control call sign for a United States Air Force aircraft carrying the President was established for security purposes during Eisenhower's presidency. This came about following a 1953 incident where an Eastern Airlines commercial flight (8610) had the same call sign as the flight the president was on (Air Force 8610). The airliner accidentally entered the same airspace, and after the incident, the unique presidential aircraft call sign Air Force One was introduced in 1959.
