Dynamin is a GTPase responsible for endocytosis in the eukaryotic cell. Dynamins are principally involved in the scission of newly formed vesicles from the membrane of one cellular compartment and their targeting to, and fusion with, another compartment, both at the cell surface (particularly caveolae internalization) as well as at the Golgi apparatus.[1][2][3] Dynamin also plays a role in many processes including division of organelles,[4] cytokinesis and microbial pathogen resistance.
