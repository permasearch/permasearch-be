Cobalt-based catalysts are used in reactions involving carbon monoxide. Steam reforming, useful in hydrogen production, uses cobalt oxide-based catalysts. Cobalt is also a catalyst in the Fischerâ€“Tropsch process for the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide into liquid fuels.[82] Hydroformylation of alkenes often uses cobalt octacarbonyl as a catalyst,[83] although it is often replaced by more efficient iridium- and rhodium-based catalysts, e.g. the Cativa process.
