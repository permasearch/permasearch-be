A more exhaustive model was developed for the US Navy stationed in Parris Island in South Carolina. It was developed with a consideration for heat stroke due to the high humidity of the island during summer months. It utilized three specialized thermometers.[13] This research led to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology establishing a different formula, the Australian Apparent Temperature, for cooler temperatures.[14]
