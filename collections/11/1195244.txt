Five days prior to Judgment Day, Chavo tore his biceps, forcing Guerrero to look for another partner. He chose Tajiri, and they won the WWE Tag Team Championship, Guerrero's second and Tajiri's first at Judgment Day by defeating Team Angle in a ladder match.[93][94] The following week, Guerrero and Tajiri managed to retain their title by cheating.[89][95] They also defeated Roddy Piper and his protégé Sean O'Haire in Madison Square Garden.[89][96] After Guerrero and Tajiri lost the titles to Team Angle on the July 3 episode of SmackDown!, Guerrero turned on Tajiri, slamming his partner through the windshield of his low-rider truck. The next Smackdown! Guerrero said he did it because during the match Tajiri had accidentally hit his low-rider. Despite being portrayed as the villain, when Guerrero asked the audience if they blamed him for doing it, the audience responded by yelling "No!".[89][97]
