A strong acid is effectively completely dissociated in aqueous solution below certain concentration threshold values in concentrated solutions of acids like hydrochloric acid or nitric acid above 2-3 M. A tacit assumption occurs here about hydrogen ion concentration in dilute solutions being equal to analytic concentration of the monobasic acid as a result of total dissociation. All acids with a pKa value of less than −2 are more than 99% dissociated at pH 0 (1 M acid). This is known as solvent leveling since such acids are brought to the same level of being strong acids, regardless of their pKa values. Likewise, all bases with a pKa value larger than the upper limit are more than 99%  dissociated at all attainable pH values and are classified as strong bases.[7]
