Sarah Rodman of Boston Globe depicted the song as a "dance thumper" and invites listeners to "lose themselves in the music".[10] Los Angeles Times' Jeff Weiss viewed the song as "generic" with Usher "singing generic paeans to a paramourâ€™s eyes over a Eurovision-like Max Martin production."[11] Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine disapproved of the track as a whole, writing "DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love is, while indistinguishable from any other overdriving club banger, one of the only songs in which Usher Raymond acknowledges an aphrodisiac more powerful than his own ab musk".[12]
