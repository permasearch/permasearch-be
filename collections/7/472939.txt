India is the world's most populous democracy.[148] A parliamentary republic with a multi-party system,[149] it has seven recognised national parties, including the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and more than 40 regional parties.[150] The Congress is considered centre-left in Indian political culture,[151] and the BJP right-wing.[152][153][154] For most of the period between 1950—when India first became a republic—and the late 1980s, the Congress held a majority in the parliament. Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP,[155] as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-party coalition governments at the centre.[156]
