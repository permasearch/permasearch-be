Since September 2015, Hotz has been working on his own AI startup called comma.ai.[38] In an interview with Bloomberg, Hotz revealed he is building vehicular automation technology based on artificial intelligence algorithms. Hotz has built a working self-driving 2016 Acura ILX, which he demonstrated on the I-280 in a video.[3] The video prompted a cease and desist letter from the California Department of Motor Vehicles.[39] Hotz wants to sell his technology to Tesla Motors and he has reported to have talked to CEO Elon Musk and is working on proving his technology to be superior to that of Mobileye, which, at the time, was used for Tesla Autopilot.[3][3] [40][41] Hotz claims that Musk offered him $12 million (minus $1 million for every month it took Hotz to work on the task) to create a driving system that could replace the MobilEye solution currently used in Tesla vehicles.[42] Tesla later released a statement on their website citing corrections to the Bloomberg article, stressing that their autopilot system was developed in-house, with a vision chip component from MobilEye, instead of one separate autopilot system manufactured by MobilEye, as suggested by Hotz in the interview with Bloomberg.[40] Tesla CEO Elon Musk offered advice on Hotz's self-driving car project in a December 2015 interview.[43]
