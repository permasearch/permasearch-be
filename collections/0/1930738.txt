Work on the fourth season was underway when Ryan Seacrest Productions (RSP) and Bravo denied the show's post-production crew a union contract.  The crew went on strike with the support of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees.[5] Bravo fired the crew and the fourth season had been delayed.[6] Eventually, RSP "ratified a union agreement, ending the month-long strike."[7] The fourth season of Shahs of Sunset premiered on March 2, 2015.[8] In June 2015, the show was renewed for a fifth season which premiered April 10, 2016.[9] On October 27, 2016, the show was renewed for a sixth season which premiered Sunday, July 16, 2017.[10] In April 2018, the show was renewed for a seventh season.[11]
