"My Long Goodbye" received very positive reviews from critics. IGN gave the episode a score of 8.5 out of 10, and praising Laverne's death scene, mainly for Judy Reyes performance and for Carla's final goodbye, stating that is "a moment both emotional and funny, but always honest", and that "Reyes hits it out of the park with her performance". However, he regretted that Wright "doesn't get anything as juicy for herself", although admitting "this choice doesn't lessen the impact any as the show says goodbye to a familiar face"[1]
