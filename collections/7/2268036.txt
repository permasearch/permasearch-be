Wat Phra Dhammakaya (Thai: วัดพระธรรมกาย; RTGS: Wat Phra Thammakai; IPA: [wát pʰráʔ tʰam.má.kaːj]) is a Buddhist temple (wat) in Khlong Luang District, in the peri-urban Pathum Thani Province north of Bangkok, Thailand. It was founded in 1970 by the maechi (nun) Chandra Khonnokyoong and Luang Por Dhammajayo. It is the best-known and the fastest growing temple of the Dhammakaya Movement. This movement, also known as the Dhammakaya meditation tradition (Vijja Dhammakaya), was started by the meditation teacher Luang Pu Sodh Candasaro in the early twentieth century. The temple is part of the Mahanikaya fraternity, and is legally represented by the Dhammakaya Foundation. The temple emphasizes the revival of traditional Buddhist values, but does so through modern methods and technology, which has led to controversy and a government crackdown. Despite these controversies, the temple has continued to play a leading role in Thai Buddhism. Religious studies scholar Edward Irons has described the temple as "the face of modern Thai Buddhism".[2] The temple emphasizes personal transformation, expressed through its slogan "World Peace through Inner Peace".
