Ten years before the start of the series, when his younger brother Jimmy faced serious charges after defecating through the sunroof of a romantic rival's BMW – unaware the man's children were in the backseat – Chuck bailed him out on the condition that Jimmy abandon his career as a con artist and work a legitimate job in HHM's mailroom. Around the time of his divorce from his wife, Rebecca Bois, Chuck took a leave of absence from HHM after apparently developing electromagnetic hypersensitivity, or a painful allergic sensitivity to electricity. Jimmy, who quit HHM after they refused to hire him after he passed his bar exam, took over Chuck's care and provided his groceries.
