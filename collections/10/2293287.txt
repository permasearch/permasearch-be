Biographers have stated that Banneker's duties on the survey consisted primarily of making astronomical observations at Jones Point in Alexandria, Virginia, to ascertain the location of the starting point for the survey.[28][34][37] They have also stated that Banneker maintained a clock that he used to relate points on the ground to the positions of stars at specific times.[28][37] However, some have noted that Banneker's actual role in the survey is uncertain, as his involvement in the effort "rests on extremely meager documentation".[38] An April 21, 1791, news report of the dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who â€³ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed".[39] The news report did not mention Banneker's name.[40]
