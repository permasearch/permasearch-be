The airport consists of two passenger terminals: Terminal 1 at Santacruz for domestic flights and Terminal 2 at Sahar for both international and domestic flights. While both terminals use the same airside facilities, they are physically separated on the cityside, requiring a 15â€“20-minute (landside) drive between them. MIAL operates coach shuttle services between the two terminals for the convenience of transit passengers.
