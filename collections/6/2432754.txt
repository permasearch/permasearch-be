After donning night vision goggles (3D glasses) the "cub reporters" get in the Scoop and leave the loading docks to a Manhattan[11] back alley where they encounter Spider-Man.[12] He warns that he is in for the most dangerous night of his life and for the guests to be careful.[11] In this scene, a series of synchronized effects are used to simulate Spider-Man jumping on the Scoop.[13][14] Nearly missing a trash truck driven by a Stan Lee cameo, the guests enter a warehouse where the Sinister Syndicate are holding the Statue of Liberty hostage. Once spotted, Electro, Scream, and Doctor Octopus attack and hurl the Scoop into the sewer, where Spider-Man is waiting. After he fends off Hydro-Man and Doctor Octopus there, the guests escape narrowly to the river where Hobgoblin attacks with exploding pumpkins and sends guests into the streets.[12]
