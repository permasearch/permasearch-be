Uber has been criticized for its extreme surcharges during emergencies such as Hurricane Sandy,[29][30] the 2014 Sydney hostage crisis,[31][32][33] and the June 2017 London Bridge attack,[34][35][36] especially when taxis offered to transport riders for free; however, in many cases Uber later refunded surcharges incurred by riders during these events. In 2014, Uber announced that it would not implement surge pricing during emergencies in the United States.[37][38][39] Uber, as Cabify, courses were free up to a certain limit during the 2017 Central Mexico earthquake, with the display of a message indicating to shelter.[40]
