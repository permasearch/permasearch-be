This Piazza, entered from Via San Giovanni, is the main square of the town.  It is triangular in shape and is surrounded by medieval houses of different dates, among them some fine examples of Romanesque and Gothic palazzos.  At the centre of the piazza stands a well which was the main source of water for the town's residents. The structure dates from 1346.[6] Although much of it has been renewed in the late 20th century, parts of the paving date from the 13th century.[6]
