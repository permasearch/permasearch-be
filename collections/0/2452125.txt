Nelson uses a variety of music styles to create his own distinctive blend of country music, a hybrid of jazz, pop, blues, rock and folk.[129] His "unique sound", which uses a "relaxed, behind-the-beat singing style and gut-string guitar"[130] and his "nasal voice and jazzy, off-center phrasing",[129] has been responsible for his wide appeal, and has made him a "vital icon in country music", influencing the "new country, new traditionalist, and alternative country movements of the '80s and '90s".[129]
