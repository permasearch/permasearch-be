Among pre-Islamic Arabs, a bride price called mahr was an essential condition for a legal marriage. The mahr was given to the guardian (wali) of the bride, such as her father, brother or another relative. In earlier times, the bride received no portion of the mahr.[1] Some scholars believe that in the period shortly before Muhammad, the mahr, or at least a part of it, was already given to the bride,[1] while others regard its transformation into wife's property as a "revolutionary" Quranic innovation.[7]
