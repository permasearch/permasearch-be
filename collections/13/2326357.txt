CNNs have been used in the game of checkers. From 1999â€“2001, Fogel and Chellapilla published papers showing how a convolutional neural network could learn to play checkers using co-evolution. The learning process did not use prior human professional games, but rather focused on a minimal set of information contained in the checkerboard: the location and type of pieces, and the piece differential[clarify]. Ultimately, the program (Blondie24) was tested on 165 games against players and ranked in the highest 0.4%.[75][76] It also earned a win against the program Chinook at its "expert" level of play.[77]
