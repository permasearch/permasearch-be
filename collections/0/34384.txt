The exact origin of the term "total quality management" is uncertain.[1] It is almost certainly inspired by Armand V. Feigenbaum's multi-edition book Total Quality Control (OCLC 299383303) and Kaoru Ishikawa's What Is Total Quality Control? The Japanese Way (OCLC 11467749). It may have been first coined in the United Kingdom by the Department of Trade and Industry during its 1983 "National Quality Campaign".[1] Or it may have been first coined in the United States by the Naval Air Systems Command to describe its quality-improvement efforts in 1985.[1]
