In the 2000s, bioinformatic predictions of intrinsic disorder in proteins indicated that intrinsic disorder is more common in sequenced/predicted proteomes than in known structures in the protein database. Based on DISOPRED2 prediction, long (>30 residue) disordered segments occur in 2.0% of archaean, 4.2% of eubacterial and 33.0% of eukaryotic proteins.[10] In 2001, Dunker published his paper 'Intrinsically Disordered Proteins' questioning whether the newly found information was ignored for 50 years.[11]
