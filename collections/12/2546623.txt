The Yoshi species makes its Paper Mario series debut in the fifth chapter of the original Paper Mario when Mario comes across a village of Yoshis and rescues a group of Yoshi kids after they become lost in the surrounding jungle outside of the village. In the sequel Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door Mario rescues a Yoshi egg that hatches into a baby Yoshi, who then joins his team during the third chapter of the game and can be named upon doing so. The color of the Yoshi depends on the amount of time that passes between rescuing the egg and the egg hatching, with the timer being reset after 20 minutes have passed. Unlike in some games, the Yoshi's coloration is merely cosmetic. The Yoshi has the only attack that can damage the two Iron Clefts known as the "Armored Harriers" introduced in the same chapter (even a perfect Superguard or the "Piercing Blow" badge won't scratch them). The Yoshis appear multiple times as non-player characters throughout the Mario & Luigi series, having a whole club dedicated to them in Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga.
