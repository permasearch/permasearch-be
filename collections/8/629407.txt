The club were less successful during the reign of Don Howe, and were relegated to Division Two at the end of 1972–73,[25] but gained promotion three years later under the guidance of player-manager Johnny Giles.[26] Under Ron Atkinson, Albion reached the 1978 FA Cup semi-final but lost to Ipswich Town.[27] In May of that year, Albion became the first English professional team to play in China, going unbeaten on their five-game trip.[28][29] In 1978–79, the team finished third in Division One, their highest placing for over 20 years, and also reached the UEFA Cup quarter-final, where they were defeated by Red Star Belgrade.[30] The team around this time was notable for simultaneously fielding three black players: Cyrille Regis, Laurie Cunningham and Brendon Batson; and is considered to be an integral part of the acceptance of black footballers in the English leagues. In his second spell as manager, Ronnie Allen guided the team to both domestic cup semi-finals in 1981–82.[31] The mid-1980s saw the start of Albion's longest and deepest decline. They were relegated in 1985–86 with the worst record in the club's history,[32] beginning a period of sixteen years outside the top flight. Five years later, the club were relegated to the Third Division for the first and only time.[33]
