The duties of an Arkansas sheriff generally include providing law enforcement services to residents, managing county jail(s), and providing bailiffs for the county, district, circuit, and other courts within the county. By the Arkansas Constitution, the sheriff is not the highest ranking law enforcement officer in a countyâ€”that power falls with the county coroner. The county coroner can conduct investigations into deaths within their county, have subpoena powers, and can conduct "coroner's inquests" (much like a grand jury) into certain deaths. The sheriff, on the other hand, has no such powers (other than investigative powers), although counties have the option to make sheriffs the highest ranking law officer, relegating the county coroner to the 2nd highest ranking law officer, although this is rarely done and doesn't change the official powers of the county sheriff. There are 75 county sheriffs in Arkansas, one for each county, regardless of its population size.
