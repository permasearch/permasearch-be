The team consists of Kim Jong-min, Kim Joon-Ho, and Yoon Shi-yoon on season 3 of the show. The team was first formed in the "Working Holiday in Yeongwol" episode, where the three had to climb the mountain to meet the naturalist as punishment. The team was then reunited in the "Last Minute Heat Tour" episode where during the dinner game of chance, Yoon Shi-yoon (in a bad sense) joined Kim Joon-ho and Kim Jong-min as the new member of the 3G team, replacing the late Kim Joo-hyuk. This was because the members jokingly said that Yoon Shi-yoon and Kim Joo-hyuk were the same (Yoon Shi-yoon's birthname Dong-GU and Kim Joo-hyuk's nickname GU-taeng bro).
