Various ancient and medieval civilizations produced "mirrors for princes" books, which aimed to advise new monarchs on how to govern. Plato described job specialization in 350 B.C., and Alfarabi listed several leadership traits in A.D. 900.[16] Other examples include the Indian Arthashastra by Chanakya (written around 300 BCE), and The Prince by Italian author Niccol√≤ Machiavelli (c. 1515).[17]
