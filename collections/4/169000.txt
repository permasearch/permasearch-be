In 2002, Ford launched its highest performance version of the Focus, called the Focus RS. It came with a 2.0-litre turbocharged Zetec engine, a Quaife ATB limited-slip differential, Brembo brakes, and a host of other performance changes, combined with a much more aggressive appearance, and was available only in blue. This original Focus RS was only available in Europe.
