The lateral line system is necessary to detect vibrations made by prey, and to orient towards the source to begin predatory action.[3] Fish are able to detect movement, produced either by prey or a vibrating metal sphere, and orient themselves toward the source before proceeding to make a predatory strike at it. This behavior persists even in blinded fish, but is greatly diminished when lateral line function was inhibited by CoCl2 application. Cobalt chloride treatment results in the release of cobalt ions, disrupting ionic transport and preventing signal transduction in the lateral lines.[4] These behaviors are dependent specifically on mechanoreceptors located within the canals of the lateral line.[3]
