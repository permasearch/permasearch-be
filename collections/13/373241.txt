They were first approved for contraceptive use in the United States in 1960, and are a very popular form of birth control. They are currently used by more than 100 million women worldwide and by almost 12 million women in the United States.[8] As of 2012, 16% of U.S. women aged 15–44 reported being on the birth control pill, making it the most widely used contraceptive method among women of that age range.[9] Use varies widely by country,[10] age, education, and marital status. One third of women aged 16–49 in the United Kingdom currently use either the combined pill or progestogen-only pill,[11][12] compared with only 1% of women in Japan.[13][needs update]
