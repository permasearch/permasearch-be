The average lifespan in the wild is 18 years, though it is quite possible for wild specimens to survive for more than 23 years.[54] The record age of a wild specimen was 39 years,[63] while that in captivity was 44 years.[34] The average annual survival rate for adult bears is variable, ranging from 86% in Florida to 73% in Virginia and North Carolina.[32] In Minnesota, 99% of wintering adult bears were able to survive the hibernation cycle in one study.[32] Remarkably, a study of black bears in Nevada found that the amount of annual mortality of a population of bears in wilderness areas was 0%, whereas in developed areas in the state this figure rose to 83%.[4] Survival in sub-adults is generally less assured. In Alaska, only 14–17% of sub-adult males and 30–48% of sub-adult females were found in a study to survive to adulthood.[32] Across the range, the estimated number of cubs who survive past their first year is 60%.[4]
