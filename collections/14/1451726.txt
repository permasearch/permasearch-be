By the early 1900s, while touring, he was regularly called the world's greatest juggler.[22] He became a headliner in North America and Europe, and toured Australia and South Africa in 1903.[23] When Fields played for English-speaking audiences, he found he could get more laughs by adding muttered patter and sarcastic asides to his routines. According to W. Buchanan-Taylor, a performer who saw Fields' performance in an English music hall, Fields would "reprimand a particular ball which had not come to his hand accurately", and "mutter weird and unintelligible expletives to his cigar when it missed his mouth".[24]
