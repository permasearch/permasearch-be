The film received its world premiere screening when it opened the London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival in March 2010. It was broadcast in the United Kingdom by the BBC in May 2010. It drew mixed reviews from critics, who generally praised the performance of Maxine Peake, although some did not enjoy the script.
