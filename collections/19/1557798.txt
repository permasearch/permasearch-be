The fewest number of clues possible for a proper Sudoku is 17 (proven January 2012, and confirmed September 2013).[31][32] Over 49,000 Sudokus with 17 clues have been found, many by Japanese enthusiasts.[33][34] Sudokus with 18 clues and rotational symmetry have been found, and at least one Sudoku is known with 18 clues and exhibits two-way diagonal symmetry, and is automorphic. The maximum number of clues that can be provided while still not rendering a unique solution is four short of a full grid (77); if two instances of two numbers each are missing from cells that occupy the corners of an orthogonal rectangle, and exactly two of these cells are within one region, the numbers can be assigned two ways. Since this applies to Latin squares in general, most variants of Sudoku have the same maximum.
