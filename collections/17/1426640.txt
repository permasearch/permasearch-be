Upon taking office, Nixon pronounced the "Nixon Doctrine," a general statement of foreign policy. Under the doctrine, the United States would not "undertake all the defense of the free nations." While existing commitments would be upheld, potential new commitments would be sharply scrutinized. Rather than becoming directly involved in conflicts, the United States would provide military and economic aid to nations that were subject to insurgency or aggression, or that were otherwise vital to U.S. strategic interests.[45] As part of the Nixon Doctrine, the U.S. greatly increased arms sales to the Middle Eastâ€”particularly Israel, Iran, and Saudi Arabia.[46] Another major beneficiary of aid was Pakistan, which the U.S. backed during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.[47]
