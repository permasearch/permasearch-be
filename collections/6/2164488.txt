Hunters position themselves in blinds near rivers, lakes, ponds or in agriculture fields planted with corn, barley, wheat or millet. Hunters build blinds to conceal themselves from waterfowl, as waterfowl have sharp eyes and can see colors.  That is why hunters use camouflage. Waterfowl hunters also often use dogs to retrieve dead or injured birds in the water. There are many retriever breeds, such as Labrador Retrievers and Chesapeake Bay Retrievers, specifically bred for the task.  Hunters also may use a boat to get downed birds. Some hunters use boats as blinds or float rivers in search of waterfowl.  When the ducks see the hunters in the boat, ducks flush off the water and hunters shoot.  Then birds are collected and placed in the boat.
