Latin crux referred to the gibbet where criminals were executed, a stake or pole, with or without transom, on which the condemned were impaled or hanged, but more particularly a cross or the pole of a carriage.[1] From this word was derived the Latin verb crucio "to put to death on the cross" or (more frequently) "to put to the rack, to torture, torment" especially in reference to mental troubles.[2] The field of etymology is of no help in any effort to trace a supposed original meaning of crux.[3] A crux can be of various shapes: from a single beam used for impaling or suspending (crux simplex) to the various composite kinds of cross (crux compacta) made from more beams than one. The latter shapes include not only the traditional â€ -shaped cross (the crux immissa), but also the T-shaped cross (the crux commissa or Tau Cross), which the Early Christian descriptions of the execution cross indicate as the normal form in use at that time, and the X-shaped cross (the crux decussata or saltire).
