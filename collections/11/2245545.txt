Due to its high saturated fat content, the regular consumption of clotted cream was, until recently, thought to be bad for health,[9] though now dairy fat in the diet, in moderation, is considered beneficial by some researchers.[10] A 2006 survey of nutrition professionals ranked clotted cream as the least healthy of 120 foods selected to be representative of the British diet.[11] According to the United Kingdom's Food Standards Agency, a 100-gram (3.5 oz) tub of clotted cream provides 586 kilocalories (2,450 kJ), roughly equivalent to a 200-gram (7.1 oz) cheeseburger.[12]
