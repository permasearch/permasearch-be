"Isn't She Lovely" was as enthusiastically received—it was Brown's "favorite number", and she added that Artie's "voice sounded great".[26] It was also Berk's favorite; he commented, "I still melt at Artie's serenade", and gave it four stars out of five.[33] Gonzalez and Benigno both gave it an "A", and the latter explained: "the arrangement ... gives the track a wonderful, spontaneous feel", and "this nerdy white boy has himself some soul."[32][34] Kubicek dissented, and explained that Artie getting emotional in song two weeks in a row "is a tad boring".[35] While most reviewers disliked "Friday" in the original, Rebecca Black version, the commentary for the prom incarnation sung by Puck, Sam and Artie was generally positive despite this—Gonzalez said she hated herself "for giving this horrendously addictive version of a horrendous song a B."[34] VanDerWerff said the song was "way, way, way too long, though it was more fun than [he] expected it to be", Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal called it "darn good and infectious", and Mullins said it was "much catchier than the original".[28][31][36] Benigno gave the song an "A−", and called it a "rafter-raiser".[32]
