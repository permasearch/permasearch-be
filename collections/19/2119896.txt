Simpson announced her separation from Wentz in 2011, citing irreconcilable differences. Despite having taken time to focus on being a mother, Simpson announced a fourth studio album that same year. She independently released the single "Bat for a Heart" (2012), though it failed to have success. Simpson eventually scrapped the album, and focused on her child. She began dating actor Evan Ross in 2013, with the couple marrying in August 2014. Months later, the two announced that Simpson was expecting a second child, and in July 2015, she gave birth to a baby girl.
