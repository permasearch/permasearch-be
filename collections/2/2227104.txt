In marine biology, the neritic zone, also called coastal waters, the coastal ocean or the sublittoral zone,[3] refers to that zone of the ocean where sunlight reaches the ocean floor, that is, where the water is never so deep as to take it out of the photic zone.[? or entire top-layer clarification needed] It extends from the low tide mark to the edge of the continental shelf, with a relatively shallow depth extending to about 200 meters (667 feet). Above the neritic zone lie the intertidal (or eulittoral) and supralittoral zones; below it the continental slope begins, descending from the continental shelf to the abyssal plain and the pelagic zone.
