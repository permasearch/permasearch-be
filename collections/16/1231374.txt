Neeson, Cooper, Copley and Jackson originally expressed interest in doing a sequel.[67][68] Joe Carnahan has expressed interest in directing a sequel and said it will depend on DVD and Blu-ray sales and rentals.[69] On March 10, 2011, Cooper stated that the film had not generated enough revenue for there to be a sequel.[70] This was confirmed by Liam Neeson in a webchat.[71] Neeson later commented in early 2012 that he understood why the film was not successful: "I watched it about two months ago and I found it a little confusing and I was in the thing. I just couldn’t figure out who was who and what’s been done to him and why, a little bit."[72] Later in 2013 Carnahan said on his Twitter account "For the record guys and as much as I appreciate all the A-TEAM love. There will NOT be a sequel. It didn't make enough $$$ and that's that."[73]
