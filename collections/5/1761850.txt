Trump played a leading role in "birther" conspiracy theories that had been circulating since President Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.[267][268] Beginning in March 2011, Trump publicly questioned Obama's citizenship and eligibility to serve as president.[269][270][271] Although the Obama campaign had released a copy of the short-form birth certificate in 2008,[272] Trump demanded to see the original "long-form" certificate.[269] He mentioned having sent investigators to Hawaii to research the question, but he did not follow up with any findings.[269] He also repeated a debunked allegation that Obama's grandmother said she had witnessed his birth in Kenya.[273][274] When the White House later released Obama's long-form birth certificate,[275] Trump took credit for obtaining the document, saying "I hope it checks out."[276] His official biography mentions his purported role in forcing Obama's hand,[277] and he has defended his pursuit of the issue when prompted, later saying that his promotion of the conspiracy made him "very popular".[278] In 2011, Trump had called for Obama to release his student records, questioning whether his grades warranted entry into an Ivy League school.[279] When asked in 2015 whether he believed Obama was born in the United States, Trump said he did not want to discuss the matter further.[280][281] In September 2016, Trump publicly acknowledged that Obama was born in the United States, and said that the rumors had been started by Hillary Clinton during her 2008 presidential campaign.[270][282][283]
