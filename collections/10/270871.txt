Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States had been in place in certain states since colonial days. Marriage to a slave was never legal.[citation needed] In the Reconstruction Era in 1865, the Black Codes across the seven states of the lower South made intermarriage illegal. The new Republican legislatures in six states repealed the restrictive laws. After the Democrats returned to power, the restriction was reimposed.[citation needed]
