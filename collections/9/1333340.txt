The origins of today's national flag with its cross-and-stripe pattern are a matter of debate. Every part of it, including the blue and white colors, the cross, as well as the stripe arrangement can be connected to very old historical elements;[4] however, it is difficult to establish "continuity", especially as there is no record of the exact reasoning behind its official adoption in early 1822.[citation needed]
