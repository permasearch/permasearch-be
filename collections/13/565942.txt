For the 2017–18 bowl season, changes from the prior season's bowl games are the Frisco Bowl replacing the Miami Beach Bowl, and discontinuation of the Poinsettia Bowl. What was the Russell Athletic Bowl is now the Camping World Bowl, due to a sponsorship change and the St. Petersburg Bowl has been renamed as the Gasparilla Bowl, after mythical St. Petersburg area pirate José Gaspar.
