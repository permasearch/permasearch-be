The concept of best practice has been employed extensively in environmental management. For example, it has been employed in aquaculture such as recommending low-phosphorus feed ingredients,[16] in forestry to manage riparian buffer zones,[17] in livestock and pasture management to regulate stocking rates,[18] and in particular, best management practices have been important to improving water quality relating to nonpoint source pollution of fertilizers in agriculture[19] as well as the identification and adoption of best practice for controlling salinity.[20] However, in the context of complex environmental problems such as dryland salinity, there are significant challenges in defining what is best in any given context. Best management practice for complex problems is context specific and often contested against a background of imperfect knowledge. In these contexts, it is more useful to think of best management practice as an adaptive learning process rather than a fixed set of rules or guidelines. This approach to best practice focuses on fostering improvements in quality and promoting continuous learning.[21]
