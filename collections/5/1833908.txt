The Law of Success in 16 Lessons is an edited version of Napoleon Hillâ€™s first manuscripts which was reworked under advisement of some the contributors and first published in 1928. This version was initially published as a multi-volume correspondence course. Later editions consolidated the material into a single hardcover book. The most current version available is through Wilder Publishing.
