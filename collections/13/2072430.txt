The first Emirati soldier to die in the line of duty was Salem Suhail bin Khamis, on November 30, 1971, during the "battle of the Greater Tunb” against Iranian forces shortly before the UAE’s formation. Bin Khamis led a six-member police force on Greater Tunb, invaded by Iran on the eve of Federation. He refused to lower the flag of Ras Al Khaimah, and the invaders killed him for his defiance.[2]
