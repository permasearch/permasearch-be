In this configuration, the left-turn signal will display circular green from the leading protected left turn phase until the lagging permissive left turn phase, but the green arrow will only be displayed during the leading protected left-turn phase. During the lagging permissive left-turn phase, it is assumed that opposing traffic has both a permissive left turn phase and a straight-through green light. This can also be used in the opposite configuration, with leading permissive and lagging protected left-turn phases.[16]
