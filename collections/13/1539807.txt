Many hip hop artists and rappers use scat singing to come up with the rhythms of their raps.[24] Tajai of the group Souls of Mischief states the following in the book How to Rap: "Sometimes my rhythms come from scatting. I usually make a scat kind of skeleton and then fill in the words. I make a skeleton of the flow first, and then I put words into it."[24] The group Lifesavas describe a similar process.[24] Rapper Tech N9ne has been recorded demonstrating exactly how this method works, in an audio segment covered by The Washington Post.[25] Gangsta rapper Eazy-E uses it extensively in his song "Eazy Street".
