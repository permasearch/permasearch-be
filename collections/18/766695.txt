Relationship-oriented leadership is a contrasting style in which the leader is more focused on the relationships amongst the group and is generally more concerned with the overall well-being and satisfaction of group members.[89] Relationship-oriented leaders emphasize communication within the group, show trust and confidence in group members, and show appreciation for work done.
