Copenhagen cannot be labelled simply as a comedy or tragedy; the lack of a protagonist and direct conflict prevents this in large part. David Rush explores a subgenre of theatre, a later hybrid form known as "drama," which he describes as a piece which cannot be specifically categorised as a tragedy, but which he notes involves "serious people going about serious business in a serious way." As the characters in Copenhagen are already dead, they cannot suffer any tragic fall; though there is definite wit in the arguments, it is taken in a very serious light seeing as it regards subjects like war, fear and nuclear arms. It is most nearly a "drama," but works in many ways as an expository piece in the manner it presents information to the audience.
