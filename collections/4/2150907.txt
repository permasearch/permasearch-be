After Coventry, many Phish fans found themselves in a predicament similar to that Deadheads faced almost a decade previously. With no more Phish to follow around, the hundreds of thousands of Phish fans began investing time in the other top jam band acts of the day.  This gave newer bands such as STS9, Disco Biscuits, and Umphrey's McGee a greater opportunity to grow their fanbase.  These bands have steadily increased their popularity, but so far, no jam band has reached Phish's attendance levels.  It should be noted that Phish never reached the Grateful Dead's peak attendance levels, so the fragmentation of the jam band scene has been a long term trend.  Phish announced on 1 October 2008 that they would return to the stage in March 2009 at Hampton Coliseum.
