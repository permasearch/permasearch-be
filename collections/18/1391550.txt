Regarding the band's decision to release "Miss Jackson" as the lead single from their fourth studio album, Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!, vocalist and guitarist Brendon Urie stated, "Every song on the album is pretty different from one another, but there are a lot of the sounds of the other songs are kind of mixed together in ["Miss Jackson"]. There are songs that range from something personal to something fictitious to a song about where I grew up in Vegas. This really sums up the vibe of the record, of this party record that weâ€™re excited about."[8] The song impacted alternative radio on July 30, 2013,[9] and released to mainstream radio on November 11, 2013.[10]
