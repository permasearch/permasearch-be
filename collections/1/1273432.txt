A mountain resort town, Ruidoso lies in the Sierra Blanca mountain range of south-central New Mexico, where it merges with the Sacramento Mountains to the south. Ruidoso is a resort community close to the slopes of Ski Apache, the Mescalero Apache Tribe-owned ski resort on Sierra Blanca, a 12,000-foot (3,700Â m) mountain.[2] The tribe also operates the Inn of the Mountain Gods resort in the area, which includes a casino, hotel, and golf course.[3] Ruidoso is the largest community in Lincoln County, and serves as the regional economic hub.
