In Windows 98, Windows 2000 and Windows ME, Paint can save images in JPEG, GIF and PNG formats when appropriate plug-ins are installed. Such plug-ins are included with Microsoft Office and Microsoft PhotoDraw. This also allows Paint to use transparent backgrounds.[4][5] Support for PCX files was dropped.[6] Starting with Windows ME, the canvas size expands automatically when larger images are opened or pasted, instead of asking.
