Near the end of the season, Joyce dies of an aneurysm, devastating Dawn and Buffy. Glory discovers that Dawn is the Key and kidnaps her. In a moment alone, Xander proposes to Anya. Buffy and her friends track Glory and Dawn to a tower built by Glory's minions. At the time of the ritual, Glory uses Dawn's blood to open the portal between dimensions, but she is distracted by the Scoobies' intervention. Willow takes Tara's sanity from Glory and gives it back, severely weakening Glory. After overpowering Glory, Buffy tells her to leave Sunnydale or die. When Glory reverts to Ben, Giles kills Ben to prevent her return. Dawn wants to sacrifice herself to save the world, but Buffy realizes that because she is related to Dawn, her blood can also close the portal. She realizes the meaning of the First Slayer's message—"Death is your gift"—and sacrifices her own life to save Dawn's and close the portal. Buffy's friends mourn her death and praise her with the inscription "She saved the world a lot".
