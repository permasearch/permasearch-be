Melbourne began as a collection of tents and huts on the banks of the Yarra. The river was used for bathing and drinking water. The river had by the 1850s become quite polluted and was the cause of an epidemic of typhoid fever which hit the town resulting in many deaths.[20] Though the Melbourne City Council opened the first Melbourne City Baths on 9 January 1860,[21] people continued to swim and drink the river water.
