Archie continues to search for work with no luck. In desperation, he goes to meet with Mr. Lodge at his office. Mr. Lodge tells him that despite jilting his daughter, he thinks Archie is a bright fellow but that his company is not hiring. Archie tells Mr. Lodge that he didn't jilt Veronica, he chose Betty. Archie thanks Mr. Lodge for his time and goes back to his job search, but after applying for work everywhere from a recording studio to a coffee bar, he still has no success. In the midst of their wedding preparations, Betty reveals to Archie that she has received a job offer as a buyer for Saks 5th Avenue in New York City. She had applied before they became engaged because it was something she wanted to try, but plans to turn down the job in order to be a teacher and to be with Archie. He is shocked at first, but tells her that instead of putting everyone else first, she needs to follow her dreams for once, and decides they should move up their wedding day to the following weekend and then move to New York.
