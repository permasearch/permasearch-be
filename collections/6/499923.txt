In 1998, the IBGE, within its preparation for the 2000 census, experimentally introduced a question about "origem" (ancestry) in its "Pesquisa Mensal de Emprego" (Monthly Employment Research), in order to test the viability of introducing that variable in the Census.[21] This research interviewed about 90,000 people in six metropolitan regions (SÃ£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, and Recife).[21]
