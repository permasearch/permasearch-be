A total of 20 songs were composed for the film, at an average cost of ₹3,000 (valued at about US$629 in 1960)[a] per song, though many were left out of the final cut owing to the film's length.[35] Both Asif and Naushad approached Hindustani classical vocalist Bade Ghulam Ali Khan inviting him to participate in the film's soundtrack, but he refused, explaining that he disliked working in films. Asif, adamant about the presence of Khan, asked him to name his fee. Khan quoted a fee of ₹25,000 per song, at a time when Lata Mangeshkar and Mohammed Rafi (the best paid playback singers of the time) charged ₹300–400 per song, thinking that Asif would send him away. Instead, Asif agreed, and even gave Khan a 50 per cent advance.[65] Surprised and left with no excuse to turn down the offer, he finally accepted.[66] Khan sang two songs, "Prem Jogan Ban Ke" and "Shubh Din Aayo"; both were included in the final version of the film and demonstrated the artist's vocal virtuosity.[27][67]
