Christian hedonism was developed in opposition to the deontology of Immanuel Kant.[2] Kant argued that actions should be considered praiseworthy only if they do not proceed from the actor's desires or expected benefit, but rather from a sense of duty.[8][9] On the contrary, Christian hedonists advocate for a consequentialist ethic based on an understanding that their greatest possible happiness can be found in God.[2][6] In this critique of Kant, John Piper was influenced by Ayn Rand.[10]
