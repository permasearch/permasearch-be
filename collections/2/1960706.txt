Vasquez pitched Invader Zim to Nickelodeon, who desired a series for their older demographic. As the series went on, ratings declined, budgetary issues became more frequent, and the show's staff became weary of their work environment. Before the second season was completed, Nickelodeon cancelled the series, leaving several episodes unfinished. The show first ran on Nick from 2001 to 2002, with a handful of second-season episodes initially going unaired; these episodes were later seen on DVD in 2004 and Nicktoons Network in 2006.
