The role of Barney was initially envisioned as a "John Belushi-type character"[13] before Neil Patrick Harris won the role after being invited to an audition by the show's casting director Megan Branman.[14] Harris's character was widely reported to be the breakout character, with Variety calling him "the major breakout"[15] and Boston.com noting that his character was the "most buzzed about element of the show".[16] Robert Bianco from USA Today observed that Harris "sparkled" in his role, and further praised Hannigan's performance as equally "delightful" as her role in Buffy the Vampire Slayer.[17]
