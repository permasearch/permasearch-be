Kochi has a diverse, multicultural, and secular community consisting of Malayalis, Konkanis,[145][146] Gujaratis,[133] Bengalis,[147] Marathis,[148] Punjabis,[134][149] Tamilians, Kannadigas, Biharias, Anglo Indians and a few families of Jews among other denominations, all living in peaceful co-existence. The city once had a large Jewish community, known as the Malabar Yehuden—and now increasingly as Cochin Jews— who figured prominently in Kochi's business and economic strata [150] and owned several Synagogues across Kochi and nearby areas such as Chendamangalam, Paravur or Mala.
