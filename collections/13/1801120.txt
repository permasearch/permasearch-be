Indigenous students make meaning of what they learn through spirituality.[3][5] Spirituality in learning involves students making connections between morals, values and intellect rather than simply acquiring knowledge. [3] Knowledge to Indigenous people is personal and involves emotions, culture, traditional skills, nature, etc. [6] For this reason, Indigenous students need time to make connections in class, and often benefit from a safe and respectful environment that encourages discussions among students.
