He has a strong passion for sports (His favorite NFL team is the New York Giants) and knows several stats off the top of his head. He is also a fan of various bands such as Foreigner, Loverboy, Zebra[2] and Boston, with their song "More Than a Feeling" being his favorite song. Carl has a car he named "2Wycked," which is a heavily modified Dodge Stealth. 2Wycked was purchased with a home equity loan which Carl thinks is worth the risk from this faulty endeavor due to imagined increased female interest. Carl owns his own personal above ground pool in his backyard, which causes him irritation when used by his neighbors uninvited. In later seasons he owns a 21-inch plasma screen television, which appears extremely tiny when mounted to his wall. His property is frequently subject to non-canon destruction.
