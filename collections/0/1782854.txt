On 25 July 2016, FINA, following the guidelines set out by the International Olympic Committee, announced that seven swimmers declared by the Russian Olympic Committee for the Rio games were deemed ineligible â€“ four, Mikhail Dovgalyuk, Yuliya Yefimova, Nataliya Lovtsova and Anastasiya Krapyvina, because of previous doping bans, and three, Nikita Lobintsev, Vladimir Morozov and Daria Ustinova, because of being implicated in the 'disappearing positive methodology' uncovered by the McClaren report. The status of relay teams involving these ineligible swimmers remained unclear.[90] On August 4, 2016, Morozov and Lobintsev were reported to be cleared for participation by the IOC.[91] On 5 August 2016, the date of the opening ceremony, Yuliya Yefimova, Natalya Lovtsova, Daria Ustinova, Mikhail Dovgalyuk, and Anastasiya Krapyvina were cleared for participation.[46] Consequently, all of the declared Russian swimmers were allowed to participate.
