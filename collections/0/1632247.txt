The Preemption Act of 1841 was widely utilized by settlers in Kansas Territory and Nebraska Territory (which were opened to settlement in 1854). When the Homestead Act was enacted in 1862, claims under the Preemption Act sharply decreased. However, preemption was still widely utilized and more land was transferred to private ownership through preemption filings than homestead types. In fact settlers would often utilize preemption, homestead and timber culture filings to establish their land holdings. This is often overlooked when viewing the homestead era in practice.
