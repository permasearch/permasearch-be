During his time as manager at Rangers, Ally McCoist showed his players footage of a goal Hooper scored against them at Celtic Park. "He makes a run from the halfway line on the left hand side. I watched it and I showed our players it", said McCoist, adding that "he [Hooper] just has a desire to run and run and just get on the end of a cross. You can't buy that, you can't teach that".[148]
