There are some differences, however. Japanese utilizes passive grammar more frequently than Korean, and has four common verb conjugations to express "if" (〜ならば、〜ば、〜たら、〜と), while Korean has one (-면). Korean also has distinct future tenses (-ㄹ것이다,-겠다) while Japanese often relies on context rather than directly indicating the future nature of a sentence.
