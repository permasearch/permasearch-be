Although ox-carts and chariots were previously used in China, the wheelbarrow was first used in Han China in the 1st century BC.[305] Han artwork of horse-drawn chariots shows that the Warring-States-Era heavy wooden yoke placed around a horse's chest was replaced by the softer breast strap.[306] Later, during the Northern Wei (386â€“534 AD), the fully developed horse collar was invented.[306]
