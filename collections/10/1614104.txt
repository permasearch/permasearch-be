Miguel, a Mexican-American "coyote", recognizes Gillick from a chance encounter in a parking lot. He alerts his boss, and Gillick and Isabela are captured. They force Miguel to execute Gillick. Miguel hesitates and unwillingly shoots Gillick in the head and the gang leaves him for dead. Miguel is disappointed with the gang and leaves them after this incident. Graver and his team track the Mexican gang and Isabela with the help of the GPS transmitter that she was wearing and kill all the gang members. Graver takes pity on Isabela and brings her back to the United States to put her in witness protection rather than following his orders to kill her. Meanwhile, Gillick wakes up finding the bullet went through his jaw, takes one of the gang members' cars, and drives for the border. One year later, Gillick finds Miguel  and asks him if he wants to become a sicario.
