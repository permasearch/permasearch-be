In the 1999 film Meet The Parents Robert De Niro's character, Jack Byrnes plays the song in the car when driving with his daughter's boyfriend. In an attempt to make humorous chat Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) makes the point that this song is clearly about smoking pot. Jack feigns ignorance and uses this to later on implicate Greg as a dope fiend, in an attempt to get his daughter to break up with Greg. In a post credit sting, we later see Greg Focker referring to this conversation and calling doubt on Jack's ignorance of the inferred drug reference.[citation needed]
