A famous plague doctor who gave medical advice about preventive measures which could be used against the plague was Nostradamus.[20][21] Nostradamus' advice was the removal of infected corpses, getting fresh air, drinking clean water, and drinking a juice preparation of rose hips.[22][23] In Trait√© des fardemens it shows in Part A Chapter VIII that Nostradamus also recommended not to bleed the patient.[23]
