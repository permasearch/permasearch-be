For domestic purposes one can create the exact equivalent of brown sugar by mixing white sugar with molasses. Suitable proportions are about one tablespoon of molasses to each cup of sugar (one-sixteenth of the total volume). Molasses comprises 10% of brown sugar's total weight,[3] which is about one ninth of the white sugar weight. Due to varying qualities and colors of molasses products,[3] for lighter or darker sugar, reduce or increase its proportion according to taste.
