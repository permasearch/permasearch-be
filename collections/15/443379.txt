The core culture of Brazil is derived from Portuguese culture, because of its strong colonial ties with the Portuguese Empire.[397] Among other influences, the Portuguese introduced the Portuguese language, Roman Catholicism and colonial architectural styles. The culture was, however, also strongly influenced by African, indigenous and non-Portuguese European cultures and traditions.[398]
