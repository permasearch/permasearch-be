At the bottom of the furnace, there is a hopper for collection of bottom ash. This hopper is kept filled with water to quench the ash and clinkers falling down from the furnace. Arrangements are included to crush the clinkers and convey the crushed clinkers and bottom ash to a storage site. Ash extractors are used to discharge ash from municipal solid wasteâ€“fired boilers.
