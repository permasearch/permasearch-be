Players with active Xbox Live Gold memberships (excluding trial memberships and "Free Gold" weekends) may download the games during their respective availability periods. When downloaded, the game belongs to the user even if they subsequently drop their Xbox Live Gold membership. Two titles are released a month, with the exception of June 2014 (which saw a third game released alongside the second to celebrate the one year anniversary of the program), April 2015 (which saw the release of four games, two in each half) and December 2015 (which saw a third game released alongside the second). The first game is free to download from the first of the month until the fifteenth, and then the second being available to download from the sixteenth until the end of the month.
