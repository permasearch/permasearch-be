Translation:2. This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah -3. Who believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them,4. And who believe in what has been revealed to you, and what was revealed before you, and of the Hereafter they are certain.5. Those are upon guidance from their Lord, and those are the successful.
