In the season seven premiere, Morgan captures Doyle and Emily returns to the BAU to assist the team in finding who kidnapped Doyle's son.[16] The team comes under fire from the judiciary panel for their retaliatory actions to avenge Prentiss's death, but everyone stands their ground to protect the team. Section Chief Erin Strauss later reveals to them that the committee was persuaded by Prentiss' defense and eventually decided to lift the BAU's suspensions although they will still be "keeping a close eye" on the members. Reid, who is still angry over her 'death' refuses to speak to her or JJ or even look them in the eye. At the end of "Proof", Prentiss talks it through with him and they make amends.[17] In the premiere it is also revealed that Garcia has been taking care of her cat, Sergio, and when she inquires about him, Garcia jokingly states that she wants visitation rights.
