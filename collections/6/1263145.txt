Celebrity Big Brother was a condensed version of the game and would not last as long as a regular season of Big Brother, with episodes only shown over two weeks instead of three months.[17][19] Unlike the parent series Jury members were not sequestered separately and were allowed to return to the outside world as well as watch the show.[20][21] Beginning with an incident that led to a lawsuit in Big Brother 2 when HouseGuest Justin Sebik got drunk and threatened fellow HouseGuest Krista Stegall by holding a knife to her throat, there has been an alcohol restriction in the house.[22][23] The alcohol restriction was lifted for the Celebrity HouseGuests.[24][25] The space in the backyard was reduced to allow production to constantly perform construction for competitions but still allow 24/7 access for the HouseGuests.[26] For the celebrity version of America's Favorite HouseGuest, the term Favorite Celebrity HouseGuest was also being used interchangeably.[27][28] For the first time since the beginning of the U.S. series, five players were featured in the season's finale night versus the usual three.[29]
