Producer Jim Morris recommended Ben Burtt as sound designer for WALL-E because Stanton kept using R2-D2 as the benchmark for the robots.[29] Burtt had completed Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith and told his wife he would no longer work on films with robots, but found WALL-E and its substitution of voices with sound "fresh and exciting".[8] He recorded 2500 sounds for the film, which was twice the average number for a Star Wars film,[19] and a record in his career.[8] Burtt began work in 2005,[46] and experimented with filtering his voice for two years.[47] Burtt described the robot voices as "like a toddler [...] universal language of intonation. 'Oh', 'Hm?', 'Huh!', you know?"[48]
