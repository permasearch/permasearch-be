The parliamentary system in Pakistan follows the Westminster system.[2] Hence the ministers of the provinces are elected by the members of the legislature, and the majority party is invited to elect a leader, whose tenure lasts for five years. The people do not elect the head of the government, rather they elect their representatives only. In turn their representatives  select the head of the government. But once the head of the government is elected, he or she enjoys almost exclusive executive powers.
