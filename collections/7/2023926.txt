MIDI introduced capabilities that transformed the way many musicians work. MIDI sequencing made it possible for a user with no notation skills to build complex arrangements.[23] A musical act with as few as one or two members, each operating multiple MIDI-enabled devices, can deliver a performance similar to that of a larger group of musicians.[24] The expense of hiring outside musicians for a project could be reduced or eliminated,[2]:7 and complex productions could be realized on a system as small as a synthesizer with integrated keyboard and sequencer.
