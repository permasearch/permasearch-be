On June 21, 2000, the LDS Church announced that Ricks College would become a four-year institution known as Brigham Young Universityâ€“Idaho. This change became official just over a year later on August 10, 2001. Among the changes were the elimination of the intercollegiate athletic program and the institution of a larger activities and intramural athletics program. The school also established a "three-track" system, which admits students on a specific track of two semesters (including the Spring semester), rather than the standard fall and winter semesters. Among other changes to campus facilities to accommodate the associated growth, the Hyrum Manwaring Student Center was renovated and enlarged and a new auditorium building, the BYU-Idaho Center, with seating for 15,000 was built. The buildings were dedicated in December 2010.[12][13]
