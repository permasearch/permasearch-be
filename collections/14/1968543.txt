Winehouse released her debut album, Frank, on 20 October 2003. Produced mainly by Salaam Remi, many songs were influenced by jazz, and apart from two covers, every song was co-written by Winehouse. The album received positive reviews[1][2] with compliments over the "cool, critical gaze" in its lyrics[3] and brought comparisons of her voice to Sarah Vaughan,[4] Macy Gray and others.[3] The album reached number 13 on the UK Albums Chart at the time of its release, and was eventually certified triple Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).[5][6] In 2004, Winehouse was nominated for British Female Solo Artist and British Urban Act at the Brit Awards,[7] while Frank made the shortlist for the Mercury Prize.[8] That same year, the album's first single, "Stronger Than Me", earned Winehouse and Remi an Ivor Novello Award for Best Contemporary Song.[9]
