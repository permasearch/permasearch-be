The team conducted four of its spring practices at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida between February 29 and March 4, 2016, which coincided with the University's annual spring break. The final practice was held as an open practice for fans and recruits,[6] and saw an attendance of over 5,000 people. The practices were considered controversial, as coaches from the SEC and ACC protested what they believed to be an attempt to gain an upper hand in recruiting prospective athletes; however, at the time, no NCAA rules stated that the practices would not be allowed to take place.[7] Michigan also conducted several satellite camps—football camps meant to expose prospective student athletes to colleges who might otherwise not find and recruit them due to distance or other factors—in 22 states, Australia, and American Samoa following the NCAA's reversal of a ban enacted only months prior.[8]
