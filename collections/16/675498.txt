On a budget of $110 million, principal photography took place mostly on location in New York City and Washington, D.C.[17][18] from March to June 2009.[19][20][21] Noyce decided to avoid "typical post-card views of Washington DC" to reflect "the more day-to-day environment of massive federal buildings inhabited by the typical bureaucrat".[13] The opening sequence in North Korea was shot at the Floyd Bennett Field, with an extra who had experience with prisoner exchange acting as a consultant. Salt's rendezvous with Orlov was shot on the "Frying Pan", a former lighthouse ship, now moored in the Hudson River, at 26th Street in New York. The outside of the KA training facility was the Makaryev Monastery in Russia,[11] while the interior was the Russian Orthodox Cathedral of the Holy Virgin Protection in New York's East Village.[13] Filming for a chase sequence took place in Albany on Water Street near the Interstate 787 ramp between April and May.[22] Studio production took place at Grumman Studios in Bethpage, Long Island, New York.[23][24] While the film was in post-production, di Bonaventura became dissatisfied with some scenes.[25] Steven Zaillian was brought for uncredited rewrites,[26] and reshoots, mostly of action scenes, were held in New York during January 2010.[25] Filming also took place in upper Manhattan's neighborhood Washington Heights on 157th St and Riverside Dr. Some scenes were also filmed outside of Manhattan including The Bronx, Queens, Staten Island, and in Westchester County.
