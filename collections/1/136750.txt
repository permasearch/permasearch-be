More serious were a few passages which implied an author long after the time of Moses, such as Genesis 12:6, "The Canaanite was then in the land," implying a time when the Canaanites were no longer in the land.[23] Abraham ibn Ezra (c.1092-1167) made a celebrated comment on this phrase, writing that it contains "a great secret, and the person who understands it will keep quiet;"[23] the 14th century rabbi Joseph ben Samuel Bonfils responded that Moses had written this and similar passages, as he was a prophet, but that it made no difference whether they were by him or some later prophet, "since the words of all of them are true and inspired."[24]
