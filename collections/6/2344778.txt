The Colosseum at Caesars Palace is a 4,296-seat entertainment venue with a 22,450 square feet (2,086Â m2)stage, which was originally built at a cost of $95-million for Celine Dion's show, A New Day..., in 2003.[117][118] An enormous success, the Colosseum show was soon earning almost $175,000 on average per night[119] and grossed $500 million in four years.[120] The venue has since hosted performances by numerous other artists.[118] Gloria Estefan performed a special seven-day concert in October 2003 for the launch of her album Unwrapped, titled Live & Unwrapped.[117] In May 2007, Bette Midler was announced as Dion's formal replacement, performing 100 shows a year,[120] with Elton John continuing to perform his popular Red Piano show 50 nights a year while Midler was on hiatus. After taking a three-year hiatus, Cher, following her Farewell Tour, returned to Caesars Palace with a three-year contract, performing 200 shows beginning May 6, 2008.[121]
