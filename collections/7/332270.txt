Many fans of The Prisoner believe that Number Six is really John Drake, the character that McGoohan played in Danger Man (first from 1960 to 1962, then again from 1964 to 1966), but the actor always denied this. In a 1966 interview in The Los Angeles Times, with reporter Robert Musel, McGoohan stated that "John Drake of Secret Agent is gone" (Secret Agent being the name of Danger Man in the USA). Further McGoohan stated in a 1985 interview that No.6 is not the same character as John Drake, further adding that he had originally wanted another actor to portray the character.[2] However, script editor, George Markstein, who co-created the series with McGoohan, always claimed that Number Six is John Drake.
