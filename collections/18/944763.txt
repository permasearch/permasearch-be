The re-introduction of Michael's biological father, A.J. (Sean Kanan) completely turns his life upside down. Michael grows up believing the bitter battle was started by A.J. However, when A.J. tells him otherwise, Michael initially refuses to believe A.J.'s claims of being drugged in an alley by Carly, or left hanging on a meat hook by Sonny until he confronts his mother and she confirms A.J.'s stories. Michael is completely blindsided and disgusted by his mother's past actions. He never expected any of what A.J. told him to be true. Though he does not condone A.J.'s own actions – like kidnapping Michael and faking his death – Michael reminds Carly that A.J. only tried to defend himself in the war she started. Michael has mixed emotions; he does not know what to feel. Michael has so many questions running through his head, and majority of them begin with "What if?" Michael is completely torn on what to do. Is A.J. capable of change or telling the truth; would giving A.J. a chance hurt his relationships with Carly and Sonny.[63]
