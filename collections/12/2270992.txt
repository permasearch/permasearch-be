A Chinese cover of "Yellow" became the last song in the 2018 movie, Crazy Rich Asians. Warner Bros. and Coldplay were initially both opposed to using the song, but Director Jon M. Chu convinced them otherwise, adding that "a white director couldn't do it," but he could. Coldplay was convinced after Chu wrote a letter to the band: "For the first time in my life, it described the color in the most beautiful, magical ways ... The color of the stars, her skin, the love. It was an incredible image of attraction and aspiration that made me rethink my own self-image." The letter prompted a response from the band within the hour, giving Chu the go-ahead to use the song.[43]
