The song eventually reached number fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100 thanks to promotion of the song by the Blue Belles, who made their first television appearance on American Bandstand in mid-1962. It is unknown as to whether Robinson erased the original lead vocal from the song and added in Patti LaBelle's lead vocal, or whether the Starlets themselves were replaced by session singers. Nevertheless, the Starlets' manager sued Robinson for ownership of the song, with the girls each winning $5,000 from the suit.[1] Despite this, however, it is still not clear as to how the song was released.
