Despite the end of the war, Price and Yuri continue their hunt for Makarov, finally tracking him down to a hotel in Dubai in January 2017. With Nikolai's help, the pair assault the hotel armed with heavy equipment in an attempt to avenge Soap. After being forced to abandon an injured Yuri, Price prevents Makarov from escaping by crashing his helicopter into the hotel's atrium. Makarov prepares to execute Price with a Desert Eagle, but Yuri intervenes, which sees him killed by Makarov. Enraged, Price ties a steel cable around Makarov's neck and breaks the glass roof of the hotel, hanging and killing the ruthless terrorist. As the police begin to arrive at the hotel, a victorious Price smokes a cigar.
