Various races made their homes underneath the Misty Mountains. The Dwarf realm of Moria flourished from the First Age well into the Third. In the early Second Age, escapees from the War of Wrath established subterranean lairs: Orcs (e.g. at Goblin-town, Gundabad) and (as far as is known) one Balrog (under Moria). The Balrog was destroyed by Gandalf the Grey in T.A.Â 3019.
