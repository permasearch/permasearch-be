In the 1950s and 1960s Europe saw the emergence of two different projects, the European Free Trade Association, led by the UK, and the much more political European Economic Community, led by France and Germany. It has been claimed that a similar division to this persists today: On the one hand, there are those European countries, some inside and some outside of the EU, who see Europe largely as a free trade zone, and are reluctant to further integrate politically. On the other hand, there is the Eurozone, a group of countries which are committed to a common political unity.[5]
