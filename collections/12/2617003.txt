Dual-layer recording (sometimes also known as double-layer recording) allows DVD-R and DVD+R discs to store significantly more dataâ€”up to 8.5 gigabytes per disc, compared with 4.7 gigabytes for single-layer discs.[28]  Along with this, DVD-DLs have slower write speeds as compared to ordinary DVDs. When played, a slight transition can sometimes be seen in the playback when the player changes layers. DVD-R DL was developed for the DVD Forum by Pioneer Corporation; DVD+R DL was developed for the DVD+RW Alliance by Mitsubishi Kagaku Media (MKM) and Philips.[29]
