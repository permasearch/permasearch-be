Rock Around the Clock was never released officially on VHS or laserdisc in North America. On January 23, 2007, Sony Pictures (current owners of the Columbia catalog) released the first Region 1 DVD edition of the film alongside Don't Knock the Rock. The film was not, however, released in its original aspect ratio, and was instead cropped for widescreen.[2]
