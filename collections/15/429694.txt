Paul Tamburro of Game Revolution gave it 3.5 out of 5 stars, stating "Ultimately, South Park: The Fractured But Whole is still a polished RPG that die-hard fans of the animated series will love. However, while its combat system has been greatly improved, its failure to provide the same belly laughs as The Stick of Truth, the lack of variety in its locations and its mundane puzzle-solving make for a disappointing follow-up. I enjoyed my time with The Fractured But Whole, and it's clear that a great deal of effort went into its development, but after this I'm not so sure that I'd want to revisit South Park a third time."[24]
