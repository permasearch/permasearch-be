Chelsea is a character in Friday the 13th (2009), played by Willa Ford. She joins Trent and the others for a fun filled weekend at Trent's parent's summer home on Crystal Lake. After passing the time playing some games and drinking, she along with Nolan decide to go down to the lake and do some wakeboarding. As Nolan drives the boat, a topless Chelsea loses her balance while performing a jump and falls into the lake. As Nolan turns the boat around to go and pick her up, he is suddenly shot in the head with an arrow, causing his body to fall forward onto the throttle, increasing the boats speed. Chelsea (who is oblivious to what just happened), watches as the boat comes towards her, realizing too late as the boat runs over her, Chelsea suffering a head injury. As she comes to, a panic stricken Chelsea calls out to Nolan, scanning the lake for any sign of him or the boat. Suddenly her eyes find Jason standing in the woods on the banks of the lake, watching her. A terrified Chelsea begins to swim away from him towards shore, screaming out for help as she goes. She finally emerges from under the water, finding herself under the dock at the shoreline but before she can get out, Jason appears and walks out onto the dock. Chelsea half submerges herself in the water to keep Jason from hearing her, and it appears to work as Jason is shown walking off the dock and out of Chelsea's sight. She starts to relax when suddenly a machete bursts through the dock and directly into the top of Chelsea's head. Her body is lifted slightly out of the water as Jason pulls out his machete, and Chelsea's body falling back into the water. Her body is never shown after.
