A popular method of qualitative research is the case study (e.g., Stake, 1995) [5] or (Yin, 1989)[6] which examines in depth "purposive samples" to better understand a phenomenon (e.g., support to families; Racino, 1999);[7] hence, smaller but focused samples are more often used than large samples which may also be conducted by the same or related researchers or research centers (e.g., Braddock, et al., 1995).[8]
