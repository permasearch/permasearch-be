Generally, the composition matrix is degenerate: That is to say, not all of its rows will be linearly independent. In other words, the rank (JR) of the composition matrix is generally less than its number of columns (J). By the rank-nullity theorem, the null space of aij will have J-JR dimensions and this number is called the nullity (JN) of aij. The problem of balancing a chemical equation then becomes the problem of determining the JN-dimensional null space of the composition matrix. It is important to note that only for JN=1, will there be a unique solution. For JN>1 there will be an infinite number of solutions to the balancing problem, but only JN of them will be independent: If JN independent solutions to the balancing problem can be found, then any other solution will be a linear combination of these solutions. If JN=0, there will be no solution to the balancing problem.
