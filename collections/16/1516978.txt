In "Fairy Old Parent", Poof is assigned to his very first person as a fairy godparent as his own, for miserable old people; such as Mrs. Crocker. He grants her wishes but became overworked and exhausted, returning to Cosmo and Wanda via Timmy's plan. At the end of "School of Crock", he is heard speaking fluent English, which further develops and strengthens his innate fairy magic to slightly higher power-levels. Since his first appearance, he inherent magical abilities are tied to his feelings and emotions. When happy, good things happen, but when he cries, bad things happen. He is shaped like an orb and wears a light purple jumpsuit. He also uses a toy rattle (which babies do) the way other fairies use magic wands.
