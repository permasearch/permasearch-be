Portal 2's lead writer Erik Wolpaw estimates each campaign to be about six hours long.[3] Portal 2 contains in-game commentary from the game developers, writers, and artists. The commentary, accessible after completing the game once, appears on node icons scattered through the chambers.[19] According to Valve, each of the single-player and cooperative campaigns is 2 to 2.5 times as long as the campaign in Portal, with the overall game five times as long.[5][7][20]
