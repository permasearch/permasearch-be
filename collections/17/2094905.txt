Hitler and the NSDAP understood the power of emblems and insignia to influence public opinion.[354] The stylized lightning bolt logo of the SS was chosen in 1932. The logo is a pair of runes from a set of 18 Armanen runes created by Guido von List in 1906. It is similar to the ancient Sowil≈ç rune, which symbolizes the sun, but was renamed as "Sig" (victory) in List's iconography.[354] The Totenkopf symbolized the wearer's willingness to fight unto the death, and also served to frighten the enemy.[355]
