The monument was created on December 5, 2008, through an executive order issued by President George W. Bush under the authority of the Antiquities Act of 1906. The proclamation date was selected in anticipation of the 67th anniversary of the Attack on Pearl Harbor, on December 7, 2008. This is the first proclamation of a national monument in Alaska since passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) in 1980.[2]
