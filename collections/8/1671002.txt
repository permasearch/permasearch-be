In Japanese writing about the surrender, many accounts consider the Soviet entry into the war as the primary reason or as having equal importance with the atomic bombs,[181] while others, such as the work of Sadao Asada, give primacy to the atomic bombings, particularly their impact on the emperor.[182] The primacy of the Soviet entry as a reason for surrender is a long-standing view among some Japanese historians, and has appeared in some Japanese junior high school textbooks.[182] Notably however, the Soviet Navy was well regarded as chronically lacking the naval capability to invade the home islands of Japan, despite having received numerous ships under loan from the US.
