Symbiotic animals of the genus Symbion, the only member of the phylum Cycliophora, live exclusively on lobster gills and mouthparts.[25] Different species of Symbion have been found on the three commercially important lobsters of the North Atlantic Ocean â€“ Nephrops norvegicus, Homarus gammarus, and Homarus americanus.[25]
