Carl has a cousin named Terry, an illegal plastic surgeon who is an ex-con and is in the Mafia, who he occasionally gambles with.[7][8] Carl also has a second-cousin named Denese, who once gave a handjob to Meat Loaf, and is now a single mother with whom Carl often berates out of misguided affection.[9] In the episode "Mail Order Bride," he and Master Shake were both briefly married to a mail-order bride from Chechnya named Svetlana, who quickly runs off after the marriage.[10] In "Big Bro," he accidentally impregnates a woman named Darlene, and later fakes his own death to avoid responsibility while leaving Frylock to raise his illegitimate son (who is never been seen or mentioned again in later episodes).[11]
