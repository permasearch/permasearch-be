Air is pumped through the CO2 absorber as the first step of this process.[46][47] CO2 absorber for DAC are designed either as a counter-current spray tower or as a counter-current thin-falling-film contractor to maximize the contact area between the air and the solvent and thus maximize the absorption driving force.[46][47] The solvent is regenerated in the causticization unit by reacting the Na2CO3 with Ca(OH)2, which also transfers the captured CO2 to the form of CaCO3 solid crystals.[46] A mechanical filter is then used to separate the CaCO3 crystals form the water.[46] Since the crystals come out wet from the filter, they are dried in a steam dryer.[46] Then the dry crystals are heated in a furnace to produce CaO and pure CO2 gas.[46] The CaO is then hydrated to regenerate the Ca(OH)2 used for the causticization reaction.[46] The pure CO2 stream is then compressed and ready to be transported for geologic sequestration, EOR, or other commercial applications.
