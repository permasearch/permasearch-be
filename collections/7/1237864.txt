Dr. Jumba Jookiba (/ˌdʒʌmbə dʒuːˈkibə/ JUM-bə joo-KEE-bə) is the creator of Stitch and his "cousins." He is an overweight, mostly purple-skinned alien from the planet Kweltikwan/Quelte Quan speaking in a vaguely Russian accent, with dark pink skin on his front torso and armpits, a huge and mostly bald ovalish head with three black hairs, a wide mouth, a little nose and four yellow eyes. He has been called an "idiot scientist", but he prefers to be known as an evil genius and is in fact surprisingly sociable and friendly outside of his work. He was voiced by veteran character actor David Ogden Stiers in the films, Lilo & Stitch: The Series, Disney's Stitch: Experiment 626, and Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, while The Series executive producer and screenwriter Jess Winfield voices him in the Stitch! anime and Stitch & Ai.
