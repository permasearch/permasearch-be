The Third Saturday in October is the name given to Alabama's annual game against the University of Tennessee Volunteers. Through the 2017 season, Saban has compiled an overall record of eleven wins and zero losses (11–0) against the Volunteers.[99] In the period between the 1995 and 2006 seasons prior to the arrival of Saban, the Volunteers were 10–2 against the Crimson Tide.[100] Since Saban has been Alabama's head coach, they have outscored Tennessee 396 to 126 in their eleven victories (average score 36 to 11).[100] The only games that the Crimson Tide did not win by at least two touchdowns came in the 2009 game when Terrence Cody blocked a field goal as time expired and preserved the 12–10 Alabama victory and in 2015 when the tide won 19-14 due to a game clinching fumble recovered by A'shawn Robinson. 2016 and 2017 saw blowout wins of 49-10 and 45-7 for the Tide over the Volunteers. At the conclusion of the 2017 season, Alabama defensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt was hired as the Tennessee head coach.[49][100]
