To demonstrate the flaws of the common belief that the message resides in how the medium is used (the content), McLuhan uses the example of mechanization, pointing out that regardless of the  product (e.g.. cornflakes or Cadillacs), the impact on workers and society is the same.[2] In a further exemplification of the common unawareness of the real meaning of media, McLuhan says that people "describe the scratch but not the itch."[4] As an example of "media experts" who follow this fundamentally flawed approach, McLuhan quotes a statement from "General" David Sarnoff (head of RCA), calling it the "voice of the current somnambulism."[5] Each medium "adds itself on to what we already are", realizing "amputations and extensions" to our senses and bodies, shaping them in a new technical form. As appealing as this remaking of ourselves may seem, it really puts us in a "narcissistic hypnosis" that prevents us from seeing the real nature of the media.[5]
