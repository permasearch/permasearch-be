Robert "Bobby" James Ewing[1][2] is a fictional character in the long-running soap opera, Dallas and its 2012 revival. The youngest son of Jock and Miss Ellie Ewing, he was portrayed by actor Patrick Duffy between 1978 and 1985, and again from 1986 to 1991. Bobby had been killed off in the final episode of the 1984–1985 season, and Patrick Duffy left the show for a year. Bobby returned to the show in the famous "shower scene" right at the end of the 1985–1986 season. The subsequent "dream revelation" at the start of the 1986–1987 season, wrote off Bobby's accident, his death and all but the final scene of the 1985–1986 season, as a dream of Bobby's fiancée and ex-wife, Pamela Barnes Ewing (Victoria Principal).
