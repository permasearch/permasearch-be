In the 1960s, larger sections of swamps and bogs in Western Russia were drained for agricultural and mining purposes.[34] Plans are underway to increase peat output and increase peat's contribution to Russian energy generation.[35] There is concern about the environmental impact as peat fields are flammable, drainage degrades ecosystems, and burning of peat releases carbon dioxide.[35] Due to 2010 forest and peat fires, the Russian government is under heavy pressure to finance re-flooding of the previously drained bogs around Moscow. The initial costs for the programme are estimated to be about 20 to 25 billion rubles; that is close to 500 million euros (540 million USD).
