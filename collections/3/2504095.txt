According to human-rights groups, the two-week rule may pressure workers to remain with abusive employers.[63][74] In 2005, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights urged the government to "review the existing 'two-week rule'Â ... and to improv[e] the legal protection and benefits for foreign domestic workers so that they are in line with those afforded to local workers, particularly with regard to wages and retirement benefits."[75] The following year, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women called on the government to "repeal the 'two-week rule' and to implement a more flexible policy regarding foreign domestic workers. It also calls upon the state party to strengthen its control of employment agencies and to provide migrant workers with easily accessible avenues of redress against abuse by employers and permit them to stay in the country while seeking redress."[76] The two-week and live-in rules were criticised by the United Nations Human Rights Committee in 2013.[64]
