This Markov chain is irreducible, because the ghosts can fly from every state to every state in a finite amount of time. Due to the secret passageway, the Markov chain is also aperiodic, because the monsters can move from any state to any state both in an even and in an uneven number of state transitions. Therefore, a unique stationary distribution exists and can be found by solving π Q = 0 subject to the constraint that elements must sum to 1. The solution of this linear equation subject to the constraint is     π = ( 7.7 , 15.4 , 7.7 , 11.5 , 15.4 , 11.5 , 7.7 , 15.4 , 7.7 )   {\displaystyle \pi =(7.7,15.4,7.7,11.5,15.4,11.5,7.7,15.4,7.7)}  %. The central state and the border states 2 and 8 of the adjacent secret passageway are visited most and the corner states are visited least.
