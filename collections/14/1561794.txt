Kristian finds his son's backpack in the lobby, and feeling hopeless that they are still alive, he furiously bangs some exposed pipes with a metal rod, but the noises are heard by Idun and Sondre, in which they respond. It tracks Kristian to the bomb shelter, but as he dives, further damage occurs to the ruins, causing water to flood where they are taking refuge. He removes the heavy debris and reunites with Idun, but as he returns with Sondre, he accidentally inhales water. Idun heads back for him, in a desperate attempt to revive him. While it seems Kristian has drowned and Idun accepts his death, Sondre does one last frantic effort at revival, which pays off. The family is reunited at Ã˜rnesvingen, and the film closes with a title card saying the events are accurate to occur in the future, but the exact date is still a mystery.
