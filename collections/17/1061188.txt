There seemed to be no mention of his office address in the Season Six shows, however in episode "Bonus Baby" when a police officer inspects Bailey's Private Investigator License, a close-up shows "77 Sunset Strip". Perhaps that brief shot was supposed to explain the show's title, but surely it confused viewers. The P.I. License shows his business as "Bailey Investigations", and his name as "S. Bailey", though a real license would state the person's full name.
