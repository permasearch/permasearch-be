Dead ends are created in urban planning to limit through-traffic in residential areas. While some dead ends provide no possible passage except in and out of their road entry, others allow cyclists, pedestrians or other non-automotive traffic to pass through connecting easements or paths, an example of filtered permeability. Its application retains the dead end's primary function as a non-through road, but establishes complete pedestrian and bicycle network connectivity.
