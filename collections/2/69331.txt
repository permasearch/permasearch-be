The big-budget, Jon Small-directed video was filmed over 3 days in mid-1993. It begins with Reba in her dressing room wearing a lilac feather gown, where she sees a picture of her lover, which she glances at. It then shows Linda as a professional actress at a movie premiere, then cuts back to Reba smashing the picture with a metal object. Reba shows up in a limo with the same man. The two women are seen then in a photo shoot with Linda holding an award and the man in the background. The picture is taken, but it shows Reba losing focus for some reason.
