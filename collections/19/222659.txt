Lime pickles are soaked in pickling lime (not to be confused with the citrus fruit) rather than in a salt brine.[11] This is done more to enhance texture (by making them crisper) rather than as a preservative. The lime is then rinsed off the pickles. Vinegar and sugar are often added after the 24-hour soak in lime, along with pickling spices.
