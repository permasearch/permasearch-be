After the 1998 embassy bombings in Kenya, the U.S. Justice Department struggled with how to prosecute terrorism in American courts. Osama bin Laden had acted as a mentor and financier for terrorist acts, and these were independently planned and proposed by a loose association of like-minded thinkers who considered the United States to be a common enemy; however, bin Laden was not within U.S. Jurisdiction when he had provided support for others to commit the bombings, so he had not broken any obvious American law at the time. In order to obtain an indictment, which was necessary both to seek extradition and to pursue assets, prosecutors invoked the RICO statute under seal, so that bin Laden was part of a legally-definable 'organization' subject to American law.[25]
