Regnier de Graaf, in 1672, observed that the secretions (female ejaculation) by the erogenous zone in the vagina lubricate "in agreeable fashion during coitus". Modern scientific hypotheses linking G-spot sensitivity with female ejaculation led to the idea that non-urine female ejaculate may originate from the Skene's gland, with the Skene's gland and male prostate acting similarly in terms of prostate-specific antigen and prostate-specific acid phosphatase studies,[4][32] which led to a trend of calling the Skene's glands the female prostate.[32] Additionally, the enzyme PDE5 (involved with erectile dysfunction) has additionally been associated with the G-spot area.[33] Because of these factors, it has been argued that the G-spot is a system of glands and ducts located within the anterior (front) wall of the vagina.[13] A similar approach has linked the G-spot with the urethral sponge.[34][35]
