Sketches from Monty Python's Flying Circus were introduced to American audiences in August 1972, with the release of the Python film And Now for Something Completely Different, featuring sketches from series 1 and 2 of the television show. This 1972 release met limited box office success. Sketches like "Bicycle Repairman" and "The Dull Life of a Stockbroker" aired in the summer of 1972 on Comedyworld, a summer replacement series for NBC's The Dean Martin Show.
