Early Christian writers such as Clement of Alexandria and Firmicus denigrated Athena as representative of all the things that were detestable about paganism;[138] they condemned her as "immodest and immoral".[139] During the Middle Ages, however, many attributes of Athena were given to the Virgin Mary,[139] who, in fourth century portrayals, was often depicted wearing the Gorgoneion.[139] Some even viewed the Virgin Mary as a warrior maiden, much like Athena Parthenos;[139] one anecdote tells that the Virgin Mary once appeared upon the walls of Constantinople when it was under siege by the Avars, clutching a spear and urging the people to fight.[140] During the Middle Ages, Athena became widely used as a Christian symbol and allegory, and she appeared on the family crests of certain noble houses.[141]
