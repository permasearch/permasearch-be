On June 25, 2009, Carter was traded, along with Ryan Anderson, to the Orlando Magic in exchange for Rafer Alston, Tony Battie and Courtney Lee.[72] Orlando hoped Carter would provide center Dwight Howard with a perimeter scorer who can create his own shot—something the Magic lacked in losing the NBA Finals to the Los Angeles Lakers.[73] On February 8, 2010, he had a season-high 48 points, 34 in the second half, when the Magic rallied from a 17-point deficit to defeat the New Orleans Hornets 123–117.[74] Carter helped the Magic reach the Eastern Conference Finals, where they were defeated 4–2 by the Boston Celtics. It marked his first and so far only Conference Finals series.
