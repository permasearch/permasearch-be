Events were staged separately in several sports, including the Liberty Bell Classic for track and field[26] and the USGF International Invitational for gymnastics. At the U.S. Swimming Nationals, the split and finishing times from the corresponding Olympic events the previous week were displayed on the scoreboards so that a virtual comparison of medals "won" by U.S. swimmers could be kept.[27]
