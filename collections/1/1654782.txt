The libraryâ€™s archives also house many Stevens family documents and artifacts from early American and New Jersey history from as early as the American Revolutionary War.[40] The Archives and Special Collections department aims to engage student, faculty, staff, alumni and the local and global community with primary sources and artifacts.  The Hoboken Historical Museum hosted a six-month exhibition on the Stevens Family and their contributions to American life and featured many of the Library's contents.[41] In early 2015, the Stevens Class of 1960 produced a documentary entitled "Stevens and Sons: America's First Family of Engineers" narrated by Richard Reeves highlighting the family's contributions.
