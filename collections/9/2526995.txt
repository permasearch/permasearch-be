In July 2009, Siemens settled allegations of fraud by a Russian affiliate in a World Bank-funded mass transit project in Moscow by agreeing to not bid on World Bank projects for two years, not allowing the Russian affiliate to do any World Bank funded work for four years, and setting up a $100 million fund at the World Bank to fund anti-corruption activities over 15 years, over which the World Bank had veto and audit rights; this fund became the "“Siemens Integrity Initiative”.[72][73] The first payments were made out of the funds in 2010 in a tranche of $40 million.[74] A second set of projects was funded in 2014 totaling $30 million.[75]
