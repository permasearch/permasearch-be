Rodgers quickly proved that he was one of the best quarterbacks in the league by passing for over 4,000 yards in his first season as a starter as well as throwing for 28 touchdowns and only 13 interceptions (currently his career high). With Rodgers making his debut as a starter, the Packers beat the Minnesota Vikings 24â€“19 at Lambeau Field. This marked the first time since 1992 that a quarterback other than Favre started a regular-season game for the Packers. Rodgers ended the game with 178 yards passing and two touchdowns (one passing and one rushing).[54] In just his second NFL start the following week, Rodgers was voted the FedEx Air award winner after passing for 328 yards and three touchdowns in a win against the Detroit Lions.[55]
