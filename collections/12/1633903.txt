The computational complexity of DFS was investigated by John Reif. More precisely, given a graph     G   {\displaystyle G}  , let     O = (  v  1   , â€¦ ,  v  n   )   {\displaystyle O=(v_{1},\dots ,v_{n})}   be the ordering computed by the standard recursive DFS algorithm. This ordering is called the lexicographic depth-first search ordering. John Reif considered the complexity of computing the lexicographic depth-first search ordering, given a graph and a source. A decision version of the problem (testing whether some vertex u occurs before some vertex v in this order) is P-complete,[9] meaning that it is "a nightmare for parallel processing".[10]:189
