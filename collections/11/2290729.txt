G.I. Joe: The Movie is a 1987 animated feature film. It was released on home video on April 20, 1987, and later aired in syndication, both as a full-length film and as a series of five episodes. With detailed visuals in Toei Animation's typical animated feature film styling, the film has a decidedly darker tone than the television series. The plot revolves around the introduction of Cobra-La, and their plans to steal a device allowing them to transform all human life into serpent creatures. The film also reveals Cobra Commander's cartoon origin, and features the animated debuts of several members of the G.I. Joe Team, most notably Chuckles, Falcon, Law & Order, Jinx, Tunnel Rat and Mercer.
