Bret's exit: The next morning when both teams were prepping for dinner service, Bret took a bathroom break, during which he aggravated an existing slipped disc (though this could have happened in the reward as he fell on his back.) He was escorted to the dorm by his teammates to rest, but when Ramsay found out about the injury he went up to the dorms, making it the second time this season Ramsay went up to the dorms, and told him he could not continue in the competition as it could lead to permanent back injuries and therefore eliminated a teary-eyed Bret from Hell's Kitchen, but he told him to stay strong and get better. While not explicitly mentioned, Ramsay did not take Bret's jacket[citation needed].
