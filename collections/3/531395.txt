During the White House's 1902 renovation, the pantry received a mezzanine to increase its utility.[83] To the Family Dining Room were added a vaulted ceiling, faux paneling, and a frieze featuring Neoclassical designs.[83] The frieze was broken by the high windows in the north wall, but the windows were lowered in 1961 and the frieze allowed to continue unbroken around the entire room.[84] The faux paneling was also removed at this time,[84] and the walls painted yellow.[85] The Family Dining Room underwent its first significant renovation since the Kennedy years in 2015. First Lady Michelle Obama had the room painted a light grey, and the decor, furniture, rug, and artwork now reflect a Mid-20th Century Modern look.[86]
