Dahl introduced most of his own stories himself, giving short monologues explaining what inspired him to write them. Unlike other horror anthologies such as The Twilight Zone, Tales of the Unexpected features no supernatural, science fiction or fantasy elements and instead takes place in entirely realistic settings (With the exceptions of the season one episode "William and Mary" and the season four episode "The Sound Machine")
