When Sabrina has Harvey write a Basketball article for the school newspaper, she starts to feel left out when he asks Brad to help him with it. To make matters worse, she can't share her problems with Valerie since she rarely calls anymore. Sabrina then starts to percolate with jealousy since Harvey is spending a lot of time hanging out with Brad and Dreama isn't around to spend time with her. As a result, Sabrina develops jealitosis, a condition that causes jealousy to get out of control. Sabrina then ignores her aunt's warnings to be happy for the people she's jealous of and ultimately ends up in the "Jealous Sea" where Salem helps her realize that while she can be happy for other people, it won't diminish what she has. While Sabrina is dealing with her jealousy, Mr. Kraft becomes more irritable than usual when he finds out his brother Wally is coming to visit him.
