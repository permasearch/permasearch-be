The 104th Grey Cup (branded as the 104th Grey Cup presented by Shaw for sponsorship reasons)[2] was a Canadian football game that was played on November 27, 2016, between the Calgary Stampeders and the Ottawa Redblacks, that decided the champion for the 2016 CFL season. In an upset, Ottawa defeated the heavily favoured Stampeders 39â€“33 in overtime to win a championship in just their third season of existence. This was the third Grey Cup game to go into overtime (the other two instances came in 1961 and 2005). This also marked a first that a CFL team won its division with a losing record (8-9-1) and became the 3rd worst team (behind the 2000 BC Lions and 2001 Calgary Stampeders who both went 8-10) to win the Grey Cup.
