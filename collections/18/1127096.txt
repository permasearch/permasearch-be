Notre Dame began as a primary and secondary school, but soon received its official college charter from the Indiana General Assembly on January 15, 1844.[23] Under the charter the school is officially named the University of Notre Dame du Lac (University of Our Lady of the Lake).[24] Because the university was originally only for male students, the female-only Saint Mary's College was founded by the Sisters of the Holy Cross near Notre Dame in 1844.[25]
