Many modern-day Chinese Filipinos, mostly Hoklo, have last names with one syllable like Lim, Cheng, Lao, Ang, Lo, Chua, Ong, Chiu, Yan, Uy, Ching, Sin, Go, Tan, Yap, Cu, Ke, Wu, So, Yu, Dy, Khu and Sy. However, early Chinese Filipino families took on the complete name of their patriarch, thus their names had three syllables. These were adopted into the mainstream Filipino surnames and do not exist anywhere else in the world. Their names were transcribed using the Spanish orthography in effect during the 19th century.[4]
