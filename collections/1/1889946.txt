Physiographically, Eurasia is a single continent.[5] The concepts of Europe and Asia as distinct continents date back to antiquity and their borders are geologically arbitrary. In ancient times the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara, along with their associated straits, were seen as separating the continents, but today the Ural and Caucasus ranges are more seen as the main delimiters between the two. Eurasia is connected to Africa at the Suez Canal, and Eurasia is sometimes combined with Africa to make the largest contiguous landmass on Earth called Afro-Eurasia.[9] Due to the vast landmass and differences in latitude, Eurasia exhibits all types of climate under the KÃ¶ppen classification, including the harshest types of hot and cold temperatures, high and low precipitation and various types of ecosystems.
