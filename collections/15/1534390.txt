Shaun Hastings (voiced by and modelled on Danny Wallace)[32] (b. 1985) is a cynical, condescending and pessimistic member of the Assassin's team, specializing in research and information handling. Through conversations in Assassin's Creed II, Desmond learns that Shaun was interested in conspiracies from an early age, and developed a love of history. Though he was unaware of the existence of modern-day Templars and Assassins, he realized that there was some power-struggle going on. Shaun attempted to tell others about his findings, not realizing that the Templars would try to silence him. Fortunately, Rebecca Crane apparently "rescued" Shaun and recruited him into the Order. This is mentioned as being unconventional, as most Assassins were usually born into the Order, not recruited. In 2013, Shaun infiltrated Abstergo by working as a coffee vendor at their Entertainment subsidiary in Montreal, in order to find out what happened to Desmond's body. A year later, under the alias "Deacon", Shaun and Bishop enlisted the help of a Helix player in order to locate the remains of a Sage during the French Revolution.
