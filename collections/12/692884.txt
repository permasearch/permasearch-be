Alexis Michelle was declared safe from the bottom two, while Nina Bo'Nina Brown and Valentina lip-synced against each other to Ariana Grande's "Greedy".[21] However, the lip-sync was stopped by RuPaul because Valentina had a veil (which was part of her runway look) covering her mouth, effectively hindering the lip-sync performance; she subsequently removed it per request by RuPaul. Later, it became clear that Valentina did not know the words to the lip-sync, which (in addition to their performances) made Nina Bo'Nina Brown the winner of the lip-sync, while Valentina was sashayed away by RuPaul.[21]
