MacGowan described "Lullaby of London" as being about a man who comes home at night drunk and proceeds to start telling his young son, who is in bed, about how everything is going to be fine and to go to sleep, while privately the man is worried and hoping that the child will not have to go through the same hardships that he did while growing up.[6] "Sit Down by the Fire" is about "the old ghost stories people used to tell you in Ireland before you went to bed. They used to tell you some horrific stories to prepare you for the horrors of the world ahead."[6] "The Broad Majestic Shannon" is named after the longest river in Ireland and, according to MacGowan, is a song about an Irishman returning to his home town in County Tipperary after many years of living in London, and finding that everything about the place he grew up in has changed or disappeared. MacGowan revealed that he had written the song with former Clancy Brothers members Liam Clancy and Tommy Makem in mind, in the hope that they would record a version of it.[4][7]
