Academic opinion on Kruger is divided.[16] To admirers he was an astute reader of people, events and law who faithfully defended a maligned nation and became a tragic folk hero;[16] to critics he was "an anachronistic throwback", the stubborn, slippery guardian of an unjust cause and an oppressor of black Africans.[16] "More nonsense has been written about him than anybody I know of", writes Meintjes, in whose view the true figure has been obscured by conflicting attempts to sabotage or whitewash his imageâ€”"a veritable bog of hostility and sentiment, prejudice and deification",[241] depicting Kruger as anything "from saint to stuffy mendacious savage".[242] Rights and wrongs aside, Meintjes asserts, Kruger is the central figure of Boer history and one of the "most extraordinary" of South Africans.[241]
