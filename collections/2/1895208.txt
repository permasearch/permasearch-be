Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... has since been ranked by critics and publications as one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time.[25][26] The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004) called it essential listening for anyone interested in the Wu-Tang Clan,[20] while Steve Huey from AllMusic said Raekwon is "arguably the Wu's best storyteller," crediting him for "translating epic themes and narratives of a mafia movie into a startlingly accomplished hip-hop album". Huey argued the record was possibly the "best Wu-Tang solo album", along with GZA's Liquid Swords, and wrote that like that album, "Only Built 4 Cuban Linx takes a few listens to reveal the full scope of its lyrical complexities, but it's immensely rewarding in the end."[12]
