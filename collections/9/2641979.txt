Orange County is working toward water independence by building the world's largest indirect potable water recycling project - the Groundwater Replenishment System. Poseidon Water is also developing a seawater desalination plant in Huntington Beach for Orange County and has already built and is operating a seawater desalination plant in Carlsbad for San Diego County. Combined the two plants will provide 100 million gallons of drinking water per day, or enough water for about 800,000 people.
