Estimating that the Russians were "finished," the Germans began another southern operation in the autumn of 1942, the Battle of Stalingrad.[83] Hitler insisted upon splitting German southern forces in a simultaneous siege of Stalingrad and an offensive against Baku on the Caspian Sea.[85] Stalin directed his generals to spare no effort to defend Stalingrad.[86] Although the Soviets suffered in excess of more than 2 million casualties at Stalingrad,[87] their victory over German forces, including the encirclement of 290,000 Axis troops, marked a turning point in the war.[88]
