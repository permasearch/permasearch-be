Like their spines, cactus flowers are variable. Typically, the ovary is surrounded by material derived from stem or receptacle tissue, forming a structure called a pericarpel. Tissue derived from the petals and sepals continues the pericarpel, forming a composite tubeâ€”the whole may be called a floral tube, although strictly speaking only the part furthest from the base is floral in origin. The outside of the tubular structure often has areoles that produce wool and spines. Typically, the tube also has small scale-like bracts, which gradually change into sepal-like and then petal-like structures, so the sepals and petals cannot be clearly differentiated (and hence are often called "tepals").[10] Some cacti produce floral tubes without wool or spines (e.g. Gymnocalycium)[16] or completely devoid of any external structures (e.g. Mammillaria).[10] Unlike the flowers of other cacti, Pereskia flowers may be borne in clusters.[11]
