A typical HDD design consists of a spindle that holds flat circular disks, also called platters, which hold the recorded data. The platters are made from a non-magnetic material, usually aluminum alloy, glass, or ceramic, and are coated with a shallow layer of magnetic material typically 10–20 nm in depth, with an outer layer of carbon for protection.[35][36][37] For reference, a standard piece of copy paper is 0.07–0.18 millimeters (70,000–180,000 nm).[38]
