With Mario excluded as the main playable character, Luigi fills in the role and gameplay is similar to that of New Super Mario Bros U, with all levels in the game redesigned specifically for Luigi's abilities and play style, including his higher jumping ability, floatier physics and less precise handling, which is described as shorter but harder. The combination of more challenging levels and a higher jumping, less frictional Luigi mirrors the relationship of the Japanese Super Mario Bros. 2 to Super Mario Bros.[3] Another change is to Nabbit (previously an enemy from New Super Mario Bros. U), who physically replaces Mario as a playable character while also becoming mostly an ally; however, the game still retains the feature from New Super Mario Bros. U of Nabbit being chased, making him a partial antagonist again. This can only occur if Nabbit is not selected as a player. When chosen as an actual player, he is immune to enemy damage, and while he cannot use power-ups himself (with the exception of the Super Star), any he does collect are converted into 1-Ups at the end of the stage.
