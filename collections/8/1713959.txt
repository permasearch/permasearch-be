For the first time, the 2018 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament will seed the top 16 teams, rather than only the top 8 teams as has been the practice since 1999. This will ensure that the regional featuring the top-seeded team will be paired with the regional hosted by the 16th-seeded team, where in the past Super Regionals were paired generally along geographical lines.[5]
