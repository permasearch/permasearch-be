In 1963 the official journal of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR published an article announcing a possible sighting. The previous year the whaling ship Buran had reported a group of large marine mammals grazing on seaweed in shallow water off Kamchatka,[26][45] in the Gulf of Anadyr. The crew reported seeing six of these animals ranging from 6 to 8 meters (20 to 26Â ft), with trunks and split lips. There have also been alleged sightings by local fishermen in the northern Kuril Islands, and around the Kamchatka and Chukchi peninsulas.[46][47] These sightings may have been mistaken identifications of extant arctic marine mammals such as the narwhal (Monodon monoceros) and the northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris).[44]
