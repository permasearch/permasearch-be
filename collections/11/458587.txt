In 1995, the monsoons failed badly in Karnataka and the state found itself hard pressed to fulfill the interim order. Tamil Nadu approached the Supreme Court demanding the immediate release of at least 30 TMC.  The Supreme Court refused to entertain Tamil Nadu's petition and asked it to approach the tribunal.  The tribunal examined the case and recommended that Karnataka release 11 TMC.  Karnataka pleaded that 11 TMC was unimplementable in the circumstances that existed then.  Tamil Nadu now went back to the Supreme Court demanding that Karnataka be forced to obey the tribunal's order.  The Supreme Court this time recommended that the then Prime Minister, P. V. Narasimha Rao, intervene and find a political solution.  The Prime Minister convened a meeting with the Chief Ministers of the two states and recommended that Karnataka release 6 TMC instead of the 11 TMC that the tribunal ordered.  Karnataka complied with the decision of the Prime Minister and the issue blew over.
