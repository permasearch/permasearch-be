Doping controversy has surrounded Lance Armstrong. In August 2005, one month after Armstrong's seventh consecutive victory, L'Ã‰quipe published documents it said showed Armstrong had used EPO in the 1999 race.[145][146] At the same Tour, Armstrong's urine showed traces of a glucocorticosteroid hormone, although below the positive threshold. He said he had used skin cream containing triamcinolone to treat saddle sores.[147] Armstrong said he had received permission from the UCI to use this cream.[148] Further allegations ultimately culminated in the United States Anti Doping Agency (USADA) disqualifying him from all his victories since 1 August 1998, including his seven consecutive Tour de France victories, and a lifetime ban from competing in professional sports.[149] He chose not to appeal the decision and in January 2013 he admitted doping in a television interview conducted by Oprah Winfrey,[150] despite having made repeated denials throughout his career.[151][152]
