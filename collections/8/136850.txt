An offer to contract must be addressed to a person, be sufficiently definite – that is, describe the goods, quantity, and price – and indicate an intention for the offeror to be bound on acceptance.[44] The CISG does not appear to recognise common law unilateral contracts[45] but, subject to clear indication by the offeror, treats any proposal not addressed to a specific person as only an invitation to make an offer.[46] Further, where there is no explicit price or procedure to implicitly determine price, then the parties are assumed to have agreed upon a price based upon that 'generally charged at the time of the conclusion of the contract for such goods sold under comparable circumstances'.[47]
