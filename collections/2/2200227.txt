England began to defend their heavy lead. However, in the 74th minute, they managed to extend it through a counterattack. Ferdinand won the ball in defence and gave it to Paul Scholes. Scholes progressed up the pitch through a one-two passing move with David Beckham. Scholes passed the ball to Emile Heskey, who ran past German defender Marko Rehmer and hit the ball low past Kahn to make it 5â€“1.
