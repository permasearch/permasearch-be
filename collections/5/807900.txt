Williams turned professional on October 31, 1994, at the age of fourteen. In the second round of her first professional tournament, the Bank of the West Classic in Oakland, Williams was up a set and a service break against world No. 2 Arantxa SÃ¡nchez Vicario before losing the match. That was the only tournament Williams played in 1994.
