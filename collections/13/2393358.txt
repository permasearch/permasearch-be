The Dungeons and endless corridors that are a hallmark of European Gothic are far removed from American Gothic in which  castles are replaced with caves. Lloyd-Smith reinterprets Moby Dick to make this point convincingly.[3] Early settlers were overcome by fear linked to the unexplored territory which surrounded, and in some cases, engulfed them. Fear of the unknown stemming from environmental factors like darkness and vastness is notable in Charles Brockden Brown's Edgar Huntly.
