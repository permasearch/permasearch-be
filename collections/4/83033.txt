The period of the later 1950s and early 1960s has traditionally been seen as an era of hiatus for rock and roll.[51] More recently some authors[weaselÂ words] have emphasised important innovations and trends in this period without which future developments would not have been possible.[52][53] While early rock and roll, particularly through the advent of rockabilly, saw the greatest commercial success for male and white performers, in this era the genre was dominated by black and female artists. Rock and roll had not disappeared at the end of the 1950s and some of its energy can be seen in the Twist dance craze of the early 1960s, mainly benefiting the career of Chubby Checker.[53][nb 2]
