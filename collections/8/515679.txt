A month before the album's release, Swift hosted exclusive secret sessions in London,[38] Rhode Island,[39] Los Angeles[40] and Nashville.[41] She said, "Everything about this album is a secret." Each party had a number of attendees, with a total of 500 fans chosen from around the world, for whom the album was played but none of them leaked any music. The behind the scenes footage for the sessions was released on November 7 on ABC's Good Morning America.[42] Swift partnered with AT&T to produce a multi-part behind-the-scenes series chronicling the making of Reputation, titled "The Making of a Song". The series was played on the channel from November 13.[43]
