This episode was the first Black Mirror episode to be written, though it aired second.[3] It was written by Charlie Brooker and Konnie Huq; Brooker described it as "sort of her idea", as she once remarked that he would "basically be happy in a room where every wall was [an iPad screen]".[4] Brooker compared it to the "1984" ad produced by Apple, Inc. for the Apple Macintosh computer.[5]
