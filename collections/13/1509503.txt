Aristotle said, "the end and purpose of the polis is the good life".[41] Adam Smith characterized the good life in terms of material goods and intellectual and moral excellences of character.[42] Smith in his The Wealth of Nations commented, "All for ourselves, and nothing for other people, seems, in every age of the world, to have been the vile maxim of the masters of mankind."[43]
