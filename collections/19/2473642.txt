Explanation:  In a command economy, people and material are moved where they are needed.  Large cities might field good teams due to the greater availability of high quality players; and teams that can practice longer (weather, facilities) can reasonably be expected to be better.  In addition, you put your best and brightest in places where they can do the most good—such as on high-value weapons programs.  It is an anomaly for a small city to field such a good team.  The anomaly (i.e. the soccer scores and great soccer team) indirectly described a condition by which the observer inferred a new meaningful pattern—that the small city was no longer small.  Why would you put a large city of your best and brightest in the middle of nowhere?  To hide them, of course.
