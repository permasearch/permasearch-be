Agile Unified Process (AUP) is a simplified version of the Rational Unified Process (RUP) developed by Scott Ambler.[1] It describes a simple, easy to understand approach to developing business application software using agile techniques and concepts yet still remaining true to the RUP. The AUP applies agile techniques including test-driven development (TDD), agile modeling (AM), agile change management, and database refactoring to improve productivity.
