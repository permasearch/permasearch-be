The temple was established at an ancient religious site dating from the fourth millennium BCE that was dedicated to the earth mother, Gaia, and eventually, was the site of a temple to Hera that dated to the Archaic period. The Altis, the enclosure with its sacred grove, open-air altars and the tumulus of Pelops, was first formed during the tenth and ninth centuries BCE,[2] Greece's "Dark Age", when the followers of Zeus had joined with the followers of Hera.[3]
