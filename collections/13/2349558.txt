The earliest animal fossils appear to be those of invertebrates. 665-million-year-old fossils in the Trezona Formation at Trezona Bore, West Central Flinders, South Australia have been interpreted as being early sponges.[50] Some paleontologists suggest that animals appeared much earlier, possibly as early as 1 billion years ago.[51] Trace fossils such as tracks and burrows found in the Tonian era indicate the presence of triploblastic worms, like metazoans, roughly as large (about 5Â mm wide) and complex as earthworms.[52]
