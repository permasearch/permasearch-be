The concert hall was converted into a tea room and the theatre redesigned as a restaurant in the early 1950s. A funfair was added around the same time.[15] By the 1960s, the pier was suffering from serious financial difficulties.[15] In 1965, it was bought by a company that owned some seafront hotels and entertainment venues. They had ambitions for the pier but were unable to cope with increasing maintenance costs.[6] Some portions of wood and iron from the pier fell on the beach, and the pierhead was closed in 1970 due to safety concerns.[8][15] The pier was Grade II listed in 1969[17] and the council served compulsory repair notices, but the company was unable to afford them and opted for voluntary liquidation.[8] The remainder of the pier was closed in 1975 when the Brighton Corporation declined to buy it, passing control to the Crown Estate Commissioners.[6]
