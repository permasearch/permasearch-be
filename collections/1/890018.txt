When VFR, pilots need not contact TRACON prior to entry or while in any TRSA, however it is recommended they do so. There are no specific equipment requirements to operate VFR in a TRSA. If pilots ask for and receive radar services from TRACON, they must comply with heading and altitudes assigned or cancel the service.
