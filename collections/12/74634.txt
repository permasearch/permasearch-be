There is conservation of much of the structure of proinsulin among mammalian species, with much of the residue changes seen from one species to another present in the C peptide.[7][10] That said, the residues of the C peptide that are conserved across species interact with similarly conserved residues on the A and B chains.[7] Thus, it is hypothesized that these conserved residues are important for the functionality of mature insulin.[7]
