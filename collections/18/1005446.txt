Several authors have offered guidelines for the interpretation of a correlation coefficient.[11][12] However, all such criteria are in some ways arbitrary.[12] The interpretation of a correlation coefficient depends on the context and purposes. A correlation of 0.8 may be very low if one is verifying a physical law using high-quality instruments, but may be regarded as very high in the social sciences where there may be a greater contribution from complicating factors.
