A secretary, typically known as personal assistant (pa) or an administrative assistant, has many administrative duties. The title secretary is not used as often as in decades past, and responsibilities have evolved to much more advance skill set such as mastering Microsoft Office applications; Word, PowerPoint, and Excel to name a few. The duties may vary according to the nature and size of the company or organization, and might include managing budgets, bookkeeping, attending telephone calls, handling visitors, maintaining websites, travel arrangements, and preparing expense reports. Secretaries might also manage all the administrative details of running a high-level conference or meeting and be responsible for arranging the catering for a lunch meeting. Often executives will ask their assistant to take the minutes at meetings and prepare meeting documents for review.[4] In addition to the minutes, the secretary may be responsible for keeping all of the official records of a company or organization.[2]
