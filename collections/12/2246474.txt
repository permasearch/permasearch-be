In 1993, readers of Inside Soap voted Blake as "Best Male Character" and Hill as "Best Actor" and "Sexiest Man In Soap".[15] Jess McGuire of Defamer said that she found Sophie and Blake being intimate, more disturbing to watch than two of the serial's sapphic characters kissing.[16] Darren Devlyn of News.com.au said that Hill "burst onto the acting scene" through Home and Away, but did not truly arrive as an actor while on the series.[17] Michael Idato writing for The Age said that Blake was a "rebellious teen" and noted that soap operas "rarely cast against type" so he was not surprised that Hill was rebellious too.[18] A columnist for Stuff.co.nz said that Blake was a "hunky teenager".[19] Jenna Price of The Sydney Morning Herald said that Hill was one of the serial's teenage actors that had a "pleasant awkwardness" about their portrayal. They added that Hill became Home and Away's new poster boy and "obliterated the memory of Craig McLachlan".[20] When Finlay became hospitalised, a columnist for Inside Soap said "surely the writers couldn't be so cruel as to kill two girlfriends in a row for Blake? Or could they?".[13] While another columnist named Meg dying in Blake's arms as a "great moment in soap". They said that it was "the saddest day in Summer Bay" and added that the "nation wept" as Meg told Blake her dying wish.[21]
