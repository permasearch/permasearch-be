Peter Debruge of Variety gave the film a positive review and called it a pleasant late-summer surprise, writing: "The Hitman’s Bodyguard is about as close to a live-action cartoon as you’re likely to get this year...That’s not a style that works much of the time...but in the hands of The Expendables 3 helmer Patrick Hughes—and more importantly, owing to the chemistry of stars Samuel L. Jackson and Ryan Reynolds—it makes for a delightfully ridiculous screwball action comedy."[19] Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers praised the cast, giving it 2 stars out of 4 and saying, "Reynolds and Jackson make this summer lunacy go down easy with their banter and bullet-dodging skills. They're the only reason that The Hitman’s Bodyguard doesn't completely sink into the generic quicksand from whence it came."[20]
