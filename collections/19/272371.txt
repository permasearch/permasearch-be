Margaret Kennedy and Julia Farrell were, however, but one pair of the serious contenders for the first finders of gold on what became the Bendigo Goldfields. The date of September 1851, or soon after, and place, at or near "The Rocks" on Bendigo Creek, were also mentioned in relation to three other sets of serious contenders for the first finders of gold on what became the Bendigo goldfields, all associated with the Mount Alexander North Run (later renamed the Ravenswood Run).
