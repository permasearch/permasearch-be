One day, the children pray to God (Rishi Kapoor) for help. God discusses the matter with his fairylike angels and decides to send Geeta (Rani Mukerji), his favourite and the most whimsical of the angels, to unite Ranbir with the children. God warns her not to use her ability to alter reality during her time on earth. Geeta ignores God's warning and uses this power often, providing comic relief. She appoints herself as the children's governess and places the children in awe of her by using her transformative powers. Soon, she ingratiates herself with the children with her supportive affection and positiveness. The children begin to cherish her and depend on her while Ranbir remains perplexed and overwhelmed by her dominance of his affairs. He soon becomes enamored of her, despite the interference by his girlfriend Malaika (Ameesha Patel).
