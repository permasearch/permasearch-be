When Enron Field opened, the hill quickly gained the nickname of "The Grassy Knoll".[1][2][7][8] The first catch made on Tal's Hill was made by the Atlanta Braves' Andruw Jones in 2000 after he had previously fallen over running up the hill on the previous play.[9] Catches on the Hill were viewed to be some of the toughest to make and a number of players fell over on it.[10] Lance Berkman once said about it: "If the ball rolls onto the hill, it's not steep enough to roll back, so you have to go get it, then there's the chance of running into the flagpole that’s on it and getting hurt.”[1]
