The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council,[85] consists of senior judges who are Privy Counsellors.[86] The decision of the Committee is presented in the form of "advice" to the monarch, but in practice it is always followed by the sovereign (as Crown-in-Council), who formally approves the recommendation of the Judicial Committee.[87]
