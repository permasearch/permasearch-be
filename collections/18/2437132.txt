After a series of co-starring film roles, Lopez had her breakthrough when she was cast in the title role of Selena (1997), a biographical film about American singer-songwriter Selena Quintanilla-PÃ©rez.[6] Working on the film inspired her to launch a music career, with Lopez saying: "I started my career in musical theater on stage. So doing the movie just reminded me of how much I missed singing, dancing, and the like..." After filming Selena, Lopez was "really feeling [her] Latin roots" and recorded a demo record in Spanish.[7] Her manager sent the song ("Vivir Sin Ti") to Sony Music Entertainment's Work Group, which was interested in signing Lopez. Tommy Mottola, the head of the label, suggested that she sing in English and she began recording her debut album, On the 6.[8] Her decision to launch a musical career was seen as a risk, as film stars had a "patchy record" when it came to releasing pop music,[6] and "If the album was a flop, not only would it embarrass Lopez but it might even damage her career."[9] Lopez originally believed that "Feelin' So Good" was to be released as the album's lead single.[10] "If You Had My Love" was produced by Rodney Jerkins; Lopez recorded her vocals for the song at Sony Music Studios in New York City with engineers Franklyn Grant and Robb Williams. The song was later mixed by Tony Maserati at The Hit Factory in New York City, and subsequently mastered by Herb Powers at Powers House of Sound.[11][12] Shawnyette Harrell and Jennifer Karr served as backing vocalists.[13]
