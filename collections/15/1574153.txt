Despite rising traffic to Las Vegas, WAE reduced service to the city amid the Great Depression.[8] Once its financial situation improved, the airline bought the airfield and established a monopoly on flights.[9] When the city attempted to purchase the field and build a more modern terminal, WAE refused. With the advent of World War II, however, WAE was pressured to sell the airfield.[10] Nevadan Senator Pat McCarran helped obtain federal funding for the city to buy the field and construct a new terminal. He also helped establish a gunnery school by the United States Army Air Corps at the field.[11] For the senator's contributions, the airport was named McCarran Field in 1941.[12]
