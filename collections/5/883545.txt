Jean Piaget, a Swiss theorist, posited that children learn by actively constructing knowledge through hands-on experience.[13] He suggested that the adult's role in helping the child learn was to provide appropriate materials that the child can interact with and use to construct. He used Socratic questioning to get children to reflect on what they were doing, and he tried to get them to see contradictions in their explanations.
