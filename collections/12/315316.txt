Nicholas Courtney was originally going to appear in this story as the Brigadier, but had to pull out for health reasons. The character is said to be stranded in Peru, which had been previously given as his whereabouts during The Sontaran Stratagem. Had Courtney appeared, this story would have been the only televised encounter between the Brigadier and the Tenth Doctor.
