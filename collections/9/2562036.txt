Following the first edition, printed between 1724 and 1727, the Tour was published several more times. A decade after the original printing, printer and future novelist Samuel Richardson secured the rights and printed the second edition of the Tour, releasing an edition with substantial revisions on 13 October 1738. He was responsible for at least some of the revisions in this edition, as well as in the subsequent editions of 1742, 1748, 1753, and 1761–62. Richardson's biographers comment that a “travel book seems an odd thing for Richardson to have worked on, since few men were less travelled,” and note that, “as it is revised [by Richardson], the Tour becomes less and less like a travel book”.[3]
