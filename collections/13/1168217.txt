A one-hour pilot for a new series was made in 1996 but never aired. Produced and written by Stephen J. Cannell, it starred Gary Busey and Russell Wong as the new Five-O team. James MacArthur returned as Dan Williams, having become governor of Hawaii.[23] Several cameos were made by other Five-O regulars, including Kam Fong as Chin Ho Kelly[24] (even though the character had been killed off at the end of Season 10).[citation needed]
