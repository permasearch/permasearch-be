The 1899 Cleveland Spiders own the worst single-season record of all time (minimum 120 games) and for all eras, finishing at 20–134 (.130 percentage) in the final year of the National League's 12–team era in the 1890s; for comparison, this projects to 21–141 under the current 162 game schedule, and Pythagorean expectation based on the Spiders' results and the current 162 game schedule predicts a record of 25–137.
