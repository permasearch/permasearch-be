This talk page is not the proper place for you to expound on your personal feelings about this sort of thing. Indeed, you have referred to your commentary with phrases such as "My personal views on...." etc. Your commentary above is riddled with what you obviously characterize as your own beliefs. Instead, let's stick to what reliable, previously published third party sources say about the subjects of this and other Wikipedia articles -- and let's summarize accurately what those sources are saying.
