Throughout the 2008 AFL season, Hawthorn played a brand of football which became described as "unsociable" – a rough, physical style of play which conceded a lot of free kicks, but regardless asserted a physical dominance for the club.[16] Hawthorn finished second on the home-and-away ladder with a record of 17–5, and progressed to the Grand Final to defeat Geelong 18.7 (115) to 11.23 (89), who had lost only one match during the season.[17] Hawthorn would go on to lose its next eleven encounters with Geelong, allegedly caused by the "Kennett curse". Lance Franklin won the Coleman Medal with 102 goals, becoming the first player for more than a decade to score 100 goals within the home-and-away season.
