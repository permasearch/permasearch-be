Trap music employs a heavy use of multilayered, hard-lined, and melodic synthesizers, crisp, grimy, and rhythmic snares, deep 808 kick drums, double-time, triple-time, and similarly divided hi hats, and a cinematic and symphonic utilization of string, brass, woodwind, and keyboard instruments to create an energetic, hard-hitting, deep, and variant atmosphere.[4][5][6][7] These primary characteristics would go on to be the signature sound of trap music, originating from producer Shawty Redd. Trap may use a range of tempos, from 100 BPM to 176 BPM, but the tempo of a typical trap beat is around 140 BPM.[8]
