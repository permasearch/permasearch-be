Plurality voting is distinguished from a majoritarian electoral system, in which, to win, a candidate must receive an absolute majority of votesâ€”i.e. more votes than all other candidates combined. Both systems may use single-member or multi-member constituencies, In the latter case it may be referred to as an exhaustive counting system: one member is elected at a time and the process repeated until the number of vacancies is filled.
