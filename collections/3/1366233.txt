The new Z06 arrived as a 2006 model in the third quarter of 2005. It has a 7.0 L version of the small block engine codenamed LS7. At 427.6 cubic inches, the Z06 was the largest small block ever offered from General Motors. Because of the Corvette's former use of 427 cubic-inch big blocks in the late-1960s and early 1970s, the LS7's size was rounded down to 427 cubic inches. Official output was 505 bhp (377 kW) and has a 0-60 mph (97 km/h) time of 3.7 seconds. Top speed is 198 mph (319 km/h).[68] Another first for a Corvette, the Z06 featured a full aluminim chasis. The frame mirrored the C5/6 architecture but substituting aluminum hydroformed rails and aluminum extrustions and castings fore and aft. This dropped weight from 419 to 287 pounds while improving chassis stiffness.[69]
