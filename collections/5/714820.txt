Over time, Sandino and April become best friends, and Sandino fixes a ruined bedroom in her house. This makes Manny and Byron happy and so does Jennifer, who feels April does not want them there. While on a date, Sandino tells April he doesn't understand why she is with Randy and asks if she loves Randy. He tells her what true love is to him. One Sunday morning, Sandino eagerly knocks on April's bedroom door to get April ready for church, but Randy threatens to have Sandino deported if he continues to spend time with April.
