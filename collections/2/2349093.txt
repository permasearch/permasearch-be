Understanding where all the energy goes during the combustion process is important to properly designing gun and recoil systems. Recoil energy is initially absorbed by the springs and hydraulic cylinders of the buffering system, or the body of the shooter, which produces the counter-recoil force. The kinetic energy of recoil is then slowly dissipated as heat energy. For a hand-held firearm, the energy is absorbed by the shooter's body, creating a small amount of heat in muscles and bones. For the naval cannon from the figure above, it will roll backwards and the recoil energy will be mostly absorbed by the friction forces in the wheel axles and between the wheel and the ship deck and this energy is again converted to heat.
