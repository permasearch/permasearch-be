The return to Wembley saw an upturn in form with England beating Israel, Russia and Estonia 3–0 each. After this, England played Russia away, a game which if they won they would qualify but lose, and qualification would not be in their hands. England put in a very good display, and took a first half lead through Wayne Rooney. But Russia went on to win 2–1. England were relying on Israel to beat Russia to be able to qualify, and they did, with an injury time winner.
