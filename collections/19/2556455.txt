The listeners to the show are referred to as "Ditto-heads". Early in the show's run, listeners began to use the variations on the expression "ditto" to speed up the beginnings of calls, which tend to open with the listener expressing his or her gratitude to the host and an appreciation of the show. Mr. Limbaugh claims the term originated with a caller who said "ditto what the previous caller said".[citation needed]
