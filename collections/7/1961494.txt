In Glossip v. Gross, attorneys for three Oklahoma inmates argued that midazolam could not achieve the level of unconsciousness required for surgery, meaning severe pain and suffering was likely. They argued that midazolam was cruel and unusual punishment and thus contrary to the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  In June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled they failed to prove that midazolam was cruel and unusual when compared to known, available alternatives.[86]
