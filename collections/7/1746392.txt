The Enterprise searches while in orbit of Angel One. Doctor Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) relieves Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) of duty after he and most of the crew have fallen ill to a random virus on board, that gives the sense of an odd smell to its victims at the time of infection. The Captain leaves Lieutenant Geordi La Forge (Levar Burton) in command (Geordi's first time in Acting Command of a Starship). Shortly after, they find Ramsey and transmit his location to the Away Team, who beam directly to there.
