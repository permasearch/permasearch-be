URM was established in 1980 as a result of the legislative branch’s enactment of the Refugee Act that same year.[33] Initially, it was developed to “address the needs of thousands of children in Southeast Asia” who were displaced due to civil unrest and economic problems resulting from the aftermath of the Vietnam War, which had ended only five years earlier.[32] Coordinating with the United Nations and “utilizing an executive order to raise immigration quotas, President Carter doubled the number of Southeast Asian refugees allowed into the United States each month.”[34] The URM was established, in part, to deal with the influx of refugee children.
