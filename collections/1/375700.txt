In the cool cloudy damp Pacific Northwest, moss is sometimes allowed to grow naturally as a lawn substitute, one that needs little or no mowing, fertilizing or watering.  In this case, grass is considered to be the weed.[33]  Landscapers in the Seattle area sometimes collect boulders and downed logs growing mosses for installation in gardens and landscapes.  Woodland gardens in many parts of the world can include a carpet of natural mosses.[29]  The Bloedel Reserve on Bainbridge Island, Washington State, is famous for its moss garden.  The moss garden was created by removing shrubby underbrush and herbaceous groundcovers, thinning trees, and allowing mosses to fill in naturally.[34]
