The Cape Cod cottage style house originated in the wood building counties of England and was brought to America by Puritan carpenters. The harsh climate of New England tested the pioneers ingenuity, and by lowering the house and pulling its plan into more of a square footprint, they transported the English Hall and parlor house we call the Cape Cod cottage.[1] The style has survived and emerged as a 1- to ​1 1⁄2-story house with wooden shutters and clapboard or shingle exterior. Using local materials – cedar for roofing and siding shingles, oak and pine for framing and flooring[2] – settlers built houses locally adapted to New England's extreme winter climate. Temperatures in January and February can drop to -20F, with snow accumulations often reaching several feet.[3] To fight the chill, they built massive central chimneys and low ceilinged rooms to conserve heat. The steep roof characteristic of New England homes minimized snow load. Finally, colonists installed shutters on the windows to hold back heavy winds.
