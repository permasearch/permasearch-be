For example, the function f from the reals to the reals, defined by the formula     f ( x ) =   1 +  x  2     ,   {\displaystyle f(x)={\sqrt {1+x^{2}}},}   employs, as auxiliary functions, the square function (mapping all the reals to the non-negative reals), the square root function (mapping the non-negative reals to the non-negative reals), and the addition of real numbers. The whole set of real numbers may be taken as the domain of f, even if the domain of the square root function is restricted to the non-negative real numbers; the image of f consists of the reals that are not less than one.
