Ike's remnants combined with an unusual depression that affected southwestern Iceland on September 17, three days after Ike became extratropical.[122] The storm produced 9 m (30 ft) waves along southwest coasts of the island. Rainfall peaked near 200 mm (7.9 in) close to Reykjavík. Wind gusts were measured up to 89 mph (143 km/h).[123] Strong winds on the backside of the system produced a large dust storm in northern areas of the island.[124]
