Camille's French mother and owner of a bar where the police team often chat about the case over a drink. She makes a particularly good cup of tea, according to DI Richard Poole, although generally their relationship with each other is strained because of his prejudice toward the French. She raised Camille as a single mother and is therefore very close to her; she does not react badly when Camille confirms she is thinking of leaving, in fact, she supports Camille and respects her choices, urging her to do whatever makes her happy. When Camille leaves, she has a spare room and lets the homeless JP stay in it when Goodman finds out he has nowhere to live and is sleeping in the police cells. In series 5 episode 5, JP told Catherine that he's in love with his high school crush, Rosey Fabrice, but was told not to confess by Dwayne, which angers Catherine, who confronts Dwayne to encourage JP to confess to Rosey.
