According to Gomes et al. (2010),[22] Haplogroup B is another characteristically Nilotic paternal marker. It was found in 22% of Wood et al.'s Luo samples and 8% of the studied Maasai.[21] The E1b1b haplogroup has been observed at overall frequencies of around 11% among Nilo-Saharan-speaking groups in the Great Lakes area,[23] with this influence concentrated among the Maasai (50%).[21] This is indicative of substantial historic gene flow from Cushitic-speaking males into these Nilo-Saharan-speaking populations.[24] In addition, 67% of the Alur samples possessed the E2 haplogroup.[21]
