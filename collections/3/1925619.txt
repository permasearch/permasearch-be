Denver lies within the semi-arid, continental climate zone (KÃ¶ppen climate classification BSk).[55] It has four distinct seasons and receives a modest amount of precipitation spread throughout the year. Due to its inland location on the High Plains, at the foot of the Rocky Mountains, Denver is subject to sudden changes in weather.[56] Contrary to the popular belief that Denver receives 300 days of sunshine a year, the city can actually expect to receive an average of 115 clear days, 130 partly cloudy days, and 120 cloudy days each year.[57][58][59]
