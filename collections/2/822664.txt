The Sicani were the only tribe known to have inhabited the island at this time[36][45] and are generally regarded as being closely related to the Iberians.[46] The population on Malta grew cereals, raised livestock and, in common with other ancient Mediterranean cultures, worshiped a fertility figure represented in Maltese prehistoric artefacts exhibiting the proportions seen in similar statuettes, including the Venus of Willendorf.[citation needed]
