In "Better Than You", Billie starts giving other children tours round the Dumping Ground, getting them to pay. However, when she falls out with Toni, Floss steals her idea, and she and Toni decide to give tours of their own. Billie teams up with Tyler and they plan their own rival tour; however, Faith tells them they shouldn't treat the Dumping Ground like a freak show, and persuades Billie and Tyler to stop giving tours. Billie eventually makes up with Toni.
