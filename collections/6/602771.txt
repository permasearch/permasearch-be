Nevertheless, the LDS Church differs from the many other churches within contemporary Christianity, and many people do not accept the church as part of Christianity.[91] The faith itself views other modern Christian faiths as having departed from true Christianity[92] via a general apostasy and maintains that it is a restoration of 1st-century Christianity and the only true and authorized Christian church.[93] Differences between the LDS Church and most of traditional Christianity include disagreement with aspects of the Nicene Creed, belief in a theory of human salvation that includes three heavens (referred to as "degrees of glory", its interpretation of I Cor. 15:35 et.seq.),[94] a doctrine of "exaltation" which includes the ability of humans to become gods and goddesses in the afterlife,[72] a dietary code called the Word of Wisdom, and unique ceremonies performed privately in LDS temples, such as the endowment and sealing ceremonies.
