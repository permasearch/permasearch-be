Although Churchill had upset both Edward VII and George V in his political career, he always remained a firm monarchist,[537] displaying a romanticised view of the British monarchy.[538] Jenkins described Churchill's opposition to protectionism as being based on a "profound conviction",[539] although during his political career many questioned the sincerity of Churchill's anti-protectionist beliefs.[540] Although as Home Secretary he found sanctioning executions to be one of his most emotionally taxing tasks, he did not endorse the abolition of the death penalty.[541]
