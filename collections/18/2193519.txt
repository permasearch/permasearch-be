Mast cells have Toll-like receptors and interact with dendritic cells, B cells, and T cells to help mediate adaptive immune functions.[88] Mast cells express MHC class II molecules and can participate in antigen presentation; however, the mast cell's role in antigen presentation is not very well understood.[89] Mast cells can consume and kill gram-negative bacteria (e.g., salmonella), and process their antigens.[90] They specialize in processing the fimbrial proteins on the surface of bacteria, which are involved in adhesion to tissues.[91][92] In addition to these functions, mast cells produce cytokines that induce an inflammatory response.[93]  This is a vital part of the destruction of microbes because the cytokines attract more phagocytes to the site of infection.[90][94]
