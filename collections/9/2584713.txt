These models were all offered as sedans, and wagons only with the Executive, Acclaim and Berlina. Unusually, the VY also introduced a limited edition SS wagon featuring the same 235 kW (315 hp) V8 (upgraded to 245 kW or 329 hp for Series II), bodykit and sports suspension as the SS sedan. However, it was equipped with 17-inch alloy wheels as opposed to the 18-inch wheels on the sedan. 500 such wagons were produced for Series I, and 350 for Series II.[1]
