The tape loops were played on BTR3 tape machines located in various studios of the Abbey Road building[31] and controlled by EMI technicians in Studio Two at Abbey Road on 7 April.[32][21] Each machine was monitored by one technician, who had to hold a pencil within each loop to maintain tension.[30] The four Beatles controlled the faders of the mixing console while Martin varied the stereo panning and Emerick watched the meters.[33][34] Eight of the tapes were used at one time, changed halfway through the song.[33] The tapes were made (like most of the other loops) by superimposition and acceleration.[35][36] According to Martin, the finished mix of the tape loops could not be repeated because of the complex and random way in which they were laid over the music.[37]
