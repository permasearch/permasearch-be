The Bell brothers' father Bobby and uncle Tommy were boxers. They moved to New York to train and lived in the same apartment building as Thelonious Monk, who became Robert's godfather when he was born. Miles Davis would drop by because he wanted to be a boxer.[4] They played occasionally with McCoy Tyner, Pharoah Sanders, and Leon Thomas.[5]
