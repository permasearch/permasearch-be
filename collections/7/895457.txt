Studies have found that non-native speakers of English in the UK have no causal impact on the performance of other pupils,[171] immigrant children have no significant impact on the test scores of Dutch children,[172] no effect on grade repetition among native students exposed to migrant students in Austrian schools,[173] that the presence of Latin American children in schools had no significant negative effects on peers, but that students with limited English skills had slight negative effects on peers,[174] and that the influx of Haitians to Florida public schools after the 2010 Haiti earthquake had no effects on the educational outcomes of incumbent students.[175]
