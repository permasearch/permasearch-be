A subtropical cyclone is a weather system that has some characteristics of a tropical cyclone and some characteristics of an extratropical cyclone. They can form in a wide band of latitudes, from the equator to 50Â°. Although subtropical storms rarely have hurricane-force winds, they may become tropical in nature as their cores warm.[181] From an operational standpoint, a tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition.[182]
