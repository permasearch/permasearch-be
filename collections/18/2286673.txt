Almost every season of The Real World, beginning with its fifth season, has included the assignment of a season-long group job or task to the housemates. Beginning with this season, the producers instituted the new rule that participation in the assignment is mandatory for the cast, and that a roommate who was terminated from the assignment would be evicted from the residence and from the cast. The Back to New York housemates were assigned jobs as receptionists for Arista Records during the day, and helped gain publicity for their up-and-coming bands at night.
