Sir Henry de la Pomeroy captured the Mount in 1193, on behalf of Prince John, in the reign of King Richard I.[13] The monastic buildings were built during the 12th century and in 1275 an earthquake destroyed the original Priory Church, which was rebuilt in the late 14th century, remaining in use.[citation needed] Syon Abbey, a monastery of the Bridgettine Order acquired the Mount in 1424.[14]
