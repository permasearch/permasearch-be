Welding processes have become increasingly important in almost all manufacturing industries and for structural application.[5] Although a large number of techniques are available for welding in atmosphere, many of these techniques cannot be applied in offshore and marine application where presence of water is of major concern. In this regard, it is relevant to note that a great majority of offshore repairing and surfacing work is carried out at a relatively shallow depth, in the region intermittently covered by the water known as the splash zone. Though numerically, most ship repair and welding jobs are carried out at a shallow depth, the most technologically challenging task is repair at greater depths, especially in pipelines and repair of accidental failure. The advantages of underwater welding are largely of an economic nature, because underwater-welding for marine maintenance and repair jobs bypasses the need to pull the structure out of the sea and saves valuable time and dry docking costs. It is also an important technique for emergency repairs which allow the damaged structure to be safely transported to dry facilities for permanent repair or scrapping. Underwater welding is applied in both inland and offshore environments, though seasonal weather inhibits offshore underwater welding during winter. In either location, surface supplied air is the most common diving method for underwater welders.[6]
