Three more barrages across the Ganges main river are existing at Bijnor, Narora and Kanpur.[18] The barrages at Bijnor and Narora divert all the water including baseflows during dry season to the canals for irrigating vast area up to Allahabad city. Most of the water available at the upstream of the Kanpur barrage is used during dry season for the cities drinking water needs.[19] Downstream of Kanpur barrage, adequate water is  not available from the barrage to dilute the polluted water reaching the main river during the dry seasons of year.
