The commission released its interim report in December 2013, shortlisting three options: the north-west third runway option at Heathrow, extending an existing runway at Heathrow, and a second runway at Gatwick Airport. After this report was published, the government confirmed that no options had been ruled out for airport expansion in the South-east and that a new runway would not be built at Heathrow before 2015.[159] The full report was published on 1 July 2015, and backed a third, north-west, runway at Heathrow.[160] Reaction to the report was generally negative, particularly from London Mayor Boris Johnson. One senior Conservative told Channel 4: "Howard Davies has dumped an utter steaming pile of poo on the Prime Minister's desk."[161] On 25 October 2016, the government confirmed that Heathrow would be allowed to build a third runway; however, a final decision would not be taken until winter of 2017/18, after consultations and government votes. The earliest opening year would be 2025. On 5 June 2018 Cabinet approved the third runway, with a full vote planned for Parliament.[162]  On 25 June 2018, the House of Commons voted 415-119 in favor of the Third Runway.[163]  The bill received support from most MPs in the Conservative and Labour Parties.[164]  A judicial review against the decision is being launched by four London local authorities affected by the expansion—Wandsworth, Richmond, Hillingdon and Hammersmith and Fulham—in partnership with Greenpeace and London mayor Sadiq Khan.[165]  Khan previously stated he would take legal action if it were passed by Parliament.[166]
