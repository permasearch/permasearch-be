BLS explained the gap between productivity and compensation can be divided into two components, the effect of which varies by industry: 1) Recalculating the gap using an industry-specific inflation adjustment (“industry deflator”) rather than consumption (CPI); and 2) The change in labor’s share of income, defined as how much of a business’ revenue goes to workers as opposed to intermediate purchases (i.e., cost of goods) and capital (owners) in that industry.[27] The difference in deflators was the stronger effect among high productivity growth industries, while the change in labor’s share of income was the stronger effect among most other industries. For example, the 3.5% productivity gap in the information industry was composed of a 2.1% difference in deflators and about a 1.4% due to change in labor share. The 2.7% gap in Manufacturing included 1.0% due to deflator and 1.7% due to change in labor share.[27]
