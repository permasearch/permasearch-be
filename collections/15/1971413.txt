In October 1908, the first nationalist movement was formed, Budi Utomo.[51] On 10 September 1912, the first nationalist mass movement was formed: Sarekat Islam.[52] By December 1912, Sarekat Islam had 93,000 members.[52] The Dutch responded after the First World War with repressive measures. The nationalist leaders came from a small group of young professionals and students, some of whom had been educated in the Netherlands. In the post–World War I era, the Indonesian communists who were associated with the Third International started to usurp the nationalist movement.[53] The repression of the nationalist movement led to many arrests, including Indonesia's first president, Sukarno (1901–70), who was imprisoned for political activities on 29 December 1929.[54] Also arrested was Mohammad Hatta, first Vice-President of Indonesia.[55] Additionally, Sutan Sjahrir, who later became the first Prime Minister of Indonesia, was arrested on this date.[56]
