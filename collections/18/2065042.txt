On July 28, 2013, The Dirty Heads played their largest sold-out show to date in front of 8,500 hometown friends, family, and fans at the Orange County Fair's Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa, CA. The emotional stop on their "Cabin By The Sea Tour" ended with a "thank you" from the band for all the local support over the years, including a "trip down memory lane" story of when the band used to play small shows in local Huntington Beach, CA bars to a handful of people.[citation needed]
