Limp Bizkit will offer several concerts in UK during winter 2016 alongside Korn, two of the most prominent nu metal acts from 1990s. Regarding this nostalgic tour Fred says: "You may have experienced a lot of cool concerts in your life, but I can guarantee you that an evening with Korn and Limp Bizkit will always and forever be your favourite. No one brings the party harder, heavier, and more exciting than us. No one. And… make sure you get plenty of rest the night before. It’s time to bring it back!"[87]
