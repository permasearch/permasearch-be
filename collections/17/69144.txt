A month later, Harry leaves the Dursleys' home to catch the Hogwarts Express from King's Cross railway station's secret Hogwarts platform, Platform 9Â¾. On the train, he befriends fellow first-year Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger, whose snobbiness and affinity for spells initially causes the two boys to dislike her. There, Harry also makes an enemy of yet another first-year, Draco Malfoy, who prejudices against Hermione due to her being the daughter of Muggles, a term used by wizards and witches that describe ordinary humans with no magical ability.
