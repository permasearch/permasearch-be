Aging is one of the most common causes of dry eyes because tear production decreases with age.[4] Several classes of medications (both prescription and OTC) have been hypothesized as a major cause of dry eye, especially in the elderly.  Particularly, anticholinergic medications that also cause dry mouth are believed to promote dry eye.[22]  Dry eye may also be caused by thermal or chemical burns, or (in epidemic cases) by adenoviruses.   A number of studies have found that diabetics are at increased risk for the disease.[23][24]
