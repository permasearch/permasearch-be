Regardless, and as forewarned by the prosecuting U.S. Attorney, Ken Fimberg/Scott,[40] the Department of Justice's stated findings and plea agreement with Rockwell were heavily contested by its own, 23-member special grand jury. Press leaks on both sides—members of the DOJ and the grand jury—occurred in violation of secrecy regarding grand jury information, a federal crime punishable by a prison sentence.[41] The public contest led to U.S. Congressional oversight committee hearings chaired by Congressman Howard Wolpe, which issued subpoenas to DOJ principals despite several instances of DOJ's refusal to comply. The hearings, whose findings include that the Justice Department had "bargained away the truth",[42] ultimately still did not fully reveal to the public the special grand jury's report, which remains sealed by the DOJ courts.[37][43]
