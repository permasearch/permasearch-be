When federal forces deploy support of DSCA, once those forces enter the incident area they come under the operational control of U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM). US Northern Command only controls federal forces deployed into the impact area in response to the incident. National Guard forces deployed under the authority of the Governor remain under control of the Governor.
