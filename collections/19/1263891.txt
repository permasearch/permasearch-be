The police faced severe and broad criticism for their reaction, with an American Civil Liberties Union spokesperson saying that it was "nothing less than an orchestrated police riot."[23] Several primary witnesses reported unnecessarily violent actions and police abuses, including firing on reporters[22] and people obeying police commands.[25] Police responded that their response was "outstanding" and "clearly disciplined."[25] De la Rocha said of the incident, "I don't care what fucking television stations said, [that] the violence was caused by the people at the concert; those motherfuckers unloaded on this crowd. And I think it's ridiculous considering, you know, none of us had rubber bullets, none of us had M16s, none of us had billy clubs, none of us had face shields."[26]
