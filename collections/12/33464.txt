A legend also explains that when the Vikings arrived at the mouth of the river Masma, the holy Bishop of the diocese of Gonzalo BretoÃ±a prayed for protection from the heavens against the forthcoming attack. A major storm was unleashed, sinking most of the fleet and a large number of Vikings fled in their ships.
