In Toy Story 3, Buster is now older and looks very aged, with mixed brown and gray fur, a gray-white snout, overweight, and too old to help Woody save the other toys (in a direct parody of the rescue scene from Toy Story 2), although he remains nice and loyal to them. He tends to fall asleep as well.
