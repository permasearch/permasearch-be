Before Mughal rule in India, the aristocracy collected and retained revenue from land and production. The Mughals appointed people to act as tax officers, sending them around the country to oversee collection of revenue and remit it to the capital city of Delhi.[6] These people were known as the zamindari (intermediaries)[7] and they collected revenue primarily from the Ryots (peasants)[8] The zamindari system was more prevalent in the north of India because Mughal influence in the south was less apparent.[7]
