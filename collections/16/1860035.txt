Within the two main categories are many further types of psychologists as reflected by the 56 professional classifications recognized by the APA,[4] including clinical, counseling, and educational psychologists, such professionals working with persons in a variety of therapeutic contexts. People often think of the discipline as involving only such clinical or counseling psychologists.
