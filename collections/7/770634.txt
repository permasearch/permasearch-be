Eileithyia or Ilithyia (/ɪlɪˈθaɪ.ə/;[1] Greek: Εἰλείθυια;,Ἐλεύθυια (Eleuthyia) in Crete,  also Ἐλευθία (Eleuthia) or Ἐλυσία (Elysia) in Laconia and Messene, and Ἐλευθώ (Eleuthō) in literature)[2] was the Greek goddess of childbirth and midwifery.[3] In the cave of Amnisos (Crete) she was related with the annual birth of the divine child, and her cult is connected with Enesidaon (the earth shaker), who was the chthonic aspect of the god Poseidon. It is possible that her cult is related with the cult of Eleusis.[4]
