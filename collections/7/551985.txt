In pre-1950s France, "chute de manne" was obtained by pressing mayflies into cakes and using them as bird food and fishbait.[19] From an economic standpoint, mayflies also provide fisheries with an excellent diet for fish.[63] Mayflies could find uses in the biomedical, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. Their exoskeleton contains chitin, which has applications in these industries.[63]
