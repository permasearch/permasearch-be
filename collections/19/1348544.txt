Red owns what is known as "the Possum Van", a 1979â€“1993 Dodge Ram cargo van, painted as a grey 'possum on a pale blue background, and with a license plate reading simply "POSSUM". It is one of Red's few vehicles that actually runs. It has played (and donated) many parts in Handyman's Corner projects. After the series ended, the van was scrapped.
