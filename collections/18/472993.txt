Dumbo the Flying Elephant is an aerial carousel-style ride located in Fantasyland at six Disney parks around the world. It is based on the 1941 film, Dumbo. The original attraction opened at Disneyland in October 1955, three months after the park opened. The four other versions of the attraction were opening-day attractions at their respective parks.
