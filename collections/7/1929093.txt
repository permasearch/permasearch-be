Malaysia declared its independence from Britain in 1957, and formed its current state in 1963.[2] Since then, it has seen significant economic growth, a large part of which can be attributed to its forest industry.[3] Malaysia's rapid rate of development has put it far ahead of several of its neighbours, such as Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. This has largely been in part to its abundance of natural resources, which constitutes significant portions of the country's economic sector. Because of this large financial gain from logging, production has been high since initiation, and it was not until 1985 that consequences were first realised.[3]
