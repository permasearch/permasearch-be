Merrimen, Bosco and Levi try to make their escape with bags from the waste truck. They hit a traffic jam and are blocked. Nickâ€™s team spots them and attempts to shoot them as the robbers try to escape. After warning other drivers, the police start to shoot at Merrimen and his gang. Levi and Bosco are shot dead, but Merrimen gets away. Nick gives chase and shoots Merrimen through a fence, wounding him. Nick hops the fence to catch him, but Merrimen refuses to go out quietly. He raises an empty gun to Nick, forcing him to shoot him. As Merrimen lies on the ground dying, Nick kneels by him. He reminds Nick that he kept to his word and dies peacefully. When Nick inspects Merrimen's van, he only finds bags with shredded paper. He also finds that Donnie has escaped custody.
