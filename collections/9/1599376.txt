The earliest human settlers in the area around Broken Hill are thought to have been the Wiljakali[7] Indigenous Australians, once thought to have only intermittently lived in the area because of the lack of permanent water sources, but it has since been found that the Indigenous Clans of the area were able to survive on underground water holes and wells that were unknown to the European settlers. Many of these waterholes are still kept secret from non-Indigenous people. As in much of Australia, a combination of white settler disease and aggression drove them from their lands.[11]
