Depending on the problem, the task may be to find any solution (finding a single solution is enough) or all solutions. The set of all solutions is called the solution set. In the example above, the solution (x, y) = (a + 1, a) is also a parametrization of the solution set with the parameter being a. It is also possible that the task is to find a solution, among possibly many, that is best in some respect; problems of that nature are called optimization problems; solving an optimization problem is generally not referred to as "equation solving".
