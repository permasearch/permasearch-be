The Willys CJ-3B replaced the CJ-3A in 1953, the same year Willys-Overland was bought by Kaiser Motors. The Kaiser parent company removed "Overland" from the Willys Motors subcompany name. The CJ-3B introduced a higher grille and hood to clear the new Willys Hurricane engine. A four-speed manual transmission became optional in 1963, at an extra cost of $194.[10] The turning radius was 17 ft 6 in (5.3 m).[24] Until 1968, about 196,000 CJ-3Bs were produced, of which 155,494 were assembled in the U.S.[25][26]
