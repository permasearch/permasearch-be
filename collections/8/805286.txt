Some forms of storage that produce electricity include pumped-storage hydroelectric dams, rechargeable batteries, thermal storage including molten salts which can efficiently store and release very large quantities of heat energy,[78] and compressed air energy storage, flywheels, cryogenic systems and superconducting magnetic coils.
