Because of their food preferences, fall armyworm larva can wreak havoc on a wide range of human crops. The first historical account of the fall armywormâ€™s destruction was in 1797 in Georgia. Destruction can happen almost over night, because the first stages of a caterpillar's life require very little food, and the later stages require about 50 times more. Because of this rapid change in food consumption, the presence of larva will not be noticed until they have destroyed almost everything in as little as a night.[11] Some examples of targeted crops include cotton, grass, tobacco, sweet corn, rice, peanuts, and even fruits such as apples, oranges, and many more. The list of possible food sources for the worms is extensive, so crop damage is wide ranging.[4] It is estimated that almost 40% of those species that armyworms target are economically important.[7] Because the larva eat so much of the plant, they are very detrimental to crop survival and yield. In corn, larvae will even burrow into the corn ear to eat the kernels.[4]
