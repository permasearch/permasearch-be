Superman's appeal to licensees rests upon the character's continuing popularity, cross market appeal and the status of the "S" shield, the stylized magenta and gold "S" emblem Superman wears on his chest, as a fashion symbol.[182][183] The "S" shield by itself is often used in media to symbolize the Superman character.[184][185]
