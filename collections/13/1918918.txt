The first-year curriculum is prescribed for all students. The day-division curriculum consists of seven required courses totaling 29 credit hours.[7] Evening-division students are required to complete the same basic courses within the first two years of their law school career. Revised for 2013, the new curriculum is designed to strengthen first-year doctrinal courses, to support the development of practice-area concentrations, and to emphasize training that will help graduates transition to the real world of practice.
