In Timothy and Titus in the New Testament a more clearly defined episcopate can be seen. We are told that Paul had left Timothy in Ephesus and Titus in Crete to oversee the local church (1Tim 1:3 and Titus 1:5). Paul commands Titus to ordain presbyters/bishops and to exercise general oversight, telling him to "rebuke with all authority" (Titus 2:15).
