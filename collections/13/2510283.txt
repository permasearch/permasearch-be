The inspirational sloka was Swami Vivekananda's message to the Hindus to get out of their hypnotized state of mind.[2] The sloka was meant as a call to his countrymen to awaken their "sleeping soul" and propagate the message of peace and blessings given by the "ancient Mother" to the world. "Awake" also denotes the awakening of one's real nature and the consequent ushering in of prosperity.[2]
