The duty of care owed to protect others from psychiatric harm is different from that owed for physical harm, with additional control devices and distinctions present in order to limit liability.[43] A successful claim for psychiatric harm must result from a sudden shock (caused by a traumatising event),[43] and the victim must be of ordinary fortitude and mental strength, and not especially susceptible to the harm in question.[44] Whilst a prima facie duty of care is imposed for physical harm where the criteria of proximity, foreseeability, and policy are fulfilled, liability for psychiatric harm rests upon an individual's connection to a traumatising event; those not physically endangered may not be owed a duty of care unless they can fulfill several relational criteria.[45]
