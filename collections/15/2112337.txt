The earliest traces of human habitation in Norway are dated to about 9000 BC, in mountainous regions near Store Myrvatn in contemporary Rogaland, where excavations have found portable dwellings most likely kept by nomadic reindeer hunters.[3] Traces of such tents have also been found other places along the western coast; at Fosenstraumen near Rad√∏y in Hordaland archeological evidence indicates that tents in use at about 6500 BC were of similar design to those still in use by the Sami nomads[4]
