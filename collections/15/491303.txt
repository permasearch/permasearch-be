Social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders (ASD; see Classification) from other developmental disorders.[23] People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. Noted autistic Temple Grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals, or people with normal neural development, as leaving her feeling "like an anthropologist on Mars".[26]
