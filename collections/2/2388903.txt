The bulk of First-Class facilities and accommodation was located on the upper decks within the superstructure of the Titanic, where the vibrations and noise of the engines were at their lowest. The entirety of A-Deck was devoted to First-Class recreational space and accommodation, along with most of B and C Decks. First-Class facilities were located on every level down to F-Deck, which means that First-Class passengers enjoyed the most space by far of any of the three classes on the ship.
