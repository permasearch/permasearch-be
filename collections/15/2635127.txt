Suicide rates in Germany increased as the war drew to a close, particularly in areas where the Red Army was advancing. More than a thousand people (out of a population of around 16,000) committed suicide in Demmin on and around 1 May 1945 as the 65th Army of 2nd Belorussian Front first broke into a distillery and then rampaged through the town, committing mass rapes, arbitrarily executing civilians, and setting fire to buildings.[124] High numbers of suicides took place in many other locations, including Neubrandenburg (600 dead),[124] Stolp in Pommern (1,000 dead),[124] and Berlin, where at least 7,057 people committed suicide in 1945.[125]
