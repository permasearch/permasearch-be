In "Game Over, Charles, it is revealed that Sara had been working all along with Charlotte under the disguises of both Red Coat and Black Widow. This sheds light on the fact that Sara's earlier interactions with Emily and the other Liars were just a facade to lure the girls into complacency. Harvey is shown to have acted the part of and abused captivity victim when in actual fact, she was seemingly working with "A" out of her own free will. In contrast to her previous persona, Sara is duplicitous in nature as she played on the Liars' sympathies for her plight to stop them from questioning her and having suspicions. Furthermore, Harvey is also shown to be manipulative as she seeks out Emily and flirts with her to develop a relationship under the pre-tense of having feelings for her when it is implied that she did that to keep a close eye on the girls. This is also supported by the fact that Charlotte also took advantage of Sara's close proximity to the Liars to prevent them from telling Dr. Sullivan anything by threatening her safety.
