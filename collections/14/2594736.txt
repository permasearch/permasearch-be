Increased human migration within the area has been driven by poverty and unfavorable resettlement conditions.[5][18]  This migration enabled the contraction of HIV and has since led to its heightened prevalence within Volta Basin communities.[10]  The districts of Manya Krobo and Yilo Krobo, which lie within the southwest portion of the Volta Basin, are predominantly indigenous communities that have attained a disproportionate prevalence of HIV.[10]  The situation underlines the strength of the local factors upon these districts.  Commercial sex work was established in response to the thousands of male workers that were in the area for building the dam.[10]  Ten percent of the child-bearing females from these two districts migrated out of their districts during this time.[10] In 1986, "90% of AIDS victims in Ghana were women, and 96% of them had recently lived outside the country".[10]
