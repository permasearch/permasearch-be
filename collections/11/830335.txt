The word 'mosque' entered the English language from the French word mosqueé that was probably derived from Italian moschea, a variant of Italian moscheta, from either Middle Armenian մզկիթ (mzkit‘) or Medieval Greek: μασγίδιον (masgídion) or Spanish mezquita, from Arabic: مَـسْـجِـد‎, translit. masjid (meaning "place of worship" or "prostration in prayer"), either from Nabataean masgĕdhā́ or from Arabic Arabic: سَـجَـدَ‎, translit. sajada (meaning "to bow down in prayer"), probably ultimately from Aramaic sĕghēdh.[3]
