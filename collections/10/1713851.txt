OPERATION TOLLROAD In November 1968 elements of the 4th Infantry Division, including Infantry and Combat Engineers, embarked from the Plei Trap Valley in Vietnam and proceeded to follow the Ho Chi Minh Trail into Cambodia and North into Laos, where they were extracted by helicopter on December 1.  The mission was accomplished in two sections, the first in Cambodia, and the second when replacements were provided as the operation was crossing the Laotian border.  The purpose of the mission was to render the trail unusable by creating abitis, destroying bunkers and bridges, and cratering the road.  The incursion started on 25 November and ended December 1.  The replacement units arrived on November 29.  All personnel were removed by December 1.  It is to be noted that on Thanksgiving evening a traditional Thanksgiving turkey dinner was delivered by helicopter to the troops in Laos per order of then-President Lyndon Johnson. The operation began at coordinates YA 747922 and the final extraction in Laos was at coordinates YB 726078. [39]
