Pictures and television reports indicated extensive structural damage throughout the Cancún area, as well as significant flooding and many downed trees, power lines and scattered debris. Several homes had also collapsed. Rainfall amounts in excess of 23 inches (590 mm) were reported in several areas, with Isla Mujeres reporting 64 inches (1,625.6 mm)—five times what Hurricane Gilbert dropped.[20] The station recorded 64.33 inches (1,633.98 mm) over 24 hours, setting a western hemisphere record for the greatest rainfall in that time period.[21] One gymnasium used as a shelter lost its roof, which forced the evacuation of more than 1,000 people staying there.[19] During the storm, waves five to eight meters high (enough to reach the third floor of many hotels) slammed against the coastline.[22] Damage was extensive as well on Cozumel, with many broken windows, fallen trees and power lines, but less structural damage. It was comparable to the scene after Hurricane Emily back in July 2005, a storm of similar intensity at landfall, but faster moving.
