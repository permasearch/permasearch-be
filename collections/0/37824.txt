Manuel "Manny" Heffley is Greg and Rodrick's younger brother. He is an annoying, spoiled child who is constantly doted on by his mother. He makes a great number of demands and throws temper tantrums if they are not fulfilled. Among Manny's most well-known characteristics are his refusal to be toilet-trained and his complete inability to remain in nursery school. He frequently damages Greg's property, and uses his age as an excuse for doing so. Whenever they go on vacations, Manny ends up ruining it and gets away with it. The excessive coddling he receives from his parents infuriates Greg. He also takes advantage of his overindulgence. It is revealed in The Third Wheel that Manny has imaginary friends, whom he blames for his misbehavior. Despite his very young age and spoiled attitude, Manny shows signs of actually possessing more intelligence than he appears to have. He surprises his family by his ability to speak Spanish in The Long Haul, but plays this to his advantage by persuading some Mexican men to take them to retrieve their pet pig. He is his grandmother's favorite, although she denies this. In the three movies based on the first four books, Manny is portrayed by Connor and Owen Fielding. In the movie, Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul, he is portrayed by Wyatt and Dylan Walters.
