The behavioral science and social sciences have long suffered from the problem of their studies being largely not being reproducible.[18] Now, biomedicine has come under similar pressures.[19] In a phenomenon known as the replication crisis, journals are less likely to publish straight replication studies so it may be difficult to disprove results.[20] Another result of publication bias is the Proteus phenomenon: early attempts to replicate results tend to contradict them.[21] However, there are claims that this bias may be beneficial, allowing accurate meta-analysis with fewer publications.[22]
