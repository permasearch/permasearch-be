Technicians undercut the rod or journals to eliminate wear before buildup. Further buildup and corrosion is typically prevented via thermal spraying, which involves protrusion of molten particles onto the heated metallic surface, forming a smooth coating interwoven into the structure. Typically, boron alloys are used for this process, as they very dense, hard, and oxide-free. They prevent against abrasive materials that cause divots, scratches, and cracks, and prevent surface erosion and corrosion.
