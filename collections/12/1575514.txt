The Queen's University Belfast Series was first issued in 2003. This issue features a representation of Hibernia on the front, alongside shields of arms of the six counties of Northern Ireland. The back of this note displays an image of Queen's University Belfast. In 2008 a new series featuring the image of the Old Bushmills Distillery on the reverse was introduced. Apart from this change of rear design the difference between this note and the preceding series is minimal. The design of the Â£5 note was tweaked in 2013, with slight changes of the front design taking place. The 2013 note also features an image of the Bushmills Distillery on the reverse.[3]
