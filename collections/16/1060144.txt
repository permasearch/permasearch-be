Due to Mourinho preferring Ronaldo and Higuaín as his forwards,[97] Benzema began the campaign as a substitute coming off the bench in the team's opening league match of the season against Mallorca.[99] Following the September international break, he made his first start in a 1–0 win over Osasuna.[100] On 21 September, Benzema made a substitute appearance and scored his first goal of the season in a 3–0 home win against Espanyol.[101] Afterwards, the striker failed to score a domestic goal for nearly two months. The striker did assist on goals in back-to-back weeks against Hércules in the league and Milan in the Champions League.[102][103]
