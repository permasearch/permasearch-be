In order to minimize and prevent any residues of antibiotics in chicken meat, any chickens given antibiotics are required to have a "withdrawal" period before they can be slaughtered. Samples of poultry at slaughter are randomly tested by the FSIS, and show a very low percentage of residue violations.[73] Although violations are minimal, these small amounts of antibiotics have still contributed to antibiotic resistant outbreaks in the U.S.  There are five infectious agents that account for 90% of foodborne related deaths.  Three consistently found in poultry are: Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Escherichia coli.[74]
