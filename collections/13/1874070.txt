On the other hand,      R  spatial    (     n ^    ,  360  ∘    )  = + 1   {\displaystyle R_{\text{spatial}}\left({\hat {n}},360^{\circ }\right)=+1}   in all circumstances, because a 360° rotation of a spatial configuration is the same as no rotation at all. (This is different from a 360° rotation of the internal (spin) state of the particle, which might or might not be the same as no rotation at all.) In other words, the      R  spatial     {\displaystyle R_{\text{spatial}}}   operators carry the structure of SO(3), while     R   {\displaystyle R}   and      R  internal     {\displaystyle R_{\text{internal}}}   carry the structure of SU(2).
