First, the initial box score did NOT show 10 assists. The initial showed 9. Since it was so close, the Rockets went back to check the tape to see if an assist was missed. After watching the tape, they decided he had 10 assists so they changed it. However, the league said they could not change it after the fact. The actual box score still reads 29, 18, 10, and 11, at least from the data basketball-reference.com has but it is not an official quadruple double. His actual career stats, I believe, reflect him getting 10 assists that game. Aug 13, 2006, Geoff
