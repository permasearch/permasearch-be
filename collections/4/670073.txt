Stromatolites are layered accretionary structures formed in shallow water by the trapping, binding and cementation of sedimentary grains by biofilms of microorganisms, especially cyanobacteria.[29] Stromatolites provide some of the most ancient fossil records of life on Earth, dating back more than 3.5 billion years ago.[30]
