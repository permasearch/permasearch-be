Some 260,000 acres (1,100Â km2) are planted with cassava.[13] Cassava is native to the Latin American and Caribbean region[14] and is grown in almost every country of the region. Cuba is the second largest producer of cassava in the Caribbean with a production of 300,000 t (2001).[15] However, the yield per hectare is the lowest of all Caribbean countries. Most of Cuba's production is used directly for fresh consumption.[16] Part of the cassava is processed to sorbitol in a plant near Florida, Central Cuba.[17]
