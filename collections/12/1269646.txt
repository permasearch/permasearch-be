McCormick married Michael Cummings on March 16, 1985, who had heard of The Brady Bunch but had never seen it at the time. They fell in love upon meeting in a church.[17] McCormick and Cummings have one child, Natalie Michelle, born May 19, 1989. The family lives in Westlake Village, northwest of Los Angeles. After getting married, McCormick went through a series of interventions, stints in rehab, and experimental therapies. She says that treatment with psychologist Eugene Landy set her back. She began to get sober after marrying, but she still suffered from depression and paranoia. She once threatened to jump from a balcony in front of her husband.[17] She and her husband were at first wary of medication, but McCormick has been treated with antidepressant medication such as Prozac since the 1990s. McCormick also said that she was helped by her friendships with former Brady Bunch cast members.[2][7]
