In Ireland notaries public cannot agree on a standard fee due to competition law. In practice the price per signature appears to be â‚¬65. A cheaper alternative is to visit a commissioner for oaths who will charge less per signature, but that is only possible where whomever is to receive a document will recognize the signature of a commissioner for oaths.
