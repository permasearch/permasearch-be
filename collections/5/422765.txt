Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors,[28][29] New York City consists of five boroughs, each of which is a separate county of New York State.[30] The five boroughs – Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, The Bronx, and Staten Island – were consolidated into a single city in 1898.[31] The city and its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States,[32] and as many as 800 languages are spoken in New York,[33][34][35] making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world.[34][36][37] New York City is home to more than 3.2 million residents born outside the United States,[38] the largest foreign-born population of any city in the world.[39] In 2013, the tri-state New York Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) produced a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of nearly US$1.4 trillion.[40] If New York City were a country, it would have the 12th highest GDP in the world.[41]
