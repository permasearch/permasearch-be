In February 2012 the Membership approved the first major revision to the FSC P&C, in order to bring its certification up to date.[22] The review and revision of the FSC P&C began in 2008 and gathered feedback from many FSC members and other stakeholders.[23] This revision also marked the start of a process of developing baseline requirements for each of the revised Criteria;[22] These requirements - called International Generic Indicators (IGIs) - are intended to ensure consistent application of the FSC P&C across all countries. Where national standards are not currently established, the IGIs will be used as interim standards.
