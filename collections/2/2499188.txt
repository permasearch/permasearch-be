Like previous singles "Jar of Hearts" and "Arms", "Human" is largely built around a piano melody and showcases her voice.[6] It is a pop power ballad written in key Ab major, and features a strong build-up towards the chorus.[7][8]  The song features a string arrangement by notable arranger David Campbell. Critics have compared Perri's honest, heart-on-her-sleeve songwriting to that of Taylor Swift.[6] Lyrically, "Human" uses relatable yet specific details to describe the vulnerability of being human. The verses find Perri musing the things she would do for love, yet as she sings in the chorus, "I'm only human / And I bleed when I fall down."
