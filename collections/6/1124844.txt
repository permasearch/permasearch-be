The Liturgy of the Hours uses one canticle from the Old Testament each day at Lauds, "each weekday of the four-week cycle [has] its own proper canticle and on Sunday the two sections of the Canticle of the Three Children may be alternated".[1] The liturgy prior to the reform after the II Vatican Council used fourteen Old Testament canticles, having two weekly cycles.
