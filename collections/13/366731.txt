Jamie Lee Curtis's performance was singled out for praise by many critics. David Ansen of Newsweek noted that, "the most startling metamorphosis is Curtis' transformation from fading horror-flick queen to dazzling comedienne. She goes on a teenage tear—tormenting Anna's younger brother (who wonders why Mom's acting so weird), getting down and dirty on a TV talk show where Tess is supposed to discuss her book on aging—with fiercely funny conviction."[8] Lisa Schwarzbaum from Entertainment Weekly called her performance "glorious,"[9] and A. O. Scott from The New York Times contended that she "does some of her best work ever [in Freaky Friday]."[10] Nick Davis described her as "so frisky and pouty and incandescent in Freaky Friday, she made the whole movie feel like something special."[11] Her performance was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.
