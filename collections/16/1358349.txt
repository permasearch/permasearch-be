The music did not resonate with everyone. Leonard Bernstein remarked "the songs are just laundry lists"[107] and walked out of the production.[108] Richard Rodgers could only hear the beat and called it "one-third music".[107] John Fogerty said, "Hair is such a watered down version of what is really going on that I can't get behind it at all."[109] Gene Lees, writing for High Fidelity, stated that John Lennon found it "dull", and he wrote, "I do not know any musician who thinks it's good."[96]
