NLOS links may either be simplex (transmission is in one direction only), duplex (transmission is in both directions simultaneously) or half-duplex (transmission is possible in both directions but not simultaneously). Under normal conditions, all radio links, including NLOSl are reciprocalâ€”which means that the effects of the propagation conditions on the radio channel are identical whether it operates in simplex, duplex, or half-duplex.[5] Please remember that propagation conditions on different frequencies are different, so traditional duplex with different uplink and downlink frequencies is not necessarily reciprocal.
