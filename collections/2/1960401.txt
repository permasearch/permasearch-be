GO Transit offers four passenger fare classes: adult, senior, child, and student. Senior fares are available for passengers over the age of 65, while child fares are available for passengers between the ages of 6 and 12. Passengers between the ages of 1 and 5 ride free with an accompanying adult, but each adult may only ride with one child for free in this manner; any unaccompanied child must pay child fares. Passengers under the age of 1 always ride free on GO Transit.
