An amphetamine overdose can lead to many different symptoms, but is rarely fatal with appropriate care.[1][51][69] The severity of overdose symptoms increases with dosage and decreases with drug tolerance to amphetamine.[41][51] Tolerant individuals have been known to take as much as 5 grams of amphetamine in a day, which is roughly 100 times the maximum daily therapeutic dose.[51] Symptoms of a moderate and extremely large overdose are listed below; fatal amphetamine poisoning usually also involves convulsions and coma.[49][41] In 2013, overdose on amphetamine, methamphetamine, and other compounds implicated in an "amphetamine use disorder" resulted in an estimated 3,788 deaths worldwide (3,425–4,145 deaths, 95% confidence).[note 3][70]
