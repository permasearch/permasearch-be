Among Pink Pearl's descendants is 'Pink Princess', a carmine-striped apple with pink to dark pink flesh. It was originally named 'Pink Lady' by its developer, Fred Jansen of Ontario, Canada, but Jansen did not patent the name and it was subsequently taken over for a quite different Australian apple, forcing Jansen to change the name of his own apple.[5]
