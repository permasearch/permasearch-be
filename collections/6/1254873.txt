Apart from small formal battles, there were 29 Confederate raids into Kansas during the war.[20] The most serious episode came when Lawrence, Kansas came under attack on August 21, 1863, by guerrillas led by William Clarke Quantrill. It was in part retaliation for "Jayhawker" raids against pro-Confederate settlements in Missouri.[21][22][23]
