By this law, or amended charter of Lansingburgh, the inhabitants of the village were accorded additional privileges and new duties were defined for them. Provision was made for new village ordinances relative to markets, streets, drainage, fire department, liquor license and many other matters, all of which were left in the hands of the new trustees.
