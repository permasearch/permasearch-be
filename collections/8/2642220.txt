On August 6, 1985, Ramirez drove to Northridge and broke into the home of Chris and Virginia Peterson.[65][66] Ramirez crept into the bedroom, startling Virginia, 27, prompting him to shoot her in the face with a .25 caliber semi-automatic handgun.[67] He then shot Chris Peterson in the temple and attempted to flee; Chris Peterson fought back while avoiding being hit by two more shots during the struggle before Ramirez managed to escape.[68] The couple survived their injuries.[69]
