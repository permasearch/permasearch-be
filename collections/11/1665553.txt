The Tar Heel wrestling program boasts many ACC champions, All-Americans, and has 3 individual NCAA champions: C.D. Mock (1982), Rob Koll (1988), and T.J. Jaworsky (1993, 1994, 1995). Jaworsky is known as one of the greatest college wrestlers of all time as he is the first and only ACC wrestler to win three NCAA titles in addition to winning the inaugural Dan Hodge Trophy, given to college wrestling's most dominant wrestler. Koll is now the head coach at Cornell University where he has led the program to new heights with multiple top 10 NCAA finishes.
