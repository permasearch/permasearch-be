The concept of a global temperature is commonly used in climatology, and denotes the average temperature of the Earth based on surface,[5] near-surface or tropospheric measurements. These temperature records and measurements are typically acquired using the satellite or ground instrumental temperature measurements, then usually compiled using a database or computer model. Long-term global temperatures in paleoclimate are discerned using proxy data.
