Due to the inconsistent findings in GWAS, multiple studies have undertaken the approach of analyzing SNPs in biological pathways. Signaling pathways traditionally associated with bipolar disorder that have been supported by these studies include CRH signaling, cardiac Î²-adrenergic signaling, Phospholipase C signaling, glutamate receptor signaling,[43] cardiac hypertrophy signaling, Wnt signaling, Notch signaling,[44] and endothelin 1 signaling. Of the 16 genes identified in these pathways, three were found to be dysregulated in the DLPFC in post-mortem studies, CACNA1C, GNG2, and ITPR2.[45]
