The Bath Roman Temple stood on a podium more than two metres above the surrounding courtyard, approached by a flight of steps. On the approach there were four large, fluted Corinthian columns supporting a frieze and decorated pediment above. The pediment, parts of which are displayed in the museum, is the triangular ornamental section, 26 feet (7.9 m) wide and 8 feet (2.4 m) from the apex to the bottom,[24] above the pillars on the front of the building. It featured the very powerful central image of the Gorgon’s head glowering down from a height of 15 metres on all who approached the temple.The great head itself has snakes entwined within its beard, wings above its ears, beetling brows and a heavy moustache[25] although there is some controversy about what this really represents as Gorgons are usually female.[26] An alternative interpretation sees the central head as the image of a water god such as the image of Oceanus,[27] and yet another as a Celtic sun god.[10] In early 2010 various stones on the pediment were conserved and rearranged.[28]
