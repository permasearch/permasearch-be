By tradition, youths are privately allowed to drink alcohol after their confirmation.[66] If a shop or bar fails to ask for an ID card and is identified having sold alcohol to an underage, it is subject to fine. A national ID card, obtained in the local town hall, can serve as age verification.[67] This card is rarely used though since a passport or moped-licence can sometimes be used.[68]
