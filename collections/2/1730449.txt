In recent years pubs and supermarkets have come under increasing pressure from the government to prevent the sale of alcohol to under 18s.[6] Currently the law comes down much heavier on those selling the alcohol than those illegally buying it.[7] The police regularly send young people who appear underage into pubs to try to purchase alcohol.[8] Pubs, managers and staff members face fines for being caught. Repeat offenders face a risk of losing their licence.[9][10] Pubs are responding by training their staff to ask people for proof of age if they can't immediately tell if a customer is old enough and as a way of encouraging vigilance are likely to sack staff members who get caught selling alcohol to underage people by the police.[11]
