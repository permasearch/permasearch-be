Debbie is now seemingly in a relationship with a man called Mark, whom she met on a night out with Maxine Donnelly (Joanna Higson) and when she got drunk, he took her back to his student residence to sleep, but nothing more. Debbie left the students room the next morning, thinking that she'd never see him again. However, at a funeral the family had been invited to, they met again, and she discovered it was his Grandmothers funeral.
