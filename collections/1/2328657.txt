Although glycine can be isolated from hydrolyzed protein, this is not used for industrial production, as it can be manufactured more conveniently by chemical synthesis.[9] The two main processes are amination of chloroacetic acid with ammonia, giving glycine and ammonium chloride,[10] and the Strecker amino acid synthesis,[11] which is the main synthetic method in the United States and Japan.[12] About 15 thousand tonnes are produced annually in this way.[13]
