In the episode "Pleasant Little Kingdom", the residents of Wisteria Lane see a sign announcing that a halfway house for former prisoners will locate in the neighborhood. At a neighborhood meeting to stop this plan, Paul reveals he bought several houses in the neighborhood, and intends to buy more, in order to control the vote on whether the facility should locate there. Paul claims that he wants other prisoners to experience the warmth such a neighborhood offers, which may keep them from returning to prison. In reality, he seems pleased to watch the neighbors bickering. He tells everyone he owns enough houses to open his center and that the mayor will be giving him a special award for it. In the episode "Down the Block There's a Riot", Lynette Scavo organizes a protest with aid from neighboring communities but it turns into a riot, causing mass fighting and destruction on the Lane. Paul always knew this would happen and planned it. When Lynette tells him that it is all his fault, Paul asks her "What makes them better than a bunch of ex-cons?" Paul walks around the Lane at night, celebrating his triumph, and is shot by an unknown assailant.
