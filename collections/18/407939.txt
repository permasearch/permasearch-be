All 5.7-liter Tundras come equipped with a tow package which includes engine oil and transmission coolers, integrated trailer hitch, 4.30:1 axle ratio, and large braking hardware for increased fade resistance. Equipped with the 5.7-liter V8 the Tundra has a maximum tow rating of 9,000–10,400 lb (4,100–4,700 kg) depending on body configuration.
