Due to a change in the state law which disqualified aliens from teaching in public and private schools, the Bernadine madames left Nebraska City in 1920. The sisters were replaced at Saint Bernard's Academy by the Ursuline Sisters of Kentucky that same year. In 1927, the Ursuline Sisters assumed responsibility for Saint Benedict's School as well. A new Saint Benedict's School building was erected by the sisters and the members of Saint Benedict's Parish in 1951. The structure now houses the present Lourdes primary grades.
