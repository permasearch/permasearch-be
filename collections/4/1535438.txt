The remains of the ziggurat were first discovered by William Loftus in 1850.[6] The first excavations at the site were conducted by John George Taylor (mistakenly credited as "J. E. Taylor")[7] in the 1850s, leading to the identification of the site as Ur. After World War I, preliminary excavations were performed by Reginald Campbell Thompson and Henry Hall. The site was extensively excavated in the 1920s by Sir Leonard Woolley by appointment of the University Museum of the University of Pennsylvania and the British Museum in the period of 1922 to 1934.
