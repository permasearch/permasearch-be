The building was originally constructed in 1914 as a clubhouse for German migrants. During World War I, the clubhouse was leased to YMCA. In 1919, it was sold to the Plaridel Temple Association, an exclusive corporation of Masons. The Plaridel Masonic Temple property was handed to the Grand Lodge of the Philippines Islands in 1937 and had it improved a year after during the incumbency of Justice Jose Abad Santos, the Grandmaster.
