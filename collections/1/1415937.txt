According to the Quran, the basic criterion for salvation in the afterlife is the belief in one God (tawḥīd), Angels of God, revealed books of God, all messengers of God, as well as repentance to God, and doing good deeds. Though one must do good deeds and believe in God, salvation can only be attained through God's judgment.[16]
