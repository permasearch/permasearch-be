Many hens confined to battery cages, and some raised in cage-free conditions, are debeaked to prevent them from harming each other and cannibalism. According to critics of the practice, this can cause hens severe pain to the point where some may refuse to eat and starve to death. Some hens may be force molted to increase egg quality and production level after the molting.[84] Molting can be induced by extended feed withdrawal, water withdrawal or controlled lighting programs.
