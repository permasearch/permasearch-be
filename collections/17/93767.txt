In the matches for the twelve competition rounds, the team who plays at home is decided when the fixtures are drawn â€“ simply the first team drawn out for each fixture. Occasionally games may have to be moved to other grounds due to other events taking place, security reasons or a ground not being suitable to host popular teams. In the event of a draw, the replay is played at the ground of the team who originally played away from home.
