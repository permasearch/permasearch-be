A black triangle (within the standard down-arrow-shape of stop signs) was a symbol of "stop for all vehicles" from about 1925 in Germany. The triangular yield sign was used as early as 1938 when it was codified in Czechoslovakia in a blue-white variant without words[1] and in 1939 in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia which adopted the current red-white variant.[2] In the United States, the first yield sign was erected in 1950 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, designed by Tulsa police officer Clinton Riggs;[3] [4][5] Riggs invented only the sign, not the rule, which was already in place.[6] Riggs' original design was shaped like a keystone; later versions bore the shape of an inverted equilateral triangle in common use today.
