The first generation of the new Mini received a facelift in July 2004 for the upcoming 2005 model year. This was also when the new convertible was introduced; it was never available with the pre-facelift design. Aside from minor design changes (mostly up front) and improved equipment, the Rover R65 manual gearbox replaced a Getrag five-speed.[12]
