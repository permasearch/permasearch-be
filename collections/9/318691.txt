John Waters wrote the screenplay under the title of White Lipstick, with the story loosely based on real events. The Corny Collins Show is based on the real-life Buddy Deane Show, a local dance party program which pre-empted Dick Clark's American Bandstand in the Baltimore area during the 1950s and early 1960s.[5] Waters had previously written about The Buddy Deane Show in his 1983 book Crackpot: The Obsessions of John Waters.
