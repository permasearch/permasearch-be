SeaLink has outlasted several competing companies since it began operations. Boat Torque, a Western Australian company, operated Superflyte from 1994 until 1997, sailing from Glenelg to Kingscote. Kangaroo Island Ferries had a short-lived venture with SeaWay, which travelled from Wirrina Cove to Kingscote from September 2004 until February 2005. SeaWay could not handle rough weather as well as SeaLink vessels which impacted the service's reliability. Under different proprietorship, SeaWay recommenced services in August 2007.[33] However, in May 2008, the operator of SeaWay announced suspension of services until October 2008, citing increased fuel prices.[34] In June 2008 the SeaWay's operating company was placed in administration and the vessel advertised for sale.[35]
