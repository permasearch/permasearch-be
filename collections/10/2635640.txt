Several early authors believed the frilled shark to be a living representative of otherwise long-extinct groups of elasmobranchs (sharks, rays, and their ancestors), based on its multiple-pointed teeth, the articulation of its upper jaw directly to the cranium behind the eyes (called "amphistyly"), and its "notochord-like" spinal column with indistinct vertebrae.[7] Garman proposed that it was allied with the cladodonts, a now-obsolete taxonomic grouping containing forms that thrived during the Palaeozoic era, such as Cladoselache from the Devonian period (416â€“359 Mya). His contemporaries Theodore Gill and Edward Drinker Cope suggested it was instead related to the hybodonts, which were the dominant sharks during the Mesozoic era. Cope went as far as to assign this species to the fossil genus Didymodus.[8][9]
