During Bush's second term, a controversy arose over the Justice Department's midterm dismissal of seven United States Attorneys.[203] The White House maintained that the U.S. attorneys were fired for poor performance.[204] Attorney General Alberto Gonzales later resigned over the issue, along with other senior members of the Justice Department.[205][206] The House Judiciary Committee issued subpoenas for advisers Harriet Miers and Josh Bolten to testify regarding this matter, but Bush directed Miers and Bolten to not comply with those subpoenas, invoking his right of executive privilege. Bush maintained that all of his advisers were protected under a broad executive privilege protection to receive candid advice. The Justice Department determined that the President's order was legal.[207]
