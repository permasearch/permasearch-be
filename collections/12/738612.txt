There are hundreds of commercially available pigments for visual artists to use and mix (in various media such as oil, watercolor, acrylic, and pastel). A common approach is to use just a limited palette of primary pigments[9] (often between four and eight) that can be physically mixed to any color that the artist desires in the final work. There are no specific set of pigments that are primary colors, the choice of pigment depends entirely on the artist's subjective preference of subject and style of art as well as material considerations like lightfastness and mixing heuristics. Contemporary classical realists have often advocated that a limited palette of white, red, yellow, and black pigment (often described as the "Zorn palette") is sufficient for compelling work.[10]
