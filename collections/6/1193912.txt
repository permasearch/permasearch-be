Kodak created an advertising campaign in 1975 that featured Anka singing a jingle entitled "Times of Your Life". While the tune was being heard across the United States in a commercial, Anka decided to record and release it as a single in late 1975. The song became a hit in the U.S., reaching number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in February 1976 and remaining in the Top 40 for 12 weeks.[3] The previous month, "Times of Your Life" had spent one week atop the Billboard easy listening (adult contemporary) chart, Anka's only recording to do so.[4]
