This period also saw Levallois flint tools introduced, possibly by humans arriving from Africa. However, finds from Swanscombe and Botany Pit in Purfleet support Levallois technology being a European rather than African introduction. The more advanced flint technology permitted more efficient hunting and therefore made Britain a more worthwhile place to remain until the following period of cooling known as the Wolstonian Stage, 352,000–130,000 years ago. Britain first became an island about 350,000 years ago.[6] Early Neanderthal remains discovered at the Pontnewydd Cave in Wales have been dated to 230,000 BP,[7] and are the most north westerly Neanderthal remains found anywhere in the world.
