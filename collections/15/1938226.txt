"Yellow Flicker Beat" lasts for a duration of 3:52 (three minutes and fifty-two seconds).[7] The Sydney Morning Herald's reviewer Bernard Zuel characterised it as an electropop song and noted the electronic production on the song.[10] Meanwhile, Billboard's Jason Lipshutz shared that the track explored Lorde's art pop sensibilities.[11] The song features Lorde's "brooding croon" over minimal synthesisers and rattling drums.[12] Alex Young and Michelle Geslani from Consequence of Sound labelled the song a throwback to Lorde's debut album Pure Heroine (2013).[13] Brennan Carley from Spin compared the style of "Yellow Flicker Beat" to that of Pure Heroine (2013) for the "typically sweeping themes and moody, electronically enhanced melodies." He eventually draw comparisons between the track and "Biting Down" (from The Love Club EP).[14] Lipshutz wrote that the hook from the song reminded of Lorde's "Team" (2013).[11]
