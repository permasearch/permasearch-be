Because cracked nipples can result in the infant being exposed to blood, women with certain blood-borne diseases may be advised to stop breastfeeding if they have a cracked nipple. It has been found safe for breastfeeding mothers with hepatitis B and cracked nipples to breastfeed.[11] In the event that a nursing woman experiences cracked and bleeding nipples or breast inflammation within one to two weeks immediately following an acute Toxoplasmosis infection (when the organism is still circulating in her bloodstream), it is theoretically possible that she could transmit Toxoplasma gondii to the infant through her breast milk. Immune suppressed women could have circulating Toxoplasma for even longer periods of time. However, the likelihood of human milk transmission is very small.[12] Transmission risk of HIV increases if the mother has cracked and bleeding nipples[13][2] An uncommon infection in the mother, Chagas disease, can be transmitted to the nursing infant via cracked nipples.[14] Women with hepatitis C are advised to abstain from breastfeeding if their nipples are cracked or bleeding.[15][16]
