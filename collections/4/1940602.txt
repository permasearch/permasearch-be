On February 1, 1984, in response to a request from New York Telephone, the New York Public Service Commission voted to create a new area code to serve Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. Previously, all of New York City had been served by area code 212 for 37 years. Despite protests from some local officials and state lawmakers, the commission was persuaded by New York Telephone's reasoning that a new area code was needed to "prevent an impending exhaustion of telephone numbers."[1] The new area code 718 entered service on September 1, 1984. The split was implemented in a way so that the city's then-three million numbers were split roughly in half. Permissive dialing of 212 continued across New York City until January 1, 1985.[1]
