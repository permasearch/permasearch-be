Later, April learns from Caroline where Rebekah is and un-daggers her. With April's help, Rebekah takes Elena, Stefan and Caroline prisoner so that she can learn what progress they have made in finding the cure. After toying with them and finding out what she wants, she releases them. Stefan later approaches her where she states she still wishes to find the cure so she can use it on Klaus. Stefan then proposes the two work together to get the cure since they are the only two without an edge since Klaus has the sword, Damon is with Jeremy, and Bonnie is working with Professor Shane. In the episode "A View to Kill" Rebekah and Stefan work together to find the headstone of the first immortal creature. She then convinces him to stop caring about Elena and the two have sex.
