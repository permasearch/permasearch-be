The song debuted in the UK at number one on 10 January 2010, selling over 106,000 copies in its first week, the highest sale for any new year release since Michelle McManus sold 118,000 copies of "All This Time" in the equivalent week in January 2004.[4] It is also the first number-one single of the 2010s (not counting Lady Gaga's "Bad Romance" which also reached number-one in 2009). After two weeks at number one on the UK Singles Chart and six weeks at the top of the UK R&B Chart, "Replay" was succeeded by Owl City's "Fireflies" and Rihanna's "Rude Boy", respectively. It was the first song released in 2010 in the UK to be certified Gold with sales in excess of 400,000.[5] In June 2010, it was announced that "Replay" was the third highest selling single of the year in the UK at that point.
