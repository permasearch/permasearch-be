"Bang" was written by Courtney Kemp Agboh and directed by Rod Holcomb. The writers based the episode on the Ponzi scheme orchestrated by Bernard Madoff, who was sentenced to prison in 2009 after pleading guilty to defrauding thousands of clients out of billions of dollars with an investor fraud scheme. The anger expressed by onlookers at the Miles Wagner trial in The Good Wife reflected the passionate emotions the real-life Madoff scandal evoked.[3] "Bang" featured guest appearances by actors Alan Cumming and Gary Cole.[4] Some commentators suggested Cummings' character, Eli Gold, was based on White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel.[5][6] Both are political operatives from Chicago noted for bullying tactics and their use of foul language.[5][7]
