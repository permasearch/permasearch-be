The history of Hawaii's economy can be traced through a succession of dominant industries; sandalwood,[181] whaling,[182] sugarcane, pineapple, the military, tourism and education.[183] Hawaiian exports include food and clothing. These industries play a small role in the Hawaiian economy, due to the shipping distance to viable markets, such as the West Coast of the contiguous U.S. The state's food exports include coffee, macadamia nuts, pineapple, livestock, sugarcane and honey.[184] As of 2015[update], Honolulu was ranked high on world livability rankings, and was also ranked as the 2nd safest city in the U.S.[185][186]
