Capello's former assistant Stuart Pearce took charge for a friendly match against Netherlands, a match rescheduled from the previous summer, in which Netherlands won 3â€“2 and Scott Parker took the temporary role as captain. In that, the England home kits were changed again from blue and white to red and white, with the crest now in a complete red colour.
