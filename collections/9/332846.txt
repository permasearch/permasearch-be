Shortly before Typhoon Haiyan entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility on November 6, PAGASA raised Public Storm Warning Signal (PSWS) No.1, the lowest of four levels, for much of the Visayas and Mindanao.[33] As the storm continued to approach the country, warnings expanded into Luzon and increased in severity for eastern areas.[34] By the evening of November 7, PSWS No. 4, the highest level of warning which indicates winds in excess of 185 km/h (115 mph) are expected, was raised for Biliran Island, Eastern Samar, Leyte, Northern Cebu, Metro Cebu, Samar, and Southern Leyte.[35][36] Through November 8, the coverage of PSWS No. 4 continued to expand, with areas in southern Luzon being included.[37]
