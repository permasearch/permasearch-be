On May 4, 2011, Tess runs into Cutter again and they later decided to get married so they could continue their plot to steal the Buchanan's money. Meanwhile, Jessica is struggling with Bess, and tries to take control back from Tess. On May 11, 2011, Brody and Cutter argues with each other over Cutter's relationship with Jessica and Tess which causes her to split into a male alter, Wes (Wes is based on Brody's deceased fellow Navy SEAL friend Wes Granger and the equivalent of Viki's alter Tommy), who is meant to push all men away from Jessica. Wes leaves Cutter's hotel room and arrives at Capricorn, where he attempts to flirt with Aubrey and Rama. Cutter lures Wes back to the Minute Man Motel, and kisses him, attempting to get Tess back. Instead, Jessica returns, but Cutter (still trying to get Tess back) brings Wes back, who punches him and flees the hotel.
