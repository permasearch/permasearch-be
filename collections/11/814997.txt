On stage, Lopez is recognized for her showmanship and sex appeal,[271] and often includes costumes such as bodysuits as part of her performance.[272][273][274] Author Priscilla PeÃ±a Ovalle stated in Dance and the Hollywood Latina: Race, Sex and Stardom (2011) that Lopez was one of the Latin stars who "used dance to gain agency as working performers with mainstream careers, yet many of their roles paradoxically racialized and sexualized their bodies".[275] Troy Patterson of Entertainment Weekly also observed that she used her body for emphasis on stage, "She turned herself out as the fly girl hyperversion of postfeminist power, flaunting her control by toying with the threat of excess. In consequence, her star went supernova."[276] Her signature movements include "clock-wise pivoting with salsa hip circles and sequential torso undulations".[277] While being noted to lip sync in the early stages of career, Lopez's Dance Again World Tour was praised for showcasing live vocals and choreography synchronously.[278][279][280] In a review of her Las Vegas residency All I Have, Los Angeles Times writer Nolan Feeney called her "Queen of the Strip" and remarked that her dancing is "undoubtedly the centerpiece of the show".[271]
