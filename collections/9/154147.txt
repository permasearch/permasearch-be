During the (north) Polar Exploration of the early 20th century, Inughuit, northern Greenlandic Inuit, were found to be making iron knives from two particularly large nickel-iron meteors.[6] One of these meteors was taken to Washington, D.C., where it was remitted to the custody of the Smithsonian Institution.
