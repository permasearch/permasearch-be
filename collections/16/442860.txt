High pressure electrolysis is the electrolysis of water with a compressed hydrogen output around 120–200 Bar (1740–2900 psi).[10] By pressurising the hydrogen in the electrolyser, the need for an external hydrogen compressor is eliminated; the average energy consumption for internal compression is around 3%.[11]
