Two years later she joined a touring group, the West of England Theatre Company, for an eight-month stint. She was spotted by a producer, which led to her being cast as a schoolgirl in Blue Murder at St Trinian's in 1957.[6] That same year, she starred with her father, playing father and daughter, in the BBC production of Nicholas Nickleby.[7] An earlier film role, albeit uncredited, was as a lady-in-waiting in Laurence Olivier's film Richard III (1955), which also starred her father. She performed in two early Carry On films. In Carry On Nurse, she played Nurse Nightingale and in Carry On Teacher she played Felicity Wheeler, a prim school inspector whose amorous hopes toward Kenneth Connor's wimpy science master are continually thwarted.[1]
