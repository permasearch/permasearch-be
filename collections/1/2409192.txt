Burner allows users to make phone calls and VoIP calls and send SMS and MMS messages via phone numbers issued through the app.[12][13][14] Users can purchase credits for temporary numbers or add an additional line for an ongoing subscription fee.[15] The Burner Connections features, launched in October 2015, allow users to integrate their Burner numbers with third-party applications like Slack, Google Sheets, Dropbox, Evernote and SoundCloud.[16][17] This functionality allows people to automatically archive SMS messages and images, program auto-responses, sync voicemails and more. In November 2015, Burner launched a way for developers to connect the app with various applications, like IFTTT, or create new custom integrations through the use of webhooks.[18][19][20]
