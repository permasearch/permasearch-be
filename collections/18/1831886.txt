In New Zealand, the most common cultivar is the red (purple) cultivar called kumara (spelled kūmara in the Māori language), but orange ('Beauregard') and gold cultivars are also available.[7] Kumara is particularly popular as a roasted food, often served with sour cream and sweet chili sauce. Occasionally, shops in Australia will label purple cultivars as "purple sweet potato" to denote the difference to the other cultivars. About 95% of Australia's production is of the orange cultivar named 'Beauregard', originally from North America, known simply as "sweet potato". A reddish-purple cultivar, 'Northern Star', is 4% of production and is sold as "kumara".
