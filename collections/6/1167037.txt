The main runway (Code 3C) is fully grooved and 1,552 m (5,092 ft).[25]  In 2007 the airport re-surfaced, strengthened and widened the main runway, taxiways and aprons, and installed new airfield ground lighting and a CAT 1 instrument landing system (ILS). In early 2012, a new state-of-the-art Thales primary and secondary radar system was installed.  In 2008 a new £2.5m business aviation terminal was completed (FBO) and is operated by Oxfordjet.   The airport can handle aircraft up to and including the Boeing BBJ and Airbus ACJ series. For the business aviation operator, the airport is an approximately 60 minute drive time from the West End area of central London but offers helicopter shuttles in 25 minutes to central London's Battersea Heliport which is co-owned with London Oxford Airport.
