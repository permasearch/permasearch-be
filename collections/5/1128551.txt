"I Palindrome I" is a single by American alternative rock duo They Might Be Giants. The title track is one of three singles from Apollo 18, released in 1992 by Elektra Records. The song references numerous actual palindromes.[1] In a review of Apollo 18, Karen Schlosberg said that the lyrics to "I Palindrome I" sound like "Edgar Allan Poe and David Lynch meeting the Monkees".[2]
