"I Am Woman" has been used in TV commercials for a sports footwear chain and a female-oriented cable TV network, but a pitch about 2003 by Coors beer ("with a gigantic amount of money", Reddy says) was rebuffed. "I'm not in the drug-dealing business," she says. "I don't care how much money they offer me."[2] In 2006 Burger King featured a lyrically adjusted version of "I Am Woman" for a commercial titled "Manthem" extolling the virtues of large burgers over small "chick food" plates.[24][25]
