2015 - The first all-Queensland NRL Grand Final sparked talk of a Grand Final being held in Queensland in the near future.[citation needed] It was also notable as Brisbane Broncos ended their biggest drought from a Grand Final since entering the competition and it was Bennett's first year back since leaving the Broncos.[citation needed] It was also notable for North Queensland Cowboys winger Kyle Feldt scoring a try after the full-time siren to level the game at 16-all.[citation needed] After Jonathan Thurston missed the sideline conversion, he kicked a golden point field goal to win the Cowboys their first ever premiership in the first golden point grand final. It also ended Brisbane's undefeated streak in grand final's having won all six previous games.[citation needed]
