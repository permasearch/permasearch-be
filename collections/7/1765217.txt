Sinusoid sign is another M-mode finding indicating presence of pleural effusion. Due to the cyclical movement of the lung in inspiration and expiration, the motion-time tracing (M-mode) ultrasound shows a sinusoid appearance between the fluid and the line tissue. This finding indicates possibly but not with certainty, of a pleural effusion, empyema, blood in pleural space (Hemothorax).[6][7]
