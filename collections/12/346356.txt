The band's previous album, 1989's Mother's Milk would become the band's second album to enter in the Billboard 200, peaking at number 52 and at the time the biggest of their career.[4] Although the record was mildly successful, production was weighed down by producer Michael Beinhorn. He convinced Frusciante to play with an overall heavier tone, and instructed Kiedis to write lyrics that would be more radio viable, thus causing the band to feel restricted creatively.[5][6]
