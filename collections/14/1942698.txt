Illinois Loyalty is the main school song of the university. It was first performed on March 3, 1906 and is one of the oldest songs of its kind in the United States. The song was written by Thacher Howland Guild (1879-1914), instructor in rhetoric and a member of the bandâ€²s solo cornet section.[28] Due to the song's length, it is normally played only at the beginning, halftime, and end of football games.
