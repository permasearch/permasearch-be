Despite the agreement and ongoing negotiations, President Habyarimana, supported by the French government,[145] spent the subsequent months forging a "common front" against the RPF.[148] This included members of his own party and the CDR, and also factions from each of the other opposition parties in the power sharing coalition.[148] At the same time, other members of the same parties issued a statement in conjunction with the RPF, in which they condemned French involvement in the country and called for the Arusha process to be respected in full.[148] The hardline factions within the parties became known as Hutu Power, a movement which transcended party politics.[149] Apart from the CDR, there was no party that was exclusively part of the Power movement.[150] Instead, almost every party was split into "moderate" and "Power" wings, with members of both camps claiming to represent the legitimate leadership of that party.[150] Even the ruling party contained a Power wing, consisting of those who opposed Habyarimana's intention to sign a peace deal.[151] Several radical youth militia groups emerged, attached to the Power wings of the parties; these included the Interahamwe, which was attached to the ruling party,[152] and the CDR's Impuzamugambi.[153] The youth militia began actively carrying out massacres across the country.[154] The army trained the militias, sometimes in conjunction with the French, who were unaware of the fact that the training they provided was being used to perpetrate the mass killings.[153]
