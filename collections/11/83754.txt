New York's use of remand (pre-trial detention) and bail procedures have been criticized.[82] For example, New York is one of only four states that does not allow judges to consider public safety when making a bail determination.[82] And almost without exception, New York judges only set two kinds of bail at arraignment, straight cash or commercial bail bond, while other options exist such as partially secured bonds, which only require a tenth of the full amount as a down payment, and unsecured bonds, which don't require any up front payment.[83][84][85] The Court of Appeals ruled in 1991 that most people arrested must be released if they are not arraigned within 24 hours,[86] and in 2013, for the first time since 2001, the average time it took to arraign defendants fell below 24 hours in all five boroughs of New York City.[87] But there have been accusations of systematic trial delays,[88][89] especially with regards to the New York City stop-and-frisk program.[90] There have also been allegations that excessive pre-trial detention and systematic trial delays are used to pressure defendants to accept plea bargains.[84][91][92]
