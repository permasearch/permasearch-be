Plinkett has been described as "cranky", a "schizophrenic", and "psychotic"[4][5] with a voice that has been called "a cross between Dan Aykroyd in The Blues Brothers and The Silence of the Lambs' Buffalo Bill".[4][6] The character has also been described as illiterate. He mispronounces words like "protagonist", and brags that he has never read a book and has no intention of doing so. He also displays ignorance of history, as shown by his confusion of the Cuban Missile Crisis with World War I, and the Nazi invasion of France with the French Revolution. Through side comments in narration, flashes of disturbing images, and cuts to live scenes filmed by Red Letter Media, Plinkett is implied to have murdered his various ex-wives. Glimpses of human remains and hostages seen in his basement indicate he may be a serial killer.[3][5] Plinkett has said he is 119 years old and claimed to have been aboard the Titanic when it sank. He claims to have had a disappointing son who hanged himself in a gas station bathroom, and an "adopted" son he kidnapped from a grocery store parking lot. Plinkett also has a fondness for Totino's Pizza Rolls, and encourages feedback by promising to mail one to viewers who leave comments on his "webzone". While seeming oafish and moronic, Plinkett appears to demonstrate an astute understanding of film history and criticism, referencing numerous other films. His voice and other traits were intended to incorporate a sense of humor to avoid making the reviewer sound too much like a "nerd" or "armchair critic".[3] Plinkett seems to live, or at least have lived, in Teaneck, New Jersey, having made references to its police department (in his Star Trek review) and the Cedar Lanes Cinema (in his Revenge of the Sith review). He also has a fondness for gambling in Atlantic City; some reviews give his mailing address as a slot machine at a casino there.
