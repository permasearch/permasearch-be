Office Depot was founded in October 1986 by F. Patrick Sher, the former chairman and chief executive officer; Stephen Dougherty, the president; and Jack Kopkin, the executive vice president. All three were formerly associated with Mr. HOW Warehouse, a home improvement company that Sher sold to Service Merchandise in 1983. The company opened its first store at Lakes Mall in Lauderdale Lakes, Florida in October 1986.[3]
