Ten teams were formed for the inaugural season in 2008, five each from Australia and New Zealand. All ten teams remain in the competition. Each of the ten teams represents long-established regional netball organisations. The Australian teams represent the five largest Australian states, while the five New Zealand teams represent groupings of adjacent regions.
