Gudetama (ぐでたま, Gudetama) is a Sanrio character who debuted in 2013. The character is the yolk of an unfertilized egg, devoid of gender.[50] Gudetama is often depicted reclining on an egg white or as an ingredient in a Japanese dish. Gudetama’s main trait is laziness. The name Gudetama is derived from the Japanese words for lazy (ぐでぐで, gude gude) and egg (卵, tamago).[51] Gudetama debuted following a contest run by Sanrio to introduce new characters based on Japanese food, in which Gudetama came second to Kirimi-chan.[52] Gudetama has proven popular in Japan, leading to the opening of a number of themed pop-up cafes serving egg-related dishes.[53] A plentiful selection of character goods are also available, ranging from stationery to confectionery to toys. Gudetama goods have been sold at a number of dedicated pop-up stores across Japan.
