The series' music theme combined the fanfare from the original series theme by Alexander Courage with Jerry Goldsmith's theme for Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979). Some early episodes' plots derived from outlines created for Star Trek: Phase II.[6] Additionally, some sets used in the Original Series-era films were redressed for The Next Generation, and in turn used for subsequent Original Series films.[15] Part of the transporter room set in TNG was used in the original Star Trek's transporter set.[15] Many production details, such as LCARS computer interfaces and starship design, were carried through in the production of subsequent spin-offs.
