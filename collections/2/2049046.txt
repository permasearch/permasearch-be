In March 1976, the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL), called for an equal age of consent of 14 in Britain. The submission to the Criminal Law Revision Committee generated extensive newspaper coverage. While the report recognised the merits of abolishing the age of consent, it proposed retaining a prohibition on sex under the age of 14 "as a compromise with public attitudes",[26] stating that "although it is both logical and consistent with modern knowledge about child development, to suggest that the age of consent should be abolished, we fear that, given the present state of public attitudes on this topic, it will not be politically possible to abolish the age of consent".[27] They also argued that "childhood sexual experiences, willingly engaged in, with an adult result in no identifiable damage", and suggested that more harm was caused when the children retold their experiences in court or to the press. The submission was signed by Harriet Harman, who later became leader of the House of Commons and deputy leader of the Labour Party.[28]
