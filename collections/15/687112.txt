"Get Me Bodied" received acclaim from music critics who praised its party sound and Beyoncé's vocals. Chris Richards of The Washington Post referred to the track a "club-hungry come-ons" with a "dexterous melody". He further stated that the "skeletal" track "keeps Beyoncé tethered to the ground".[22] Jody Rosen of Entertainment Weekly commented that "a piddly home hi-fi can hardly capture the thunderous grandeur of 'Get Me Bodied,' which sets Beyoncé's harmonies above a pummeling track overseen by rap producer Swiss Beatz".[23] Tim Finney of Pitchfork Media called the track a "percussive, Diwali-esque jam".[13] Us Weekly described "Get Me Bodied" a "snappy dance number."[24] Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker noted that the song sounds "anxious."[12] Mike Joseph of PopMatters noted that the song is very similar to Gwen Stefani's "Hollaback Girl" (2005) and expressed further praise about "Get Me Bodied", writing: "['Get Me Bodied' is] Beyonce’s glorified version of a 'Hollaback Girl'-type song. [...] But listen to way she wails and shouts throughout the song! Gwen Stefani certainly isn’t capable of vocal gymnastics like this. When she sings [...] you can visualize beads of perspiration coming off of her as she shakes to this song."[17]
