Polk successfully linked the U.S.-British boundary dispute over the partition of Oregon Territory with the Texas annexation debate. In doing so, the Democratic Party nominee united the anti-slavery Northern expansionists, who demanded Oregon as free-soil, with pro-slavery Southern expansionists, who insisted on acquiring Texas as a slave state. In the national popular vote, Polk beat Clay by less than 40,000 votes, a margin of 1.4%. James G. Birney, of the anti-slavery Liberty Party, took 2.3% of the vote. Polk won the electoral vote 170â€“105, but the flip of several thousand votes in closely contested New York would have delivered the election to Clay. In the aftermath of the election, Polk presided over the annexation of Texas, which triggered the Mexican-American War. This was the last presidential election to be held on different days in different states; starting with the presidential election of 1848, all states held the election on the same date in November.
