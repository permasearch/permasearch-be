Parker spent five weeks rehearsing with the cast members[7][14] before principal photography commenced on 27 August 1990, with an estimated budget of $12â€“15 million.[3][4][5] While Doyle's novel is set in the fictional Barrytown (based on Kilbarrack, where Doyle was a schoolteacher), Parker suggested that the film take place in Dublin. A total of 44 locations in the city were used filming.[7][14] The film's director of photography, Gale Tattersall, sought to create "a gritty, ugly look" that would become more composed and polished as the band became more successful. He felt that this visual style would support the film's story arc.[23]
