The investor must wait a specified period of time (commonly referred to as the "redemption period") before taking action to foreclose on the property.[9] During the redemption period, the lien (plus interest and any other fees) may be repaid by the owner or a legal designee of the owner.[10] Usually the lien holder is not permitted during this period to contact the property owner (or anyone else having an interest in the property, such as the mortgage holder) to demand payment or threaten foreclosure, or else the lienholder can face sanctions (such as: termination of the lien and loss of money spent, being banned from future sales, and/or criminal charges).[11]
