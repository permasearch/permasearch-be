The cost of health insurance in the United States is a major factor in access to health coverage. The rising cost of health insurance leads more consumers to go without coverage and increase in insurance costs and accompanying rise in the cost of health care expenses has led health insurers to provide more policies with higher deductibles and other limitations that require the consumer to pay a greater share of the cost themselves. Many people with pre-existing conditions such as cancer and depression are turned down for coverage, denied coverage of those conditions or are charged higher prices for coverage.
