Vanuatu's total area is roughly 12,274 square kilometres (4,739 sq mi),[21] of which its land surface is very limited (roughly 4,700 square kilometres (1,800 sq mi)). Most of the islands are steep, with unstable soils and little permanent fresh water.[19] One estimate, made in 2005, is that only 9% of land is used for agriculture (7% with permanent crops, plus 2% considered arable).[22] The shoreline is mostly rocky with fringing reefs and no continental shelf, dropping rapidly into the ocean depths.[19]
