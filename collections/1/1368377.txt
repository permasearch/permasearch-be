Mister Negative is often accompanied by several henchmen, known as his Inner Demons,[5] who wear Samurai-style masks (also known as Oni-Mask, Oni meaning demon) and use high tech electrified versions of swords, knuckles and various other oriental weaponry such as gun staffs and Nunchakus. They are able to regenerate from even the most lethal wounds within a matter of seconds, as they've been shown almost immediately recovering from impalement, gunshots to the head, and even getting torn apart or decapitated. It has been implied that the Inner Demons can be killed under the right circumstances: at one point, Anti-Venom claims to have killed some of them, possibly by suffocation, which he later notes to be an effective tactic against them.[13] Mr. Negative also orders the murder of two Inner Demons who have failed him.[volume & issue needed]
