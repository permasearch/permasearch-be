Water treatment came to the United States in 1872 when Poughkeepsie, NY opened the first slow sand filtration plant,[7] dramatically reducing instances of cholera and typhoid fever which had been seriously impacting the local community. Poughkeepsie's design criteria were used throughout the country as a model for other municipalities. Poughkeepsie's original treatment facility operated continuously for 87 years before being replaced in 1959.[8]
