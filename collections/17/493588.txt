Residents in Pennsylvania may also purchase firearms from gun shows and private dealers. When purchasing from a federally licensed dealer, the process remains the same. However, when purchasing a long gun from a private dealer, an individual is exempt from obtaining a background check. When purchasing a handgun from a private dealer, the individual is legally required to complete a firearm transfer at a federally licensed dealer.Â There is a $2 fee for the instant check and a $3 firearm sale surcharge to cover telephone costs.[5]
