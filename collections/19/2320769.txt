From 1963 to 1973, the area had a different name when President Lyndon Johnson by executive order renamed the area "Cape Kennedy" after President John F. Kennedy, who had set the goal of landing on the moon. After Kennedy's assassination in November 1963, his widow, Jacqueline Kennedy, suggested to President Johnson that renaming the Cape Canaveral facility would be an appropriate memorial. Johnson recommended the renaming of the entire cape, announced in a televised address six days after the assassination, on Thanksgiving evening.[23][24][25][26] Accordingly, Cape Canaveral was officially renamed Cape Kennedy.[21][27]  Kennedy's last visit to the space facility was on November 16, six days before his death;[28][29] [30] the final Mercury mission had concluded six months earlier.
