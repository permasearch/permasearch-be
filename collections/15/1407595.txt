Pullman has identified three major literary influences on His Dark Materials: the essay On the Marionette Theatre by Heinrich von Kleist,[11] the works of William Blake, and, most important, John Milton's Paradise Lost, from which the trilogy derives its title.[12] In his introduction, he adapts a famous description of Milton by Blake to quip that he (Pullman) "is of the Devil's party and does know it".
