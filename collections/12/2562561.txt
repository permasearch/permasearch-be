Krakauer was featured during a CBS 60 Minutes report on April 17, 2011 where 60 Minutes reporter Steve Kroft raised questions about humanitarian Greg Mortenson and the non-profit Central Asia Institute (CAI). Krakauer questioned the accuracy of events in Mortenson's book Three Cups of Tea and whether Mortenson was kidnapped by the Taliban in 1996 as described in his second book, Stones into Schools. Krakauer went on to question Mortenson's credibility through the financial practices of CAI. Krakauer had been a financial supporter of Mortenson's work and had previously donated $75,000 before becoming disillusioned with him and his management of CAI.[15] The 60 Minutes story largely retraced the conclusions Krakauer came to as described in his e-book, Three Cups of Deceit â€“ How Greg Mortenson, Humanitarian Hero, Lost His Way.[16] The e-book was released the day after the 60 Minutes piece aired.
