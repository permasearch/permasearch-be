The headmistress of this season ended up being Mo'Nique. As they entered the house, two people were introduced to assist Mo'Nique in eliminations: Mikki, an Essence magazine editor, and Keith, from an entertainment agency and beauty pageant coordinator. All the girls received their pledge pins from Mo'Nique and threw out their name tags with their nicknames from when they were on Flavor of Love. Saaphyri was the only contestant on Charm School without a nickname, due to her disqualification for fighting with another contestant (H-Town) before she received one on Flavor of Love 2. From this point forward, each contestant was referred to using their real names. A mixer was then held for the girls to have talks with Mo'Nique and the deans.
