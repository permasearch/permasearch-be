The Associated Press organization was first created in 1846. Throughout much of its history, the AP maintained a style book for member reporters. By the early 1950s the publication was formalized into the AP Stylebook and became the leading professional English grammar reference by most member and non-member news bureaus throughout the world. Due to growing demand by non-member journalists and writers working in public-facing corporate communications, the AP published their style book for the general public in 1953. The first publication focused on "where the wire set a specific style";[7] for nearly a quarter century it assumed its reader had a "solid grounding in language and a good reference library" and thus omitted any guidelines in those broader areas.[7] In 1977, prompted by AP Executive News Editor Louis Boccardi's request for "more of a reference work", the organization started expanding the book.[7] That year's book was produced jointly with competitor United Press International.[8] In 1989, Norm Goldstein became the AP Stylebook editor, a job he held until the 2007 edition.[7] After publishing the final edition under his editorship, Goldstein commented on the future of the AP Stylebook's section on name references:
