Albert had a female companion called Elsie Partridge, who was first mentioned by Rodney in "The Unlucky Winner Is...", and appeared in the episode "Sickness and Wealth". His nephews often teased him about this as well as his ability to sink ships and, with his bald head and big white beard, his resemblance to Captain Birdseye.
