Since its broadcast, Vincent and the Doctor has received critical acclaim. Dave Golder of SFX magazine gave the episode five out of five stars, calling it "a genuinely magical episode of Who, high on atmosphere...and bursting with charm".[2] John Moore, writing on Den of Geek, also took a positive stance towards the episode, describing it as "life-affirming" as a Doctor Who fan, and, though he did criticise some elements of the plot, likewise wrote positively about the ending, ultimately finding the episode "utterly useless, but absolutely art".[25] Keith Watson in the Metro was surprised by the "impressive imagining of Van Gogh's world", praising Curtis' humour throughout the episode. He also praised the performance by Curran as Van Gogh, feeling that, with regard to Van Gogh's depression, the producers "pulled it off" against the odds.[26] Mark Lawson of The Guardian praised it as "exceptionally good" and "thrilling and funny, as well as educational", noting its "historical rigour" and its "good arty jokes",[27] while Deborah Orr wrote that it was "hardly original for someone to alight on [Van Gogh's] tale as a tear-jerker, although it is pretty shrewd to think of placing it in a popular time-travel context" and that "the feeling that I'd been gently monstered into life-affirming feel-good sobs by Richard Curtis was not new, not in the least".[28]
