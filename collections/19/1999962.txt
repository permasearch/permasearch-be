In his early years Alf was described as a "good-natured rogue with a finger in every pie."[1] Meagher said that although some people think he is miserable, he sees him as an "upstanding member of the community".[11] He further added "He can be a bit grumpy and gets stuck into people and you have to be quick to catch his apology if he is wrong, but on the whole he is a big softie."[11]
