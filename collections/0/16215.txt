Hoot is a 2002 young adult novel by Carl Hiaasen. The setting takes place in Florida, where new arrival Roy makes two oddball friends and a bad enemy, and joins an effort to stop construction of a pancake house which would destroy a colony of burrowing owls who live on the site. The book won a Newbery Honor award in 2003.[1] A film adaptation of the book was released in May 2006, starring Logan Lerman, Brie Larson, and Cody Linley.[2] Hiaasen and Wil Shriner, the director and script-writer, "fought long and hard to stay truthful to the book."[3]
