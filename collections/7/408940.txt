After the curse, Cora masquerades as Lancelot, claiming that he's dead. Lancelot turns up alive. At some point, he returns to Camelot and sneaks into King Arthur's castle. During the night where David is bestowed the Siege Perilous seat by Arthur, Snow White goes out to the hallway to calm down her crying baby son where she sees a shadowy figure walk past. When she calls out to the person, Lancelot steps out much to her astonishment. He assures her it is truly him. After putting aside the story of his struggles, Lancelot warns her about a villain that is currently in the castle. At first, Snow assumes he is speaking about Emma. Instead, Lancelot reveals that King Arthur is the villain and Camelot is not what it seems. When Arthur found out that Lancelot was alive and confronted him and Mary Margaret in the Dark One's Vault, David found out where the suspicions towards King Arthur were confirmed. When the rest of the Knights arrive at Granny's to help King Arthur, Lancelot also discovered that Guinevere was under Arthur's command thanks to the sand dust that was used on her by King Arthur. Lancelot is locked up in the dungeon where he meets Merida as they both plan to find a way to defeat King Arthur. Both of them are freed by David's group with the help of Merlin. Following Captain Hook being tethered to Excalibur, Merlin sends Sir Lancelot to his mother, the Lady of the Lake which is a two-day journey to help stop the darkness. He is too late to help and is not swept up by the third Dark Curse back to Storybrooke like everyone else.
