However, mitochondrial DNA reflects only the history of the females in a population and so may not represent the history of the population as a whole. This can be partially overcome by the use of paternal genetic sequences, such as the non-recombining region of the Y-chromosome.[143] In a broader sense, only studies that also include nuclear DNA can provide a comprehensive evolutionary history of a population.[145]
