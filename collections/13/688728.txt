On October 27, 2009, during the evening commute, the steel crossbeam and two steel tie rods repaired over Labor Day weekend[53] snapped off the Bay Bridge's eastern section and fell to the upper deck.[54][55][56] The cause may have been due to metal-on-metal vibration from bridge traffic and wind gusts of up to 55 miles per hour (90Â km/h) causing failure of one rod, which broke off, which then led to the metal section crashing down.[57] Three vehicles were either struck by or hit the fallen debris, though there were no injuries.[58][59][60][61] On November 1, Caltrans announced that the bridge would probably stay closed at least through the morning commute of Monday, November 2, after repairs performed during the weekend failed a stress test on Sunday.[62] BART and the Golden Gate Ferry systems added supplemental service to accommodate the increased passenger load during the bridge closure.[63] The bridge reopened to traffic on November 2, 2009.
