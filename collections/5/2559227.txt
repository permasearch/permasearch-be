This situation pleased no one, and the Court immediately agreed to a rehearing on the issue of taxing general income. The terminally ill Jackson struggled to Washington, undoubtedly hoping that his vote would settle the question in favor of the tax's validity. But though Jackson voted to support the tax, another justice (probably Shiras) changed his position, producing a 5‐to‐4 vote invalidating the entire tax law because it was a direct tax that had to be apportioned among the states according to their populations."Stamos1981 (talk) 16:42, 4 July 2008 (UTC)
