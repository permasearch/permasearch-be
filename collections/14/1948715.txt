The Steelers began 2011 very badly by losing 35–7 to their arch-rival Baltimore in a terribly-botched game with three Roethlisberger interceptions and 7 turnovers. Afterwards, they avenged themselves by shutting out Seattle 24–0. Next Pittsburgh fought a hard battle with the Peyton Manning-less Colts in Indianapolis and managed to squeak past them with a last second Shaun Suisham field goal 23–20. With injuries piling up, the Steelers came out flat against Houston and lost 17–10 in Week 4. Ben Roethlisberger was sidelined with a foot injury and Charlie Batch scheduled to start in Week 5 against Tennessee, however Roethlisberger played and threw for 5 touchdowns in a 38–17 win. After easily winning that game, he returned to action as Pittsburgh beat Jacksonville at home 17–13 and then won in Arizona 32–20 for their first encounter since Super Bowl XLIII. The Steelers set a franchise record in the latter half of the game as Roethlisberger threw a 95-yard TD pass to Mike Wallace. The next week, Pittsburgh returned home to face Tom Brady and the New England Patriots. In a spectacular defensive effort, in which Pittsburgh held Brady to a season-low 198 yards passing, the Steelers beat the Patriots 25–17. Then after a disappointing home loss to Baltimore, the Steelers went to Cincinnati and won their first AFC North division battle of the year, 24–17. After a bye, the Steelers came out flat once again in Kansas City, but managed to beat the Chiefs 13–9. They regrouped and routed the Bengals at home 35–7 the following week.
