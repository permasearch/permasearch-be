Taupin's lyric refers to a time in 1968, before John was popular as a musician, when John was engaged to be married to girlfriend Linda Woodrow. John and Woodrow were sharing a flat with Taupin in Furlong Road in Highbury, London, hence the opening line "When I think of those East End lights." While having serious doubts about the looming marriage, John contemplated suicide.[3] He took refuge in his friends, especially Long John Baldry, who convinced John to abandon his plans to marry in order to salvage and maintain his musical career. After "sticking his head in the gas oven, but with the windows open", his parents arrived the next day, in a van, to take him back to their apartment in Pinner.[4][5]
