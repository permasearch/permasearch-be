As for the Chargers, the implications of their defeat were worse in hindsight as this remains as the only Super Bowl the Chargers had ever played in and including the pre AFL-NFL merger, the 3rd championship game the Chargers lost, since they previously won the AFL Championship in 1963. That championship remains to this day as the only major sports championship the city of San Diego has won (and also the longest championship drought for any city that has at least two major sports franchises), so even though they were heavy underdogs, the loss still had a great significance.[12][13] The Chargers would also not win another playoff game since then until the 2007 season, when they reached the AFC Championship, but lost to the then 18-0 New England Patriots, 21â€“12. This remains the closest the Chargers have come to returning to the Super Bowl as of the 2017 season. Super Bowl XXIX would be their only appearance while playing in San Diego, before they moved to Los Angeles following the 2016 season.
