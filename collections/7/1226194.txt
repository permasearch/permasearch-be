Eventually, Laura and Stefan were able to conclude the Stavros was alive, prompting Stefan to break out of prison. After confronting Stavros on Spoon Island, Stefan tied him up and left him inside an empty coffin. However, when the police came looking for Stefan, they freed Stavros, and following some questions, let him go. When the time came for Stavros and Nikolas to come face to face, Helena arranged for Nikolas to believe that Stavros was still frozen, prompting Nikolas to declare that he hated his father and hoped he remained "dead". Subsequently, Helena lured a handful of her enemies to the underground laboratory where she had kept Stavros hidden, and trapped them inside. Stavros, in an effort to prove his love for Nikolas, gave him the necessary information to escape the laboratory, with Gia in tow. Following a vicious altercation with Luke, Stavros found himself dangling over the entrance to a bottomless pit, and in one final effort to thumb his nose at Luke, threw up his hands and fell to his presumed death.
