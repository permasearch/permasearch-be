"Out Last Night" is an up-tempo song in which the male narrator recalls a party that he attended the night before. He recalls the people that he met there (including "girls from Argentina and Arkansas / Maine, Alabama, and Panama"), as well as his actions (such as lying to others after a few drinks, and telling them that he is "a doctor, a lawyer, a senator's son, / Brad Pitt's brother, and a man on the run"). In the chorus, he says that "Everybody was some kind of star / When [they] went out last night." Co-written by Brett James and Chesney, it is one of three new tracks on his second greatest hits album Greatest Hits II.[1]
