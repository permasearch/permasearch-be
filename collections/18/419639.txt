The Gators men's basketball team is currently led by coach Michael White, and plays its home games in the O'Connell Center.[9] White's Gators returned to the NCAA Tournament in 2016â€“17 after a two-year absence despite finishing second in the SEC during the regular season and suffering an early exit from the SEC Tournament. The Gators, as a #4 seed, ultimately reached the Elite Eight before falling short against fellow conference partner South Carolina.
