Under Armour announced an addition to their ColdGear product line, called Infrared, that was released in 2013.[39] This line claims to disseminate heat using ceramic powder and re-circulate heat around the wearer's body. This was purportedly designed so that the wearer's heat signature will not be picked up. Under Armour also had released a product with scent control technology in 2012 titled, "Under Armour Scent Control". This line claims to be designed so that the wearer's scent cannot be detected.[40]
