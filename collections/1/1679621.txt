A number of parties have made reservations and interpretative declarations to their application of the Convention. The Convention text forbids reservations "incompatible with the object and purpose of this Convention" or that would inhibit the operation of any body established by it.[64] A reservation is considered incompatible or inhibitive if two-thirds of parties object to it.[64]
