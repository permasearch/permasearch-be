The chief cult center of Ra was Iunu, the "Place of Pillars", later known to the Greeks as Heliopolis (lit.Â "Sun City")[3] and today located in the suburbs of Cairo. He was identified with the local sun god Atum. As Atum or Atum-Ra, he was reckoned the first being and the originator of the Ennead ("The Nine"), consisting of Shu and Tefnut, Geb and Nut, Osiris, Set, Isis and Nephthys. The holiday of 'The Receiving of Ra' was celebrated on May 26 in the Gregorian calendar.[citation needed]
