Republican Lindsay Parkhurst was first elected to represent the 79th district in 2016, defeating Democrat Kate Cloonen. The 79th district includes all or parts of Kankakee, Bourbonnais, Bradley, Essex, Hopkins Park, Peotone, Herscher and Braceville.[31] Cloonen's predecessor, Democrat Lisa Dugan, who represented the 79th district from 2003-2013 has announced she will run for the seat. The race, dubbed a "battle royale" by political observers, is expected to cost in the millions of dollars.[32]
