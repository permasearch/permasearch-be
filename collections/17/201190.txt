The September 27 premiere episode, titled "I'm Not Crazy, I'm Confident" saw a significant boost in viewership over March's Survivor: Game Changers with 8.33 million people tuning in, compared to the show's all-time low of 7.64 earlier in the year. However, the premiere of the show's 35th season was unable to match Survivor: Millenials vs. Gen X's premiere viewership from fall 2016. That said, the series once again ranked first in it's time-slot (by a significant margin) and once again tied with ABC's The Goldbergs for the critical 18-49 demographic, with both placing behind Fox's Empire. Survivor again edged out favourites Empire, Modern Family and Criminal Minds to rank second overall for the evening behind SEAL Team which also debuted on CBS in the hour proceeding.[28]
