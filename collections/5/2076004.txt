In 1913 the County School moved to its new building on Tottenham Green and the Polytechnic was able to expand by extending daytime courses. A day Junior Technical School offering a two-year course for students age 13 to 16 was opened. The junior day schools were enlarged again between the wars with a Junior Technical School for boys age 13–16 in building and allied trades and a Junior Commercial School for girls and boys age 13–16 offering a general education, together with office and clerical skills. These schools provided a secondary education that could lead to apprenticeships in industry or careers in business and the professions.[10]
