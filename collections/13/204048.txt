After Ayres's division had captured the return, Warren again went to search for Crawford.[220][221] He found Crawford's division in good order on the east side of the Boisseau farm, facing west.[181][218][221][222] Unfortunately for Warren, Sheridan asked for Warren at about this time and no one could say where he was.[223] Sheridan then ordered Griffin to take command of the corps.[223] Meanwhile, Warren ordered Crawford to wheel to the left and drive south against Five Forks because Warren perceived that the Confederates still held the crossroads because of artillery fire coming from that direction.[221][222] Coulter's brigade led the attack on the left of Ford's Road with Kellogg's and Baxter's brigades and four of Bartlett's separated regiments coming up on the right.[220][221] From woods on the south of the Boisseau farm, the Confederates fired steadily on the Union battle line.[221][223] Three companies of the 1st Maine Veteran Infantry Regiment routed a patrol of Rosser's cavalry across Hatcher's Run before rejoining their regiment.[221] Warren assigned the 1st Maine Veteran Infantry Regiment and the 118th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment to watch the ford across Hatcher's Run.[223][224]
