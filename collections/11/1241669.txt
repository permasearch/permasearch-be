Michael's older brother is George Oscar Bluth II (Will Arnett), going entirely by the acronym "GOB" (/dʒoʊb/).[28] An unsuccessful professional magician whose business and personal schemes usually fail or become tiresome and are quickly abandoned, GOB is competitive with Michael over women and bullies Buster.[28] Michael's twin sister Lindsay (Portia de Rossi) is spoiled and materialistic, continually seeking the center of attention and leaping on various social causes for the sake of vanity.[32] She is married to Tobias Fünke (David Cross), a discredited psychiatrist-turned-aspiring actor.[28] Tobias is a self-diagnosed "never-nude" (a disorder comparable to gymnophobia), whose language and behavior have heavily homosexual overtones to which he seems completely oblivious and which are the center of much tongue-in-cheek comedy throughout the series.[32][33] Their daughter is Mae "Maeby" Fünke (Alia Shawkat), a rebellious teen with an opportunistic streak, who seeks to defy her parents for the sake of attention, and otherwise pursues boys and power, and furthers her complicated relationship with George Michael.[28]
