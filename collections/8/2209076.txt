The event is organized by Pride Toronto, a non-profit organization. A small complement of seven staff support the work of 19 festival teams and six advisors; each team is responsible for an aspect of the festival. Each team is administered by two or three volunteer team leads. The long-term vision for, and strategic oversight of, the organization and the festival is managed by 12 volunteers on the board of directors.
