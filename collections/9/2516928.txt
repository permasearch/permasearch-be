In 2015 the Australian Government's Department of Health published a meta study which reviewed the existing literature on 17 alternative therapies including Pilates, in order to determine if any were suitable for being covered by health insurance. The review found that due to the small number and methodologically limited nature of the existing studies, the effectiveness of Pilates is uncertain.[6] For the treatment of lower back pain, low quality evidence suggests that while Pilates is better than doing nothing, it is no more effective than other forms of physical exercise.[14][4] There is some evidence regular sessions can help with the conditioning of the abdominal muscles of healthy people, when compared to doing no exercise.[7] There is no good evidence it helps improve balance in elderly people.[5]
