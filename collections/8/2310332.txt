A big, long-furred gray tom with a single green eye and a bushy tail, Rain is originally a temporary member of SkyClan, but later betrays them and joins Darktail's group. He acts as a second-in-command of sorts to Darktail, but later grows frustrated with his leader and tries to murder him, but Darktail kills him.
