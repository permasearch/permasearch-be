A video game based on the film was released on May 5, 2005, two weeks before the film. The game followed the film's storyline for the most part, integrating scenes from the film. However, many sections of the game featured scenes cut from the film, or entirely new scenes for the game.[100] The style of the game was mostly lightsaber combat and fighting as Obi-Wan or Anakin.[101] It also has a form of multiplayer mode, which includes both "VS" and "Cooperative" mode.[101] In the first mode, two players fight with characters of their choice against each other in a lightsaber duel to the death. In the latter mode, two players team up to combat increasingly difficult waves of enemies.[101]
