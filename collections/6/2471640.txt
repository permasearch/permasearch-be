The GT500 failed to meet some automotive journalists' expectations.[33][34] Car and Driver magazine, for example, though praising the GT500 for its ample horsepower and relatively smooth ride, criticized their test car for its heavy weight and, in particular, the nose-heavy weight distribution of 57.7% front and 42.3% rear (compared to the 52.5% front, 47.5% rear of a Mustang GT manual they tested).[35] Nevertheless, in spite of their opinion of its drawbacks, Car and Driver drove a GT500 in their 2007 "Lightning Lap" road test at Virginia International Raceway and found that the car's on-track performance lap time of 3:05.9 fell just below that of the Porsche 911 Turbo (3:05.8) and faster than that of the Lotus Elise (3:09.3), Porsche Cayman S (3:09.5) and BMW M6 (3:10.0).[36]
