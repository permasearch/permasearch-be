In British English the standard, known as Standard English (SE), is historically based on the language of the medieval English court of Chancery.[25] The late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw the establishment of this standard as the norm of "polite" society, that is to say of the upper classes.[26] The spoken standard has come to be seen as a mark of good education and social prestige.[27] Although often associated with the RP accent, SE can be spoken with any accent.[28]
