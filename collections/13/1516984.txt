Chester McBadbat (voiced by Frankie Muniz in 2001–2003; Jason Marsden in 2003–2017) is one of Timmy's best friends. He lives in a trailer with his father in an impoverished community with few amenities. Although his mother was mentioned in the episode "Teeth for Two", she has not been shown in the show. He is generous and cares more for others than himself, as every time he has obtained magic, he has used his wishes to try to improve the lives of others, even though it usually leads to disaster. He becomes the only classmate of Timmy to know about his godparents' existence in Fairy Idol, but it is not mentioned again in later episodes (it is presumed he loses his knowledge of this after wishing everything back to normal). He often wears worn-in, oversized clothes. He has freckles, green eyes, dental braces, and blonde shaggy hair and eyebrows. Jason Marsden also voiced Imaginary Gary Ricky and Winston Dunsworth throughout the series Marsden was the first and so far the only Voice Actor to play a live action character named Jeff from Channel Chasers.
