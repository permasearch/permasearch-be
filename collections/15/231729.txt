Washington has a 6.50% statewide sales tax.[179] Local rates vary based on an individual's location at the point of purchase and can total up to 3.10% for a combined rate of 9.60%.[179] In addition, due to the large number of Native American sovereign nations located within the state, sales-tax rates, if any, can vary based on state treaties with each nation.[180][181]
