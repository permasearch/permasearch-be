Enculturation is the process by which people learn values and behaviors that are appropriate or necessary in their surrounding culture.[18] Parents, other adults, and peers shape the individual's understanding of these values.[18] If successful, enculturation results in competence in the language, values and rituals of the culture.[18] This is different from acculturation, where a person adopts the values and societal rules of a culture different from their native one.
