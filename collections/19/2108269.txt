In September 1761, with his assistant Hugh Oldham,[20] Brindley surveyed an extension from Longford Bridge to Hempstones, near Halton, Cheshire.[10] He assisted in obtaining Parliamentary approval for the Bridgewater Canal Extension Act of 1762[21] which allowed the construction of an extension to the canal, from Manchester, to the River Mersey at Runcorn.[22] Despite objections from the Mersey and Irwell Navigation Company,[10] Royal assent was given on 24Â March 1762.[23] A junction, Waters Meeting, was created in Trafford Park, at which the new extension branched south through Stretford, Sale, Altrincham, Lymm and finally to Runcorn.
