Although Mandarin and Hakka are the official variants of Chinese in Taiwan, Taiwanese Hokkien is widely spoken and used in media. Additionally, they are also taught at the primary school level and are used in public transportation announcements.[9] There is also a thriving literary scene for both Taiwanese and Hakka alongside Mandarin. In 2002 the Taiwan Solidarity Union proposed making Taiwanese an co-official language, but this was criticized by both Blue and Green politicians as promoting Hoklo chauvinism at the expense of Hakka and the Aboriginal language.[10]
