According to traditional belief, the popping of joints, especially knuckles, can lead to arthritis and other joint problems. However, medical research has so far failed to conclusively demonstrate a connection between knuckle cracking and long-term joint problems. The cracking mechanism and the resulting sound is caused by carbon dioxide cavitation bubbles suddenly partially collapsing inside the joints.[1]
