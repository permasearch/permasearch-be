Between the 1976 voyage and 2009, Hōkūle‘a completed nine[update] additional voyages to Micronesia, Polynesia, Japan, Canada and the mainland United States, all using ancient wayfinding techniques of celestial navigation. On 19 January 2007, Hōkūle‘a left Hawaiʻi with the voyaging canoe Alingano Maisu on a voyage through Micronesia (map) and ports in southern Japan.[a] The voyage was expected to take five months. On 9 June 2007,[15] Hōkūle‘a completed the "One Ocean, One People" voyage to Yokohama, Japan. On April 5, 2009,[16] Hōkūle‘a returned to Honolulu following a roundtrip training sail to Palmyra Atoll,[17][18] undertaken to develop skills of potential crewmembers for Hōkūle‘a's eventual circumnavigation of the earth.[19]
