The first train on the High Line viaduct, part of New York Central's West Side Line, ran along the structure in 1933.[53] The elevated structure was dedicated on June 29, 1934 and was the first part of the West Side Improvement Project to be completed.[54] The High Line, which originally ran from 34th Street to St. John's Park Terminal at Spring Street, was designed to go through the center of blocks rather than over an avenue;[54][48] as a result, the viaduct's construction necessitated the demolition of 640 buildings.[54][51] It connected directly to factories and warehouses, allowing trains to load and unload inside buildings. Milk, meat, produce, and raw and manufactured goods could be transported and unloaded without disturbing street traffic.[48] This reduced the load on the Bell Laboratories Building (which has housed the Westbeth Artists Community since 1970)[55] and the former Nabisco plant in Chelsea Market, which were served from protected sidings in the buildings.[50][56]
