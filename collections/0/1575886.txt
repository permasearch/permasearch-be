"Love Is Here to Stay" was first performed by Kenny Baker in The Goldwyn Follies but did not reach popularity until it was sung by Gene Kelly to Leslie Caron in the film An American in Paris (1951).[1] The song appeared in Forget Paris (1995) and Manhattan (1979). It can also be heard in the film When Harry Met Sally (1989) sung by Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald.[2]
