Nabagopal Mitra contended unity to be the fundamental criterion of nationalism and maintained that for the Hindus the basis of national unity has been the Hindu religion. He also attempted a definition of the Hindu nation. According to him, "Hindu nationality .. is not confined to Bengal. It embraces all of Hindu names and Hindu faiths throughout the length and breadth of Hindustan; neither geographical position nor the language is counted as a disability. Hindus are destined to be a religious nation."[3]
