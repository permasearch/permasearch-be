Bubble (played by Jane Horrocks) is Eddy's personal assistant. The character speaks with a strong Lancashire accent, exhibits a daft fashion sense, and acts in an unintelligent, foolish manner. She is unable to remember the names of common objects or understand basic concepts. Bubble's function in the PR company is simply to flatter Edina's vanity by comparison.
