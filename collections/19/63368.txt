The first Act, the Currency Act of 1751 (24 Geo. II c. 53), restricted the emission of paper money and the establishment of new public banks by the colonies of New England.[5] These colonies had issued paper fiat money known as "bills of credit" to help pay for military expenses during the French and Indian Wars. Because more paper money was issued than what was taxed out of circulation, the currency depreciated in relation to the British pound sterling. The resultant inflation was harmful to merchants in Great Britain, who were forced to accept the depreciated currency from colonists for payment of debts.[6]
