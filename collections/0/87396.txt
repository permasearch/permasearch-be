The bill was called for by President John F. Kennedy in his Report to the American People on Civil Rights of June 11, 1963,[7] in which he asked for legislation "giving all Americans the right to be served in facilities which are open to the publicâ€”hotels, restaurants, theaters, retail stores, and similar establishments", as well as "greater protection for the right to vote". Kennedy delivered this speech following the immediate aftermath of the Birmingham campaign and the growing number of demonstrations and protests throughout the southern United States. Kennedy was moved to action following the elevated racial tensions and wave of black riots in the spring 1963.[8]
