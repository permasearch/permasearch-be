The Land Without Magic, commonly known as the Real World, is another main setting, shown as a place devoid with magic, and not connected to the others. It is often said that travelling to the Land Without Magic is hard, but possible, such as magical doors created by the Apprentice, magic beans, or the Dark Curse. During the first six seasons, Storybrooke, Maine was the main setting, serving as an isolated town separated from the rest of the world, where the cursed inhabitants are trapped by various forces. During the seriesâ€™ seventh season, the setting shifted to Hyperion Heights, Seattle, where unlike Storybrooke, its cursed inhabitants are living among ordinary people.
