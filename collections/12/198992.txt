Taxable income is defined in a comprehensive manner in the Internal Revenue Code and tax regulations issued by the Department of Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service.[5]  Taxable income is gross income as adjusted minus deductions.  Most states and localities follow these definitions at least in part, though some make adjustments to determine income taxed in that jurisdiction.  Taxable income for a company or business may not be the same as its book income.
