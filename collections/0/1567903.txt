None of the KTMA episodes were rerun nationally or have been released onto home video due to rights issues. Some consider the first three KTMA episodes to be "missing episodes", as no fan copies are known to exist, but master copies of all these episodes still exist according to Mallon.[75] In November 2016, Hodgson reported that master copies of two of the episodes "Invaders from the Deep" and "Revenge of the Mysterons from Mars" had been found.[76] The episodes were made available to Kickstarter backers of the new series on November 25, 2016.[77]
