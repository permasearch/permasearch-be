USA Today called Butkus the "gold standard by which other middle linebackers are measured."[1] Although not the creator of the middle linebacker position—which is credited to his predecessor Bill George—Butkus is recognized as having defined the role.[47][61] He is also recognized for having set the benchmark for the success of Bears middle linebackers, which continued with Mike Singletary and Brian Urlacher.[72] Hall of Fame running back Earl Campbell, known for his hard-hitting running style, cited Butkus as his hero growing up.[73]
