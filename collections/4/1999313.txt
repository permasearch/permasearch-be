The first large molecule whose atomic structure was partly determined on a molecular computer graphics system was Transfer RNA by Sung-Hou Kim's team in 1976.[36][37] after initial fitting on a mechanical Richards Box. The first large molecule whose atomic structure was entirely determined on a molecular computer graphics system is said to be neurotoxin A from venom of the Philippines sea snake, by Tsernoglou, Petsko, and Tu,[38] with a statement of being first[29] in 1977. The Richardson group published partial atomic structure results[39] of the protein superoxide dismutase the same year, in 1977. All of these were done using the GRIP-75 system.
