Protection from slavery is reiterated in the Slavery Convention.[2] This is affected by the Optional Protocol to the Abolition of Slavery[3] and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).[4] The ICCPR, governed by the Human Rights Committee,[5] is responsible for internationally monitoring present conditions of slavery.
