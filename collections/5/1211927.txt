Macdonald Hall is closing! Their school is in jeopardy and the best way to save it, according to Bruno, is to get the word out about how great their school is. Bruno leads a scheme to get the name of Macdonald Hall known all over Canada. While the boys are doing this, to blow off steam, Bruno starts playing with one of Elmer Drimsdale's inventions and inadvertently starts a police investigation into the activities of the operative known as "The Fish."
