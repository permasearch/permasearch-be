On 30 May 2011, the German government announced a plan to shut all nuclear reactors by 2022.[26] Environment Minister Norbert RÃ¶ttgen stated of the decision, "It's definite. The latest end for the last three nuclear power plants is 2022. There will be no clause for revision".[4] Prior to the decision, Germany's renewable energy sector already provided 17% of Germany's electricity and employed about 370,000.[7] The decision to phase-out nuclear power has been called the swiftest change of political course since unification.[27] Only a year earlier Angela Merkel's government overturned a decade-old decision to close all nuclear plants by 2022.[27]
