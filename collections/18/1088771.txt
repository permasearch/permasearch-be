The war was also very costly for the Dwarf race, as nearly half of those involved were killed or seriously wounded.[24] N치in son of Gr칩r, Frerin second son of Thr치in II, and Fundin son of Farin, the father of Balin were among the more noted casualties. Thr치in II himself lost an eye, and his elder son Thorin earned his epithet "Oakenshield" after he used an oak branch to defend himself after being wounded.
