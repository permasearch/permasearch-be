Two Class I railroads, BNSF Railway and Union Pacific Railroad (UP), operate freight rail lines through Wichita.[214] UP's OKT Line runs generally north-south through the city; north of downtown, the line consists of trackage leased to BNSF.[58][215] An additional UP line enters the city from the northeast and terminates downtown.[58] BNSF's main line through the city enters from the north, passes through downtown, and exits to the southeast, paralleling highway K-15.[58][216] The Wichita Terminal Association, a joint operation between BNSF and UP, provides switching service on three miles (5Â km) of track downtown.[217] In addition, two lines of the Kansas and Oklahoma Railroad enter the city, one from the northwest and the other from the southwest, both terminating at their junction in west-central Wichita.[58]
