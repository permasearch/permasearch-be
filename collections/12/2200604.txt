The Ogakor beach was overcome with smoke and haze from the impending forest fire. Kucha moved their fire after ash was jumping from the fire into their sleeping area, burning through one of Jeff Varner’s shirts. However, moving the fire made sleeping at night much harder. Michael told Kimmi to stop being so involved with the chickens, but she didn’t listen and still got upset and made a scene when they wanted to kill another one. On the other hand, hunger started to set in at Ogakor. Jerri and Keith once again argued about where to dump the fish guts. At Kucha, Kimmi argued with Alicia about eating another chicken, which led to a verbal tussle in front of the entire tribe. Kimmi found Alicia to be very condescending and Alicia continued to get more irritated and impatient. After the fight, Kimmi started complaining about everything.
