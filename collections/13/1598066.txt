The Kingdom of Great Britain was formed in 1707 through the Acts of Union 1707, which united the kingdoms of England and Scotland into a single kingdom encompassing the whole island of Great Britain and its outlying islands. It did not include the Kingdom of Ireland, which although under British control, remained a separate realm. On 1 January 1801, the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland were merged to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom and the state was renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
