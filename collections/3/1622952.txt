Later on 22 October 1947, tribal militias backed by Pakistan crossed the border into Jammu and Kashmir.[46][47] Local tribal militias and the Pakistani armed forces moved to take Srinagar but on reaching Uri they encountered defensive forces. Hari Singh made a plea to India for assistance and signed the Instrument of Accession.
