For the 2012 model year, the Eclipse received three slight changes: brake override logic, a clear lip spoiler on the GT trim, and one new exterior color. According to a review and rating by Motor Trend, the fourth-generation Eclipse was described as "dated" - but its "exterior design still stands out among sporty coupes currently available."[20] The 2012 model year Eclipse was now six years old and "is still trying to pass itself off as a sporty two-door."[20] This was the final model year, albeit a short run because production ended in August 2011.[21][22]
