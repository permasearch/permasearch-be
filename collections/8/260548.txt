The term Bible Diet (or the Maker's Diet) is used[by whom?] to refer to a food diet promoted on radio and in books by writer and motivational speaker Jordan S. Rubin. Rubin presents the diet as based on teachings from the Book of Leviticus, Deuteronomy and other books of the Bible; he characterizes certain foods as either forbidden ("unclean") or acceptable ("clean") to God. Rubin also markets supplements associated with the diet through his two companies: Garden of Life, Inc. and Beyond Organic. It is believed by many that in Mark 7:17-19 that Jesus states all foods are clean to eat and there are no restrictions. There are arguments over what those words truly mean, however.
