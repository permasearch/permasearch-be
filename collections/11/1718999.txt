A Probity Probe detects spells of concealment and hidden magical objects. The detector made its first appearance in Order of the Phoenix at the Ministry of Magic as a thin golden rod. After Voldemort's return, Probes are used as part of the increased security at Gringotts as well as for scanning the students of Hogwarts for Dark objects. They are last seen when Harry, Ron, and Hermione arrive at Gringotts in Deathly Hallows to rob Bellatrix Lestrange's vault of one of Voldemort's Horcruxes.
