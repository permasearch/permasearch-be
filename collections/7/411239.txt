Will's parents, Sami and Lucas, have an on-and off-relationship over the years, and this affects Will. The Sony Pictures web page for Will stated his "turbulent upbringing" makes the young Will "moody and suspicious",[61] but About.com's profile on the character says Will overcame the turmoil of his upbringing, and grew up to be a "kind-hearted" and "level-headed" teenager.[62] In an early interview, Massey said Will is "a great guy .... he kind of had an interesting upbringing, but he turned out to be a really good kid, very forgiving." Massey added: "He doesnâ€™t like being lied to, definitely, but that happens all the time to him. He's very mature for his age. Sometimes it seems like he is the parent in the relationship" (with his mom Sami).[63]
