In clothing, clothing size refers to the label sizes used for garments sold off-the-shelf. There are a  large number of standard sizing systems around the world for various garments, such as dresses, tops, skirts, and trousers. Made-to-order garments require measurements to be taken, but these do not need to be converted into national standard form.
