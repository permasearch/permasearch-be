Passport regime only started between the two countries from 1952. Citizens of both India and Pakistan did not need a visa or were issued one on arrival till the Second Kashmir War. Before the war, citizens of both countries could freely travel to each other's countries, despite the fact that both had gone to war in 1947 over the princely state of Kashmir.[97] India-Pakistan passport was a special passport issued for travel between India and Pakistan by the governments for visits, tournaments and pilgrimage. It acted as a special visa meant for visiting Pakistan and India only. Sikhs visiting Pakistan for pilgrimage were also issued this special passport by the Pakistan High Commission, India.[98][99]
