This page really needs a history of the popularization of Asian martial arts. As I understand it, it began with Judo, which was systematically created to be a sport that could be taught in schools. Or perhaps it was karate that was first taught, in modified form, in schools. In any case, many martial arts are now on the curricula of high schools (TKD in Korea, for example). Also the story of belts being derived from Judo and the custom of wearing gi and training barefoot in many asian arts should get some mention. Unfortunately, I don't really know enough about this to write it. Andrew 23:01, Apr 11, 2004 (UTC)
