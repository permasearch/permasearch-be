In January 2015, the CW announced that an animated web-series featuring the DC heroine Vixen would be debuting on CW Seed in late 2015 and be set in the same universe as both Arrow and The Flash.[8] Amell and Gustin reprise their respective roles in the series,[9] and the character of Vixen was expected to make a live-action appearance on The Flash and/or Arrow as well.[10] The next month, it was reported that another spin-off series, described as a superhero team-up show, was being discussed by The CW for a possible 2015â€“16 midseason release. Berlanti, Kreisberg, Guggenheim, and Sarah Schechter would executive produce the potential series, which would be headlined by several recurring characters from both Arrow and The Flash. That May, the CW officially confirmed DC's Legends of Tomorrow for a January 2016 premiere.[11][12] Pedowitz later stated, "There is no intention, at this point, to spin anything else off" to add to the universe,[13] though after Vixen was renewed for a second season he said that, "Hopefully, that character could actually spin itself out, if not, maybe join as one of the Legends" in Legends of Tomorrow.[14]
