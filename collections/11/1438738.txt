It is estimated that 500,000 women are raped in South Africa every year[21] with the average woman more likely to be raped than complete secondary school.[22] A 2009 survey found one in four South African men admitted to raping someone[23] and another survey found one in three women out of 4000 surveyed women said they had been raped in the past year.[24]
