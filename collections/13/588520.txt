Throughout the later half of 2017, several members of the Parliament, including Deputy Prime Minister of Australia Barnaby Joyce, have had their eligibility for parliament challenged for breach of section 44 of the Constitution, due to dual citizenships. The High Court unanimously ruled on 27 October 2017 that a dual citizen is disqualified from taking seat in parliament, unless he/she had taken "all steps reasonably required by foreign law to renounce his or her citizenship of a foreign power". This meant that five parliamentarians were ineligible to take their seat. After the judgement, many other members of parliament have also been found to have dual citizenship and disqualified.
