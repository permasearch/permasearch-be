This tax treatment is often called the "hedge-fund loophole",[33] even though it is private equity funds that benefit from the treatment; hedge funds usually do not have long-term gains.[34] It has been criticized as "indefensible" and a "gross unfairness",[35] because it taxes management services at a preferential rate intended for long-term gains. Warren Buffett has used the term "coddling the super rich".[36] One counterargument is that the preferential rate is warranted because a grant of carried interest is often deferred and contingent, making it less reliable than a regular salary.[37]
