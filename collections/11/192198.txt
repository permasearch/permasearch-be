The new brand was produced by Chicago-based company Breaker Confections (a subsidiary of Quaker Oats), which in 1975 was acquired by Sunmark Corporation of Saint Louis, Missouri. The original Wonka Bars never saw store shelves due to factory production problems prior to the film's release, but subsequent Wonka product releases were highly successful. In 1980 Breaker Confections changed its name to Willy Wonka Brands in an attempt at developing its Wonka brand image before it sold-out in 1986 to Rowntree Mackintosh Confectionery of the UK, who sold-out in 1988 to Swiss company Nestl√©, who in 1993 renamed it to Willy Wonka Candy Company.[4] Today, the company produces over 100 different varieties of candy.
