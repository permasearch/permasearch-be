Governor Samuel "Sam" Denning was Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii, replacing Gov. Jameson after her death. He is much more "by the book" and withdraws his predecessor's assurance to the Five-0 Task Force of "full immunity and means". Instead, he brings in former federal agent Lori Weston as a "spy" to keep McGarrett and the rest of Five-0 in line, much to their displeasure. In season 3 he and McGarrett come to a mutual agreement to be open with one another about investigations, with McGarrett pointing out that Governor Jameson's dishonesty was what got her killed. Although not always agreeing with McGarrett's style, Governor Denning does vouch for and backs him when necessary. For example, he dismisses Lou Grover's complaint against McGarrett in season 4 and instead forces the both of them to serve a warrant together and work out their differences themselves.
