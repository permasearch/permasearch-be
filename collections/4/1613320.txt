After signing to Taang! Records and touring to support their initial releases, Swirlies underwent several line up changes, resulting in the departure of original guitarist/vocalist Seana Carmody and drummer Ben Drucker, who were replaced by Christina Files and Anthony De Luca respectively.[5] The band spent two years conceiving and writing new material for a second LP. They recorded songs gradually as they came, booking time at various studios with sound engineer Rich Costey who had recently moved from Boston to New York to head the studio run by Philip Glass.[6] The resultant album and songs were much more reliant on instrument-swapping, as Files traded duties with bass player Andy Bermick and all but drummer Da Luca attended keyboards, samplers, vocoders, drum machines, and other electronic equipment.[7]
