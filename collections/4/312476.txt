Further inspiration for "Rock the Casbah"'s lyrics originated from Joe Strummer observing the band's manager Bernie Rhodes moaning about The Clash's increasing tendency to perform lengthy songs. Rhodes asked the band facetiously "does everything have to be as long as this rāga?" (referring to the Indian musical style known for its length and complexity). Strummer later returned to his room at the Iroquois Hotel and wrote the opening lines to the song: "The King told the boogie-men 'you have to let that rāga drop.'"[11][10][9]
