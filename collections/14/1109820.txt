Ordinary mesons are made up of a valence quark and a valence antiquark. Because mesons have spin of 0 or 1 and are not themselves elementary particles, they are "composite" bosons. Examples of mesons include the pion, kaon, and the J/Ïˆ. In quantum hydrodynamic models, mesons mediate the residual strong force between nucleons.
