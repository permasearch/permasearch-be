During the 19th and 20th centuries most of the Indian princely states fell under the British Raj.[48] The British rule during the 19th century did not take adequate measures to help develop science and technology in India and instead focused more on arts and humanities.[49] Till 1899 only the University of Bombay offered a separate degree in sciences.[50] In 1899 B.Sc and M.Sc. courses were also supported by the University of Calcutta.[51] By the late 19th century India had lagged behind in science and technology and related education.[49] However, the nobility and aristocracy in India largely continued to encourage the development of sciences and technical education, both traditional and western.[48]
