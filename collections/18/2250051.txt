Kevin first appears in "Mr. Monk and the Paperboy", where he wins a $43 million lottery, although his "girlfriend" Vicki Salinas (Nicole DeHuff), a clerk at the nearby Stop-N-Go convenience store, tries to hide it from him with the objective of eventually getting it all. Her accomplice, the store's night manager, kills paperboy Nestor Alvarez while trying to steal newspapers that they think are Kevin's (they are actually Monk's papers). Later, Vicki kills the accomplice by stabbing him with a cream soda bottle while he is making the store's night deposit. Vicki then tries killing Kevin by stopping their car at a certain point in the road and drugging him - which happens to be on a grade crossing right as the lights begin to flash and the gates begin to lower. Monk and Sharona arrive, having followed him thanks to a travel brochure, and after a struggle with Vicki, throw the switch at the crossover to shift the approaching train to the other track, just in the nick of time, sparing Kevin.
