Many transcription factors, especially some that are proto-oncogenes or tumor suppressors, help regulate the cell cycle and as such determine how large a cell will get and when it can divide into two daughter cells.[30][31] One example is the Myc oncogene, which has important roles in cell growth and apoptosis.[32]
