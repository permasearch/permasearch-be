The 1978 syndicated revival of Jeopardy! held a Tournament of Champions in early 1979 featuring top-earning champions from prior games of that season, though the format is unclear from surviving episodes. A copy of the final episode exists (sans the contestants' last names), which saw contestant Stuart defeat Phillip and Tom to win the event.
