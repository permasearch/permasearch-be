Excluding the 2003 MR2 and European Celicas with the 1ZZ engine, the 2ZZ engine is also the only model in the ZZ engine family to use a six-speed manual transmission, as well as the only one to have been available with a four-speed Tiptronic-style automatic. These gearboxes were unique to this engine; since then, only a few Toyota engines have been paired with either a six-speed manual or a Tiptronic-style automatic (and only one other engine, the 4GR-FSE, has received both.)
