The 2011 general election brought three NCMPs into Parliament: Lina Loh (the wife of Chiam See Tong, the former MP for Potong Pasir Single Member Constituency) of the Singapore People's Party, and Gerald Giam and Yee Jenn Jong of the Workers' Party of Singapore. The general election of 2015 brought in three different NCMPs into Parliament: Dennis Tan, Leon Perera and Daniel Goh. A NCMP seat was offered to former MP for Punggol East, Lee Li Lian but she declined and the seat was eventually accepted by Associate Professor Daniel Goh.
