Liberal governments also changed the seat of government and the nature of church-state relations. The presidency and the Congress were moved to La Paz, which became the de facto capital, but the Supreme Court remained in Sucre. Liberal presidents canceled the special privileges officially granted to the Roman Catholic Church, in 1905 they legalized public worship by other faiths, and in 1911 they made civil marriage a requirement.[7]
