Jehovah's Witnesses emphasize the use of God's name, and they prefer the form Jehovahâ€”a vocalization of God's name based on the Tetragrammaton.[165][166][167] They believe that Jehovah is the only true God, the creator of all things, and the "Universal Sovereign". They believe that all worship should be directed toward him, and that he is not part of a Trinity;[168] consequently, the group places more emphasis on God than on Christ.[169][170] They believe that the Holy Spirit is God's applied power or "active force", rather than a person.[171][172]
