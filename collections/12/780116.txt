Arachnophobia is a specific phobiaâ€”it is the abnormal fear of spiders or anything reminiscent of spiders, such as webs or spider-like shapes. It is one of the most common specific phobias,[106][107] and some statistics show that 50% of women and 10% of men show symptoms.[108] It may be an exaggerated form of an instinctive response that helped early humans to survive,[109] or a cultural phenomenon that is most common in predominantly European societies.[110]
