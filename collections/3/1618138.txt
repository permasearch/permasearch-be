The Adventures of Pete & Pete began on Nickelodeon in 1989, as minute-long shorts that aired as interstitials. Owing to the popularity of the shorts, five half-hour specials were made, followed by a regular half-hour series that ran for three seasons from 1993 to 1996. Reruns of the shorts and the shows now run on TeenNick as part of their block The Splat on October 5, 2015. Jason Ankeny of AllMusic called the series "the greatest children's show ever",[1] while IGN called it "one of the most well-written kids shows ever".[2] The first two seasons were released on DVD in 2005; the third was planned for 2006 but was indefinitely postponed.
