In the Republic of Ireland, most secondary schools start summer holidays the first week of June, or at the end of the Junior Certificate and Leaving Certificate exams (approximately 20th June), and don't return until 20-26th August. Other holidays include two weeks for Easter and another two for Christmas and New Year, as well as two midterms with one in October/November during the week of Halloween and one usually in the month of February. Primary schools in the Republic of Ireland work sixteen days longer, so they start their summer holiday at the end of June but do not return until the first week of September.[9] Private schools in the Republic of Ireland follow the same pattern.
