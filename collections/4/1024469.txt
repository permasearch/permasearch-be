Matlock had largely become, like Silverman and Hargrove's Perry Mason older TV series revival, a "movie-of-the-week" type series by season nine. Part of the reason for this was Griffith's advancing age, as he was wanting to spend more time with his family as he was pushing age 70. Before that season, Brynn Thayer departed from the series and Leanne was mysteriously never heard from again. In season nine Carol Huston joined the series as Jerri Stone, a secondary private investigator helping out Cliff in his duties. Like Conrad McMasters, Jerri and Matlock had shared hobbies including singing.
