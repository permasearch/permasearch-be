On 21 March 1955, Big Maybelle made the first recording for Okeh Records. The songwriting was credited to D. C. Williams, and the record was produced by Quincy Jones.[3] Roy Hall made a recording of the song in September 1955 for Decca Records and maintained that he had written it and had secured the legal copyright as co-writer under the pseudonym of "Sunny David". However, a Decca sample copy of Hall's recording lists Dave Williams as the sole writer. On the Pop Chronicles documentary, Jerry Lee Lewis incorrectly credited Big Mama Thornton.[4] All subsequent recordings of the song (including Lewis' recording for Sun Records) list the composers as Sunny David and Dave Williams. Hall was also a Nashville club owner, who later claimed to have employed the young piano player Lewis at some point around 1954.[5]
