It has been suggested that Trump's visit would have to take place outside London, after Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the chief of the Metropolitan Police, said that he had concerns about the visit given the amount of protests expected.[399] One suggestion being considered is for Trump to address a rally at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham,[393] a city where 50.4% of voters voted to leave the EU,[400] rather than London, which saw 59.9% voting to remain.[401] Local politicians and activists in Birmingham promised to stage protests if the visit is moved, with Shabana Mahmood, Labour MP for the Birmingham Ladywood constituency, saying that "President Trump with his hateful and divisive rhetoric, policies and Muslim ban is not welcome here."[402]
