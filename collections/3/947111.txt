Olive oil has a long history of being use as a home skincare remedy. Egyptians used it alongside beeswax as a cleanser, moisturizer, and antibacterial agent since pharaonic times.[47] In ancient Greece, olive oil was used during massage, to prevent sports injuries and relieve muscle fatigue.[48] In 2000, Japan was the top importer of olive oil in Asia (13,000 tons annually) because consumers there believe both the ingestion and topical application of olive oil to be good for skin and health.[49]
