On 23 May 2011, Agüero announced on his official website that he wanted to move from Atlético and formally asked to be released from his contract.[44][45] Agüero later spoke to ESPN, where he stated that he would "not be returning to Atlético".[46] On the same day that Agüero officially became a Manchester City player, Atlético hosted a 2011–12 Europa League qualifier against Strømsgodset IF, where a group of Atlético fans brandished "Agüero, We Hope You Die" banners in a reaction to the striker's £38 million move to City at the Vicente Calderón on 28 July 2011, after he had previously stated his desire to see out his contract with the club just weeks before requesting a transfer.[47] Upon his departure, Atlético used the €45 million from Agüero's sale to buy Radamel Falcao as his replacement.[48]
