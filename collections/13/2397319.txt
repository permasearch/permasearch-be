A fan was detained by police while suffering the effects of LSD during  a concert in Southaven, Mississippi.  He was then restrained and taken to a local hospital emergency room where he later died.  He was still in police custody at the time.[34] Toxicology report proved that an LSD overdose was in fact not the cause of death, but the side effects of the drug caused a serious behavioral reaction that required restraint to protect him and others.[35] On November 18, 2015 autopsy findings stated that 'hogtying' contributed to the death of the fan.[36]
