In Ultimate Spider-Man #128, Gwen was reintroduced to the series. Carnage had recreated her body and her memories as essentially a clone. After a battle with Venom, Carnage left Gwen to join with Eddie Brock. Since this battle, Gwen has been completely rid of the Carnage symbiote and is now living with May Parker.
