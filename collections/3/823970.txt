The Aegean Collapse has been attributed to the exhaustion of the Cypriot forests causing the end of the bronze trade.[64][65][66] These forests are known to have existed into later times, and experiments have shown that charcoal production on the scale necessary for the bronze production of the late Bronze Age would have exhausted them in less than fifty years.
