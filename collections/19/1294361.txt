Mo is a kind, eccentric kid in the Dumping Ground. He first appeared in "Oh, Mo!" His age is 10, as of series 3 of The Dumping Ground. In series 4, Mo has shown an annoyance to younger residents like Joseph. Which is quite hypocritical, been as how Mo was when he first arrived at the dumping ground.
