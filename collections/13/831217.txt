The top athletes from each regional event advance to the CrossFit Games, which are held over three days in July or August. The men's and women's events each consist of 40 competitors vying for 3 podium positions and approximately $750,000 in total prize money (the overall prize purse of $2.2 million, as of 2016, includes payouts to other divisions).
