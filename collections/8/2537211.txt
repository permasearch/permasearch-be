In his 1981 work, The Theory of Communicative Action, philosopher Jurgen Habermas endorsed Weber's belief that instrumental and value-rational motives can explain observable actions. He applied multiple labels to Weber's dichotomy. Instrumental action appeared as "teleological" or simply "work". Value-rational action appeared as "normatively regulated".[2]:II:168–74[9][10]:63–4 In later works he sharpened Weber's original labels. Instrumental action is motivated by "nonpublic and actor-relative reasons" and value-rational action is motivated by "publicly defensible and actor-independent reasons".[11]
