In 1961, Danish jazz guitarist Jørgen Ingmann's cover of "Apache" went to #2 in the US and #2 in Canada.[1] A 1973 version by the Incredible Bongo Band has been called "hip-hop’s national anthem".[4] Although this version was not a hit on release, its long percussion break has been sampled countless times on hip hop and dance tracks since the 1980s.
