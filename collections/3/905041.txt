In the case of the Earth, the magnetic field is induced and constantly maintained by the convection of liquid iron in the outer core.  A requirement for the induction of field is a rotating fluid.  Rotation in the outer core is supplied by the Coriolis effect caused by the rotation of the Earth.  The Coriolis force tends to organize fluid motions and electric currents into columns (also see Taylor columns) aligned with the rotation axis.  Induction or creation of magnetic field is described by the induction equation:
