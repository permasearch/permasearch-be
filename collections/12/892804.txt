All the interior and exterior high school scenes were filmed on the Brookline High School campus, except for the scene in the gymnasium.[citation needed] The exterior shot is the Brookline High School gym, but the interior was Cousens Gymnasium at Tufts University. Other scenes from the movie were shot in the Boston area. For example, the scenes at Julie's house were filmed in nearby Newton.
