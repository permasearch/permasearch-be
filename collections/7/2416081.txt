The first known reference to boiling tea came from the Han dynasty work "The Contract for a Youth" written by Wang Bao where, among the tasks listed to be undertaken by the youth, "he shall boil tea and fill the utensils" and "he shall buy tea at Wuyang".[22] The first record of cultivation of tea also dated it to this period (Ganlu era of Emperor Xuan of Han) when tea was cultivated on Meng Mountain (蒙山) near Chengdu. From the Tang to the Qing dynasties, the first 360 leaves of tea grown here were picked each spring and presented to the emperor. Even today its green and yellow teas, such as the Mengding Ganlu tea, are still sought after.[23] An unknown Chinese inventor was also the first person to invent a tea shredder.[24] An early credible record of tea drinking dates to 220 AD, in a medical text Shi Lun (食论) by Hua Tuo, who stated, "to drink bitter t'u constantly makes one think better."[25] Another possible early reference to tea is found in a letter written by the Qin Dynasty general Liu Kun.[2] However, before the mid-8th century Tang dynasty, tea-drinking was primarily a southern Chinese practice.[20] It became widely popular during the Tang Dynasty, when it was spread to Korea, Japan, and Vietnam.
