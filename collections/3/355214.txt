The announcer models prizes such as men's watches, suits, and other accessories, a practice that began with original announcer Johnny Olson and has continued with his three successors (Rod Roddy, Rich Fields, and George Gray). The announcer also appeared in Showcase skits, sometimes modeling the prizes or playing a character in a story line. Starting in 2010, on episodes where two models appear in games typically featuring three models, the announcer will assume the third model's role and often is paired with another model when describing prizes. With a video screen added to the announcer's podium in 2011 tapings, a prize (or graphics for trips) may be displayed on the announcer's podium, and some prizes (such as a laptop computer) may be modeled by the announcer from his podium.
