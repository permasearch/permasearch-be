Kubo has stated that Ichigo's greatest strength is his considerate and thoughtful nature; he always thinks about other's needs. However, he also noted it as his greatest weakness, since worrying about his friends tends to put him in danger. When asked in an interview if he had any plans to focus on the love triangle between Ichigo, Orihime, and Rukia, Kubo chose neither to confirm nor deny it as he didn't want to focus on romance.[12] Kubo attributes Ichigo's popularity among readers to the fact that he "looks cool". He also mentioned that as people read more about him they will discover that he is a warm and kind-hearted person.[13]
