On October 11, the Associated Press reported that North Korea had threatened war if attempts would be made to penalize them through further sanctions.[19] This statement occurred even as Japan moved to tighten sanctions on the country.[19] South Korea said they were ensuring their troops were prepared for nuclear war.[19] A U.S. Army major, stationed along the border between North and South Korea, said that the overall situation was "calm" but that "Communist troops were more boldly trying to provoke their southern counterparts: spitting across the demarcation line, making throat-slashing hand gestures, flashing their middle fingers and trying to talk to the troops."[19]
