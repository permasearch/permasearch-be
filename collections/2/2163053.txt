When Ur was founded, the Persian Gulf's water level was 2.5 meters higher than it is today. Ur is therefore thought to have had marshy surroundings, and used canals only for transportation, not for irrigation. Fish, birds, tubers, and reeds might have supported Ur economically without the need for an agricultural revolution sometimes hypostatized as a prerequisite to urbanization.[9][10]
