Pearl, Pearl Light, and Country Club are still available to this day, but only in small volumes and in select markets such as Texas and Oklahoma.  Today's distribution is greatly reduced from the 47-state coverage Pearl's beers once enjoyed.  In addition, the variety in which Pearl's beers were available has also decreased.  Although previously produced and sold in every form, such as bottles, cans, and kegs, the current iteration of Pearl is only available in 12-packs of 12-oz. cans.  Likewise Country Club has been reduced to only 40-oz. bottles.[32]  Many who have tasted Pearl before and after the Pabst merger claim the formula has changed; customers say todayâ€™s Pearl tastes like a weaker version of Budweiser.  Officially, though, Pabst claims the formula used for today's Pearl is the same that was originally bought by the San Antonio Brewing Association back in 1886.[33]
