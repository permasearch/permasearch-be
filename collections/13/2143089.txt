In the 1970s, the price of raccoon pelts rose again to a high of 25 to 30 dollars each, and some people made their entire income from coon hunting. It was possible to catch ten raccoons per night in well-populated areas, with good dogs.[9] One outdoors writer estimated that in 1985 there were 30 to 40 thousand coon hunters in Michigan alone.[31] This market hunting largely died out by the late 1980s,[9] and it is estimated that during the fur boom trapping took more raccoons than hunting with dogs.[3]
