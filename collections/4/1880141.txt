Some physical similarities existed between the two women but the severity of the injuries, which included severe head trauma and the immediate inability to communicate led local government officials to mis-identify the casualties, the hospital to carry through with the unfortunate action and caused both families to respond in a manner appropriate to the situation of each casualty: Cerak was taken care of by the van Ryn family in the belief that she was their daughter. Meanwhile, Laura was interred in a marked grave at a funeral with 1400 people in attendance. Five weeks passed before incidents arose that caused suspicion about identity: she made comments about things and people that were inconsistent with facts pertaining to Laura; and a university roommate also reported some physical discrepancies. "Laura" confirmed that it was 'Whitney Cerak' that had survived when asked by hospital staff to write down the patient's name, which was then confirmed by dental records. The tragic mix-up appeared to have been caused by the similarities of appearance of Cerak and van Ryn, and the confusion at the crash scene. Neither family spoke publicly about the incident for nearly two years.[12][13]
