The fourth single, "Hahaha", was uploaded by the band to their YouTube page on June 7.[18] That same day, the album's release date was announced as June 22.[19] A music video for the track "Dilemma" featuring Andrew Adamson was uploaded on the Death Grips YouTube channel on June 15.[20] A sixth single, "Shitshow", was uploaded to YouTube two days later.[21] Three days later, on June 20, the official video for "Shitshow" was released. It was directed by Zach Hill and Galen Pehrson. However, the video's explicit nature led to YouTube taking down the video and giving Death Grips' channel a community strike,[22] after which the band re-uploaded the music video to Vimeo. The album was officially released on streaming platforms on June 22, as well as on Death Grips' YouTube.
