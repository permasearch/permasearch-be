Dachshunds come in three sizes: standard, miniature,[9] and kaninchen (German for "rabbit"). Although the standard and miniature sizes are recognized almost universally, the rabbit size is not recognized by clubs in the United States and the United Kingdom. The rabbit size is recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (World Canine Federation) (FCI), which contain kennel clubs from 83 countries all over the world.[10] An increasingly common size for family pets falls between the miniature and the standard size, frequently referred to as "tweenies," not an official classification.[11]
