In western Uganda one finds numerous earthworks near the Katonga River. These earthworks have been affiliated with the Empire of Kitara. The most famous Bigo Bya Mugenyi is about four square miles with the Katonga River on one side. The earthwork ditch was dug out by lifting cutting through solid bedrock and earth, about 200,000 cubic metres. It was about 12 feet (3.7Â m) high. It is not certain whether the function was for defense or pastoral use. Very little is known about the Ugandan earthworks.[26]
