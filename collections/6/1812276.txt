James's visit to Denmark, a country familiar with witch-hunts, sparked an interest in the study of witchcraft,[43] which he considered a branch of theology.[44] He attended the North Berwick witch trials, the first major persecution of witches in Scotland under the Witchcraft Act 1563. Several people were convicted of using witchcraft to send storms against James's ship, most notably Agnes Sampson.
