After the massacre at Isstvan V, the broken remnants of three Legions formed a guerrilla force dedicated to slowing Horus's advance on Terra. The ten tales in this volume relate exceptional stories of heroism by these Shattered Legions. Driven almost to the brink of self-destruction at Isstvan V, the Iron Hands now seek vengeance for the murder of their primarch Ferrus Manus. Gathering survivors from the Raven Guard and the Salamanders aboard any vessels capable of warp travel, these Shattered Legions wage a new campaign of annihilation against the traitor forces across the galaxy â€“ a campaign masterminded by legendary warleader Shadrak Meduson.
