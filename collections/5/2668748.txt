Just over half (51%) of test takers take IELTS to enter higher education in a foreign country.[33]  The IELTS minimum scores required by academic institutions and by course vary. As a general rule, the top ranked universities in the United States tend to require a higher IELTS band (typically 7.0). Most universities accept scores between 6-7 as being suitable for undergraduate study in English.[34]
