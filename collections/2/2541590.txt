The Draupadi Ratha is an 11 by 11 feet (3.4 by 3.4Â m) stone structure north of Arjuna Ratha, and they share a platform.[57] Dedicated to[who?] (whose image is carved on the rear wall), it resembles a wooden hut and has a curved roof. There is a carved structure with alternating lions and elephants, and the shrine deity is missing.[57][45] Its design is a simplified Nagara-style Hindu temple. The ratha has reliefs of Durga; three images are on the outer walls, and one is on an interior wall. The east-facing Durga is her Mahishasuramardini form, with the head of buffalo. Depicted elsewhere with her are devotees, makaras (mythical sea creatures) and ganas (mythical, comic dwarfs).[59]
