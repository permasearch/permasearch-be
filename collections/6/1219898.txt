During World War II, the temple was occupied by Japanese forces and got damaged, by fire, during the battle for the liberation of Manila in 1945. It was rebuilt in 1948. Unfortunately in 2000, the temple, including the relics of Freemasonry in the Philippines, were destroyed by fire. It was reconstructed and the new building was formally inaugurated in 2006.[2]
