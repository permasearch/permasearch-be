The Geneva Accords promised elections in 1956 to determine a national government for a united Vietnam. Neither the United States government nor Ngo Dinh Diem's State of Vietnam signed anything at the 1954 Geneva Conference. With respect to the question of reunification, the non-communist Vietnamese delegation objected strenuously to any division of Vietnam, but lost out when the French accepted the proposal of Viet Minh delegate Pham Van Dong,[68] who proposed that Vietnam eventually be united by elections under the supervision of "local commissions".[69] The United States countered with what became known as the "American Plan", with the support of South Vietnam and the United Kingdom.[70] It provided for unification elections under the supervision of the United Nations, but was rejected by the Soviet delegation.[70] From his home in France, Bảo Đại appointed Ngô Đình Diệm as Prime Minister of South Vietnam. With American support, in 1955 Diem used a referendum to remove the former Emperor and declare himself the president of the Republic of Vietnam.
