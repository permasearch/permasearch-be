Robing symbolizes the passing of the student leadership from the senior class to the junior class. The specific origin of the robing ceremony is not known, but it may have occurred as early as 1902. Seniors place their caps and gowns on the juniors, and this is the first time the juniors are allowed to sing the alumni/senior song, “Up with the Purple”. Since 2007, Robing has been held on the Friday of Midnight March with Class Ring Ceremony.[34]
