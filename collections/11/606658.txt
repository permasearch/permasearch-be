The slogan "exhortation, organization, and reprisals" expressed the discipline and motivation which ensured the Red Army's tactical and strategic success. On campaign, the attached Cheka Special Punitive Brigades conducted summary field courts-martial and executions of deserters and slackers.[17][24] Under Commissar Jānis K. Bērziņš the Special Punitive Brigades took hostages from the villages of deserters to compel their surrender; one in ten of those returning was executed. The same tactic also suppressed peasant rebellions in areas controlled by the Red Army, the biggest of them being the Tambov Rebellion.[25] The Soviets enforced the loyalty of the various political, ethnic, and national groups in the Red Army through political commissars attached at the brigade and regimental levels. The commissars also had the task of spying on commanders for political incorrectness.[26] Political commissars whose Chekist detachments retreated or broke in the face of the enemy earned the death penalty.[citation needed] In August 1918, Trotsky authorized General Mikhail Tukhachevsky to place blocking units behind politically unreliable Red Army units, to shoot anyone who retreated without permission.[27] In 1942, during the Great Patriotic War (1941–1945), Joseph Stalin reintroduced the blocking policy, using penal battalions.
