In the midst of these events, Chloe begins a recurring relationship with Chance's brother Ronan Malloy (Jeff Branson). The actress was pleased with the pairing's potential; "My fingers are crossed that there will be more to come because I think those two characters could go so far with each other".[29] Jeff Branson was also hopeful for the pairing, commending them for bringing out a "different side" of Ronan, describing them as "a chance for him to drop the frosty, crusty exterior he puts on because Chloe really gets under his skin, but in a good way."[30]
