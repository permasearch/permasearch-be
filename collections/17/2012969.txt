Typically, patients who undergo adjustable gastric banding procedures lose less weight over the first 3.5 years than those who have RNY gastric bypass, BPD, or DS surgeries. Although other procedures appear to result in greater weight loss than adjustable gastric banding in the short term, results from the study by Maggard suggest that this difference decreases significantly over time.[19] Gastric banding patients lose an average[clarification needed] of 47.5% of their excess weight, according to a meta analysis by Buchwald.[5]
