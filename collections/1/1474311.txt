Hippolyta boarded a small boat and let it cast adrift. She eventually landed in Louisiana where she met a psychic named Angela.[18][19][20] After becoming friends with Angela and her family, Angela informed Hippolyta that her daughter was in serious danger.[21] Rushing to her aid, Hippolyta arrived too late to save Diana from the demon Neron, as Diana was still suffering from the spell that had reduced her strength.[15] Thus, Hippolyta's vision of her daughter dying as Wonder Woman came true.[22]
