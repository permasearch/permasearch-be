Django Unchained was the first Tarantino film not edited by Sally Menke, who died in 2010. Editing duties were instead handled by Fred Raskin, who had worked as an assistant editor on Tarantino's Kill Bill.[36] Raskin was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Editing but lost to William Goldenberg for his work on Argo.
