In enzymes, the protein structure orients a few, key amino acids into precise geometries to form an active site to perform chemistry.[28] Since these active site networks frequently require the cooperation of multiple components, mutating any one of these components massively compromises activity, and so mutating a second component has a relatively minor effect on the already inactivated enzyme. For example, removing any member of the catalytic triad of many enzymes will reduce activity to levels low enough that the organism is no longer viable.[29][30][31]
