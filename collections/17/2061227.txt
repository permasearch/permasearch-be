After meeting in school, Clemens Rehbein and Philipp Dausch finished their secondary education at Jacob-Grimm-Schule in Kassel, Germany in 2012. Both were in a jazz quintet known as Flown Tones where Rehbein played bass guitar and Dausch was a guitarist.[4] The group disbanded after the drummer left, though Dausch and Rehbein continued to collaborate feeling they had a good connection.[5] They combined electronic production with acoustic guitar and their own vocals and lyrics.[1] Rehbein wrote most of the songs at home, then uploaded the songs to YouTube, where they gradually gained a following.[5].
