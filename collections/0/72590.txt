Andy Cole and Shearer – with 34 goals in 1993–94 and 1994–95, respectively – scored the most goals to win the Golden Boot,[10][A] while Nicolas Anelka scored the fewest to clinch the award outright, with 19 goals in 2008–09.[8] The all-time record for lowest number of goals scored to be bestowed the award, however, is 18 goals; this was achieved during the 1997–98 and 1998–99 seasons, when the award was shared between three players both times.[15] The latter season marked the last time the Golden Boot was shared until 2010–11,[16] when Dimitar Berbatov and Carlos Tevez both scored 20 goals that season to tie for the award.[17] Harry Kane recorded the highest goals-to-games ratio to win the award, scoring 29 goals in 30 games in 2016–17 for a rate of 0.97.[18]
