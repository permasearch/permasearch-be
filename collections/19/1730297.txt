In computer engineering, "computer architecture" is a set of rules and methods that describe the functionality, organization, and implementation of computer systems. Some definitions of architecture define it as describing the capabilities and programming model of a computer but not a particular implementation.[34] In other definitions computer architecture involves instruction set architecture design, microarchitecture design, logic design, and implementation.[35]
