Enos is a friendly gentleman encountered by teenager Annie Phillips in Friday the 13th. He agrees to drive her part of the way to Camp Crystal Lake and, during the drive, he informs Annie about the 1958 murders of camp counselors Barry and Claudette, as well as the mysterious fires and water contamination. Unfortunately, his warnings are dismissed by Annie. He is played the late Rex Everhart (who later became known as the voice of Belle's father, Maurice, from Disney's Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)).
