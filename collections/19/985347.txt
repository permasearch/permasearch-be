The Looney Tunes Show is an American animated sitcom that ran from May 3, 2011 through August 31, 2014 on Cartoon Network. The show consists of two seasons, each containing 26 episodes, and features characters from the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies theatrical cartoons updated for the 21st century. It is produced by Warner Bros. Animation. On July 29, 2014, producer Tony Cervone confirmed that the series was cancelled and not renewed for a third season because of Warner Bros.' favor in the newer spin-off, Wabbit.[1] Despite the cancellation of the show, an animated direct-to-video feature, Looney Tunes: Rabbits Run, was released to retail stores on August 4, 2015.[2]
