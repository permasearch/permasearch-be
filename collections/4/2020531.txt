The Sailor Starlights (セーラースターライツ, Sērā Sutāraitsu) are a group of Sailor Soldiers composed of Sailor Star Fighter, Sailor Star Maker, and Sailor Star Healer; in civilian form they go by the pseudonyms Kou Seiya, Kou Taiki, and Kou Yaten, respectively. They come from the fictional planet Kinmoku, whose princess, Princess Kakyuu, left the planet to escape Sailor Galaxia's assault and to heal her wounds. The Starlights abandon Kinmoku and track Kakyuu to Earth and then Japan, where the Starlights disguise themselves as a male pop star group called The Three Lights (スリーライツ, Surī Raitsu) and embed their music with a telepathic broadcast in order to attract Kakyuu's attention. The Three Lights all attend Jūban High School along with Usagi and her friends. Eventually, on their way to the Galaxy Cauldron, they are killed by Galaxia's servants Sailor Chi and Sailor Phi.
