In the 1980s, Rolls-Royce plc reinstated the program to provide the operator with a fixed engine maintenance cost over an extended period of time. Operators are assured of an accurate cost projection and avoid the breakdowns costs; the term is trademarked by Rolls-Royce but is the common name in the industry.[18] It is an option for operators of several Rolls-Royce aircraft engines.[citation needed] Other aircraft engine manufacturers such as General Electric and Pratt & Whitney offer similar programs.
