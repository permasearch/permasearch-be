After restoring the Asgardian gods with a gathering of energies donated by Skyfathers from other pantheons,[109] Thor has a series of adventures on Earth, including encountering two Heralds of Galactus in swift succession;[110][111] stopping Mephisto from taking human souls;[112] clearing his name when framed by Asgardian god of war Tyr;[113][114] aiding Drax the Destroyer;[115] with ally Iron Man defeating the Bi-Beast and the Man-Beast;[116][117][118] engaging the former king of Nastrond Fafnir transformed by Odin into a dragon in combat when freed by Loki,[119] and battling Dracula.[120][121] Thor learns of the existence of the "God Eater", a creature summoned when the death gods of several pantheons temporarily merge their realms. Thor thwarts the creature – revealed to be in humanoid guise Atum, the son of Gaea, and therefore Thor's half-brother – and ensures the cosmic balance is restored.[122]
