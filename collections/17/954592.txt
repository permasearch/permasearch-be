Metals only exist in solution as coordination complexes, it follows then that this class of compounds is useful in a wide variety of ways. Coordination compounds are therefore found both in nature and in industry (in, especially, color-rich ways). Some common complex ions include such substances as vitamin B12, the heme group in hemoglobin and the cytochromes, and the chlorin group in chlorophyll (which are dark red or cherry colored, blood red, and green in color respectively), and some dyes and pigments. One major use of coordination compounds is in homogeneous catalysis for the production of organic substances.
