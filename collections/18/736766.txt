With the financial and critical success of the 2001 film The Fellowship of the Ring and the 2002 film The Two Towers,[16] Universal approached Jackson in early 2003,[6] during the post-production of The Return of the King, concerning his interest in restarting development on King Kong. In March 2003, Universal set a target December 2005 release date and Jackson and Walsh brought The Lord of the Rings co-writer Philippa Boyens on to help rewrite their 1996 script.[16] Jackson offered New Line Cinema the opportunity to co-finance with Universal, but they declined.[6] Universal and Jackson originally projected a $150 million budget,[17] which eventually rose to $175 million.[18] Jackson made a deal with Universal whereby he would be paid a $20 million salary against 20% of the box office gross for directing, producing and co-writing. He shared that fee with co-writers Walsh (which also covered her producing credit) and Boyens.[19] However, if King Kong were to go over its $175 million budget, the penalties would be covered by Jackson.[20]
