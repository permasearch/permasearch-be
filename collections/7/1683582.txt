RCA, which had enjoyed a steady stream of product from Presley for over a decade, grew anxious as his interest in spending time in the studio waned. After a December 1973 session that produced 18 songs, enough for almost two albums, he did not enter the studio in 1974.[261] Parker sold RCA on another concert record, Elvis Recorded Live on Stage in Memphis.[262] Recorded on March 20, it included a version of "How Great Thou Art" that would win Presley his third and final competitive Grammy Award.[263] (All three of his competitive Grammy wins—out of 14 total nominations—were for gospel recordings.) Presley returned to the studio in Hollywood in March 1975, but Parker's attempts to arrange another session toward the end of the year were unsuccessful.[264] In 1976, RCA sent a mobile studio to Graceland that made possible two full-scale recording sessions at Presley's home.[265] Even in that comfortable context, the recording process became a struggle for him.[266]
