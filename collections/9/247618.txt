The meat for turkey bacon comes from the whole turkey and can be cured or uncured, smoked, chopped, and reformed into strips that resemble bacon.[1] Turkey bacon is cooked by pan-frying.[57] Cured turkey bacon made from dark meat can be 90% fat free.[58] The low fat content of turkey bacon means it does not shrink while being cooked and has a tendency to stick to the pan.[58]
