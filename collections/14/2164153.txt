The Paper Mill Playhouse, Milburn, New Jersey, produced the show from April 13 to May 15, 2005. The director was Gordon Greenberg, with choreography by Christopher Gattelli and the cast that starred Alice Ripley as Genevieve, Max von Essen as Dominique, Lenny Wolpe as Amiable, Gay Marshall (Denise) and Richard Pruitt (Claude).[12] The Paper Mill production included the reworking of the relationship between the characters of GeneviÃ¨ve and Dominique as well as new lyrics for "Proud Lady". The production received rave reviews across the board, including The New York Times, which exclaimed "after 30 years of fine-tuning, Messieurs Stein and Schwartz will have the lovely little musical they always wanted",[13] The New York Daily News, by Howard Kissel, who urged "The whole thing could - and should - be moved to Broadway, where it could find a well-deserved home",[14] Peter Filichia, from the Star Ledger, said: "Director Gordon Greenberg (who's staged the entire show superbly) gets the most of this moment, too. Everyone knows that man does not live by bread alone. He needs a good musical in his diet, too. 'The Baker's Wife' certainly is one to savor."[citation needed]
