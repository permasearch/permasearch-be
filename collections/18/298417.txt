All Tom shows appear to have incorporated elements of melodrama and blackface minstrelsy.[90] These plays varied tremendously in their politicsâ€”some faithfully reflected Stowe's sentimentalized antislavery politics, while others were more moderate, or even pro-slavery.[87] Many of the productions featured demeaning racial caricatures of Black people,[90] while a number of productions also featured songs by Stephen Foster (including "My Old Kentucky Home", "Old Folks at Home", and "Massa's in the Cold Ground").[86] The best-known Tom Shows were those of George Aiken and H.J. Conway.[87]
