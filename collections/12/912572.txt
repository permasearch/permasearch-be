French toast is commonly served as a breakfast food in India. It differs from other versions in that it generally omits any dairy or sweet component. French toast is generally made by beating plain eggs (salt is optional) and dipping pieces of white sliced bread in them for a brief soak, after which they are pan fried. During the cooking process, savory ingredients such as fried onions, cilantro leaves, diced tomato, or chopped green chilis may be added. Once the egg is set, the slices of French toast are often served with tomato ketchup.
