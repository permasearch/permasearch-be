Olluco is one of the most widely grown and economically important root crops in the Andean region of South America, second only to the potato.[2] The tuber is the primary edible part, but the leaf is also used and is similar to spinach.[3] They are known to contain high levels of protein, calcium, and carotene. Olluco was used by the Incas prior to arrival of Europeans in South America.
