In the silver mining town of Skalitz, young Henry is a simple peasant, living under his mother and his blacksmith father, Martin. After finishing some errands for his father, Henry joins him in completing a magnificent commissioned sword for King Wenceslaus' hetman, Sir Radzig Kobyla. While Henry wishes to explore and see life outside of the village, Martin insists that a quieter life is much safer than an adventurer's. Immediately after, an army of Cuman soldiers under Sigismund of Luxembourg's control attack and raid Skalitz, killing all who do not flee. Henry holds on to the sword and runs but later comes back for his mother and father, and witnesses their murder under Sigismund's crony, Sir Markvart von Aulitz. Henry flees to the safety of the castle, but is too late, and is forced to ride out to the nearest castle of Talmberg.
