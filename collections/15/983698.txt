Most modern engines are equipped with fuel injection, and have an electric submersible fuel pump in the fuel tank. Moving the fuel pump to the interior of the tank helps prevent vapour lock, since the entire fuel delivery system is under positive pressure and the fuel pump runs cooler than if it is located in the engine compartment. This is the primary reason that vapour lock is rare in modern fuel systems. For the same reason, some carburetted engines are retrofitted with an electric fuel pump near the fuel tank.
