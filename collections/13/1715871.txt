People can enroll in Medicare Advantage and other Part C health plans either by enrolling when they first become Medicare-eligible and first join both Parts A and B or by switching from traditional Medicare during an annual or special enrollment period as outlined in "Medicare and You, 2018" (there are over a dozen such enrollment periods).
