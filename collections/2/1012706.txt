Ibn Battuta continued by ship south to the Swahili Coast, a region then known in Arabic as the Bilad al-Zanj ("Land of the Zanj"),[46] with an overnight stop at the island town of Mombasa.[47] Although relatively small at the time, Mombasa would become important in the following century.[48] After a journey along the coast, Ibn Battuta next arrived in the island town of Kilwa in present-day Tanzania,[49] which had become an important transit centre of the gold trade.[50] He described the city as "one of the finest and most beautifully built towns; all the buildings are of wood, and the houses are roofed with dÄ«s reeds".[51]
