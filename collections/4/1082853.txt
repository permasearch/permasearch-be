In late 1994, the Croatian Army intervened several times in Bosnia: from November 1–3, in Operation Cincar near Kupres,[14] and on November 29 – December 24 in the Winter '94 operation near Dinara and Livno.[15][16] These operations were undertaken to detract from the siege of the Bihać region and to approach the RSK capital of Knin from the north, isolating it on three sides.[124]
