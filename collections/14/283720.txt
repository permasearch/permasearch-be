In 2002, the Netherlands passed a law legalizing euthanasia including physician-assisted suicide.[63] This law codifies the twenty-year-old convention of not prosecuting doctors who have committed euthanasia in very specific cases, under very specific circumstances. The Ministry of Public Health, Wellbeing and Sports claims that this practice "allows a person to end their life in dignity after having received every available type of palliative care."[64] The United Nations has reviewed and commented on the Netherlands euthanasia law.[citation needed]
