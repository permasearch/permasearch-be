The music video is based on M.C. Escher's Drawing Hands. Directed by Phil Harder, it features a simple musical session intercut with a rotoscoped animation of Brandon Boyd drawing himself. The animation was handled by both Boyd and drummer Jose Pasillas. The scenes from the official music video were shot in the McNamara Alumni Center on the University of Minnesota. The video was nominated for Best Group Video at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards but lost to 'N Sync.
