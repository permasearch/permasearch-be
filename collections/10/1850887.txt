In the United States, the use of lasers on the gums was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the early 1990s, and use on hard tissue like teeth or the bone of the mandible gained approval in 1996.[1] Several variants of dental lasers are in use with different wavelengths and these mean they are better suited for different applications.
