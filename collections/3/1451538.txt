The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health is pushing a higher emphasis on a hearing loss prevention program rather than a hearing conservation program.  While this change may seem superfluous, it is important to note the advancement.  Prevention implies a response by the workplace caused by initial signs of employee hearing loss rather than instilling a new set of policies (such as "buy quiet") and thinking (such as hearing protection training and education) to decrease the possibility of occupational hearing loss from happening in the first place.
