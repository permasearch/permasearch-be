In July 2012, Olsen was one of a limited number of artists invited to show in "Art with an Agenda: An Exhibit Inspired by Kelly Thomas", at the PAS Gallery in Fullerton, California.[6] All the art on display was inspired by the life and circumstances surrounding the death of Kelly Thomas, a homeless, schizophrenic, 37-year-old man who was brutally beaten by members of the Fullerton Police Department on July 5, 2011.[7] Olsen's piece, titled "Still Life," shows a half-eaten donut in a puddle of blood beside a lit flashlight.[8][9]
