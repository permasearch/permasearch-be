When Jane's mother, Janice, finally tries to talk about what's been going on, they're interrupted by Jane's father coming in while announcing that Taylor has come for a visit. After they're left alone by Jane's parents, Taylor confesses about her home life and how scared she is sometimes. Jane, wanting to comfort her, brushes Taylor's hair away and begins stroking it. Taylor stares at her for a moment, before she and Jane share their first kiss. In a voice over, Jane wonders to herself if kissing Taylor made her gay and that, at the time, she convinced herself that "it was just a phase". She then goes on to say that "it was the first time [she] ever felt connected to someone". After that, the two become an official couple.
