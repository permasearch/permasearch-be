When Pickett ordered Corse to the west side of Gilliam's field, he ordered Rooney Lee to prepare to withdraw to the South Side Railroad.[253] Lee covered his dismounted men with his mounted men and fought a successful delaying action as he slowly retreated.[253] He had to speed up as Corse's brigade collapsed.[234][253] Yet, Custer could not cut off many of Lee's men, who crossed Hatcher's Run at W. Dabney Road and then marched to Ford's Road to report to Fitzhugh Lee.[253] Custer followed Lee's men for about 6 miles (9.7Â km) but gave up and set up camp on the battlefield, where Pennington's brigade rejoined them, as darkness closed in.[253]
