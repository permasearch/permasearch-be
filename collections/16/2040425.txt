The current iteration of Memorial Stadium opened in 1960 as part of a new athletics area at the university and has a capacity of 52,929. It replaced the original Memorial Stadium, built in 1925, a 20,000-seat stadium located on 10th Street where the arboretum now stands. The stadium has been renovated or updated multiple times (1969, 2003, 2009 and 2016) since the original construction and is currently undergoing a renovation scheduled for an August 2018 completion.[84]
