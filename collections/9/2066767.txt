Electronic equipment from computers to intentional transmitters can produce unwanted radio signals and are subject to FCC regulation.  For digital devices including computers and peripherals, FCC Class B is the more stringent standard, applying to equipment marketed for use in the home, even if it could be used elsewhere.  Home users are likely to be annoyed by interference to TV and radio reception.  Class A is a looser standard for equipment intended only for business, industrial and commercial settings.
