The figure of ~$6.2 bilion for FY12 aid to Israel is, quite simply, a lie. The real amount is roughly the same as it was in FY11, i.e. around $3.1 billion. You might want to check in other sources to verify, as the number you quote is an obvious error. The figure of ~12.9 billion for Afhganistan also looks rather inflated. I recall a figure of $8.5 billion, but no certain. Once again, verify in other sources, and update as needed. False statistics only brings Wikipedia into further disrepute. JD
