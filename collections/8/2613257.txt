The authorities of the Republic of China (commonly known as "Taiwan") refer to the Hong Kong SAR passport as the "Hong Kong passport" because the ROC government tries to avoid references to the political status of Hong Kong as a SAR of the People's Republic of China.[16] While the Brazilian Consulate-General in Hong Kong uses the term "Hong Kong passport" in reference to both the Hong Kong SAR and British National (Overseas) passports.[17]
