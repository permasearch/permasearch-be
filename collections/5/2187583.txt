At the Flyers' home opener against the Toronto Maple Leafs on October 11, 1973, she made a surprise appearance to perform the song in person and received a tremendous reception. The Flyers won that game by a 2–0 score. She again performed the song at the Spectrum in front of a capacity crowd of 17,007 fans before game 6 of the Stanley Cup Finals on May 19, 1974, against the Boston Bruins. Before that game, Smith had a "Flyer Record" of 36–3–1. Boston's defenceman, Bobby Orr and center, Phil Esposito, infamously tried to jinx the Flyers' "good luck charm" by shaking her hand after her performance. The Flyers won their first of two back-to-back Stanley Cups, winning that playoff series against the Boston Bruins four games to two, with Bernie Parent shutting the Bruins out 1–0 in that game.
