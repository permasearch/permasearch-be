In a percolator, boiling water is forced into a chamber above a filter by steam pressure created by boiling. The water then seeps through the grounds, and the process is repeated until terminated by removing from the heat, by an internal timer,[101] or by a thermostat that turns off the heater when the entire pot reaches a certain temperature.
