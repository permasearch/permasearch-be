The IRS, state, and local tax authorities may examine a tax return and propose changes.  Changes to tax returns may be made with minimal advance involvement by taxpayers, such as changes to wage or dividend income to correct errors.  Other examination of returns may require extensive taxpayer involvement, such as an audit by the IRS.  These audits often require that taxpayers provide the IRS or other tax authority access to records of income and deductions.  Audits of businesses are usually conducted by IRS personnel at the business location.
