A number of characteristics highlight the differences between artificial sea glass and natural sea glass, starting with the coloration and surface texture of each piece.[15] An example of natural sea glass will usually have a frosty, almost powdery texture at different points.[15] One of the most reliable indicators for natural sea glass is a "C" shaped design all over the outside of the sample.[16] If the design is located on the piece, it is authentic sea glass, since artificial beach glass will typically not have that particular design.[16] Sea glass usually comes from broken glass bottles or other household items, so the pieces you find on the beach will not be perfectly shaped, unlike artificial sea glass, often sold as beach glass.[16]
