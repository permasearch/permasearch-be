The whole of the hotel's energy requirements are met through renewable sources, including waste water.[16] The hotel saves over 40 percent of energy by means of various energy efficiency features.[11] A 12.6-MW windmill caters to the power requirement of the hotel complex,[9] the excess of which is contributed to the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board.[10] The heating, ventilation and air conditioning in the complex are optimally controlled using a technology known as Hartman Loop.[9] The envelope materials of the building comprising composite wall assembly, multi-glazed windows, and roof-top insulation, well exceed the fenestration standards of ASHRAE/ECBC.[11] The roof is a combination of green roof, and the reflective paints and high SRI finish on the domes of the complex reduce thermal gradient differences after daylight hours. The hotel also has independent, programmable lighting controls installed in each area. Water is heated by means of solar concentrators. The hotel uses water-cooled refrigerants in place of air-cooled ones. Energy is saved by means of a jet-fan ventilation system.[9]
