Prototype theory came out of problems with the classical view of conceptual structure.[4] Prototype theory says that concepts specify properties that members of a class tend to possess, rather than must possess.[8] Wittgenstein, Rosch, Mervis, Berlin, Anglin, and Posner are a few of the key proponents and creators of this theory.[8][13] Wittgenstein describes the relationship between members of a class as family resemblances. There are not necessarily any necessary conditions for membership, a dog can still be a dog with only three legs.[10] This view is particularly supported by psychological experimental evidence for prototypicality effects.[10] Participants willingly and consistently rate objects in categories like 'vegetable' or 'furniture' as more or less typical of that class.[10][13] It seems that our categories are fuzzy psychologically, and so this structure has explanatory power.[10] We can judge an item's membership to the referent class of a concept by comparing it to the typical member â€“ the most central member of the concept. If it is similar enough in the relevant ways, it will be cognitively admitted as a member of the relevant class of entities.[10] Rosch suggests that every category is represented by a central exemplar which embodies all or the maximum possible number of features of a given category.[10] According to Lech, Gunturkun, and Suchan explain that categorization involves many areas of the brain, some of these are; visual association areas, prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and temporal lobe.
