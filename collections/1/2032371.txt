Barons are styled The Right Honourable The Lord [Barony].[7] Barons' wives are styled The Right Honourable The Lady [Barony]. Baronesses in their own right, whether hereditary or for life, are either styled The Right Honourable The Baroness [Barony] or The Right Honourable The Lady [Barony], mainly based on personal preference (e.g., Margaret, Baroness Thatcher and Brenda, Lady Hale, both created baronesses in their own right for life). Note the order of the names: 'Lady Brenda Hale' would denote that she were the daughter of an earl, marquess or duke and, in the case of men, 'Lord Digby Jones' would denote that he were the younger son of a marquess or duke, and should be properly styled "The Lord Jones of Birmingham" (or, less formally: "Digby, Lord Jones"). The Right Honourable is frequently abbreviated to The Rt Hon. or Rt Hon. When referred to by the Sovereign in public instruments, The Right Honourable is changed to Our right trusty and well-beloved, with Counsellor attached if they are a Privy Counsellor.
