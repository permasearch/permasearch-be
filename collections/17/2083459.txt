Meats have been cooked over open flames by the Aboriginal peoples of Canada since the beginning of the human habitation of North America.[14] US-style barbecue culture is a recent import to Canada, having been introduced following the Second World War.[15] Its arrival coincided with the commercially driven popularization of a type of "domestic masculinity" for middle-class suburban fathers in the 1950s. This was a sharp break with the Canadian tradition, however, and as late as 1955, an article in Maclean's magazine called the practice "weird".[16] Therefore, barbecue, in one sense, cannot be said to be a deeply held Canadian tradition. Yet by the late 1950s, the barbecue, once a fad, had become a permanent part of Canadian summers.
