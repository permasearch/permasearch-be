Unlike in humans, pica in dogs or cats may be a sign of immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, especially when it involves eating substances such as tile grout, concrete dust, and sand. Dogs exhibiting this form of pica should be tested for anemia with a CBC or at least hematocrit levels.[35][36] Although several theories have been proposed by experts for causes of pica in animals, there is insufficient evidence to prove or disprove any of them.[7]
