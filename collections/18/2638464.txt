There are further shocks for Tina when David tells her that Kylie and his half-brother Nick Tilsley (Ben Price), had a one-night stand on Christmas Day 2012. Tina is disgusted that David has started a vendetta against Nick and his wife, Leanne (Jane Danson). This comes to a head when David causes an accident that leaves Nick in a coma. Tina tells David that she wants nothing more to do with his problems but supports him after he has a DNA test done on Kylie's baby daughter, Lily, proving that David is her father. Kylie later becomes suspicious of David and Tina, thinking they are having an affair and she and Tina fight in The Rovers. The next day, Kylie apologises and begs Tina to tell her what is going on; Kylie later gets the truth from Nick. When Kylie throws David out, Tina offers him a place to stay, infuriating Tommy, who accuses Tina of never putting him first and leaves for the Canary Islands. A few weeks later, Tommy rings Tina and tells her he is not coming back and ends their relationship. Tina then begins feuding with Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), after she is nasty about Tina's surrogacy and Dennis pawns Rita's engagement ring at Tracy's new shop, culminating in Tina throwing a brick through the shop window.
