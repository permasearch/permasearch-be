Laws in many jurisdictions have been changed in recent years to allow wider distribution of naloxone.[66][67] Several states have also moved to permit pharmacies to dispense the medication without the person first seeing a physician or other non-pharmacist professional.[68] Over 200 naloxone distribution programs utilize licensed prescribers to distribute the drug, often through the use of standing medication orders [69][70] whereby the medication is distributed under the medical authority of a physician or other prescriber (such as a pharmacist under California's AB1535).
