The defeat of Russia and the alliance with Britain gave France increased authority and prestige in Europe. This was the first war between European powers since the close of the Napoleonic Wars and the Congress of Vienna, marking a breakdown of the alliance system that had maintained peace for nearly half a century. The war also effectively ended the Concert of Europe and the Quadruple Alliance, or "Waterloo Coalition," that the other four powers had established. The Paris Peace Conference of 1856 represented a high-water mark for the regime in foreign affairs.[83] It encouraged Napoleon III to make an even bolder foreign policy venture in Italy.[84]
