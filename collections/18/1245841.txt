On August 19, 2011, China's Ministry of Culture released a list of 100 songs including the then twelve-year-old "I Want it That Way" that were required to be removed from the Internet. This purge came about because the Ministry claimed that these songs had been released without first being subjected to a mandatory screening process conducted by Ministry officials as per official government policy. Media sites were given until September 15 to delete the named songs or face unspecified penalties. The Chinese government claims that such measures are necessary for national security purposes.[3]
