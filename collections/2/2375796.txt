The episode takes place on July 17th, 2012, the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, almost exclusively on a fictitious cul-de-sac named after the British athlete Kelly Holmes. While originally only intending to visit the ceremony, alien time traveller the Doctor (David Tennant) and his companion Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) investigate Chloe Webber (Abisola Agbaje), who has the ability to make people disappear by drawing them.
