On the outbreak of World War I in 1914, at the age of fifty-seven, Baden-Powell put himself at the disposal of the War Office. No command was given to him. It has been claimed[dubious – discuss] that Lord Kitchener said: "he could lay his hand on several competent divisional generals but could find no one who could carry on the invaluable work of the Boy Scouts."[33] It was rumoured that Baden-Powell was engaged in spying and Baden-Powell claimed[dubious – discuss] that intelligence officers spread this myth.[34]
