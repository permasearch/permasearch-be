By mid-1967, Jim McGuinn had changed his first name to Roger, as a result of his interest in the Indonesian religion Subud, into which he had been initiated in January 1965.[131]  The adoption of a new name was common among followers of the religion[132] and served to signify a spiritual rebirth for the participant.  Shortly after McGuinn's name change, the band entered the studio to record the Crosby-penned, non-album single "Lady Friend", which was released on July 13, 1967.[133]  The Byrds' biographer Johnny Rogan has described "Lady Friend" as "a work of great maturity" and "the loudest, fastest and rockiest Byrds' single to date."[131]  Regardless of its artistic merits, however, the single stalled at a disappointing number 82 on the Billboard chart, despite the band making a number of high-profile television appearances to promote the record.[133]  Crosby, who had closely overseen the recording of the song,[134][135] was bitterly disappointed by the single's lack of success and blamed Gary Usher's mixing of the song as a factor in its commercial failure.[131]
