Parsons produced a general theoretical system for the analysis of society, which he called "theory of action," based on the methodological and epistemological principle of "analytical realism" and on the ontological assumption of "voluntaristic action."[164] Parsons' concept of analytical realism can be regarded as a kind of compromise between nominalist and realist views on the nature of reality and human knowledge.[165] Parsons believed that objective reality can be related to only by a particular encounter of such reality and that general intellectual understanding is feasible through conceptual schemes and theories. Interaction with objective reality on an intellectual level should always be understood as an approach. Parsons often explained the meaning of analytical realism by quoting a statement by Henderson: "A fact is a statement about experience in terms of a conceptual scheme."[166]
