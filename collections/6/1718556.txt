The Japanese aircraft that survived were met by other fighters, and 16 more were shot down. Of the 27 aircraft which now remained, some made attacks on the picket destroyers USS Yarnall and USS Stockham but caused no damage. Between three and six bombers broke through to Lee's battleship group and attacked; one scored a direct hit on the main deck of USS South Dakota, which killed or injured over 50 men, but failed to disable her. South Dakota was the only American ship damaged in this attack. Not one aircraft of Ozawa's first wave got through to the American carriers.
