Many parts or elements of the myth of Oedipus occur before the opening scene of the play, although some are alluded to in the text.  Oedipus is the son of Laius and Jocasta, the king and queen of Thebes.  The misfortunes of his house are the result of a curse laid upon his father for violating the sacred laws of hospitality.  In his youth, Laius was the guest of Pelops, the king of Elis, and he became the tutor of Chrysippus, the king's youngest son, in chariot racing.  Laius seduced or abducted and raped Chrysippus, who according to some versions, killed himself in shame.  This murder cast a doom over Laius and all of his descendants (although many scholars regard Laius' transgressions against Chrysippus to be a late addition to the myth).
