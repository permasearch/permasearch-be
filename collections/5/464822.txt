Josh is a mortal guy that runs the coffee shop and gave Sabrina the job. Technically, Josh is her manager, although the relationship is somewhat different because Sabrina's aunt Hilda later owns the shop. Josh is interested in photography, and manages to sell one of his photographs for $1000 (with Sabrina's magical help). He was attracted to Sabrina in the fourth season, but at that time she was dating Harvey. He often acted jealously towards Harvey, and got a mostly negative review by the fans of the show. In the fifth season he dated Morgan, and then in the sixth season he dated Sabrina. In this season Sabrina is willing to tell Josh she is a witch, so that she can tell him she loves him, but in the end she does not have to and he never figures it out. In the Season 6 finale, Sabrina gambles her love life in order to bring her Aunt Hilda back to life because of this Josh took the offer in Prague, and he was never seen again. Sabrina later discovers she is meant to be with Harvey. He was played by David Lascher, formerly of the Nickelodeon series Hey Dude.
