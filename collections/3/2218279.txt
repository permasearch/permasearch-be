Natural bitumen deposits are reported in many countries, but in particular are found in extremely large quantities in Canada.[3][4] Other large reserves are located in Kazakhstan, Russia, and Venezuela. The estimated worldwide deposits of oil are more than 2 trillion barrels (320 billion cubic metres);[5] the estimates include deposits that have not been discovered. Proven reserves of bitumen contain approximately 100 billion barrels,[6] and total natural bitumen reserves are estimated at 249.67 Gbbl (39.694×10^9 m3) worldwide, of which 176.8 Gbbl (28.11×10^9 m3), or 70.8%, are in Alberta, Canada.[3]
