Not much is known about the life history of hawksbills.[33] Their life history can be divided into three phases, namely the pelagic phase, from hatching to about 20 cm, the benthic phase, when the immature turtles recruit to foraging areas, and the reproductive phase, when they reach sexual maturity.[34][35] The pelagic phase possibly lasts until the turtles reach around 20 cm in length in 1–3 years,[36] reaching sexual maturity at around 40 cm (2–4 years).[37] Hawksbills show a degree of fidelity after recruiting to the benthic phase,[38] however movement to other similar habitats is possible.[39]
