At present there is no securities regulation in relation to public issuance of securities in the British Virgin Islands.  Although Part II of the Securities and Investment Business Act, 2010 purports to regulate public issues of securities, this Part has not yet been brought into force (nor has Part V, dealing with market abuse).
