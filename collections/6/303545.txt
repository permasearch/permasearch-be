Stare decisis (Anglo-Latin pronunciation: /ˈsteɪriː dɪˈsaɪsɪs/) is a legal principle by which judges are obligated to respect the precedent established by prior decisions. The words originate from the phrasing of the principle in the Latin maxim Stare decisis et non quieta movere: "to stand by decisions and not disturb the undisturbed".[3] In a legal context, this is understood to mean that courts should generally abide by precedent and not disturb settled matters.[3] The principle of stare decisis can be divided into two components.
