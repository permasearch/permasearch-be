It was announced at the end of the sixteenth season that star Danny Pino (who portrayed Detective Nick Amaro) would be departing the cast; however, the producers did not kill off his character and left availability for him to return to the show. Leight said to The Hollywood Reporter on character departures, "I try to leave that door open. I would like to be able to bring him [Pino] back. At this point, it depends on where he is and what he's doing and what the story needs. That's one of the advantages of not killing a character that you like."[9] Warren Leight told TV Guide that season seventeen's theme would focus on change and transitions whereas last season (the sixteenth) focused on family; "it should be a year where wherever everyone starts at the beginning of the [season] is not where they end." Leight added that more character development would be in store for Raul Esparza's ADA Barba and Peter Scanavino's Det. Carisi, as well as Benson (Hargitay) being promoted to Lieutenant.[10]
