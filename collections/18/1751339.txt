Mountain lions had roamed on nearby Mount Nittany until the 1880s.[2] The origin of the name "Mount Nittany" is obscure, the most commonly accepted explanation being that it is derived of Native American words (loosely pronounced as "neet-a-nee") named after the cougars that roamed the mountain or "single mountain" - a protective barrier against the elements.[citation needed]. The "original" nittany lion can be seen in the Penn State All-Sports Museum as the only known mounted eastern mountain lion. It was killed in Susquehanna County by Samuel Brush in 1856.[3] According to a July 1992 article in National Geographic by Maurice Hornocker titled "Learning to Live with Mountain Lions", "Courthouse records from Centre County, Pennsylvania, show that one local hunter killed 64 lions between 1820 and 1845. During those 25 years an estimated 600 cats were killed in that county alone."
