The next level of ascendancy for a district judge who served sufficient number of years is the post of High court judge. High court Judges are usually appointed from a pool of advocates practicing at the Bar of the High court and District Judges who served for sufficient number of years. This has also caused District Judges to wane in their efficiency as they have come to realize that elevation of lawyers directly to High Court Judges dampens their process of being awarded with promotions for the work they've put in over many years of service.
