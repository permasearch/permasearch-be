Scientists typically are careful in recording their data, a requirement promoted by Ludwik Fleck (1896â€“1961) and others.[44] Though not typically required, they might be requested to supply this data to other scientists who wish to replicate their original results (or parts of their original results), extending to the sharing of any experimental samples that may be difficult to obtain.[45]
