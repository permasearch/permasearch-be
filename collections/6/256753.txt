The Android beta version of Fortnite was released on August 9, 2018 with a time-exclusivity for selected Samsung mobile devices until August 12, 2018, after which it will be available for other compatible Android devices.[47][48] Epic distributed the Android Fortnite Battle Royale app directly from its website rather than through the Google Play Store, citing that the want to have a direct connection to the players of the game, and they believe that the 30% fee Google takes from all microtransactions from apps through the Play Store was disproportionate to the types of services the store provides.[49] Security experts expressed concern over this decision, since this requires users to modify security settings in default Android distributions to allow third-party sites to install Android application packages (APK). This setting can make users, particularly younger players, prone to potential malware, including clones of Fortnite that install malicious programming.[50]
