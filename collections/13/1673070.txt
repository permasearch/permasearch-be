In 1969, Mao declared the Cultural Revolution to be over, although various historians in and outside of China mark the end of the Cultural Revolution – as a whole or in part – in 1976, following Mao's death and the arrest of the Gang of Four.[227] In the last years of his life, Mao was faced with declining health due to either Parkinson's disease[228] or, according to his physician, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,[229] as well as lung ailments due to smoking and heart trouble.[230] Some also attributed Mao's decline in health to the betrayal of Lin Biao. Mao remained passive as various factions within the Communist Party mobilised for the power struggle anticipated after his death.
