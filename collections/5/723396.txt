On November 3, 2016, Walt Disney World competitor Universal Orlando announced the TapuTapu system for their new water park, Volcano Bay.[30] The system allows Volcano Bay guests to tap their wristbands to a touchpoint, which will then place them in a virtual queue. Fifteen minutes before their wait time is up, the device will vibrate to let the wearer know that they should head back to the attraction.[31][32] However, guests have to return the TapuTapu at the end of the day,[33] unlike Magicbands that can be kept and reused by the guests.
