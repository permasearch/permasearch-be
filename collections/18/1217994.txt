At the forefront of the painting, Bierstadt paints a band of Shoshone Native peoples.[11] According to a review in Harper's Weekly from March 26, 1864, Lander's Peak, "is purely an American scene, and from the faithful and elaborate delineation of the Indian village, a form of life now rapidly disappearing from the earth, may be called a historic landscape."[12] Bierstadt illustrated Shoshone people along with the majestic peaks as a marker of the "sublime" which authors like James Fenimore Cooper, John C. Fr√©mont, and Washington Irving wrote about.[1] Interestingly, Bierstadt does not include who these people are in his painting title. Unlike Catlin, Bierstadt focused not on the individuality of members of the Shoshone people, rather, his focus was on their relationship with landscape. As Bierstadt scholar Matthew Biagell suggests, as "He placed them, as he placed European peasants in earlier works, in the middle distance so that we witness their presence in a landscape setting rather than focus on their movements."[13]
