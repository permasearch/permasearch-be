After the war, the coal industry boomed. Many counties in the Appalachian Plateau region, such as McDowell County in West Virginia, became dominated by coal mining. Coal mining towns were created, and many immigrants were attracted to the region for work. Although mining was good for the economy, deaths were high in the harsh work of the mines. Among the terrible coal incidents was the Monongah mining disaster of 1907.[5]
