Since 1988, participation in Australia Day has increased, and in 1994 all states and territories began to celebrate a unified public holiday on the actual day for the first time.[32] Research conducted in 2007 reported that 27.6% of Australians polled attended an organised Australia Day event and a further 25.6% celebrated with family and friends.[33] This reflected the results of an earlier research project where 66% of respondents anticipated that they would actively celebrate Australia Day 2005.[34]
