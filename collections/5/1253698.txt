The main disadvantage of the star schema is that data integrity is not enforced as well as it is in a highly de-normalized state. One-off inserts and updates can result in data anomalies which normalized schemas are designed to avoid. Generally speaking, star schemas are loaded in a highly controlled fashion via batch processing or near-real time "trickle feeds", to compensate for the lack of protection afforded by normalization.
