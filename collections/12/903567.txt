Montag runs through the city streets towards Faber's house. Faber urges him to make his way to the countryside and contact the exiled book-lovers who live there. He mentions he will be leaving on an early bus heading to St. Louis and that he and Montag can rendezvous there later. On Faber's television, they watch news reports of another mechanical hound being released, with news helicopters following it to create a public spectacle. After successfully wiping Montag's scent from around the house in hopes of deterring the hound, Montag leaves Faber's house. After an extended manhunt, he escapes by wading into a river and floating downstream.
