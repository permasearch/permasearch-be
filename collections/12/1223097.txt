Brunei is one of many nations to lay claim to some of the disputed Spratly Islands.[87] The status of Limbang as part of Sarawak has been disputed by Brunei since the area was first annexed in 1890.[87] The issue was reportedly settled in 2009, with Brunei agreeing to accept the border in exchange for Malaysia giving up claims to oil fields in Bruneian waters.[88] The Brunei government denies this and says that their claim on Limbang was never dropped.[89][90]
