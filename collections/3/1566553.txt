The English church found itself in need of conducting a new conversion process to Christianise this incoming population.[71] It is not well understood how the Christian institutions converted these Scandinavian settlers, in part due to a lack of textual descriptions of this conversion process equivalent to Bede's description of the earlier Anglo-Saxon conversion.[72] However, it appears that the Scandinavian migrants had converted to Christianity within the first few decades of their arrival.[68]
