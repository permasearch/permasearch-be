During the 1988 presidential election, Vice President George H.Â W. Bush noted that his opponent Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis had described himself as a "card-carrying member of the ACLU" and used that as evidence that Dukakis was "a strong, passionate liberal" and "out of the mainstream".[312] The phrase subsequently was used by the organization in an advertising campaign.[313]
