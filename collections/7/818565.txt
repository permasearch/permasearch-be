Cory's class is making a play about William Shakespeare's Hamlet, and Cory gets the lead role with Topanga and Minkus as his "co-stars". At home, Cory tries to practice for his annual golf game with Alan, Amy, and Eric. Eric then tells Cory that he throw the game off for the price of $5. While Cory's class is rehearsing for the play, Cory tries to convince Mr. Feeny to make changes to make it more exciting. Later, Topanga gives Cory his costume as Hamlet which includes a doublet and tights. Cory calls it a "miniskirt and pantyhose" and refuses to ware it. Cory then decides to quit the play and tells Shawn about his hidden motive and thinks that if he quits, Mr. Feeny will be forced to accept his suggestions. However, Minkus replaces Cory as Hamlet. At home, Cory finds out that Alan's job cut his salary by 5% which means they cannot afford to go the Jersey Shore golf tournament. In the school, Shawn got Minkus' former role and begs Cory to return because Minkus is a poor substitute. Cory tries to convince Mr. Feeny to let him have his part back, but he refuses and teaches Cory a lesson not to let people down who are counting on him. In the Matthews household, Cory finds out that they made their own golfing tournament in the backyard. In the play, Cory is spear carrier and his co-spear carrier starts a fight in the stage which leaves everyone but Cory left.
