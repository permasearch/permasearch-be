There was one vice-presidential debate between Congresswoman Ferraro and Vice President George H. W. Bush. Held on October 11, the result was proclaimed mostly even by the press and historians;[62][91] women voters tended to think Ferraro had won, while men, Bush.[83] At it, Ferraro criticized Reagan's initial refusal to support an extension to the Voting Rights Act.[92] Her experience was questioned at the debate and she was asked how her three terms in Congress stacked up with Bush's extensive government experience.[92] To one Bush statement she said, "Let me just say first of all, that I almost resent, Vice President Bush, your patronizing attitude that you have to teach me about foreign policy."[62] She strongly defended her position on abortion, which earned her applause and a respectful reply from her opponent.[92] In the days leading up to the debate, Second Lady of the United States Barbara Bush had publicly referred to Ferraro as "that four-million-dollarâ€”I can't say it, but it rhymes with 'rich'."[93] Barbara Bush soon apologized, saying she had not meant to infer Ferraro was "a witch".[93] Peter Teeley, Vice President Bush's press secretary, had dispensed with rhymes as he said of Ferraro just prior to the debate, "She's too bitchy. She's very arrogant. Humility isn't one of her strong points and I think that comes through."[94] Teeley declined to apologize for the remark, saying it had no sexist implications and the Ferraro campaign was being "hypersensitive" in complaining about it.[94]
