In the United States, the series was released as a four-disc set in both high-definition formats,[59] the Blu-ray version on single-layer BD-25 discs[60] and the HD DVD set on dual-layer HD DVD-30 discs.[61] The first U.S. high-definition releases omitted the extra disc of bonus features from the standard-definition boxed set, though these extras were included with new material in a special-edition Blu-ray released in 2011.[62]
