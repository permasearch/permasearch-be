Some people with a pathological interest in the power of life and death tend to be attracted to medical professions or acquiring such a job.[64][65][66][67] These kinds of killers are sometimes referred to as "angels of death"[68] or angels of mercy. Medical professionals will kill their patients for money, for a sense of sadistic pleasure, for a belief that they are "easing" the patient's pain, or simply "because they can".[69] perhaps the most prolific of these was the British doctor Harold Shipman. Another such killer was nurse Jane Toppan, who admitted during her murder trial that she was sexually aroused by death.[70] She would administer a drug mixture to patients she chose as her victims, lie in bed with them and hold them close to her body as they died.[70]
