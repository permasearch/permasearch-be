However, the Supreme Court ruled in NFIB v. Sebelius that this provision of the ACA was coercive, and that the federal government must allow states to continue at pre-ACA levels of funding and eligibility if they chose. Several states have opted to reject the expanded Medicaid coverage provided for by the act; over half of the nation's uninsured live in those states. They include Texas, Florida, Kansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi.[17] As of May 24, 2013 a number of states had not made final decisions, and lists of states which have opted out or were considering opting out varied,[18][19] but Alaska,[19] Idaho,[20] South Dakota,[20] Nebraska,[18] Wisconsin,[20] Maine,[20] North Carolina,[20] South Carolina,[20] and Oklahoma[20] seemed to have decided to reject expanded coverage.[20]
