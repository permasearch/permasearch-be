The popularity of The Pickwick Papers spawned many imitations and sequels in print as well as actual Clubs and Societies inspired by the club in the novel. One example is the still in operation Pickwick Bicycle Club in London, which was established in 1870, the same year as Charles Dickens' death.[18] Other clubs, groups, and societies operating under the name "The Pickwick Club" have existed since the original publication of the story.
