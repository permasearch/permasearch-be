In humans, body temperature is typically highest during the mid to late afternoon.[11] However, human athletes being tested for physical vigor on exercise machines showed no statistically significant difference after lunch.[11] Owners of factory farms are advised to use buildings with an east–west (as opposed to north–south) orientation to house their livestock, because an east–west orientation generally means thicker walls on the east and west to accommodate the sun's acute angle and intense glare during late afternoon. When these animals are too hot, they are more likely to become belligerent and unproductive.[7]
