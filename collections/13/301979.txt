Toxemia of pregnancy is common and kills many pregnant females. Signs of toxemia include anorexia, lack of energy, excessive salivation, a sweet or fruity breath odor due to ketones, and seizures in advanced cases.[83] Pregnancy toxemia appears to be most common in hot climates.[84] Other serious complications of pregnancy can include a prolapsed uterus, hypocalcaemia, and mastitis.[85]
