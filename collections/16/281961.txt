The Siberian tiger is often considered to be the largest tiger.[12][13] This appears to be true only for captive Siberian tigers.[14] A comparison of data on body weights of wild Siberian tigers indicates that up to the first half of the 20th century both males and females were on average heavier than post-1970 ones. Today's wild Siberian tigers are smaller than Bengal tigers. Their reduced weight as compared to historical Siberian tigers may be due to a combination of causes: when captured, they were usually sick or injured and involved in a conflict situation with people.[15]
