Over the course of the series, The Americans received 18 Emmy nominations. For its fourth, fifth, and sixth seasons, the series was nominated for Outstanding Drama Series; and Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys were each nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress and Actor in a Drama Series, respectively, for those seasons.[93] The prior omissions that the show had received at the Emmys were considered to be snubs by the Emmys in the drama and acting categories by critics.[94][95] Margo Martindale was nominated four times and won twice for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series, and Alison Wright received a nomination in the same category for the fifth season. The show received four nominations for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series, for "Do Mail Robots Dream of Electric Sheep?" written by Joshua Brand; and Joel Fields and Joe Weisberg were nominated for the award three consecutive years for the fourth, fifth, and sixth season finales. Nathan Barr also received a nomination for Outstanding Original Main Title Theme Music for the first season.[93]
