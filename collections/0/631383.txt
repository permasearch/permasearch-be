Paige Matthews (played by Rose McGowan) is the youngest half-sister who initially receives the power to move objects with her mind by orbing ("teleporting") them from one location to another through a vocal command.[15] Paige is ambitious, outspoken, and stands firmly in what she believes in. She is the secret love child of the Halliwell sisters' mother Patty (Finola Hughes) and her whitelighter Sam Wilder (Scott Jaeck), making Paige both a witch and whitelighter.[7] Paige was given up at birth and raised by her adoptive parents. She was unaware of her magical history until Prue's (Shannen Doherty) funeral at the beginning of season four, in which she goes on to help reconstitute The Charmed Ones by taking Prue's place in the Power of Three.[7] As the series progresses, Paige also inherits a variety of whitelighter powers such as orbing herself and others, sensing, glamouring, and healing.[15] One of the reoccurring struggles for Paige is finding an identity for herself outside of her role as a Charmed One. In the final season, she marries mortal parole officer Henry Mitchell (Ivan Sergei).
