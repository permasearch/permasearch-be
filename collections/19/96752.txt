"Product Recall" was penned by staff writer Justin Spitzer and consulting producer Brent Forrester.[3] It was the second Office episode to be directed by Randall Einhorn,[4] a former director of Survivor[5] who also worked as the series' director of photography.[6] In early 2007, series co-creator Greg Daniels explained to an audience at Paleyfest that Einhorn's direction had become "a character in the show because [he] has an enormous amount of judgment/leeway about where he's looking. And often [what] adds a tremendous amount of comedy is the choosing to look over there and see what that person thinks and back and forth. He's definitely a hidden character on the show."[7]
