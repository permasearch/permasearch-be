On two occasions, in 1974 and 2017, the State Opening has been conducted in a "dressed-down" manner, due to the snap general elections held in those years. This form of ceremony has been marked by several changes. Most noticeably, the Queen attended in a hat and morning dress, rather than the traditional crown, ball gown, and robe of state. The Imperial State Crown is carried in front of the Queen, in the same manner as the Sword of State and Cap of Maintenance. Also, no carriages or coaches are used, and the Queen arrives at Westminster by car. There is no military escort in the streets for this procession. Finally, certain personages, such as Heralds and Officers of Arms, are not in attendance at the ceremony. Other than these changes, the ceremony remains largely the same.
