The Florida tree snailis found on a variety of native hammock trees including Lysiloma and Ficus (Deisler-Seno 1994). This endemic subspecies can be found from Big Pine Key to the mainland with populations extending north and west into portions of Palm Beach and Collier counties, respectively. The Florida tree snail is listed as a species of special concern with the State primarily due to the loss of its habitat. Some conservation activities have focused on the efforts of a few naturalists to relocate different varieties of the Florida tree snail to Everglades NP. Additional conservation measures can be made to enhance and preserve native habitat to promote the continued existence of the species without the necessity of being relocated.
