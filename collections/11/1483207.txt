Since the Muslim conquest of the Indus Valley, the majority of Pakistani given names are derived from Persian, Arabic and Turkish names. Children may be given one, two or rarely three names at birth. If the person has more than one given name, one of them is chosen as the person’s most called name, by which he is called or referred to informally. Generally for males, Muhammad, the name of the prophet of Islam, is chosen to be the person’s first given name, if he has more than one. Because of the prevalence of this practice, this name is usually not the person’s most called name, as it does not serve as a unique identifier. Females are usually given at most two names.
