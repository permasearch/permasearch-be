The earliest examples of "frame stories" and "stories within stories" were in ancient Indian literature, such as the Mahabharata, Ramayana, Fables of Bidpai, Hitopadesha and Vikram and the Vampire. Both The Golden Ass by Apuleius and Metamorphoses by Ovid extend the depths of framing to several degrees. Another early example is the famous Arabian Nights, in which Scheherazade narrates stories within stories, and even within some of these, more stories are narrated. Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales and Boccacio's Decameron are also classic frame stories.
