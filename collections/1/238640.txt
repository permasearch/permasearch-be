As one of the BBC's and A&E's most popular presentations ever,[38][55] the serial was "a cultural phenomenon, inspiring hundreds of newspaper articles and making the novel a commuter favourite".[56] With the 1995 and 1996 films Persuasion, Sense and Sensibility and Emma, the serial was part of a wave of Jane Austen enthusiasm which caused the membership of the Jane Austen Society of North America to jump fifty percent in 1996 and to over 4,000 members in the autumn of 1997.[41] Some newspapers like The Wall Street Journal explained this "Austen-mania" as a commercial move of the television and film industry, whereas others attributed Austen's popularity to escapism.[57]
