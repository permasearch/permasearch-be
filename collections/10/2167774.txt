Depending on the region, the Fit is available with a 1.2-, 1.3- (in Europe referred as 1.4 L model), 1.5-litre i-DSI engine, or 1.5-litre VTEC engine. All four engines are based on Honda's L-series engine family. The eight-valve i-DSI (intelligent dual and sequential) engines use two spark plugs per cylinder, allowing petrol to burn more completely; therefore, fuel consumption and emissions are reduced while maximum torque at mid-range rpm is maintained. The 1.5 L VTEC engine has the typical 16-valve configuration that can maximise output at high rpm.
