Beginning in March 1995, the Astra sedan was assembled in Indonesia where it was marketed as the "Opel Optima".[8] The name had to be changed since PT Astra was Toyota's long operating local partner in Indonesia.[9] In India the Opel Astra was assembled for the local market in a joint venture with the Birla Companies, beginning in 1996.[10] Indian production ended in 2002.
