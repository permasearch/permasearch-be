The Ford Crown Victoria was released for sale in March 1991 as a 1992 model.[9] In an effort to optimize its availability for buyers, at the launch, fleet sales of the vehicle were postponed for 14 months.[9] To better distinguish the generation for buyers, the long-running LTD prefix was dropped. In line with the redesign of the 1991 Chevrolet Caprice (its chief competitor), the 1992 Crown Victoria featured a major exterior redesign on the previous-generation chassis. Focused on aerodynamics and fuel efficiency, Ford reduced the coefficient of drag of the exterior from 0.42 to 0.34 (nearly matching the 0.32 of the Ford Taurus).
