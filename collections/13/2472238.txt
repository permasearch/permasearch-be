Former Arizona Cardinals quarterback Jake Plummer replaced Griese as quarterback prior to the 2003 season. He would lead the team to a 49–26 record and a 1–3 playoff record from 2003 to 2006.[58]  Prior to the 2005 season, the Broncos were plagued by early season success followed by late season flops. In both 2003 and 2004 they started the season 5–1 and ended 10–6.[59][60]
