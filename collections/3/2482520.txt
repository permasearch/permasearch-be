Estimates between 2000 and 2003 found 7,300 Sumatran orangutans[79] and between 45,000 and 69,000 Bornean orangutans[80] remain in the wild. A 2007 study by the Government of Indonesia noted a total wild population of 61,234 orangutans, 54,567 of which were found on the island of Borneo in 2004. The table below shows a breakdown of the species and subspecies and their estimated populations from this, or (in the case of P. tapanuliensis) a more recent, report:[84][4] The diet of the species is also unique.
