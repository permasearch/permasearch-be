Claiming he has found the way to Earth, Dr. Smith tampers with the navigation controls and inadvertently dumps all the Jupiter 2's reserve fuel supply. Hope is shattered when the Professor locates an Earth fuel barge but the tanks are found nearly empty. Meanwhile, Smith begins to see a beautiful, green-skinned woman floating outside the viewports who sings his name, but no one believes his wild story until the girl lures him outside the ship. With the little fuel they have squeezed from the barge, the family is forced to make the decision to save Dr. Smith and miss their chance of returning to Earth.
