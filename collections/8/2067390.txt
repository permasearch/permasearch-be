After initial successes where Chicanos were elected in the South Texas counties of Dimmit, La Salle, and Zavala, La Raza Unida Party decided to be more ambitious for the 1972 gubernatorial elections.[3] The campaign run by La Raza Unida for the 1972 was extremely controversial because it was entirely racially based.  The leaders of the party believed that change could only occur by appealing to the cultural and familial values shared by Mexican Americans.[6]  They also asserted that racism against Mexican Americans was so prolific that the entire political system would have to be reevaluated.[6] Mario Compean, past spokesperson for La Raza Unida, said "Ours was a message of liberation from […] a corrupt political system anchored on the twin pillars of racism and discrimination, on the one hand, and social subordination imposed by capitalism on the other".[6] The candidate endorsed by La Raza Unida was an ex-Baylor football-player-turned-lawyer named Ramsey Muñiz. He was, at the time, a political unknown, who had been involved with MAYO since 1968 but not distinguished himself.
