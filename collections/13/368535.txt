Rocket League was critically praised, earning positive reception for its improvements upon Battle-Cars, its graphics and multiplayer gameplay, though some critics were skeptical of the game's physics engine. The game earned a number of industry awards, and saw over six million sales and 40 million players by the beginning of 2018. Rocket League has also been adopted as an eSport, with professional players participating through ESL and Major League Gaming, along with Psyonix hosting their own competitions through the Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS).
