The Nomination Ceremony from the broadcast edition was replaced with the new Safety Ceremony. This ceremony took place over two days with two separate ceremonies. During the ceremony, the HoH was sequestered in the HoH room while the other HouseGuests were downstairs with their "Block Pass". When instructed by Big Brother, the HoH activated the "Block Pass" of a HouseGuest of their choosing. This made the pass illuminate green and indicate that the HouseGuest is safe from nominations.
