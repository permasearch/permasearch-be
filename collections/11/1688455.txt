World War I (1914-1918) became the ultimate cause of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, which formally ended in 1922. However, during wartime operations the Empire prevented the British Royal Navy from reaching Constantinople, stopping an Entente invasion in the Battle of Gallipoli (1915-1916). Nevertheless, under the provisions of the Treaty of Lausanne (1923) the Empire ultimately fell.[citation needed]
