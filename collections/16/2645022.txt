Early father of international law, Spanish philosopher Francisco de Vitoria (c. 1483â€“1546) is considered the "founder of global political philosophy". De Vitoria conceived of the res publica totius orbis, or the "republic of the whole world". This came at a time when the University of Salamanca was engaged in unprecedented thought concerning human rights, international law, and early economics based on the experiences of the Spanish Empire.
