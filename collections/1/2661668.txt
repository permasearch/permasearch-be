In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, breach of the peace is descended from the Justices of the Peace Act 1361,[5] which refers to riotous and barratous behaviour that disturbs the peace of the King. More modern authority defines a breach of the peace as existing whether harm is actually done, or is likely to be done, to a person or his property, or a person is in fear of being harmed through an assault, an affray, a riot, an unlawful assembly, or some other form of disturbance.[6]
