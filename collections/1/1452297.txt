As the case moved forward, the plaintiffs amended their complaint to ask the court to declare Ohio's recognition ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional. Judge Black gave the state time to prepare its appeal of his decision by announcing on April 4 that he would issue an order on April 14 requiring Ohio to recognize same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions.[40][41] Following the resignation of the lead defendant, Ohio's director of health, Ted Wymyslo, for reasons unrelated to the case, Lance Himes became interim director, and the case was restyled Henry v. Himes.[33][42] On April 14, Black ruled that Ohio must recognize same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions,[43][44] and, on April 16, stayed enforcement of his ruling, except for the birth certificates sought by the plaintiffs.[45][46]
