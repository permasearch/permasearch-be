Alex observes that Haley's actions show that she has a crush on Andy, but Haley refuses to admit it. However, when they arrive at the venue that is close to the cafe where Andy is waiting for his flight, Haley goes to find him and to talk to him about his girlfriend. She tells him that he is able to get a better girlfriend than Beth, who does not deserve him, using examples of her own previous treatment of boys to show him how Beth is not treating him well. Haley quickly leaves as she gets a call from her mother, but she later receives a call from Andy who asks if she was referring to someone in particular earlier. Haley refuses to admit that by "someone better" she meant herself, so Andy, who took a cab and came to the wedding to find her, does not say he is there, and he leaves.
