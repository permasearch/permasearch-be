During fiscal year 2016, the Federal government received approximately $3.3 trillion in tax and fee revenue and had outlays (spending) of $3.9 trillion; the difference was a $587 billion deficit. Measured as a percentage of gross domestic product (a measure of the size of the economy), revenues were 17.8% GDP, above the historical average (1980â€“2015) of 17.4% GDP. Outlays of 20.9% GDP were slightly above the average of 20.6% GDP. The deficit of 3.2% GDP was equal to the historical average. After a significant increase primarily due to the Great Recession, the annual deficit returned to its historical average in fiscal year 2014 and is projected to remain around that level until 2019 before slowly rising.[1]
