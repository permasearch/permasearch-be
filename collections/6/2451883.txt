Sextina Aquafina (voiced by Aisha Tyler in season 1-2, Daniele Gaither in season 3) is a bottlenose dolphin pop-music sensation. In "Out to Sea", Diane meets with Sextina to discuss becoming her social-media ghostwriter. In the season three episode "Brrap Brrap Pew Pew", Diane accidentally tweeted out that Sextina was having an abortion while she was being distracted, which caused a media storm. While Sextina was initially angered with the tweet and tried to fire Diane, she later embraced the image because of support from other celebrities. She later released a music video militantly supporting abortion, had her "abortion" on live TV, and soon after became pregnant. It is implied that she is sent to a farm where celebrities go to disappear.
