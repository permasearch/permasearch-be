The episode opens in medias res as former Sheriff Deputy Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) scavenges for gas and supplies at an abandoned convenience store in rural Georgia on a deserted highway. He spots a little girl (Addy Miller), but she turns out to be a zombie. When she charges towards him, Rick shoots her in the head.
