Upstate and downstate are often used informally to distinguish New York City or its greater metropolitan area from the rest of New York State. The placement of a boundary between the two is a matter of great contention.[74] Unofficial and loosely defined regions of Upstate New York include the Southern Tier, which often includes the counties along the border with Pennsylvania,[75] and the North Country, which can mean anything from the strip along the Canadaâ€“US border to everything north of the Mohawk River.[76]
