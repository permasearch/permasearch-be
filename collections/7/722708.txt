Obesity is one of the leading preventable causes of death worldwide.[32][33][34] A number of reviews have found that mortality risk is lowest at a BMI of 20–25 kg/m2[35][36][37] in non-smokers and at 24–27 kg/m2 in current smokers, with risk increasing along with changes in either direction.[38][39] This appears to apply in at least four continents.[37] In contrast, a 2013 review found that grade 1 obesity (BMI 30–35) was not associated with higher mortality than normal weight, and that overweight (BMI 25–30) was associated with "lower" mortality than was normal weight (BMI 18.5–25).[40] Other evidence suggests that the association of BMI and waist circumference with mortality is U- or J-shaped, while the association between waist-to-hip ratio and waist-to-height ratio with mortality is more positive.[41] In Asians the risk of negative health effects begins to increase between 22–25 kg/m2.[42] A BMI above 32 kg/m2 has been associated with a doubled mortality rate among women over a 16-year period.[43] In the United States, obesity is estimated to cause 111,909 to 365,000 deaths per year,[2][34] while 1 million (7.7%) of deaths in Europe are attributed to excess weight.[44][45]  On average, obesity reduces life expectancy by six to seven years,[2][46] a BMI of 30–35 kg/m2 reduces life expectancy by two to four years,[36] while severe obesity (BMI > 40 kg/m2) reduces life expectancy by ten years.[36]
