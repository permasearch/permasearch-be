He is called the Black Prince since his hair was cut but Yuu still calls him Black Demon. Even though he shows a bad expression, it is stated by Takumi that he is really kind. In the movie, after he ended his contract with Yu, he didn't  show much expression but it is obvious that he doesn't want it to end. He stated that the only person he could never beat is Takumi. In the manga, it is still not clear what he felt about Yuu.
