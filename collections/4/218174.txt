Football is a popular sport in Gibraltar. The Gibraltar Football Association applied for full membership of UEFA, but their bid was turned down in 2007 in a contentious decision.[98] Gibraltar was confirmed as UEFA's 54th member on 24 May 2013 as a result of Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) arbitration and played in Euro 2016 qualifications.[99][100] Their first match was a 0â€“0 draw against Slovakia. Subsequently, Gibraltar applied for FIFA membership but this bid was also turned down.
