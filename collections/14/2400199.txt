Stockdale came to know businessman and presidential candidate Ross Perot through his wife's work in establishing an organization to represent the families of Vietnam POWs. On March 30, 1992, Perot announced that he had asked Stockdale to be his provisional Vice Presidential nominee on Ross Perot's 1992 independent ticket.[25] Perot intended to replace Stockdale with another candidate, but did not do so before he dropped out of the race in July 1992.[26]
