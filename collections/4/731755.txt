In 2005, a group of local motorcycle riders gathered to organize and hold a rally focused on the areaâ€™s history and special environment. The "Rough Rider" name was chosen because Rough Riders had a long tradition in Las Vegas. Now in its 13th year, the rally attracts motorcyclists from throughout the southwest for three days of charitable activities and motorcycle related events.
