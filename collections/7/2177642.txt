In 1952, when the release of the FCC's Sixth Report and Order announced the end of its freeze on new station license applications, among the issues the Commission was slated to address was whether to approve the UPT-ABC merger.[24] One FCC Commissioner saw the possibility of ABC, funded by UPT, becoming a viable and competitive third television network.[39] On February 9, 1953, the FCC approved UPT's purchase of ABC in exchange for $25 million in shares.[39][40] The merged company, renamed American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, Inc. and headquartered in the Paramount Building at 1501 Broadway in Manhattan,[41] owned six AM and several FM radio stations, five television stations and 644 cinemas in 300 U.S. cities.[36] To comply with FCC ownership restrictions in effect at the time that barred common ownership of two television stations in the same market, UPT sold its Chicago television station, WBKB-TV, to CBS (which subsequently changed the station's call letters to WBBM-TV) for $6 million,[42] while it kept ABC's existing Chicago station, WENR-TV. The merged company acquired the WBKB call letters for channel 7, which would eventually become WLS-TV.[43] Goldenson began to sell some of the older theaters to help finance the new television network.[36]
