Can we get some more elaboration on this statement. I get that it is cited, but we should briefly summarize. From the sounds of it, the authors are explaining the MOA of ondansetron better than they are the dexamethasone. Sigh, I guess I will do it. "Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy are given dexamethasone to counteract certain side effects of their antitumor treatments. Dexamethasone can augment the antiemetic effect of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, such as ondansetron." Aglo123 (talk) 21:52, 12 September 2016 (UTC)
