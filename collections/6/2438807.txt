No radio or television stations broadcast the assassination live because the area through which the motorcade was traveling was not considered important enough for a live broadcast.[citation needed] Most media crews were not even with the motorcade but were waiting instead at the Dallas Trade Mart in anticipation of President Kennedy's arrival. Those members of the media who were with the motorcade were riding at the rear of the procession.
