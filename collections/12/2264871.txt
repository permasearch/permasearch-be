Shortly after the change of ownership, land was leased to allow construction of restaurants in the part of the parking lot nearest Bardstown Road. The Skyline Chili remains but the other location began as Gatti's Pizza in 1979, became a Dairy Queen in 1997[12], and Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers in 2015.[13] In 1988, a study of traffic along Bardstown Road found that the road in front of Mid-City Mall had by far the most vehicle accidents of any mid-block area from downtown to Bardstown Road's junction with I-264, mostly due to drivers turning left from the mall. It suggested the number of entrances to the mall be reduced and one large one created, where a traffic light would be installed, and this recommendation was carried out 1989. [14]
