The head end bears eight arms and two tentacles, each a form of muscular hydrostat containing many suckers along the edge. These tentacles do not grow back if severed. In the mature male, one basal half of the left ventral tentacle is hectocotylisedâ€”and ends in a copulatory pad rather than suckers. It is used for sexual intercourse.
