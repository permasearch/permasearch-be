Passenger railroad service to Daytona Beach was established no later than 1889 by the Jacksonville, St. Augustine and Halifax River Railway, predecessor of the Florida East Coast Railroad (FEC).  Long distance trains such as the City of Miami (from Chicago), East Coast Champion (from New York City) and the Havana Special (New York City) made stops at Daytona Beach. Passenger trains continued calling at Daytona Beach till 1968, when the FEC terminated passenger operations system-wide. The FEC currently operates freight trains through Daytona Beach.
