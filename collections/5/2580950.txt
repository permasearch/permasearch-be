The area around Port Phillip and the Yarra valley, on which the city of Melbourne now stands, was the home of the Kulin people, an alliance of several language groups of Indigenous Australians, whose ancestors had lived in the area for an estimated 31,000 to 40,000 years.[1] At the time of European settlement the population of indigenous inhabitants was estimated to be under 20,000,[2] who were hunter-gatherers from three tribes: the Wurundjeri, Boonwurrung and Wathaurong.[3]
