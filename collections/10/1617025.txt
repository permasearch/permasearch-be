Yuuto Kiba (木場 祐斗, Kiba Yūto) is a blond-haired second-year student and the school's top prince.[LN 22] He serves as the knight on Rias's team.[S1 ep 3] His Sacred Gear, Sword Birth[j], lets him generate swords with various properties for their blades, such as Holy Eraser (a blade that devours light) or Flame Delete (an ice blade that negates fire attacks). He can also generate a large number of blades from the ground to pierce enemies or give him more options in combat.[S1 ep 11] Ishibumi created Yuto to add appeal to the female readers of his series, [LN 4 afterword] and has him develop as the ace of the team as well as a strong backing character for Issei.[LN 5 afterword]
