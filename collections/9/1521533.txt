Richard Rogers Partnership designed Three World Trade Center, or 175 Greenwich Street, which stands across Greenwich Street from the Memorial's two reflecting pools.[68][69] Groundbreaking occurred in fall 2008, and in May 2009, the Port Authority proposed reducing the tower to four stories.[70] In 2012, with Silverstein still unable to find tenants, construction on the above-ground levels was delayed indefinitely, with plans for only 7 stories.[71] However, work progressed on below-grade foundations and the ground-level podium, which was completed by October 2013.[68][69] Anchor tenant Group M was finally signed in late 2013,[72] but finance negotiations between Silverstein Properties and the Port Authority dragged, until an agreement was reached in June 2014. Construction resumed in August 2014,[73] and the building opened on June 11, 2018.[74]
