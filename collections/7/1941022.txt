Brohm returned for his senior season. After taking every snap as a junior, Brohm proved he was fully recovered from his ankle injury.[14] After defeating San Jose State to begin the season, Brohm had a dominant performance against Memphis State, throwing for four touchdowns and 219 yards—175 yards and three touchdowns of which went to Aaron Bailey.[15] The following week, Brohm threw for a career-high 331 yards defeating the #23 Arizona State 35–17.[16] Brohm led the Cardinals to the #17 ranking. During the game against #24 West Virginia, Brohm threw for 270 yards. However, he had two very critical turnovers, including an interception with 3:02 to play. The Cardinals were upset by the Mountaineers 36–34.[17] After a 7–1 start, the Cardinals accepted a bid to be the home team in the 1993 Liberty Bowl[18] Brohm broke the index finger of his passing hand in Louisville's final regular season game.[19] His finger was repaired with a steel plate and pins, and he wasn't allowed to throw until the week before the bowl game.[19] Trailing 7–3 going into the 4th quarter against the Michigan State in the Liberty Bowl, Brohm threw for two touchdowns in the final minute leading the Cardinals to a 18–7 victory.[19][20]
