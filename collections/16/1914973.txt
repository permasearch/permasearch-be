The default route in Internet Protocol Version 4  (IPv4) is designated as the zero-address 0.0.0.0/0 in CIDR notation,[1] often called the quad-zero route.[citation needed] The subnet mask is given as /0, which effectively specifies all networks, and is the shortest match possible. A route lookup that does not match any other route, falls back to this route. Similarly, in IPv6, the default route is specified by ::/0.
