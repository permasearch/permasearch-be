In 1966, IBM released the Selectric Composer.[6] This highly modified (and much more expensive) Selectric produced camera-ready justified copy using proportional fonts in a variety of font styles from 8 points to 14 points.[7] Material prepared on a properly adjusted machine by a skillful operator and printed onto baryta (barium sulfate-coated) paper "would take an expert to tell... [that it] was not the product of a Linotype or Monotype machine".[8]
