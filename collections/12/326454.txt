Gutt battles Manny with his two swords, stating that "the sea isn't big enough" for the two of them. Manny charges into Gutt, knocking him down, but Gutt is able to push the mammoth off of him. Manny charges again, but Gutt swings on a number of vines to catch up to the floe; Manny follows. Gutt pushes Manny onto the front of the floe and grabs a log to finish him off, but Manny jumps onto the back of the floe, which launches Gutt off the floe. Manny catches the log and hits Gutt, sending the evil ape flying out of fight.
