The Earth's electrical current varies according to a daily pattern called the 'Carnegie Curve', believed to be caused by the regular daily variations in atmospheric electrification associated with the earth's weather regions.[6] The pattern also shows seasonal variation, linked to the earth's solstices and equinoxes. It was named after the Carnegie Institution for Science.
