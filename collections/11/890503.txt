Jitsu appeared only once as a supporting character in "The Dragon Invasion" episode in 1983. The character's name in the script is Chopper, although he is not named on-screen. His role in this episode is to accompany Skeletor in an invasion of Castle Grayskull. He has only one line and aside from a brief display of his karate-chopping abilities (his right hand, which has the ability to smash through things, is gold rather than flesh) [one of those variations from cartoon and figure appearances], has no character development. He is not used in the series again, even when the toy figure was released in 1984, since the creators of the cartoon feared he would be seen as a racist stereotype to Asians.[citation needed]
