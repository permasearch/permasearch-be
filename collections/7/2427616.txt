Some flower-feeding thrips pollinate the flowers they are feeding on, and some authors suspect that they may have been among the first insects to evolve a pollinating relationship with their host plants.[27] Scirtothrips dorsalis carries pollen of commercially important chili peppers.[28][29][30] Darwin found that thrips could not be kept out by any netting when he conducted experiments by keeping away larger pollinators.[31] Thrips setipennis is the sole pollinator of Wilkiea huegeliana, a small, unisexual annually flowering tree or shrub in the rainforests of eastern Australia. T. setipennis serves as an obligate pollinator for other Australian rainforest plant species, including Myrsine howittiana and M. variabilis.[32] The genus Cycadothrips is a specialist pollinator of cycads, the flowers of which are adapted for pollination by small insects.[33] Thrips are likewise the primary pollinators of heathers in the family Ericaceae,[34] and play a significant role in the pollination of pointleaf manzanita. Electron microscopy has shown thrips carrying pollen grains adhering to their backs, and their fringed wings are perfectly capable of allowing them to fly from plant to plant.[33]
