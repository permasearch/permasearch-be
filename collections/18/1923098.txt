This Communion of Churches comprises the Latin Church (or the Roman or Western Church) as well as 23 Eastern Catholic Churches, canonically called sui juris churches, each led by either a Patriarch or a Major Archbishop in full communion with the Holy See.  Historically, these bodies separated from Eastern Christian communions, either to remain in or to return to full communion of the Catholic Church. Vatican II decree on Eastern Catholic Churches, however, explicitly recognizes Eastern Catholic communities as "true churches" and not just rites within the Catholic Church.[5] The term sui juris literally means "by its own law" â€” these bodies retain own canonical and liturgical traditions. Particular law typically provides for the synods of the larger sui juris churches to elect their own bishops, including their patriarch or major archbishop, subject only to papal "assent" (formal recognition), which is very rarely withheld.  The pope appoints bishops for those smaller sui juris churches which have too few bishops to form a synod.
