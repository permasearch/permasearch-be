Kosta Barbarouses's goal in the 9th minute of the game came about via a header from James Donachie, however Donachie was offside when Leroy George took the free kick which Donachie passed to Barbarouses. The game's video assistant referee (VAR) system failed to detect Donachie's offside position as its video feed had failed in the thirty seconds leading up to the goal, although the issue was apparent from the Fox Sports broadcast footage. By the time the system was restored, the game had resumed, meaning the decision to allow the goal stood. Football Federation Australia acknowledged the technical issues, and the frustration of Newcastle's team and fans.[6]
