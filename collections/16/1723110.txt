George K. Anderson dated The Battle of Maldon to the 10th century and felt that it was unlikely that much was missing.[11] R.K. Gordon is not so specific, writing that this "last great poem before the Norman Conquest ... was apparently written very soon after the battle",[12] while Michael J. Alexander speculates that the poet may even have fought at Maldon.[2]
