While Adams tried to reassert control of the meeting, people poured out of the Old South Meeting House and headed to Boston Harbor. That evening, a group of 30 to 130 men boarded the three vessels, some of them thinly disguised as Mohawk Indians, and dumped all 342 chests of tea into the water over the course of three hours.[144] Adams never revealed whether he went to the wharf to witness the destruction of the tea.[145] Whether or not he helped plan the event is unknown, but Adams immediately worked to publicize and defend it.[146] He argued that the Tea Party was not the act of a lawless mob, but was instead a principled protest and the only remaining option that the people had to defend their constitutional rights.[147]
