Netball is played on either a hard or soft court with scoring hoops or "rings" at both ends. The court is slightly larger than a basketball court, being 30.5 metres (100 ft) long and 15.25 metres (50.0 ft) wide.[5][6] The longer sides are called "side lines" and the shorter sides are called "goal lines" or "back lines".[5] The two lines dividing the court into thirds are called "transverse lines".[5][6] Court markings are no more than 50 millimetres (2.0 in) wide.[5][7] The court is divided into thirds which regulate where individuals of each position are allowed to move.[5] A 0.9-metre (3 ft)-diameter "centre circle" is located in the centre of the court.[5][6] At each end of the court there is a 4.9-metre (16 ft)-radius semi-circular "shooting circle" or "goal circle" from within which all scoring shots must be taken.[5] The goal posts are 3.05 metres (10.0 ft) high from the top of the ring to the ground and have no backboards.[5][7] The rings have an internal diameter of 380 millimetres (15 in), and are located 150 millimetres (5.9 in) forward from the post and are made of 15-millimetre (0.59 in) diameter steel.[5]
