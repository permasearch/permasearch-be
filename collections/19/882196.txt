Most City fans are agreed that Manchester United is their main rivalry, a bitter rivalry which has reignited in last few years due to the resurgence of Manchester City as one of the top teams in England following their brief absence from the top flight at the end of the 20th century and City's re-emergence as a major club following their 2008 takeover.[45][46] Both Manchester teams are regarded as among the best teams in the world with both clubs consistently progressing to the latter stages of the UEFA Champions League in recent years and both are in the top 5 of football clubs by revenue with the city now viewed as a football city in similar vein to cities such as Madrid and Milan,[47][48] although City's disappearance from the upper echelons of the league following their 1960s-70s heyday until their recent rise has led to the two teams being regarded as polar opposites, with City seen as the nouveau riche to United's old money.[49][50] The two sets of fans are traditionally diametrically opposed to each other, with City's fans accusing United of arrogance and of attempting to turn the Premier League into a closed shop for elite clubs only via manipulation of the rules[51][52] and of the media[53] while they in turn are accused of using their club's money as a route to success.[54] Additionally, and in a unique twist on a cross-city rivalry, both clubs' fans accuse each other of not representing their city, with the blue half of the city observing that their adversaries do not actually play in the city of Manchester (in Trafford) and therefore do not warrant their name, while the red half instead argue over which team has more fans inside of the city.
