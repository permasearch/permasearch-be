In 2008, Transparency International criticized the lack of transparency of the system of Finnish political finance.[80] According to GRECO in 2007, corruption should be taken into account in the Finnish system of election funds better.[81] A scandal revolving around campaign finance of the 2007 parliamentary elections broke out in spring 2008. Nine Ministers of Government submitted incomplete funding reports and even more of the members of parliament. The law includes no punishment of false funds reports of the elected politicians.
