where each         (   n k   )       {\displaystyle {\tbinom {n}{k}}}   is a specific positive integer known as a binomial coefficient. (When an exponent is zero, the corresponding power expression is taken to be 1 and this multiplicative factor is often omitted from the term. Hence one often sees the right side written as        (   n 0   )     x  n   + â€¦   {\displaystyle {\binom {n}{0}}x^{n}+\ldots }  .) This formula is also referred to as the binomial formula or the binomial identity. Using summation notation, it can be written as
