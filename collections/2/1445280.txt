During the Black Moon Clan arc, Chibiusa was lost in a space-time storm and then found by Wiseman who then preyed on her frustration and despondencies to turn her into his agent Black Lady (ブラック・レディ, Burakku Redi). Infused with the energies of the Malefic Black Crystal, causing the Black Moon insignia to on her head, Black Lady resembles Chibiusa as an adult in an organdy and satin dress, Black Crystal earrings, and hair longer than Usagi's.[3]
