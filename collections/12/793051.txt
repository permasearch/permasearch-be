The day after she graduated from high school in 1964, she moved to Nashville.[14] Her initial success came as a songwriter, having signed with Combine Publishing shortly after her arrival;[16] with her frequent songwriting partner, her uncle Bill Owens, she wrote several charting singles during this time, including two-top ten hits: Bill Phillips's 1966 record "Put It Off Until Tomorrow" and Skeeter Davis' 1967 hit "Fuel to the Flame". Her songs were recorded by many other artists during this period, including Kitty Wells and Hank Williams Jr.[17] She signed with Monument Records in 1965, at 19, where she was initially pitched as a bubblegum pop singer. She released a string of singles, but the only one that charted, "Happy, Happy Birthday Baby", did not crack the Billboard Hot 100. Although she expressed a desire to record country material, Monument resisted, thinking her unique voice with its strong vibrato was not suited to the genre.
