According to expert opinion, those who are already on anticoagulants, international normalized ratio (INR) should be kept at 1.5. For aspirin users who required endoscopic treatment for bleeding peptic ulcer, there is two times increased risk of rebleeding but with 10 times reduced risk of death at 8 weeks post resumption of aspirin. For those who was on double antiplatelet agents for indwelling stent in blood vessels, both antiplatelet agents should not be stopped because there is high risk of stent thrombosis. For those which was under warfarin treatment, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), vitamin K, prothrombin complex concentrates, or recombinant factor VIIa can be given to reverse the effect of warfarin. High dose of vitamin K should be avoided to reduce the time for rewarfarinisation once the stomach bleeding has stopped. Prothrombin complex concentrates is preferred for severe bleeding. Recombinant factor VIIa is reserved for life-threatening bleeding because of its high risk of thromboembolism.[14] Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) is recommended instead of warfarin as they are more effective in preventing thromboembolism. In case of bleeding caused by DOAC, activated charcoal within 4 hours is the antidote of choice. Hamodialysis maybe given for bleeding caused by dabigatran. Anticoagulants should be resumed as soon as possible for those with high cardiovascular risk because although risk of rebleeding increases, the overall mortality decreases with resumption of anticoagulants.[14]
