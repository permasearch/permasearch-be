The Golden State Warriors had the best record in the Western Conference, therefore making Steve Kerr the Western Conference head coach.[29] Brad Stevens, coach of the Boston Celtics, was the head coach for the Eastern Conference team. While the Cleveland Cavaliers had the best record in the Eastern Conference at the time, the Cavaliers coach, Tyronn Lue, was ineligible to coach in the All-Star Game in 2017, due to the fact he was the coach in 2016. This means that the coach of the team with the second best record in the East gets the honor, which this year belongs to the Celtics.[30]
