The main antagonist of the series is "Purple Guy", who is presumably a former Fazbear Entertainment employee who murdered at least five children, whose spirits now inhabit the animatronics. In mini-games from the second game, he murders a child, whose spirit is largely believed to inhabit the Puppet. In the third game, it is revealed that he returned to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza after it closed down to dismantle the animatronics. This released the spirits of the children he murdered, scaring him into hiding inside a spring lock suit, where he was crushed to death by the suit's springlock mechanisms. It is believed that his body resides in Five Nights at Freddy's 3's main antagonist, Springtrap.[40] In the novel adaptation of the series, Purple Guy receives a possible identity, with the name William Afton.[41] It was also revealed that he was the co-owner of Fazbear Entertainment. Scott Cawthon has stated that although "the book is canon, just as the games are[, t]hat doesn't mean that they are intended to fit together like two puzzle pieces".[42] Most of the gaming community accepts it as Purple Guy's true name and work. A certain "Mr. Afton", mentioned in Sister Location's prologue, is thought to be Purple Guy, creating the possibility of him being the creator of the animatronics seen in game. A character named Michael was introduced in Sister Location, whose is assumed to be the son of Purple Guy. The character was introduced in a cutscene, in which he seems to be speaking to his father.[43]
