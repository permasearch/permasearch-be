New safety features included in the refresh include a LaneWatch camera housed in the passenger side-view mirror which may be paired to the driver's side Blind Spot Display system. Forward Collision Warning (FCW) and Lane Departure Warning (LDW) are also available while a single-angle backup camera with dynamic guidelines became standard equipment.
