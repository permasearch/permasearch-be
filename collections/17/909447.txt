This produces a system of linear equations which can be solved for     t   {\displaystyle t}  ,     u   {\displaystyle u}   and     v   {\displaystyle v}  . If the solution satisfies the condition     t ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] ,   {\displaystyle t\in [0,1],}  , then the intersection point is on the line segment between       l   a     {\displaystyle \mathbf {l} _{a}}   and       l   b     {\displaystyle \mathbf {l} _{b}}  , otherwise it is elsewhere on the line. Likewise, if the solution satisfies     u , v ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] ,   {\displaystyle u,v\in [0,1],}  , then the intersection point is in the parallelogram formed by the point       p   0     {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} _{0}}   and vectors       p   01     {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} _{01}}   and       p   02     {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} _{02}}  . If the solution additionally satisfies     ( u + v ) ≤ 1   {\displaystyle (u+v)\leq 1}  , then the intersection point lies in the triangle formed by the three points       p   0     {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} _{0}}  ,       p   1     {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} _{1}}   and       p   2     {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} _{2}}  .
