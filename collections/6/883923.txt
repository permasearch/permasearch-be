At the loading area, guests board the troop transport. Through the radio, Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) reminds the tourists to fasten their seat belts, and points out a problem with the transport. The transport takes off, past a cluster of mirrors concealing the maintenance dock entrance, and turns a corner into the Chamber of Destiny, where guests are presented with three doors. One of the three doors begins to glow more brightly than the other two, and Mara announces which gift the passengers have chosen to receive. The doors open, and the passengers enter the Hall of Promise.
