When Melissa, Ian, and Spencer are chatting with Mrs. Ackard at the Rosewood Founder's Festival during "Monsters in the End", the Hilton Resort is brought up by Ackard, and based on Melissa's response, it seems that her and Ian stayed in separate rooms while being there. Spencer finds the situation incredibly suspicious, since she brought up the fact that Ian lingered the Hilton after being annoyed towards the attention paid to her as a person of interest.
