The 2010 general election ended in a hung parliament,[20] in which Labour won 258 seats, 91 fewer than in 2005.[21] Following failure to achieve a coalition agreement with the Liberal Democrats, Brown announced his intention to resign as leader of the party on 10 May[22] and resigned as the Prime Minister the following day.[23] Shortly thereafter, David Cameron and Nick Clegg announced the formation of a coalition between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.[24] Cameron became the Prime Minister and Clegg the Deputy Prime Minister of a cabinet that contained eighteen Conservative ministers and five Liberal Democrat ministers.[25] In announcing his intention to run for the leadership, David Miliband declared that the New Labour era was over.[26] Following the publication of Tony' Blair's memoirs on 1 September 2010, Ed Miliband said: "I think it is time to move on from Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and Peter Mandelson and to move on from the New Labour establishment and that is the candidate that I am at this election who can best turn the page. I think frankly most members of the public will want us to turn the page".[27] The leadership election was won by Ed Miliband, who was able to mobilise support from the trade union electorate.[28] In a July 2011 speech, Blair stated that New Labour died when he left office and Brown assumed the party leadership, claiming that from 2007 the party "lost the driving rhythm".[29]
