India is the world's main incense producing country,[1] and is a healthy exporter to other countries (though export sales have been troubled by increasing costs of the raw materials, and by other factors, such as Western countries buying unperfumed sticks, and by Indian companies producing fakes or imitations).[2] Incense burning has taken place in India for thousands of years, and India exported the idea to China and Japan, and other Asian countries.
