BYU didn't score its first touchdown, a one-yard run by running back Michael Alisa, until 5:44 left in the game to close the gap to seven points. After holding and false start penalties forced a three-and-out on Utah's next possession, BYU quarterback Taysom Hill was intercepted on the Cougars' next drive with a little more than 90 seconds remaining â€“ appearing to seal the win for Utah.
