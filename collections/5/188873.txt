The Chew airs at 1:00 pm Eastern/12 noon Central, the slot formerly occupied by the long-running soap opera All My Children. ABC stations in the Mountain and Pacific time zones, and in Alaska and Hawaii follow a Central time zone schedule for daytime programming; thus, The Chew is scheduled by the network to air at 12 noon in these areas.
