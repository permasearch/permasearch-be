However, on 20 June in that year, the MV Kingsabbey crashed into the pier, severing the new pier head from the rest of the pier, destroying the boathouse used by the lifeboat service and causing major structural damage due to the destruction of iron piles and supporting girders. This left a 70-foot (21Â m) gap in the pier. While this was temporarily bridged to restore access, full repairs were not completed until 1989.
