In August 2016, Bendis stated issue #5 was delayed due to birth of Marquez's son and that Marvel extended series to eight issues explaining, "David [Marquez] has been handing in about a page a day for the last couple of weeks so we're getting back on track. So much so that Marvel greenlit an 8th issue for us. I came up with a better ending but needed the pages. Very grateful that they let us do our thing."[22] The delay also caused the remaining issues to be pushed back with issue #8 being released in December 2016.[23]
