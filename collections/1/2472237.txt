Brian Griese, son of former Miami Dolphins quarterback Bob Griese, took over as quarterback upon Elway's retirement. Griese led the team from 1999–2002, compiling a record of 34–30.  Though the team made the playoffs in the 2000 season under Griese, he never took a snap in the postseason for the Broncos.  A shoulder injury he suffered during a gutty Monday Night performance against the arch-rival Raiders (in what would be, ironically, the final Monday Night affair at Mile High Stadium), shelved him for most of the remainder of the season. Thus, Gus Frerotte started the playoff game against the Baltimore Ravens, a 21–3 defeat.[6] The Broncos would finish with winning records under Griese but miss the playoffs in 2001 and 2002.
