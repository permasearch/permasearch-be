In statistics, bivariate data is data on each of two variables, where each value of one of the variables is paired with a value of the other variable.[1] Typically it would be of interest to investigate the possible association between the two variables.[2] The association can be studied via a tabular or graphical display, or via sample statistics which might be used for inference. The method used to investigate the association would depend on the level of measurement of the variable.
