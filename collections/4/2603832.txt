The Rigvedic hymns mention rice and porridge, in hymns such as 8.83, 8.70, 8.77 and 1.61 in some versions of the text,[80] however there is no discussion of rice cultivation.[78] The term "ayas" (metal) occurs in the Rigveda, but it is unclear which metal it was.[81] Iron is not mentioned in Rigveda, something scholars have used to help date Rigveda to have been composed before 1000 BC.[68] Hymn 5.63 mentions "metal cloaked in gold", suggesting metal working had progressed in the Vedic culture.[82]
