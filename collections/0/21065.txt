In 1885, Joseph F. Steinwand developed a new type of cheese at his father's cheese factory near Colby, Wisconsin. The cheese was named after the village,[1] which had been founded three years earlier.[2] While Colby cheese is still widely available, it is no longer produced in Colby. A festival commemorating the cheese is held every year in mid-July where all local food booths offer free Colby cheese. On August 12, 2015, the original cheese factory was torn down leaving only the foundations of the building.[citation needed]
