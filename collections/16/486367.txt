An early experiment on knowledge of results was the machine invented by Sidney Pressey, where a device both tested and taught multiple-choice questions.[5][6] This method tells the user (by inference) only whether the choice was correct or not. The material was multiple choice items, and the method used as an addition to collecting classroom test scores.
