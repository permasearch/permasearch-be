While Tabitha and Napoleon were still in college, they were accepted into the dance company Culture Shock where they met members of the JabbaWockeeZ before the JabbaWockeeZ became a crew.[12] In addition to going to school and being a part of Culture Shock, they both maintained part-time jobs. Together they worked at Bunker Dance Center in Las Vegas teaching hip-hop classes.[14] Separately Napoleon worked as a personal trainer[8] and Tabitha worked at the Rio Hotel and Casino.[12] While dancing with Culture Shock, Tabitha created demo reels of the company to send to event organizers who were having conventions in Las Vegas.[9][15] Tabitha and Napoleon used this method to book choreography jobs and it was during this time that they honed their lyrical hip-hop style.[9] Through Culture Shock, they were hired to choreograph several industrial musicals for casinos and corporations such as Nike, Levi, Redken, Matrix Hair, and MAC.[16] They eventually worked their way up from company dancers to become the artistic directors.[15] As Tabitha and Napoleon's college graduation was approaching they decided to change their plans from a job in public relations and medical school respectively to a career in the dance industry.[5]
