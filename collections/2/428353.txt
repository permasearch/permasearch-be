December 2015 became the wettest calendar month ever recorded in the United Kingdom, with January 2016 becoming the second wettest. In these months, some northern and western parts had 2 to 4 times as much rainfall as normal.[31] December 2015 was also the warmest December averaged over the whole UK, and had the highest positive anomaly for any month in the Central England temperature series which began in 1659 (CET was 9.7 °C, this is warmer than even any March[32]). Most areas of southern England had average monthly temperatures 5-6 °C above normal. Some plants flowered that would normally do so in the Spring or even Summer.[33] Hardly any stations in Wales and Southern England recorded any air frosts and temperatures were often comparable to those of April or May. The maximum recorded temperature was 17.2 °C at Teignmouth in Devon and Plockton and Achnagart in the highlands of Scotland on 16th. The lowest daily mean temperature during December 2015 at Heathrow Airport was still 8.2 °C on 9 December, comparable to the average daily high for the calendar month. Remarkably, December 2015 did not break any national records for high temperatures, just failing to reach the maximum England temperature of 17.7 °C recorded on 2 December 1985 in Chivenor, Devon and on 11 December 1994 in Penkridge, Staffordshire.[34] Despite the warmth, it was the dullest December since 1989.[35]
