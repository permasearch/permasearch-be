RNAs are a type of large biological molecules, whose individual building blocks are called nucleotides. The name poly(A) tail (for polyadenylic acid tail)[8] reflects the way RNA nucleotides are abbreviated, with a letter for the base the nucleotide contains (A for adenine, C for cytosine, G for guanine and U for uracil). RNAs are produced (transcribed) from a DNA template. By convention, RNA sequences are written in a 5' to 3' direction. The 5' end is the part of the RNA molecule that is transcribed first, and the 3' end is transcribed last. The 3' end is also where the poly(A) tail is found on polyadenylated RNAs.[1][9]
