Nonetheless, Tolhurst was credited as co-writer of five of the eight songs featured on 1983's singles and b-sides collection Japanese Whispers (including "Let's Go to Bed" and "The Walk"), while "The Love Cats", "Lament" and "The Dream" were credited to Smith only.[42] Of 1984's The Top, Smith would say it was "the solo album I never made",[43] having played nearly all instruments himself except for drums (by Andy Anderson),[44] with Porl Thompson contributing saxophone to one song ("Give Me It").[8] Tolhurst is obliquely credited in the album's liner notes with performing "other Instruments", and shared co-writing credits with Smith for only three of the ten album tracks.[45]
