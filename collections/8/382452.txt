Because English is the majority language in both countries, and accents and dialects on both sides of the border are (relatively) similar and being a variety of North American English (as compared to the British or Australian English), both high culture and mass media are easily traded. Granted, both countries have minority-language media—Canada's large francophone population and the United States' large hispanophone population—as well as immigrants and indigenous language speakers, but cultural trade mostly concerns English-language media.
