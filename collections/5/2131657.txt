The San people are the first indigenous African people to issue a code of conduct for research. The code, published on 3 March 2017, requires researchers to submit their research proposals to the San council for approval. The research, along with any visual material, needs to be consented to by the community. The code does not aim at restricting research but for the research to be done in an ethical manner. Benefits of any studies on the Khoisan people should also benefit the studied community, which does not exclude money. Other ways which the Khoisan community could potentially benefit include opportunities for co-research, training and employment as translators and research assistants. If any ethical violations are found, the researcher will be blacklisted from working with the San. This new code of ethics does not have any legal standing. The motivation for its creation includes preventing the use of insulting language such as 'Bushmen', the use of jargon, and the lack of consent from community members as to how the community is represented. Researches have admitted to making several mistakes in their publications and that the communities do not often gain any benefits from the extensive research conducted.[23][24]
