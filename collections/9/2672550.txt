Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times and Derek Adams of Time Out complained about what were seen as tepid battle sequences,[79] and perceived melodrama.[76][81] While Ebert and TV Guide felt that Spock's death was dramatic and well-handled,[79][82] The Washington Post's Gary Arnold stated Spock's death "feels like an unnecessary twist, and the filmmakers are obviously well-prepared to fudge in case the public demands another sequel".[76] Negative reviews of the film also focused on the acting,[76][83] and Empire singled out the "dodgy coiffures" and "Santa Claus tunics" as elements of the film that had not aged well.[84]
