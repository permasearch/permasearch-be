Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix's secret ending features a character named Ventus who bears a strong striking resemblance to him. Nomura commented that, despite their similarities, Roxas and Ventus are not the same character. He also said that when playing Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, players will be able to distinguish Roxas from Ventus.[36] In another interview, Nomura implied both characters are related, specifically to Sora, but he wanted fans to imagine reasons for such a connection.[16][37] For the upcoming game Kingdom Hearts III, there is a possibility of Roxas being revived despite Sora being alive at the same time. Nomura says this will be explained by the fact that the character Xehanort whose Heartless and Nobody, Ansem and Xemnas, exist at the same time as the original one.[38]
