While Bledsoe has thrown for a high number of yards and attempts, a frequent criticism is that they are based on volume (attempts, completions, yards) rather than efficiency (passer rating, TD-to-INT ratio, yards per attempt) proving only that he has thrown a great number of times, not that he has thrown well.[37] According to sports writer Don Banks, Bledsoe's large career totals "reveal more about his longevity than about his excellence".[38]
