Another episode Chernuchin told THR would be based on Charlie Gard, an infant in England who was born with a rare genetic disorder that causes progressive brain damage and muscle failure. "That's a life and death story," Chernuchin explained. "Cat-fishing," cyberbullying — which he described to THR as "[SVU's] answer to 13 Reasons Why — and an airplane episode covering "all the turmoil on airplanes these days." Chernuchin concluded, "We are ripping things from the headlines. Some of them are big, famous headlines and some of them are smaller headlines."[4]
