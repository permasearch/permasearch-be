Hoover seldom mentioned civil rights while he was president. He believed that African-Americans and other races could improve themselves with education and individual initiative.[125] He opposed federal anti-lynching laws, and when lynchings occurred in the South, including one incident linked to his party’s efforts to “Republicanize” southern states, he offered only verbal condemnation.[115]
