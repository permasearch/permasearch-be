"Home and Away" was written, produced and arranged by Mike Perjanik as the theme song to Home and Away.[1][2][3] It was originally performed by Karen Boddington and Mark Williams. The song was engineered by Wahanui Wynyard and recorded at Albert Studios in Sydney.[1] In an interview with music website Noisey, Perjanik said he was only given a rough idea that the show was going to be about foster kids, being home or away, "so I decided that I wanted the mood to be warm."[2] The song took 4â€“6 weeks to complete.[2]
