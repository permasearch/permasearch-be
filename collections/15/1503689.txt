Layer 2 switching is highly efficient because there is no modification to the data packet and the frame, encapsulation of the packet changes only when the data packet is passing through dissimilar media (such as from Ethernet to FDDI). Layer 2 switching is used for work group connectivity and network segmentation (breaking up collision domains). This allows a flatter network design with more network segments than traditional networks joined by repeater hubs and routers. Layer 2 switching has helped develop new components in the network infrastructure.
