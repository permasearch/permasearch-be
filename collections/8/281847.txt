Upon returning to the Netherlands, Hudson reported that he had found a fertile land and an amicable people willing to engage his crew in small-scale bartering of furs, trinkets, clothes, and small manufactured goods. His report was first published in 1611 by Emanuel Van Meteren, an Antwerp émigré and the Dutch Consul at London.[227] This stimulated interest[230] in exploiting this new trade resource, and it was the catalyst for Dutch merchant-traders to fund more expeditions.
