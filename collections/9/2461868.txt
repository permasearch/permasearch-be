The ruling coalition, which consists of the Republican Party of Armenia and the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, officially nominated Armen Sarkissian for president on 23 February[9]. On 24 February, the Prosperous Armenia party, which is in opposition, signalled that it would vote for the ruling coalition's candidate[10]. This means that the only party left that did not nominate a candidate was the Way Out Alliance. As a party or coalition must have the support of at least one fourth of the deputies in the National Assembly, the Way Out Alliance were not able to nominate a candidate as they only had nine deputies in the National Assembly. Sarkissian will take up office on April 9, 2018.[11]
