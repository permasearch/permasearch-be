The only Canadian, and also last known specimen of the sea mink (Mustela macrodon) was captured on Campobello Island, New Brunswick in 1894. It is unknown whether the species was ever native to the country, but an unidentified animal reported in 1785 suggest it might have been more common in the Maritimes.
