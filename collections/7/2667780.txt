When Time declared the German Chancellor Angela Merkel Time Person of the Year for 2015, they referred to her as "Europe's most powerful leader", and the cover bore the title "Chancellor of the Free World".[10] Following the election of Donald Trump to the US presidency in November 2016, The New York Times called Merkel "the Liberal West's Last Defender",[11] and some called her "the next leader of the free world".[12][13] Merkel herself rejected the idea as absurd.[14] Increasingly, however, the term "leader of the free world" was used in connection with Angela Merkel by commentators in the English-language media. An article by James Rubin in Politico about a White House meeting between Merkel and Trump was, ironically[15] titled "The Leader of the Free World Meets Donald Trump".[16]
