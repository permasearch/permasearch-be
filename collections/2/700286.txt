Unlike The New York Times online archive, the TimesMachine presents scanned images of the actual newspaper. All non-advertising content can be displayed on a per-story basis in a separate PDF display page and saved for future reference.[178] The archive is available to New York Times subscribers, home delivery and/or digital.[177]
