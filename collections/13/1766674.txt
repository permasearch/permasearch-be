Solvation describes the interaction of solvent with molecules or ions in a solute. Ions, and to some cases, molecules, interact strongly with solvent, and the strength and nature of this interaction influences many properties of the solute, including solubility, reactivity, and color. In the process of solvation, ions are surrounded by concentric shells of solvent. Solvation is the process of reorganizing solvent and solute molecules into solvation complexes. Solvation involves bond formation, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals forces. Solvation of a solute by water is called hydration.[citation needed]
