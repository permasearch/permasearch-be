California Family Code Section 308 provides that a marriage validly contracted in another jurisdiction is valid in California. Thus, a common-law marriage validly contracted in another jurisdiction is valid in California notwithstanding it could not be legally contracted within California; and a common-law marriage that was not validly contracted in another U.S. jurisdiction is not valid in California. All other states have similar statutory provisions. Exceptions to this rule are marriages deemed by the jurisdiction to be "odious to public policy". In general, states which have abolished common-law marriage continue to recognize such marriages contracted in the past (i.e. before the date when they were abolished).
