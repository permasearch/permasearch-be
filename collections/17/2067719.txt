Théoden is an important character in Peter Jackson's film adaption of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. As in the books, the character (played by Bernard Hill) first makes an appearance in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002). However, unlike in the books, the Lord of the Mark is actually possessed and prematurely aged by Saruman (Christopher Lee). Gandalf (Ian McKellen) releases him from the spell, instantly restoring him to his true age, after which Théoden banishes Gríma Wormtongue (Brad Dourif) from the city.
