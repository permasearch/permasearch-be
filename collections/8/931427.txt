Dr. Huebner is known widely as "the father of insurance education."  He originated the concept of "human life value", which became a standard method of calculating insurance value and need. He established the goal of professionalism in the field of insurance, developed the first collegiate level program in insurance and chaired the Department of Insurance at Wharton, and contributed greatly to the progress of adult education in this area.[2] Huebner was a prolific writer, possibly best known for his classic work, Life Insurance.
