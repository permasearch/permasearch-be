Eine kleine Nachtmusik[1] (Serenade No. 13 for strings in G major), K. 525, is a 1787 composition for a chamber ensemble by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The German title means "a little serenade", though it is often rendered more literally but less accurately as "a little night music."[2] The work is written for an ensemble of two violins, viola, and cello with optional double bass but is often performed by string orchestras.[3]
