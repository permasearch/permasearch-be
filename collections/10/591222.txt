Paul, within a context of having "no command from the Lord" (1 Cor 7:25), recommends celibacy, but acknowledges that it is not God's gift to all within the church: "For I wish that all men were even as I myself. But each one has his own gift from God, one in this manner and another in that. But I say to the unmarried and to the widows: It is good for them if they remain even as I am, ... I want you to be without care. He who is unmarried cares for the things of the Lord – how he may please the Lord. But he who is married cares about the things of the world – how he may please his wife. There is a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares about the things of the world – how she may please her husband. And this I say for your own profit, not that I may put a leash on you, but for what is proper, and that you may serve the Lord without distraction" (1 Corinthians 7:7–8, 7:32–35). Paul's recommendation of celibacy could be explained by his expectation that the end was near: "The appointed time has grown short.... Let those who have wives live as if they have none.... For the present form of this world is passing away"(1 Corinthians 7:29-31). This would be consistent with Jesus' expectation of an imminent coming of the kingdom, in continuity with the Baptist (Mark 9:1; 13:30, 32).
