A gene is a stretch of DNA that encodes information. Genomic DNA consists of two antiparallel and reverse complementary strands, each having 5' and 3' ends. With respect to a gene, the two strands may be labeled the "template strand," which serves as a blueprint for the production of an RNA transcript, and the "coding strand," which includes the DNA version of the transcript sequence. (Perhaps surprisingly, the "coding strand" is not physically involved in the coding process because it is the "template strand" that is read during transcription.)
