The first recorded Test at the venue was held in 1934, and its first One Day International in 1987.[3] The Hero Cup knockout matches were staged at Eden Gardens, the first matches played under lights at the ground.[10] Sporting floodlights, bowlers deliver from the High Court End or the Pavilion End of the pitch.[3] Eden Gardens is renowned for its large and vociferous crowds. It is said that "a cricketer's cricketing education is not complete till he has played in front of a packed Eden Gardens." Former Indian Captain and Kolkata Native Sourav Ganguly confessed once in an interview that the roar of crowd at the stadium he heard when India defeated Australia in the Second Test of 2000–01 Border–Gavaskar Trophy was the most loud he had ever heard.
