Streets was founded in Corrimal, New South Wales, in the 1930s by Edwin "Ted" Street and his wife Daisy and is now Australia's largest ice-cream manufacturer. He set up a distribution depot at Bexley and then a factory where products were manufactured at in the Sydney suburb of Turrella until 1996, when production moved to a new facility in Minto. Today most cream-based products are produced at Minto, while water-based products are imported from Asia.[4]
