"Joanne" is an acoustic country ballad;[7][8][9] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stated that it "winks at" Dolly Parton's "Jolene" (1973).[10] In an interview with Zane Lowe on Beats 1, Gaga revealed that it was recorded in one take.[11] The song is written in the time signature of common time with a moderately slow tempo of 74 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of G major, with Gaga's vocals ranging from E3 to D5. "Joanne's" chord progressions follow a basic sequence of G–D–C–G–D–C during the verses, and C–D–Em–C–C/B–Am7–D during the chorus.[12] The album version runs for 3 minute and 16 seconds[13] while the piano version is 4 minutes and 39 seconds long.[14]
