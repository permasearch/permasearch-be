Kirtan (Sanskrit: "to repeat"[10]) is call-and-response chanting or "responsory" performed in India's devotional traditions.[11] A person performing kirtan is known as a kirtankar. Kirtan practice involves chanting hymns or mantras to the accompaniment of instruments such as the harmonium, tablas, the two-headed mrdanga or pakawaj drum, and karatal hand cymbals.
