A major component of tanker architecture is the design of the hull or outer structure. A tanker with a single outer shell between the product and the ocean is said to be "single-hulled".[84]  Most newer tankers are "double hulled", with an extra space between the hull and the storage tanks.[84] Hybrid designs such as "double-bottom" and "double-sided" combine aspects of single and double-hull designs.[84] All single-hulled tankers around the world will be phased out by 2026, in accordance with the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 (MARPOL).[84] The United Nations has decided to phase out single hull oil tankers by 2010.[85]
