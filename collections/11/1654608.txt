In 1997, JET produced a peak of 16.1MW of fusion power (65% of heat to plasma[130]), with fusion power of over 10MW sustained for over 0.5Â sec. Its successor, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), was officially announced as part of a seven-party consortium (six countries and the EU).[131] ITER is designed to produce ten times more fusion power than the power put into the plasma. ITER is currently under construction in Cadarache, France.
