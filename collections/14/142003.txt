Murphy hounded Pat Kiernan until he got an audition at Corcadorca, and in September 1996, he made his professional acting debut on the stage, playing the part of a volatile Cork teenager in Enda Walsh's Disco Pigs.[5] Walsh recalled meeting and discovering Murphy: "There was something about him – he was incredibly enigmatic and he would walk into a room with real presence and you'd go, "My God". It had nothing to do with those bloody eyes that everyone's going on about all the time."[9] Murphy observed, "I was unbelievably cocky and had nothing to lose, and it suited the part, I suppose."[10] Originally intended to run for three weeks in Cork,[5] Disco Pigs ended up touring throughout Europe, Canada and Australia for two years, and Murphy left both university[3] and his band.[6] Though he had intended to go back to playing music, he secured representation after his first agent caught a performance of Disco Pigs, and his acting career began to take off.[11]
