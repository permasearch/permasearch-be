The cart comes to a stop after this, and a female ride attendant appears behind a glassed control booth and thanks them for riding, but Imhotep sucks out her soul, breaks the glass, and sets the ceiling on fire while shouting "Prepare to forfeit your souls! Death is only the beginning!" The cart then drops down 39Â ft (the highest drop in the ride) and goes down a winding drop until a medjai symbol appears while Imhotep shouts "NOOOOO!" as the vehicle passes through the medjai symbol.
