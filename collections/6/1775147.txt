Five years later, in Grand Theft Auto V, Niko is briefly mentioned by Patrick McReary, who says he does not know whether Niko is alive or not when remarking on their bank robbery; the other two crew members, Michael Keane and Derrick McReary had died since then, and Packie had lost contact with Niko in the intervening years. Another reference appears at the end of the game: should Michael survive and find his family at the dining room table, his son Jimmy is stalking Niko on LifeInvader, a parody of Facebook. Apparently Niko had moved back to Broker in the intervening years in between games and is now working as a taxi driver for Roman's cab service. A closer inspection reveals that Niko has wished Roman a happy birthday, although Rockstar noted that Roman's death is not non-canon.[21]
