Marina/Seven finds a pair of glasses with dark shades (not sunglasses) while exploring the objects of her Chest. Crayton, Ella's CÃªpan, does not seem to know what the function of the glasses are. When Ella puts them on, however, she sees everything nearly three seconds before it actually happens. For example, when the group is in the truck, Ella shouts that there is a missile heading for the truck, but no one else sees or hears it. Now screaming at the top of her lungs, Ella forces everyone out of the truck, and it explodes a second later. Hence, the glasses help the wearer see what is coming before others. The use is not confirmed, because later Ella accidentally drops them and a tree branch crushes them. The name of it isn't confirmed, either. Marina is the only Garde known to possess this Loric object.
