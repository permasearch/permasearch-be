The most number of awards won by a single manager is eleven, achieved by Alex Ferguson between 1994 and his retirement in 2013. He accounted for more than half of the awards in that period of time. In 1998 Arsène Wenger became the first non-British manager to win the award, and has so far received it on two further occasions with Arsenal. José Mourinho is the only manager other Ferguson and Wenger to have won the award on more than on one occasion, and the only manager other than Ferguson to win the award in consecutive seasons.
