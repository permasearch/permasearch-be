After the dissolution of the American Association, the Browns franchise moved to the National League in 1892 and become known as the Cardinals in 1900. (The Browns name was subsequently picked up by an AL team that had previously been known as the Milwaukee Brewers, and is now the Baltimore Orioles.) St. Louis would not achieve much success in its early years in the NL. On the other hand, the Cubs dominated, winning 3 straight pennants from 1906â€“1908 and two World Series during that time, losing the first World Series in that trio only to their cross-town rivals, the Chicago White Sox. The Cubs would also go on to win seven more pennants from then until 1945.
