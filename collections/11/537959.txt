A storage area network (SAN) or storage network is a Computer network which provides access to consolidated, block level data storage. SANs are primarily used to enhance storage devices, such as disk arrays and tape libraries, accessible to servers so that the devices appear to the operating system as locally attached devices. A SAN typically is its network of storage devices not accessible through the local area network (LAN) by other devices.
