The phrase was reported widely in the international media when Ronald Reagan quipped about Russian-American relations during a 1982 presidential news conference.[3]  Reagan stated: "For ten years détente was based on words by them [the Russians] and not any words to back them up. And we need some action that they — it takes two to tango — that they want to tango also." [4] Since that time, the tango metaphor has appeared regularly in the headline of the international press.  The phrase has gained currency as a proverb in loan translation in other languages.[3]
