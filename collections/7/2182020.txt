The cyclone brought hurricane-force winds to large portions of Scotland through much of 8 December. The summit of Cairn Gorm recorded a gust speed of 165 mph (264 km/h), though sustained winds at the surface averaged 105 mph (168 km/h) and 80 mph (128 km/h) in populous areas.[25][26] The high winds generated large waves along coastlines and blew trees and debris into power lines. About 150,000 Scottish households lost power, 70,000 of which still had not had their electricity returned by nightfall.[27] Two hospitals, The Belford and Victoria Hospital, suffered power and telephone service cuts.[28]
