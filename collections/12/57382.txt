The contestants entered the show dancing on the popular song ‘’Swag se karenge sabka swagat’’ from Tiger Zinda Hai along with the participant kids. In the first act of the evening, Gandotra played the role of Salim Jahangir, and Bharadwaj played the role of Anarkali. The child actor Kartikey Raj played the role of Salim’s father Akbar. The comic timing of all the actors made the act great and the dance ‘’chod chad ke apne Salim ki gali, anarkali disco chali’’ added extra fun to the act. Shetty was very happy with the performance and stated that Gandotra involved the rest of the contestants and audience in this act. Both the judges agreed that he was the heart of the act. Gandotra scored a high nine and Bharadwaj scored perfect ten.
