When she is found in the temple by the priest she is praying silently, but her lips are moving. A priest called Eli witnesses this odd posture and concludes she is drunk. In her despair she prays to God for a child and if her prayer is granted she will give the son back to God. After Hannah's explanation of her sobriety, Eli blesses her with peace and a guarantee that God of Israel will grant her request. She goes home, eats and drinks with her husband, and is filled with hope. Subsequently, Hannah becomes pregnant; her child is named Samuel. The time comes to offer the yearly sacrifice at the temple but Hannah stays home. She promises to go to the temple when Samuel is weaned and plans to leave him with Eli to be trained as a Nazirite.
