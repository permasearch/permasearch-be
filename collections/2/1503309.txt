As a result of Gaddafi's defeat at the Battle of Tripoli, the decisive battle of the war, in August 2011, the Arab League voted to recognise the anti-Gaddafi National Transitional Council as the legitimate government of the country pending elections,[69] yet although the council has been recognised by several AU member states, including two countries that are also members of the Arab League,[70][71] the AU Peace and Security Council voted on 26 August 2011 not to recognise it, insisting that a ceasefire be agreed to and a national unity government be formed by both sides in the civil war.[72] A number of AU member states led by Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Rwanda requested that the AU recognise the NTC as Libya's interim governing authority,[73][74] and several other AU member states have recognised the NTC regardless of the Peace and Security Council's decision.[75][76] However, AU member states Algeria[77] and Zimbabwe[78] have indicated they will not recognise the NTC, and South Africa has expressed reservations as well.[79]
