After the war, Newman completed his Bachelor of Arts in drama and economics at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio in 1949.[23] Shortly after earning his degree, he joined several summer stock companies, most notably the Belfry Players in Wisconsin[24] and the Woodstock Players in Illinois. He toured with them for three months and developed his talents as a part of Woodstock Players.[18][25] He later attended the Yale School of Drama for one year, before moving to New York City to study under Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio.[18] Oscar Levant wrote that Newman initially was hesitant to leave New York for Hollywood, and that Newman had said, "Too close to the cake. Also, no place to study."[26]
