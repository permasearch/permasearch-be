Throughout his managerial career, Wenger has trusted his players to perform and learn from their own mistakes,[270] a quality Vieira regards as his biggest strength and weakness.[271] Wenger encourages sportsmen to show intuition, and makes observations rather than explicitly giving orders.[272] Campbell reflected that his former manager "puts a lot of onus on players to change the game" and "he wants certain players – especially in the last third – to be able to produce it and give something different".[273] When Wenger joined Arsenal, he spoke of his desire to see "real, modern football. That means compact lines, of zones, of quick, coordinated movements with a good technique."[274] He characteristically focuses on the strengths of his teams, rather than looking for areas to exploit the opposition.[270]
