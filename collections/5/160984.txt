The Article imposes both positive and negative obligations on States; not only is the State required to protect its constituents from arbitrary interference in family life by public authorities,[32] it must also provide within its domestic legal system safeguards that allow the development of a “normal family life”.[33] It is clear that Article 8 applies to both “legitimate” and “illegitimate” family, with no distinction between the two qualifications within the Convention.[34]
