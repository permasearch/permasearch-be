In November 2015, Air Berlin announced the closure of its Palma de Mallorca Airport hub by ceasing all of the hub's seven Spanish domestic routes by 3 April 2016.[81][82] Some days earlier, the airline announced plans to add flights from DÃ¼sseldorf to Boston, Dallas/Fort Worth, San Francisco and Havana by spring 2016.[83] However, the planned route to Dallas/Fort Worth was cancelled a few weeks later due to low demand.[84]
