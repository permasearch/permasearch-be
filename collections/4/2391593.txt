Special guest: Stuart Canin. Jack introduces cameraman Charlie Summers (Phil Arnold) and his new wife, Selma (Claire Carleton); she asks Jack why Charlie has never received a raise, and berates him for being a cheapskate. During their "feud", Fred Allen presented a 10-year-old violinist on his radio show, Stuart Canin, who played violin better than Jack. He's now a 38-year-old professor of violin at Oberlin. He plays a selection from La vida breve by Manuel de Falla on a Stradivarius.
