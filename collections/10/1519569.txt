St Kilda opened the second quarter better, but again missed relatively easy shots at goal from Schneider and Milne. After a tough 20 minutes and goals to Dempster, Byrnes, and Ablett, the final 5 minutes of the quarter saw 5 goals with Geelong kicking to a two-goal lead including two goals in 15 seconds, the first of these two was a controversial goal scored by Tom Hawkins after a Zac Dawson turnover in the goal-square, which television replays confirmed hit the post. However, the Saints scored three goals in the final minute of play with the second and third goal both coming within 5 seconds after Darren Milburn showed demonstrative abuse to the goal umpire to end the quarter taking a six-point lead into half time: Clinton Jones roved a pack to snap a goal from the pocket with about ninety seconds remaining; Justin Koschitzke got his boot to a broken marking contest in the goal square to score a goal with only twelve seconds left; and an angry Darren Milburn, believing (incorrectly, according to replays) that he had touched Koschitzke's kick off the boot, gave away an additional free kick on the goal-line for abusing the goal umpire. This free kick gifted Schneider an easy goal with just five seconds remaining in the half.
