One googol is presumed to be greater than the number of atoms in the observable universe, which has been estimated to be approximately 1078.[3] Thus, in the physical world, it is difficult to give examples of numbers that compare to the vastly greater googolplex. However, in analyzing quantum states and black holes, physicist Don Page writes that "determining experimentally whether or not information is lost down black holes of solar mass ... would require more than 101076.96 measurements to give a rough determination of the final density matrix after a black hole evaporates".[4] The end of the Universe via Big Freeze without proton decay is expected to be around 101075 years into the future.
