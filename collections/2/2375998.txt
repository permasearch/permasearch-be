Contrary to claims that alligator snapping turtles possess one of the strongest bite forces of any animal, it has been recorded at 158 ± 18 kgf (1,550 ± 180 N; 348 ± 40 lbf), which is lower than several other species of turtles and at about the same level as humans, relative to the turtle's body size.[19][20] Still, these turtles must be handled with extreme care and considered potentially dangerous.[17] This species can bite through the handle of a broom and rare cases have been reported where human fingers have been cleanly bitten off by the species.[21] No human deaths have been reported to have been caused by alligator snapping turtles.[21]
