During spring training in a game against the Boston Red Sox, Kershaw gained much attention for throwing a curveball to Sean Casey that started behind Casey but at the end looped into the strike zone and struck him out looking.[31] Kershaw was 0–3 and had a 2.28 ERA with 47 strikeouts through 43​1⁄3 innings pitched in his first stint of the year with the Suns.[32] He was then called up to the majors on May 28, 2008, but optioned back to Jacksonville on July 2.[33]
