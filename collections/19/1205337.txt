National is New Zealand's second-oldest extant political party,[7] originating in 1936 with the merger of the two main conservative parties, Reform and United. They had previously formed a coalition against the growing labour movement. National has governed for five periods in the course of the 20th and 21st centuriesâ€”it has held office in New Zealand for more years than any other party.[8][9] Historically, the party's policy platform shifted from moderate economic liberalism to increased emphasis on state interventionism under the Third National Government (1975 to 1984).[10] Following the free-market reforms of the rival Labour Government in the 1980s, National has again advocated free enterprise, reduction of taxes, and individual rights.
