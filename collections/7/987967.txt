Studies in both lab and field settings have shown both teachers and students hold self-serving biases in regard to outcomes in the classroom.[30] These attributions hold the potential for conflict between teacher and student since neither will take personal responsibility, as the student may blame the teacher while the teacher holds the student accountable. However, both teachers and students also reported being aware of the others' bias, which indicated there may be a feasible conflict resolution mechanism.
