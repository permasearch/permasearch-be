In the summer of 1959, following concerns that the native name had, as one politician put it, "turned a known into an unknown", a committee was formed, led by noted scholar Ehsan Yarshater, to consider the issue again. They recommended a reversal of the 1935 decision, and Mohammad Reza Shah approved this. However, the implementation of the proposal was weak, simply allowing Persia and Iran to be used interchangeably.[1] Nowadays both terms are common; Persia mostly in historical and cultural contexts, "Iran" mostly in political contexts.
