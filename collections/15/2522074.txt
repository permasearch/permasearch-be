No new events were added or removed for the 1932 Winter Games held in Lake Placid. For the Summer Games of the same year, the javelin throw was added and gymnastics was removed. At the 1936 Winter Games in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, women competed in the alpine skiing combined event for the first time with German Christl Cranz winning the gold medal.[17] At the Summer Games of the same year held in Berlin, gymnastics returned to the programme for women.
