The Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS) was legally recognized in 2002 but can't replace written Portuguese;[4] the law was regulated in 2005.[5] The language must be taught as a part of the education and speech and language pathology curricula, and law also mandates that LIBRAS be an elective subject as part of every other undergraduate course. LIBRAS teachers, instructors and translators are recognized professionals. Schools and health services must provide access ("include") to deaf people.
