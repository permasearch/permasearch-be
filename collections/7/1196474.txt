Marty has had many false names through the Back to the Future series, usually because of encountering his relatives at some point, most notably Lorraine mistakenly thinking his name is Calvin Klein, due to it being Marty's brand of underwear. In the first film, Marty uses the alias of "Darth Vader, an extraterrestrial from the Planet Vulcan" while wearing a radiation suit in an attempt to coerce George into asking Lorraine out to the dance. In Part III, Marty claims to be "Clint Eastwood" when asked for a name first by Maggie McFly and later by Buford Tannen. In Back to the Future: The Game, he uses one of the three aliases; Sonny Crockett, Harry Callahan, and Michael Corleone.
