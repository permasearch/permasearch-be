Will briefly dated Francie Calfo and shortly after, unbeknownst to him, Francie's genetic doppelganger Allison Doren. Will discovers the ruse by finding Provacillium in Sydney's medicine cabinet, medication taken by gene therapy patients. At exactly the same time, Allison looks through Will's work and finds out Will is researching an "Allison Georgia Doren." Allison realizes Will is close to knowing the truth, and attempts to frame him for her crimes, drugging him and subjecting him to subliminal conditioning which would render him unable to recall his exact actions at certain times, but Sydney sees through this attempt. When Will realizes the truth about Alison, she nearly kills him, but he recovers and is quickly shuttled into the Federal Witness Protection Program, removing him as a regular character for season three. However, he did have a brief reappearance after he was sought out by Sydney, when a current mission required her to make contact with one of Will's old sources during his career as an analyst, and the two had a brief tryst. During this reunion mission, Will finally encounters Allison and kills her for the murder of Francie, after which he returns to private life.
