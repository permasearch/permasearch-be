For example, the stress mark may be doubled to indicate an extra degree of stress, such as prosodic stress in English.[64] An example in French, with a single stress mark for normal prosodic stress at the end of each prosodic unit (marked as a minor prosodic break), and a double stress mark for contrastive/emphatic stress: [ˈˈɑ̃ːˈtre | məˈsjø ‖ ˈˈvwala maˈdam ‖] Entrez monsieur, voilà madame. [65] Similarly, a doubled secondary stress mark ⟨ˌˌ⟩ is commonly used for tertiary stress.
