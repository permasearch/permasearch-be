The Bears went 7–3 under Cutler, but after Cutler came down with a thumb injury, Caleb Hanie started the games, and the team lost 5 straight games under Hanie, as well as running back Matt Forté to an ACL sprain, and Forté was having a great season, leading the league in total yards from scrimmage until the injury came, and the team went 8–8 with Josh McCown at quarterback.
