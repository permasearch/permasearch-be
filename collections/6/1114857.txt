Although the battle actually took place near Allenstein (Olsztyn), Hindenburg named it after Tannenberg, 30Â km to the west, in order to, in German eyes, avenge the defeat of the Teutonic Knights 500 years earlier at the Battle of Grunwald (which was always known as the Battle of Tannenberg in German).
