Following its launch, the Ford Ranger T6 was marketed worldwide, with the exception of the United States and Canada. In the early 2010s, Ford shifted its design attention in North America towards increasing the fuel economy of full-size pickup trucks, with the shift towards direct-injection and turbocharged engines and aluminum-intensive body design for the F-Series pickup trucks.
