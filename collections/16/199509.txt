Samaritans appear elsewhere in the Gospels and Book of Acts. In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus heals ten lepers and only the Samaritan among them thanks him (Luke 17:11–19),[11] although Luke 9:51–56 depicts Jesus receiving a hostile reception in Samaria.[6] Luke's favorable treatment of Samaritans is in line with Luke's favorable treatment of the weak and of outcasts, generally.[17] In John, Jesus has an extended dialogue with a Samaritan woman, and many Samaritans come to believe in him.[18] In Matthew, however, Jesus instructs his disciples not to preach in heathen or Samaritan cities (Matthew 10:5–8).[11] In the Gospels, generally, "though the Jews of Jesus' day had no time for the 'half-breed' people of Samaria",[19] Jesus "never spoke disparagingly about them"[19] and "held a benign view of Samaritans".[20]
