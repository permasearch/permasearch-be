Underfactoring occurs when too few factors are included in a model. This is considered to be a greater error than overfactoring. If not enough factors are included in a model, there is likely to be substantial error. Measured variables that load onto a factor not included in the model can falsely load on factors that are included, altering true factor loadings . This can result in rotated solutions in which two factors are combined into a single factor, obscuring the true factor structure.
