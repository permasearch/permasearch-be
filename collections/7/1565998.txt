The Kerala Blasters then ended the year with another 'Southern Derby" match against new expansion side Bengaluru at the Nehru Stadium. Meulensteen made several changes from the previous match against Chennaiyin, including dropping goalkeeper Paul Rachubka to the bench for Indian goalkeeper Subhasish Roy Chowdhury. Samuel Shadap also started at right back as replacement for the injured Rino Anto. C.K. Vineeth, who had been on form in the lead up to this match, was also dropped with no reason given and replaced with Iain Hume.[39] During the match, the Blasters managed to hold Bengaluru at 0–0 going into halftime. However, in the 60th minute, Blasters captain Sandesh Jhingan handled the ball in the penalty box after a cross from Udanta Singh. Bengaluru's Sunil Chhetri converted the ensuing penalty to give the away side the lead.[40] The Kerala Blasters proceeded to try to find the equalizer but three minutes into stoppage time Miku found the net for Bengaluru to increase their lead and then he did it again only a minute later to make it 3–0. Despite the two late goals, Courage Pekuson managed to find time to grab a consolation goal for the Blasters in the 96th minute as they fell to their second defeat of the season.[41]
