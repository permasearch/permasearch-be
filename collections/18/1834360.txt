Sniper Joe is a biped mechaniloid used as infantry by Dr. Wily. It physically resembles a green Proto Man but instead with a head containing a full face black visor, more resembling a motorcycle helmet with a single red eye instead of sunglasses. It has no real intelligence, and simply blocks forward attacks with his shield, then shoots a number of shots from its arm cannon (The exact number of shots depends on the model of the Sniper Joe). It can also jump into the air, during which it lifts up its shield, leaving an opening for Mega Man to attack him. Mega Man can also damage him as he moves his shield out of the way directly before firing. In Mega Man 8 and Mega Man & Bass, the Joe Classic can also throw grenades that explode after a certain period of time. Sniper Joes are a recurring enemy throughout the classic series, and many of the numerous variants often involve a Sniper Joe operating machines such as walkers, gun turrets, even jet skis and helicopters. It is stated multiple times that Proto Man considers these abominations, probably since they are based upon him but with limited intelligence.
