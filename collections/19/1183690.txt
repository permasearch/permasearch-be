The Mount Everest climbing season of 2017 began in spring with the first climbers reaching the top on May 11, from the north side.[1] The first team on the south side reached the top on May 15.[2] By early June, reports from Nepal indicated that 445 people had made it to the summit from the Nepali side.[3] Reports indicate 160–200 summits on the north side, with 600–660 summiters overall for early 2017.[4] This year had a roughly 50% success rate on that side for visiting climbers, which was down from other years.[4] By 2018, the figure for the number of summiters of Everest was refined to 648.[5] This includes 449 which summited via Nepal (from the South) and 120 from Chinese Tibet (North side).[6]
