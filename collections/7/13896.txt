The Doodle Bug scooter was a very compact, small-wheeled motorscooter built from 1946-’48 in Webster City, Iowa by the Beam Manufacturing Company. Sold by the Gambles store chain, a total of 40,000 of these were built—a small number with single-cylinder Clinton engines, and most with 1.5 hp Briggs & Stratton air-cooled, single-cylinder engines. They were marketed under the “Hiawatha” brand name. Complete Doodle Bugs were to be found here and there for decades thereafter and, as well, their frames and other parts were not uncommon.
