As of September 2017, the United States Drought Monitor recorded abnormally dryweather conditions across the entire state.[26] The drought is considered severe and unprecedented, and because of its nature as a "unpredictable, sudden event brought on by sustained high temperatures and little rain", it is considered a “flash drought”.[27] North Dakota Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring announced that predicted economic losses as a consequence from the drought could amount to as much as $4 billion or $5 billion.[28][29]
