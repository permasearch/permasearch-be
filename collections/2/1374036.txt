Under President Lee Teng-hui, Republic of China (R.O.C) stated that "legally, historically, geographically, or in reality", all of the South China Sea and Spratly islands were R.O.C's territory and under R.O.C sovereignty, and denounced actions undertaken there by Malaysia and the Philippines, in a statement on 13 July 1999 released by the foreign ministry of Taiwan.[20] Taiwan and China's claims mirror each other.[21] During international talks involving the Spratly islands, P.R.C and R.O.C have cooperated with each other since both have the same claims.[21][22]
