Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz (voiced by Dan Povenmire) is a mad scientist appearing in all but one episode's B-Plots thus far. He is the father to teenage Vanessa Doofenshmirtz and is the head of his own company, Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc. Depending on the episode, Dr. Doofenshmirtz's main goal is to either destroy or rule the Tri-State Area which was suggested to him as a starting point before trying to take over the world.[11] Routinely bumbling, incompetent, and forgetful, almost all of Doofenshmirtz's plans—always involving various gadgets and inventions—have been thwarted by Perry the Platypus. However, a few of his schemes were quite successful in nature, such as in the 2014 special Phineas and Ferb Save Summer when Doofenshmirtz succeeded in moving the Earth away from its original orbit to an early autumn, much to Perry's distraught. After most defeats, he shouts his catchphrase, "Curse you, Perry the Platypus!" His first invention as a child was simply called "Inator"[12] which led to his modern contraptions usually ending with the suffix of the same name.
