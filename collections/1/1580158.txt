When a special needs trust is created and funded by someone other than the beneficiary, the trust can provide the trustee with much greater latitude to make distributions. Furthermore, the government is not entitled to recover any expenditures made for the beneficiary from the trust corpus remaining at the end of the beneficiary's life. These two benefits make third-party special needs trusts strongly preferable to any of the self-settled special needs trusts established under federal law.
