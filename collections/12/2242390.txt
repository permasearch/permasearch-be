Just as with a self-directed IRA, health savings accounts can also be self-directed. While a typical HSA custodian may offer investments such as CDs, stocks, bonds, or mutual funds, certain financial institutions provide accounts offering alternative investments which can be made inside the HSA. The Internal Revenue Code, Section 408, prohibits investments in life insurance and in collectibles, but HSAs can be used to invest in a wide variety of assets including real estate, precious metals, public and private stock, notes, and more.[32]
