One reason attributed with the slow progress is that there are no methods to hold the UN accountable to its proposed changes due to its size and the different approaches taken within the different subsidiaries of the organization [19]. Another reason is the generally poor reception of feminist ideologies in the international relations framework of the UN. Security is typically linked to masculinity, and consequently when asked to apply a feminist lens, this request is often met with hostility toward such “fluffy” subjects [20].
