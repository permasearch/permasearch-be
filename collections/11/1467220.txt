Sometimes, the stories were inspired by a certain event in the life of the storyteller. In the episode "The Tale of the Crimson Clown," for instance, Tucker blackmailed his brother Gary with a poem he had found, which Gary had written for Samantha. Gary then told a story in which a naughty younger brother was punished cruelly for his evil deeds. At the end of the episode, Tucker gave the poem back to his brother. Many, but not all, of the horror stories on Are You Afraid of the Dark? ended with a "happy ending" whereas some of them have either bad endings or twist endings like "The Tale of the Lonely Ghost", "The Tale of the Dark Music", "The Tale of Vampire Town", and "The Tale of the Pinball Wizard".
