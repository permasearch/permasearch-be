The group was promoting the album when lead singer Natalie Maines made controversial comments about U.S. President George W. Bush. The album's third single, "Travelin' Soldier", was #1 on the Billboard Country Chart the week that Maines' comments hit the press.[1] The following week, as many stations started a still-standing boycott of the Chicks' music, the song collapsed. None of their following singles gained traction with country radio.
