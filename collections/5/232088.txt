The Mare's Leg is the name given to a customized shortened rifle used by Steve McQueen's character on the television series Wanted: Dead or Alive (1958â€“1961).  McQueen's character was named Josh Randall, and the gun has also been referred to as a Winchester Randall, or a Randall Special. Mare's Leg is now a generic term for a Winchester Model 1892 (or modern derivative) with a shortened barrel and stock.[2]
