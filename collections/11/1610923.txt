Ars Nova was founded by Jon and Jenny Steingart in 2002 in memory of Gabe Wiener to provide a welcome home for young artists and audiences alike. In 2005 Ars Nova became a 501(c)(3) Not-For-Profit Organization. In addition to Ars Nova’s vast array of development programs for emerging artists, they’re also committed to commissioning new work and producing world premieres.[7]
