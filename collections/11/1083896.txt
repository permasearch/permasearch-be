On June 17, 1994, a white 1993 Bronco owned and driven by Al Cowlings containing O. J. Simpson as a passenger attempted to elude the Los Angeles Police Department in a televised low-speed chase.[17] With an estimated audience of 95 million people, the event was described as "the most famous ride on American shores since Paul Revere's".[18]
