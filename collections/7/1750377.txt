The dual-route theory of reading aloud was first described in the early 1970s.[62] This theory suggests that two separate mental mechanisms, or cognitive routes, are involved in reading aloud.[63] One mechanism is the lexical route, which is the process whereby skilled readers can recognize known words by sight alone, through a "dictionary" lookup procedure.[64] The other mechanism is the nonlexical or sublexical route, which is the process whereby the reader can "sound out" a written word.[64][65] This is done by identifying the word's constituent parts (letters, phonemes, graphemes) and applying knowledge of how these parts are associated with each other, for example, how a string of neighboring letters sound together.[62] The dual-route system could explain the different rates of dyslexia occurrence between different languages (e.g. the Spanish language dependence on phonological rules accounts for the fact that Spanish-speaking children show a higher level of performance in non-word reading, when compared to English-speakers).[30][66]
