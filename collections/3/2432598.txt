Two well-known genera are the common horse-flies, Tabanus, named by Swedish taxonomist Carl Linnaeus in 1758, and the deer flies, Chrysops, named by the German entomologist Johann Wilhelm Meigen in 1802.[25] Meigen did pioneering research on flies and was the author of Die Fliegen (Flies); he gave the name Haematopota, blood-drinker,[26] to another common genus of horse-flies.[27]
