For users with higher accuracy needs, the United States National Centers for Environmental Information developed the Enhanced Magnetic Model (EMM), which extends to degree and order 720 and resolves magnetic anomalies down to a wavelength of 56 kilometers. It was compiled from satellite, marine, aeromagnetic and ground magnetic surveys. The latest version, EMM2015, includes data from The European Space Agency's Swarm satellite mission.[72]
