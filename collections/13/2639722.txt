These conformationally constrained heterocycles are flexible because the six-membered ring can exist in an essentially flat conformation 1 or a slightly puckered boat form 2, with only a few kcal/mol difference in energy between the boat and planar forms. In addition, the 2,5-DKPs can be configured as both cis and trans isomers. As a consequence of their predominant biosynthetic origin from L-Î±-amino acids most naturally occurring 2,5-DKPs are cis configured as the cyclo(L-Xaa-L-Yaa) isomers. However, 2,5-DKPs epimerize under basic, acidic and thermal conditions. The composition of the cis and trans isomers in the equilibrium state varies widely depending on the bulk of the side chains, if a ring (e.g. proline) is present, or if the nitrogen atoms are alkylated . Although epimerization was historically an issue in the synthesis of 2,5-DKPs, several mild methods have been developed recently that avoid epimerization.[4]
