Lucre enters, accompanied by Limber, Kix and the 'servingman' (Host). He takes the 'Widow' aside to speak with her in private. Unaware that she has already married Hoard, Lucre begs the 'Widow' to return to Witgood. The 'Widow' replies that, although she loved him, she broke with Witgood because she discovered that he is a ruined rascal who mortgaged all of his lands to his uncle â€” not the wealthy gentleman he pretended to be at all. Willing to do anything to upstage his enemy, Lucre promises to restore all of Witgood's lands and make him his heir if the 'Widow' will reconsider. The 'Widow' agrees to the deal.
