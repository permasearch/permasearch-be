Full closing credits are still created by the production company and are used in syndicated reruns of a program, and are always seen if the program is released as a DVD box set, is broadcast via video on demand or is streamed online via the network's website or websites such as Hulu or Netflix that specialize in airing television programs.[citation needed] Many animated shows still maintain and air the full version of the credits.
