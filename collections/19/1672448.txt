Water and sewage services are provided by the city.[249] The city draws its water via an aqueduct from Shoal Lake, treating and fluoridating it at the Deacon Reservoir just outside the city prior to pumping it into the Winnipeg system.[250] The city's system has over 2,500 kilometres (1,600Â mi) of underground water mains, which are subject to breakage during extreme weather conditions.[251]
