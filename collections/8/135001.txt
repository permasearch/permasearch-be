The early economy of Phoenix was focused primarily on agriculture and natural resources, dependent on the "5Cs" of copper, cattle, climate, cotton, and citrus.[12] With the establishment of the Southern Pacific rail line in 1926, the opening of the Union Station in 1923, and the creation of Sky Harbor airport by the end of the decade, the city became more easily accessible.[133] The Great Depression affected Phoenix, but Phoenix had a diverse economy and by 1934 the recovery was underway.[134][135] At the conclusion of World War II, the valley's economy surged, as many men who had undergone their military training at the various bases in and around Phoenix returned with their families. The construction industry, spurred on by the city's growth, further expanded with the development of Sun City. It became the template for suburban development in post-WWII America,[136] and Sun City became the template for retirement communities when it opened in 1960.[137][138] The city averaged a 4 percent annual growth rate over a 40-year period from the mid-1960s to the mid-2000s.[13]
