Niccolò di Bernardo dei Machiavelli (voiced by Shawn Baichoo) (1469–1527) or simply Niccolò Machiavelli, is a supporting character of Assassin's Creed II and Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood. He was an Italian philosopher and writer, and a member of the Assassin Order. With the Assassin Order, Niccolò primarily worked with his ally Ezio Auditore da Firenze, and helped him with driving the Orsi brothers from Forlì and with removing the monk Girolamo Savonarola from power in Florence to obtain the "Apple of Eden" from him. Two years later, Machiavelli took up the position of leader of the Italian Assassins. Once again joined by Ezio, they fought against the corrupted Borgia family, which ruled over Rome.
