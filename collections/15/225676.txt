A would-be universal conqueror, the Master wants to control the universe (in The Deadly Assassin, 1976, his ambitions are described as becoming "the master of all matter"),[6] with a secondary objective to make the Doctor suffer; in The Sea Devils (1972), the Master mentions that the "pleasure" of seeing the destruction of the human race, of which the Doctor is fond, would be "a reward in itself".[7]
