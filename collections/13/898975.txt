Kenya's agricultural and industrial sectors were then dominated by Europeans and its commerce and trade dominated by Asians; post-independence, one of the most pressing issues was to bring the economy under indigenous control.[296] There was growing black resentment towards the Asian domination of the small business sector,[304] with Kenyatta's government putting pressure on Asian-owned businesses, intending to replace them with African-owned counterparts.[305] The 1965 session paper promised an "Africanization" of the Kenyan economy,[306] with the government increasingly pushing for a form of "black capitalism".[305] The government established the Industrial and Commercial Development Corporation to provide loans for black-owned businesses,[305] and secured a 51% share in the Kenya National Assurance Company.[307] In 1965, the government established the Kenya National Trading Corporation to ensure indigenous control over the trade in essential commodities,[308] while the Trade Licensing Act of 1967 prohibited non-citizens from involvement in the rice, sugar, and maize trade.[309] During the 1970s, this was expanded to cover the trade in soap, cement, and textiles.[308] Many Asians had retained British citizenship rather than taking on Kenyan citizenship and were affected by these measures, with their work permits not being renewed.[310] Between late 1967 and early 1968, growing numbers of Kenyan Asians migrated to Britain,[311] with a crisis emerging in February 1968 as large numbers of them sought to migrate quickly before a legal change revoked their right to do so.[312] Kenyatta was not sympathetic to those leaving, stating that "Kenya's identity as an African country is not going to be altered by the whims and malaises of groups of uncommitted individuals."[312]
