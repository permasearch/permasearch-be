More recently, Central City has most often been located in the state of Kansas.[1] Maps in Young Justice place Central City in Missouri across from Keystone City, Kansas. Additionally, the 2014 television series The Flash also places Central City in Missouri (although opening scenes show Portland, Oregon),[2] most explicitly in a letter sent to S.T.A.R. Labs in the episode "The Man in the Yellow Suit."[3]
