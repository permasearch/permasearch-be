Popoy turns to his friends Krizzy (Dimples Romana) and Kenneth (James Blanco). They point out that the breakup (of Popoy and Basha) was also hard on Basha, not just on him. "She was the only one brave enough to face the truth that there is something wrong with your relationship," Krizzy says. Kenneth suggests that Popoy was hurt because he couldn't bear to give Basha what she needed. The couple make Popoy realize that Basha needed to take care of herself first. Popoy admits he never stopped loving Basha but wonders if love is enough.
