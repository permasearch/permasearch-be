The success of Street Fighter II is credited with starting the fighting-game boom during the 1990s which inspired other game developers to produce their own fighting-game franchises, popularizing the genre, and setting off a renaissance for the arcade game industry in the early 1990s.[3] The game is widely considered among critics to be one of the greatest fighting games as well as one of the greatest video games of all time. It was then ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System platform, for which it became a long-lasting system-seller.[4] Its success led to a subseries of updated versions (see below), each offering additional features and characters over previous versions, as well as several home versions.
