Blame for lack of preparedness has been leveled at all levels of government. New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin has been criticized for not following the city's evacuation plan which called for the use of school buses to transport disadvantaged and elderly citizens out of the city. Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco was also criticized for not deploying the Louisiana National Guard sooner, although she did in fact deploy them before the hurricane hit and requested reinforcements from other states. Blanco asked for additional resources from the federal government, but refused to declare martial law or a state of emergency.[22] Disorganization began when the Louisiana Governor declined a proposal from the White House to put National Guard troops under the control of the federal government.[22] President George W. Bush and Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff were also criticized for failures on the federal level as well as with his leadership role.[23] FEMA chief Michael D. Brown admitted on the 1 year anniversary of landfall that "There was no plan" [3] and claimed that in the immediate aftermath of the disaster White House officials told him to lie to put a more positive spin on the Federal response.
