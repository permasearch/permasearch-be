According to Blankenship and Tobias, cameras lowered down the shaft into a cave recorded possible chests, human remains, wooden cribbing and tools; however, the images were unclear and none of the claims have been independently confirmed. The shaft later collapsed, and the excavation was again abandoned. The shaft was later re-dug to 181 feet (55Â m), reaching bedrock, but work was halted due to lack of funds and the collapse of the partnership.[21] Divers sent to the bottom of Borehole 10-X in 2016 found no artifacts.
