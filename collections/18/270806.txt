The song originated between vocalist Nicholas Petricca and guitarist Eli Maiman, who first developed the verse and found something infectious about it.[4] The following weekend, Petricca went to a party named Funky Soul Saturday at The Echo in Echo Park, Los Angeles while feeling frustrated with the writing process.[5] The song is largely based on that night: "We were at the bar, and it was taking forever to get a drink. I was frustrated because there was great music playing and I wanted to be out there," he remembered.[6] His girlfriend, in "a backless dress and some beat up sneaks", abruptly invited him to dance with her, inspiring the song's title.[4] Petricca later went home to work on the song, and incorporated his experiences into the song's lyrics. After creating the song's main refrain, he began picturing himself in high school: an "incredibly uncomfortable, awkward adolescent dude," he imagined the song as "an anthem for the dork who is 100 percent me."[4] In an interview with American Songwriter, he summarized the song's theme as "Encouraging people to let go of whatever it is thatâ€™s bothering you and get into your body and out of your head."[4]
