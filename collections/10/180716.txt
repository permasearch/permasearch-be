After weeks of negotiation, a debate between Salmond and Darling was arranged.[135] The programme, titled as Salmond & Darling: The Debate, was broadcast by STV on 5 August 2014.[378] The debate, moderated by Bernard Ponsonby, saw both politicians make opening statements and cross-examine each other before taking questions from the audience. At the end of the clash, they were both given the chance to make a closing speech.[379][380] Both campaign groups claimed victory in the debate.[381] A snap poll conducted by ICM stated Darling won the debate by 56% to 44%.[382] In his analysis of the ICM poll, Professor John Curtice detected little movement either way as a result of the debate.[383]
