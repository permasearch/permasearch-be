An apparent tradeoff has been described between adaptation to high temperature and low pH; relatively few examples are known that are tolerant of the extremes of both environments (pH < 2, growth temperature > 80Â°C).[1]:602 Many thermoacidophilic archaea have aerobic or microaerophilic metabolism,[1]:602 although obligately anaerobic examples (e.g. the Acidilobales) have also been identified.[5]
