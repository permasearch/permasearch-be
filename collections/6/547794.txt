Spanish, Tagalog and English versions of the national anthem have been given official status throughout Philippine history. However, only the most recent and current "Filipino" version is officially recognized by law. The Flag and Heraldic Code, approved on February 12, 1998 specifies, Lupang Hinirang, "The National Anthem shall always be sung in the national language within or without the country";[15] violation of the law is punishable by a fine and imprisonment.
