The Comfort is powered by either the 2L diesel engine (5L for the Singapore market, LXS10) or the 2-litre 3Y-PE LPG engine (YXS10). The Japanese model has fender mirrors and an automatic (driver-activated) rear door. The Crown Comfort is popular among taxicab in Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore in the past, but is gradually falling out of favour as better-appointed vehicles become available at competitive cost.
