R v Panel on Take-overs and Mergers, ex parte Datafin plc[1] is a 1986 case decided by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales involving United Kingdom company law and administrative law, which marked a major development in the scope of judicial review in English law. It established that the decisions of a private body exercising public functions may be amenable to judicial review. Before Datafin, only bodies established by statute were so amenable, while private bodies could only be sued for their actions in contract or tort law.
