In Indian English, the word is used both as an attributive and non-attributive noun, and with either a marked ("-s") or unmarked plural, as in: "1 lakh people" or "1 lakh of people"; "200 lakh rupees"; "5 lakh of rupees"; "rupees 10 lakhs"; or "5 lakhs of rupees". In the abbreviated form, usage such as "₹‍5L" (for "rupees 5 lakhs") is common.[citation needed] In this system of numeration 100 lakh is called one crore and is equal to 10 million.
