One of Simpson's creations stands in front of the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland. Simpson was named the 2012 Arts and Culture winner of Southern Living's Heroes of the New South Awards.[34] Simpson's farm contains some thirty to forty whirligigs at any given time, some of which reach fifty feet in height. They are made from castoff metal machine parts and an assortment of odd and colorful pieces of various origins.,[35]  He sells smaller versions to the public, but only from his farm.
