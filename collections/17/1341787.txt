In April, tapes from the earlier Berlin sessions were stolen after the band reportedly left them in a hotel room, and they were subsequently leaked before the album was finished.[43] The tapes' demos were bootlegged into a three-disc collection dubbed the "Salome - The [Axtung Beibi] Outtakes", named for a song that was prominently featured in the collection but did not make the album's final cut. The release is considered the most famous bootleg of U2 material.[44] Bono dismissed the leaked demos as "gobbledygook", and the Edge likened the situation to "being violated".[45] The leak shook U2's confidence and soured their collective mood for a few weeks.[46]
