In the second round City travelled to Belgians Lierse S.K., and won the first leg 3–0, with two goals from Francis Lee and one from Colin Bell.[12] The home leg produced a 5–0 win, a club record for European competition that as of 2012 has still not been exceeded.[13] The first leg of the quarter-final, at Académica de Coimbra, took place three days before Manchester City were due to play in the League Cup final. Malcolm Allison rejected the prevailing British football orthodoxy, in which domestic competitions took priority, by saying he would rather win in Portugal than in the League Cup final.[14] The match finished goalless. At Maine Road, extra-time was required for Manchester City to break down the stubbornly defensive Coimbra. Tony Towers scored the only goal of the tie with a minute of extra-time remaining.[15]
