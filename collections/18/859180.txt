Australian Survivor was initially scheduled to air twice a week, with new episodes airing on Sunday and Monday at 7:30pm.[17] However, following the first week, a third weekly episode — set to air Tuesdays at 7:30pm — was added to the schedule. The move was a means to both increase the exposure to the series to potential viewers and to increase the competitiveness of Ten's Tuesday schedule following low ratings for the previous programs airing in the 7:30pm slot, Modern Family and Life in Pieces.[18][19]
