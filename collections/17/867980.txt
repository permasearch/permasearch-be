Upon arrival on Homeworld, the group is surprised to be greeted by a large crowd of cheering Gems. Although Yellow and Blue intend to speak with White first to try to defuse any possible backlash, White Diamond's Pearl (Christine Ebersole) unexpectedly appears and spirits Steven away before anyone can react. Steven is brought to White Diamond (also voiced by Ebersole), who welcomes "Pink Diamond" back in a patronizing tone without giving him the opportunity to speak, and sends him away to a pink isolated room.
