Newton's three laws of dynamics and theory of gravity were published in his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica in 1687. Newton's theoretical and mathematical advances influenced tables by Edmund Halley published in 1693 and 1749 (McCarthy & Seidelmann 2009, pp. 26-28) and provided the underpinnings of all solar system models until Albert Einstein's theory of General relativity in the 20th century.
