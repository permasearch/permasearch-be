In the second-season finale "UnmAsked", the first "A" is revealed to be Mona Vanderwaal, who wanted revenge on the Liars for not preventing Alison's bullying and slowly distancing Hanna away from her. During a fight with Spencer, Mona ends up falling off a cliff and is then found by the authorities and admitted to the Radley Sanitarium, a local psychiatric hospital. During the final scene of the episode, a nurse comes in to alert Mona that she has a visitor and someone walks inside her room in what it looks like a red trench coat, appearing to be the same one worn by Alison DiLaurentis in her Vivian Darkbloom disguise. Mona proceeds to tell the unseen visitor that she did everything they asked her to.
