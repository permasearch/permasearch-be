In the United States, Charmed premiered on The CW on October 14, 2018.[55] It airs on Sunday nights at 9:00 pm, with Supergirl as its lead-in at 8:00 pm. The pairing of Charmed and Supergirl returned the network to original programming on Sunday evenings for the first time since the 2008â€“09 television season.[4] The CW president Mark Pedowitz explained, "We wanted to have an established show on Sunday night. We wanted name value with Charmed on there. We felt that it was two shows that are empowered women. We were making a statement that we were not kidding, that we're not phoning it in on Sunday night, that we were going to compete."[56]
