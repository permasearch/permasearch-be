PCR usually generates blunt-ended PCR products, but note that PCR using Taq polymerase can add an extra adenine (A) to the 3' end of the PCR product. This property may be exploited in TA cloning where the ends of the PCR product can anneal to the T end of a vector. TA ligation is therefore a form of sticky end ligation. Blunt-ended vectors may be turned into vector for TA ligation with dideoxythymidine triphosphate (ddTTP) using terminal transferase.
