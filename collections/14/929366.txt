Before the states reorganization in the year 1956, planning commission on 27 July 1951 conducted a meeting of the then Godavari river basin states Bombay state, Hyderabad state, Madras state and Madhya Pradesh state excluding Orissa state to discuss and finalize the Godavari river water utilization among the riparian states. The memorandum of agreement (page 105 of draft GWDT report) was prepared and later ratified by the participant states. This agreement says that the water allocations shall be reviewed after 25 years (i.e. 27 July 1976).  Since the old agreement is about to lapse shortly,  all five states of Godavari river basin (including Orissa) signed a new agreement on 19 December 1975 relating to the sanction and clearance of the projects in accordance with certain bilateral agreements entered between them after the GWDT formation.
