Since the implementation of the Schengen rules, border posts have been closed (and often entirely removed) between participating countries; that and the pro forma borders are the subject of a photo-journalistic art project.[100]  The Schengen Borders Code requires participating states to remove all obstacles to free traffic flow at internal borders.[101] Thus, road, rail and air passengers no longer have their identity checked by border guards when travelling between Schengen countries, although security controls by carriers are still permissible.[102] Travellers should still bring a passport or national identity card, as one may be required.
