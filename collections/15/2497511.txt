The original warthog had a homing beacon and remote control system linked to Lopez. This system is accidentally activated in Season 2 when Church, then possessing Lopez, and Tucker attempt to activate Lopez's repair sequence. It was during this period that the warthog spoke. Burns suggests that, like Sheila, the vehicle was originally going to be a full-blown character and maintain a personality throughout the series, in a parody of Speed Buggy. However, this idea was abandoned shortly after the remote control gag.[9]
