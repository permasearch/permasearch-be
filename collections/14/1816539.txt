Commonly, in various pressor reflexes, the central chemoreceptors, which transform chemical signals into action potentials, and the baroreceptors, which sense pressure changes of the carotid sinuses, work together to increase or decrease blood pressure. However, chemoreceptors do not play a role in the Cushing reflex. Thus, even in the presence of sympathetic stimulation from the brain, which would normally produce tachycardia, there is in fact bradycardia.[18]
