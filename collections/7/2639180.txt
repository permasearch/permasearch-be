Purchasing a level in a skill makes the character an expert in it. Skill levels can be purchased for five points times the level for career skills, with the additional cost of five additional points for non-career skills. For instance, buying level one in athletics skill would cost no points if it was a selected career or specialty skill during character creation, 5 points (5 x 1 = 5) if it was a non-selected career skill during or after character creation, and 10 points (5 x 1 [+5] = 10) if it was a non-career skill. Buying level two would cost 10 points (5 x 2 = 10) for a selected or non-selected career skill and 15 points (5 x 2 [+5] = 15) for a non-career skill. Skills have a maximum level of five. Regular Skill rolls use a yellow 12-sided proficiency die per Skill level in the place of a green ability die. It can also add an ability die if the skill level is higher than the character's attribute level. For instance, a character with a level of four in computers skill and a level of 5 in Intellect would roll four Proficiency dice and one Ability die. However, a character with a level of five in computers skill and a level of 4 in intellect would still roll four Proficiency dice and 1 Ability die rather than five Proficiency dice.
