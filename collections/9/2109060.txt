On May 4, 2013, Hill released her first official single in over a decade, "Neurotic Society (Compulsory Mix)".[102] She later published a message on her Tumblr describing how she was "required to release [it] immediately, by virtue of the impending legal deadline."[102] The release received some criticism for lyrics that appeared to tie societal decay to certain LGBT social movements.[103] Hill responded that the song was not targeted at any particular group but was instead focused on anyone hiding behind neurotic behavior.[104] Following a deal with Sony Music, which involves Hill creating a new record label within the company, Hill was said to be scheduled to release her first album in fifteen years during 2013.[102]
