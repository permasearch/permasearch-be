Sauk City restaurateurs and spouses George and Ruth Culver started their fast food careers as the owners of an A&W on Phillips Boulevard (U.S. Highway 12) in 1961.[2][3] In 1968, they purchased a resort-styled restaurant at Devil's Lake called The Farm Kitchen. Their son, Craig Culver, worked for a local McDonald's right out of college in 1973.[4] After selling their restaurants and quitting their jobs, George, Ruth, Craig and his wife Lea opened the first Culver’s Frozen Custard and ButterBurgers on July 18, 1984. Craig led the company from its inception until 2015.[4][5]
