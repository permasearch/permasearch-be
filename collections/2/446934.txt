A young Mormon missionary named Kirk Anderson went missing in 1977, in Ewell, Surrey, after he was abducted from the steps of a meetinghouse of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.[1] A few days later a freed Anderson made a report to the police that he had been abducted, driven to Devon, and imprisoned against his will, chained to a bed in a cottage, where Joyce Bernann McKinney (b. August 1949) — a former (1973) Miss Wyoming World[2][3][4][5] (as Joy McKinney[6]) — had abducted, attempted to seduce, and then raped him.[7][dead link][8] The case became known by many sobriquets, including "The Mormon sex in chains case" and "The Case of the Manacled Mormon."
