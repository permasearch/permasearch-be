Stephanie effectively moves into Leonard's and Sheldon's apartment, though Leonard does not acknowledge this. Stephanie gives Sheldon a physical examination as he claims to have tinnitus. Penny, initially unaware of Leonard's new relationship, shows up in the guys' apartment, and then searches Leonard's room with him, discovering various signs that Stephanie is indeed living with him. After Stephanie buys Leonard new clothes that he later hates, he realizes that his relationship with Stephanie is moving too fast for him. He repeatedly tries to tell Stephanie to move out, but each time she diverts him by initiating sex. Meanwhile, Sheldon sneaks into the hospital to test himself, as his tinnitus has not stopped. When Leonard next returns to the apartment, Stephanie has diagnosed Sheldon with a fake larynx inflammation and instructed him not to speak at all, a procedure she calls a "Sheldonectomy".
