How to Get Away with Murder was renewed by ABC for a fifth season on May 11, 2018,[13] to premiere on September 27, 2018.[14] The season will most likely consist of fifteen episodes due to a deal made with Davis that the series would have only 15 or 16 episodes per season.[15][16] In July 2018, series creator and showrunner Peter Nowalk told Deadline Hollywood his plans for the fifth season, confirming that the wedding between Jack Falahee and Conrad Ricamora's characters would take place, as well as a flashback episode further exploring the marriage between Viola Davis and Tom Verica's characters Annalise and Sam Keating. Additionally, he stated that the season's flashforwards are expected to be "twisty, and more fun," and tonally different.[17]
