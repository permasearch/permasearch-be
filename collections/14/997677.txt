The High Court enjoys "inherent jurisdiction", which means that it derives its powers from common law (although statutory law does modify these powers). It is due to this inherent jurisdiction that the High Court may hear any matter, whereas lower courts are more limited. Inherent jurisdiction will be exercised in order to prevent abuse of the law, which ultimately exists to properly facilitate the administration of justice. It should be noted that inherent jurisdiction was subsumed under section 173 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa: courts now cannot exercise jurisdiction beyond the ambit of the Constitution.[4]
