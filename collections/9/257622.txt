The series is set during the Great Depression of the 1930s, in the fictional small mining town of New Bedford in Northern Ontario. The family drama followed the members of the Bailey family as they lived through a time marked by hardship. Wind at My Back was loosely based on the books of Max Braithwaite, Never Sleep Three in a Bed and The Night We Stole the Mounties Car.
