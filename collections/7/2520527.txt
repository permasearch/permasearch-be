Plautdietsch, a Low German dialect, is spoken by "Russian" Mennonites, who immigrated mostly to Kansas in the mid 1870. These Mennonites tended to slowly assimilate into the mainstream society over several Generations, but Plautdietsch speaking Mennonite immigrants mainly from Mexico, where there is no assimilation, invigorated Plautdietsch in Kansas. Plautdietsch speaking Mennonite migrants from Mexico formed a new settlement in Seminole, Texas in 1977. In 2016 there were about 6,000 Plautdietsch speakers around Seminole.[19]
