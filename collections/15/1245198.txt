Service dogs do not only help owners with disabilities, but they also help emotionally. There have been experiments that show evidence that service dog owners have an improved social life while owning a service dog. This is very important when discussing children that own service dogs. Improving someoneâ€™s social life includes more friendly glances/conversations and more smiles directed their way.[9]
