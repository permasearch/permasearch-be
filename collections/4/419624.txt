For purposes of counting "official" SEC team championships in baseball, men's and women's basketball, soccer, softball, men's and women's tennis, and volleyball, the SEC currently only includes regular season team championships, not tournament championships. The Gators have won an additional 63 SEC tournament titles in these sports which are not included in Florida's total of 233 SEC team championships.
