The dates of Thales' life are not exactly known, but are roughly established by a few datable events mentioned in the sources. According to Herodotus (and as determined by modern methods) Thales predicted the solar eclipse of May 28, 585 BC.[11] Diogenes Laërtius quotes the chronicle of Apollodorus of Athens as saying that Thales died at the age of 78 during the 58th Olympiad (548–545 BC) and attributes his death to heat stroke while watching the games.
