For example, when downloading a web page, the packets of web page data travel over optical fiber Internet lines directly to the DSLAM at the neighborhood telephone exchange.  At the DSLAM they are split into as many as 247 parallel data streams.  Each is modulated onto a separate carrier signal and sent through a separate frequency channel over the subscriber's telephone line to the DSL modem.  The modem demodulates the carrier, extracting the data stream from each carrier signal, performs error correction, puts the data together again in the proper order, and sends it to the computer over the Ethernet line.
