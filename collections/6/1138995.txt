The importance of legitimacy has decreased considerably in Western countries with the increasing economic independence of women, the sexual revolution of the 1960s and  1970s, the fall of totalitarian regimes, and declining influence of Christian churches on family life.  Births outside marriage represent the majority in many countries in Western Europe and in former European colonies.  In many Western-derived cultures, stigma based on parents' marital status, and use of the word "bastard", are now considered offensive.
