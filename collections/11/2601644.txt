Learning from the Doctor, Jenny begins to adapt her ideology. Moffett explained that her character: "begins to become much more like the Doctor, and much more like a Time[lord],"[8] describing the episode as "a journey,"[10] over the course of which Jenny learns to use her fighting skills "in the right way," developing morals as she grows on a personal level.[10] Executive producer Russell T Davies has discussed the Doctor's initial reluctance to accept Jenny as his daughter, explaining, "It's awful for him in that this daughter is everything he wouldn't be; she's a soldier, she's got military protocols downloaded into her brain, she can fight, and she wants to fight, that's the important thing, that she thinks killing is fine."[10] Greenhorn asserts that as the character develops, "You can see the Doctorishness in her. And you can see that actually, the reason he would warm to that is because he begins to recognise there are elements in her that are strong in him as well."[10] Concluding the character's development over the course of the episode, Moffett surmised, "By the end of it, they've both realised that they want to be a little bit more like the other one, and admire that in each other."[10]
