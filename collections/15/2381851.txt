At some point during the 1980s the auditorium/arts wing, library, and tech wings were renovated to add more music rooms to the school to facilitate the school's large music program. The old music room which shared space with the back section of the stage was removed, the old art and drama rooms were turned into two new music rooms, as well as a group practice room was turned into a keyboard lab for a key board classes (which has since been turned back into a group practice space). The art rooms were moved to two new classrooms added at the back of the library, making it significantly smaller, and the drama room was moved to the old mechanical drafting room.
