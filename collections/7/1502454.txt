Other mechanoreceptors than cutaneous ones include the hair cells, which are sensory receptors in the vestibular system of the inner ear, where they contribute to the auditory system and equilibrioception. In addition to this, mechanoreceptors aid Dionaea muscipula Ellis (Venus Fly Trap) in capturing sizable[10] prey effectively.[11]
