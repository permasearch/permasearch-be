Fox Entertainment Group announced its plans for FXX on March 28, 2013 for a planned launch on September 2, 2013, intending for FXX to be available in approximately 74 million American homes "in year one".[3][4] In the months leading up to the launch, Fox was generally coy about definitively confirming where FXX would be placed on cable/satellite channel lineups, though Fox officials had indicated off the record that the plan was to indeed replace Fox Soccer with the new network.[10]
