Guatemala City is divided into 22 zones in accordance with the urban layout plan designed by Ra√∫l Aguilar Batres. Each zone has its own streets and avenues, facilitating navigation within the city. Zones are numbered 1 through 25. However, numbers 20, 22 and 23 have not been designated to zones, thus these zones do not exist within the city proper.[5]
