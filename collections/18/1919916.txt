On December 2, 1954, the Senate voted 67â€“22 to censure McCarthy, effectively eradicating his influence, though not expelling him from office.[41] McCarthy continued to chair the Subcommittee on Investigations until January 3, 1955, the day the 84th United States Congress was inaugurated; Senator John L. McClellan (D-Arkansas) replaced McCarthy as chairman.
