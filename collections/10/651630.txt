In the mid-season premiere "Nebraska", Carl's new colder mindset continues to develop following the reveal of Sophia as a walker. In the episode "Triggerfinger", Carl learns that Lori is pregnant. In the episode "Judge, Jury, Executioner", Carl denies the idea of heaven and shows disrespect towards Sophia's mother Carol for mentioning that Sophia was in heaven. Carl finds a walker stuck in mud in the woods and taunts it, but the walker frees itself and starts chasing him; this walker later finds Dale and mortally wounds him. In the season's penultimate episode "Better Angels", Carl saves his father by shooting Shane, who had become a walker. In the season finale "Beside the Dying Fire", Carl's gunshot attracts a horde of walkers and so the group is ultimately driven off the farm.
