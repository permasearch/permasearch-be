“The Big Miner stands as a tribute to the tens of thousands of gold prospectors who frequented regional Victoria during the second half of the nineteenth century. The statue stands 8 meters tall (6 meters of statue on a 2 metre base). It has been hand sculptured from polystyrene and has a 1.5 ton steel frame. The 2 metre high concrete base is approximately 15 tons. It was designed by Wayne Johnston of 3D Theme Concepts and sculptured by Steve Bristow. Ballarat Mayor, David Vendy, officially unveiled the statue on 1 December 2006.”
