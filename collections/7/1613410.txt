After leaving the NBA, Bogues worked in the real estate business until August 3, 2005, when he was named head coach of the Charlotte Sting in the Women's National Basketball Association, despite a lack of coaching experience. (Notably, he was shorter than all of his playersâ€”at 5'6", Helen Darling was the shortest Sting player.) Bogues led the Sting to a 14-30 record before the team folded in January 2007.
