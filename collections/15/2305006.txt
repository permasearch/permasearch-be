In 1963, de la Renta turned to Diana Vreeland, the editor-in-chief of Vogue for advice, saying that what he really wanted was to "get into ready to wear, because that's where the money is".[12] Vreeland replied, "Then go to Arden because you will make your reputation faster. She is not a designer, so she will promote you. At the other place, you will always be eclipsed by the name of Dior."[13] De la Renta proceeded to work for Arden for two years in New York City before he went to work for Jane Derby, an American fashion house.[14] When Derby died in August 1965, de la Renta took over the label.[15]
