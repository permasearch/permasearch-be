The flag has a rectangular 3:2 format. Its color is red, which originally represented the blood of the martyrs of the 13 July 1931 demonstration, but later came to symbolise workers and labourers. In the middle, a white plough further symbolises the peasants. Next to the staff, three vertical white stripes represent the three regions of Jammu, Kashmir valley and Ladakh.[4]
