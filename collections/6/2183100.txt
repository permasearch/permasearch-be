The third generation Mercury Grand Marquis saw an extensive update for the 1998 model year. Although it bore a strong resemblance to the successful "Aero" style of the 1992-1997 model, only the roof and the doors were identical between them. The front and rear fascia were redesigned, with a new grille, hood, bumpers, headlamps/taillamps, and side mirrors.[5] The interior carried over from the 1995 update, with Ford's new two-spoke steering wheel replacing the previous four-spoke design.
