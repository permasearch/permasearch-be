Politically, blacks have made substantial strides in the postâ€“civil rights era. Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson ran for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in 1984 and 1988, attracting more blacks into politics and unprecedented support and leverage for blacks in politics. In 2008, Barack Obama was elected as the first President of the United States of African descent.
