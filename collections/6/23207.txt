The only true animatronic in the third game is Springtrap, who looks like a decayed golden version of Bonnie.[44] Additionally, Freddy, Chica, Foxy, Balloon Boy, Mangle, and The Puppet return as hallucinations (or "phantoms"),[45] and although their jumpscares don't kill the player, they can disable certain features that are essential for the player to complete the night easily.
