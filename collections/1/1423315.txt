Machine components, including electricity and the metal they are composed of, are vital to Aloy's survival; she can loot their remains for crafting resources.[7][10] Ammo, resource satchels, pouches, quivers; resistance, antidotes, health potions, and traps can all be crafted.[11] Weapons have modification slots for dealing more damage.[12] Aloy wears a Focus, a small head piece that scans machines to determine their susceptibilities,[13] identify their location, their level, and the nature of loot they will drop.[4] One machine, the Stalker, can enable cloaking technology to avert the gaze of Aloy's Focus scan.[14]
