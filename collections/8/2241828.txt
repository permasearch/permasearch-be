A cooperative game is given by specifying a value for every coalition. Formally, the coalitional game consists of a finite set of players     N   {\displaystyle N}  , called the grand coalition, and a characteristic function     v :  2  N   →  R    {\displaystyle v:2^{N}\to \mathbb {R} }   [4] from the set of all possible coalitions of players to a set of payments that satisfies     v ( ∅ ) = 0   {\displaystyle v(\emptyset )=0}  . The function describes how much collective payoff a set of players can gain by forming a coalition, and the game is sometimes called a value game or a profit game. The players are assumed to choose which coalitions to form, according to their estimate of the way the payment will be divided among coalition members.
