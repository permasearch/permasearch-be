The Eastern Orthodox Church holds that "there is a state beyond death where believers continue to be perfected and led to full divinization".[301][citation needed] Although some Orthodox[who?] have described this intermediate state as purgatory, others distinguish it from aspects associated with it in the West: at the Council of Ferraraâ€“Florence, the Orthodox Bishop Mark of Ephesus argued that there are in it no purifying fires.[304]
