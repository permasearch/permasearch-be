The first recording of the song was by Etienne Paree in 1949 in America. New York radio host Gene Rayburn arranged for Teresa Brewer to record it, and it was released as the B side to Copenhagen. Rayburn then promoted Music! Music! Music! on his radio show, thus creating the hit.[1] Then it was recorded by many artists on various labels.
