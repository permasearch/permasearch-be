David Sims of The Onion A.V. Club liked that "the successful-joke-per-minute ratio of 30 Rock is still pretty high, and I got quite a few laughs out of a lot of the random gags," but feels that the series suffers from "struggling to make the onscreen insanity at all relatable." He gave this episode and the one before it a combined grade of B-.[3]
