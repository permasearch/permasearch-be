An administrator brought in by the City of Boston to evaluate and improve efficiency at the hospital. She frequently clashed with Westphall, Auschlander and Craig, particularly when she tried to prevent Craig from performing a heart transplant during season 2. She was romantically involved with Bobby Caldwell for a time, though he ended the affair towards the end of season 2. Soon afterwards, she was removed from her position by the City. Initially considered an adversary of the hospital administration, she eventually gains their respect. So much so, that when Dr. Auschlander was looking for assistant in season 3, he ultimately gives up the interview process and hires Joan. She would appear occasionally throughout the season. She would appear once more during season 4 in 1986. Now blissfully engaged to a man with a family, Bobby Caldwell called in to see her with the bad news that he'd recently tested HIV positive and, as one of his former partners, recommended that she get herself tested for the virus. Though horrified at the prospect, she was relieved to find out she was not infected.
