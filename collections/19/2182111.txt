Graham was born in 1917 into a wealthy family in New York City, to Agnes Elizabeth (nÃ©e Ernst) and Eugene Meyer. Graham's father was a financier and, later, a public official; her grandfather was Marc Eugene Meyer; and her great-grandfather was rabbi Joseph Newmark. Her father bought The Washington Post in 1933 at a bankruptcy auction. Graham's mother was a bohemian intellectual, art lover, and political activist in the Republican Party, who shared friendships with people as diverse as Auguste Rodin, Marie Curie, Thomas Mann, Albert Einstein and Eleanor Roosevelt, and worked as a newspaper reporter at a time when journalism was an uncommon profession among women. Graham's father was Jewish and her mother was Lutheran, from a family of German descent.[1][2][3][4] Along with her four siblings, Graham was baptized as a Lutheran but attended an Episcopal church.[5] Her siblings included Florence Meyer, Eugene Meyer III (Bill), Ruth Meyer and Elizabeth Meyer.
