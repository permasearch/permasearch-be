The Viluy Large igneous province covers most of the present day north-eastern margin of the Siberian Platform. The triple-junction rift system was formed during the Devonian Period; the Viluy rift is the western remaining branch of the system and two other branches form the modern margin of the Siberian Platform. Volcanic rocks are covered with post Late Devonian–Early Carboniferous sediments.[35] Volcanic rocks, dyke belts, and sills that cover more than 320 × 103 km2, and a gigantic amount of magmatic material (more than 1000 × 103 km3) formed in the Viluy branch.[35]
