Between 1947 and 1973, France went through a booming period (5% per year in average) dubbed by Jean Fourasti√© Trente Glorieuses, title of a book published in 1979. The economic growth is mainly due to productivity gains and to an increase in the number of working hours. Indeed, the working population was growing very slowly, the baby boom being offset by the extension of the time dedicated to studies. Productivity gains came from the catching up with the United States. In 1950, the average income in France was 55% of an American and reached 80% in 1973.  Among the major nations, only Japan and Spain had faster growth in this era than France.[99][100]
