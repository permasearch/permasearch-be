Gasoline fuel was a problem for the US Army Sherman tanks during World War II since a direct hit would often ignite them. Crews nicknamed them "Ronsons" after the lighter which advertised "lights up first every time". Their advantage was the simplicity of producing these tanks, allowing the allies to have a numerical advantage from 14 to 1 to 50 to 1 over German tanks.[107]
