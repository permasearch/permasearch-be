A new configuration involving a flashing yellow arrow[7] has been introduced and is gaining acceptance across the US. This configuration prevents "yellow trap" when properly implemented. First observed in Oregon, but was started in Michigan and then spread elsewhere in the United States, like Fullerton, California;[8] Lawrence, Kansas; Tyler, Texas; Gainesville, Florida; across North Carolina and Poughkeepsie, New York; and New York Cityâ€”the signals displaying a flashing yellow arrow are being phased in to replace the 5-lamp protected/permissive signals that are still in widespread use.
