The word kopje in Dutch means "small head" which perfectly describes the rock formations that seem to pop out in the savanna. Kopjes are homes for well adapted animals. The San Diego Zoo's Kopje Woodland in Africa Rocks is home to animals including klipspringers, rock hyrax, and the dwarf mongoose. Each animal has well adapted feet that allow them to cling to the rocks. The exhibit also includes these animals' main predator the bateleur as well as meerkats, servals and the red-leaved rock fig, a tree species that manages to grow wherever its seeds disperse including the rocky kopje.[67]
