For example, in the enzyme-catalyzed reactions of glycolysis, accumulation phosphoenol is catalyzed by pyruvate kinase into pyruvate. Alanine is an amino acid which is synthesized from pyruvate also inhibits the enzyme pyruvate kinase during glycolysis. Alanine is a non-competitive inhibitor, therefore it binds away from the active site to the substrate in order for it to still be the final product.[6]
