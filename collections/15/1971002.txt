Orzan - The ruler of the Lost City of Khemir. Before the Cataclysm, he and his people relied on robots to do all their work and, even after their technology failed, many refused to change their way of life. But after being bitten by Cravex's Spider of Fear and having visions of his people's robot slaves turning on him, he realised that he was himself afraid of being enslaved. (Voiced by Peter Cullen)
