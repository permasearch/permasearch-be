Larson earned a total of seven spins in the second question round.[3] Since he was in third place, he got to play first at the "Big Board" and went to his pattern play, aiming for squares #4 and #8.[3] Larson quickly bumped his total to over $10,000. Early on, his pattern play was irregular, as he stopped four times on squares that did not follow his pattern: a trip to Kauai worth $1,636 in square #7, $700 and one spin in square #17, "Pick a Corner" in square #6 (where he was given the choice of $2,250 in square #1, $2,000 in square #10, or $1,500 and one spin in square #15, he chose $2,250), and a sailboat worth $1,015 in square #7.[3]
