Nelson Story decided to try for Montana and its lucrative market of gold miners in Virginia City, Montana and became part of the first ever cattle drive on the Bozeman Trail. He pointed his herd north for the long drive. With a large measure of courage and a large measure of luck he brought his cattle over the Bozeman Trail into Montana. At Fort Phil Kearny, between present day Buffalo and Sheridan, Wyoming, the U.S. Army ordered Story and his drovers to stop because of Indian problems. Story ignored the order, evaded the Army and continued the drive into Montana, encountering and fighting Sioux and Crow Indians along the way. Only one drover was killed by Indians. The feat would not be duplicated for another 4 years. Story and the herd arrived in what is now Livingston, Montana in December 1866 and established winter quarters for his men and cattle. Story's cattle established a thriving industry, and for at least two years he shrewdly bought and sold cattle to hungry miners for up to ten times the Texas price. In 1870, when the placer mining in Montana was starting to decline, Story and his ranch in the Paradise Valley had become the leading cattleman in the northern plains.[7][10] Some credit Story with naming the now famous Paradise Valley for its grand scenery and abundant wildlife.[11] This 1866 cattle drive inspired Larry McMurtry's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel Lonesome Dove.,[12][13]
