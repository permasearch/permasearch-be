During the Akkadian Empire (2334â€“2154 BC), the Assyrians, like all the Mesopotamians (and also the Sumerians), became subject to the dynasty of the city state of Akkad, centered in central Mesopotamia. The Akkadian Empire founded by Sargon the Great claimed to encompass the surrounding "four quarters". The region of Assyria, north of the seat of the empire in central Mesopotamia, had also been known as Subartu by the Sumerians, and the name Azuhinum in Akkadian records also seems to refer to Assyria proper.[23] The Sumerians were eventually absorbed into the Akkadian (Assyro-Babylonian) population.[15][16]
