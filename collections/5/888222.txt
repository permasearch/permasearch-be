The pathway by which hepatic viruses cause viral hepatitis is best understood in the case of hepatitis B and C.[14] The viruses do not directly cause apoptosis (cell death).[14][51] Rather, infection of liver cells activates the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system leading to an inflammatory response which causes cellular damage and death.[14][51] Depending on the strength of the immune response, the types of immune cells involved and the ability of the virus to evade the body's defense, infection can either lead to clearance (acute disease) or persistence (chronic disease) of the virus.[14] The chronic presence of the virus within liver cells results in multiple waves of inflammation, injury and wound healing that overtime lead to scarring or fibrosis and culminate in hepatocellular carcinoma.[51][52] Individuals with an impaired immune response are at greater risk of developing chronic infection.[14] Natural killer cells are the primary drivers of the initial innate response and create a cytokine environment that results in the recruitment of CD4 T-helper and CD8 cytotoxic T-cells.[53][54] Type I interferons are the cytokines that drive the antiviral response.[54] In chronic Hepatitis B and C, natural killer cell function is impaired.[53]
