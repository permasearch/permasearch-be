The present college results from the merger in June 1999 of Durham College of Agriculture and Horticulture (also known as Houghall College) and East Durham Community College in Peterlee (formerly known as Peterlee Tertiary College in the 1980s and Peterlee College since 1989). The former campus at the town centre on Burnhope Way (B1320) was originally Easington Technical College and the campus at Howletch was originally Peterlee Grammar School.
