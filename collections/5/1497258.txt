The sixth Sultan was Muiz-ud-din Bahram (معز الدین بہرام‬), who had the titular name of Sultan and reigned from 1240 to May 15, 1242. During his reign, the Chihalgani became disorderly and constantly bickered among each other. It was during this period of unrest that the Mongols invaded the Punjab and sacked Lahore. Muiz-ud-din Bahram was too weak to take any action against them, and the Chihalgani besiged him in the White Fort of Delhi and put him to death in 1242.
