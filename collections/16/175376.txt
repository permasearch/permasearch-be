Currently, 1,556 known species in the world have been identified as near extinction or endangered and are under protection by government law. This approximation, however, does not take into consideration the number of species threatened with endangerment that are not included under the protection of such laws as the Endangered Species Act. According to NatureServe's global conservation status, approximately thirteen percent of vertebrates (excluding marine fish), seventeen percent of vascular plants, and six to eighteen percent of fungi are considered imperiled.[15]:415 Thus, in total, between seven and eighteen percent of the United States' known animals, fungi and plants are near extinction.[15]:416 This total is substantially more than the number of species protected in the United States under the Endangered Species Act.
