The single became a hit in the summer and fall of 2002 in the United States. While "Hot in Herre" was peaking on the charts, radio stations already started to play "Dilemma" in July 2002. It quickly climbed up the US Billboard charts and replaced "Hot in Herre" at number one after seven weeks on the Hot 100, giving Nelly his second consecutive number one from Nellyville. The song had already reached number one on the Hot 100 before a video was ever shot as Nelly's record label did not expect the song to explode so fast and expected they could take their time with the video. The song made its debut on the Billboard charts the week of July 6, 2002, it opened at numbers 66 and 63 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay charts, respectively.[12] The next week, on July 13, 2002, it debuted at number 51 on the Radio Songs chart, it also opened at number 53 on the Hot 100 the same week.[13] After four weeks, on August 17, 2002, it reached number one on the Hot 100, staying there for ten weeks and remaining on the chart for 29 weeks.[14][15] With this song Nelly replaced himself from the top of the chart, his last single, Hot In Herre, dropped to number two while Dilemma moved from number two to number one.[16][17] The song also topped the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, Mainstream Top 40, Radio Songs and R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay charts.[18][19][20][21] While "Dilemma" exploded at urban contemporary, rhythmic contemporary and contemporary hit radio, it managed to crossover to urban adult contemporary radio stations such as KJLH Los Angeles which added "Dilemma" in rotation on the week of July 8, 2002, following a positive response from younger listeners.
