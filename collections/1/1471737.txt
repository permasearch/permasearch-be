The stylebook is updated annually by Associated Press editors, usually in June, and at this time edits and new entries may be added. In 2008, 200 new entries were added, including words and phrases like "podcast", "text messaging", "social networking" and "high-definition". The 2009 edition added the entries "Twitter" and "texting". This is done to keep the stylebook up to date with technological and cultural changes.
