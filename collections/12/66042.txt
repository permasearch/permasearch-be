Sports themes are also popular in manga for male readers.[97] These stories stress self-discipline, depicting not only the excitement of sports competition but also character traits the hero needs to transcend his limitations and to triumph.[97] Examples include boxing (Tetsuya Chiba’s 1968-1973 Tomorrow's Joe[105] and Rumiko Takahashi's 1987 One-Pound Gospel) and basketball (Takehiko Inoue’s 1990 Slam Dunk[106]).
