Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it true that the 1/2 in (1/2)mv^2 is a proportionality constant that only applies to the SI system of units? If you wanted to express kinetic energy in the british engineering system you would use (1.29e-3)mv^2 = KE in BTU's. This article makes it seem as if the formula for KE is derived when in fact it is an empirical formula. The only thing we know regardless of units is that KE is proportional to mv^2. I think it's important to try to make it clear where that 1/2 comes from. I got most of this information from the external link at the bottom of the article on the conservation of energy.--70.185.112.226 (talk) 22:33, 15 February 2009 (UTC)
