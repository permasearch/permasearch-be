Kripalani was also concerned with the privilege of parliament over the press. During Nehru's premiership, the Lok Sabha called the Chief Editor of the weekly Blitz, the well-known Russi Karanjia to the bar and admonished him for "denigration and defamation of a member of parliament" for calling Kriplani Cripple-loony. This was despite Karanjia's closeness to and Kripalani's estrangement from, Nehru.
