After a dentist presses charges against Mildred after she assaults him with his drill, Willoughby brings her in for questioning, and she denies hurting him. Willoughby then begins coughing up blood, forcing him to go to the hospital. While there, he realizes that he will die soon, and after he is discharged, he spends an eventful day with his wife Anne (Abbie Cornish) and two daughters before committing suicide. He leaves suicide notes for several people in Ebbing, including one to Mildred in which he explains that he secretly paid to keep the billboards up for another month in order to keep some attention on the case and to amuse himself by keeping the drama around them going after his passing.
