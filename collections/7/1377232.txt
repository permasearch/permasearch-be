Typically coal liquefaction processes are associated with significant CO2 emissions from the gasification process or as well as from generation of necessary process heat and electricity inputs to the liquefaction reactors,[9] thus releasing greenhouse gases that can contribute to anthropogenic global warming. Especially if coal liquefaction is conducted without any carbon capture and storage technologies.[19] There are technically feasible low-emission configurations of CTL plants.[20]
