However, nowhere in the New Testament is a Christian pastor (besides Christ) titled "hiereus," the distinctive Greek word for "priest," and thus its rendering into English is seen as an etymological corruption of the Greek word "presbuteros," which means "elder," and which is the word for the lead category of Christian leaders in the New Testament church,[17] under the Lord Jesus Christ, the great High Priest (archiereus). In the New Testament, it is taught that as Christ made the perfect sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins, then believers have direct access to the Father through Him, (Hebrews 10:19) with the only priesthood that is named under Christ in the church being that which consists of all believers.[18]
