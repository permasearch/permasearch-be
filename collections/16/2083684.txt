The stadium has approximately 14,000 on-site parking spaces (plus 12,000 adjacent spaces),[34] located in numerous lots that surround the stadium's 2,000 disabled parking spaces. The design improvement, featured for example in a Discovery program about this stadium, is zoning. Parking spaces for guests are zoned with preferred leaving directions, to achieve the fastest possible movement of traffic.[35]
