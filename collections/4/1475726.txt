In 2011 General Atlantic bought a 20 percent share of Kaspersky Lab for $200 million, with the expectation of helping the company go public. A few months later, the decision was made to keep the firm private and Kaspersky re-purchased the shares from General Atlantic.[26][27][28] This was followed by numerous executive departures in 2011 and 2014 regarding disputes over going public and over Eugene's management style respectively.[29]
