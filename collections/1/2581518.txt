There is a tendency for translations of Japanese names to be somewhat fanciful. For example, Shōkaku is often translated as "crane flying in heaven", but "flying crane" or "soaring crane" is a more accurate translation. Another fanciful translation is "land of divine mulberry trees" for Fusō — fuso was a Chinese name for a mythical tree supposed to grow to the east, hence an old poetic word for Japan.
