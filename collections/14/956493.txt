How one answers the first question largely depends on the answer to the second question: should we interpret the jar to function as a prison, or a pantry?[25] The jar certainly serves as a prison for the evils that Pandora released â€“ they only affect humanity once outside the jar. Some have argued that logic dictates, therefore, that the jar acts as a prison for Elpis as well, withholding it from the human race.[26] If one takes elpis to mean expectant hope, then the myth's tone is pessimistic: All the evils in the world were scattered from Pandora's jar, while the one potentially mitigating force, Hope, remains locked securely inside.[27]
