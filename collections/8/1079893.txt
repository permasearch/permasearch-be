Gandalf calls Tom Bombadil the eldest being in existence; this is evidenced by his Sindarin name Iarwain Ben-adar (Eldest and Fatherless). Dwarves called him Forn (Old Norse, meaning "Ancient" or "Belonging to the distant past"; in Icelandic it can also mean that he has magical abilities), Men Orald (compare to Dutch oeroud and German uralt, "ancient, very old"). All these names apparently mean "Eldest". Treebeard calls himself the eldest living being of Middle-earth and says that he was there before anyone else. However, Tolkien remarked in another context: "Treebeard is a character in my story, not me; and though he has a great memory and some earthy wisdom, he is not one of the Wise, and there is quite a lot he does not know or understand."[3] The apparent discrepancy has also been explained by Tolkien deliberately mirroring the self-contradictory textual traditions of real-world medieval texts.[6]
