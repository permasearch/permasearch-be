A black-and-white segment in the form of a narrated home movie, in which Red and Bill attempted to accomplish a task, try out a sport, or go on some adventure, invariably leading to slapstick comedy. Later in the series, other characters were featured, sometimes without Red or Bill. As the action occurred, Red narrated each adventure.
