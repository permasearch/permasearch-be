After Hanoi's withdrawal, the OCA said that Indonesia, China, and the United Arab Emirates were major candidates under consideration to host.[17] Indonesia was widely regarded as a favourite, since Surabaya was the runner-up of the previous bid,[18] and willing to do so if selected.[19] The Philippines[20] and India expressed their interest about hosting the Games, but India failed to submit a late bid because it was unable to get an audience with Prime Minister Narendra Modi after being given an extended deadline by the OCA.[21]
