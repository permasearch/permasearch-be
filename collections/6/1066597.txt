The Once Upon a Time Book is a book of fairy tales depicting the lives of the characters which in turn are past reality. Its original origins are unknown (it is hinted that the Author in question could either be male or female), however, one day in the cursed town of Storybrooke, school teacher Mary Margaret Blanchard (Snow White) comes across the book in her apartment. She gives the book to her student, Henry Mills to give him hope as he struggles with belonging after being adopted.[19] From reading the book, Henry becomes convinced that the people in the town are the characters from the book. His adoptive mother Regina Mills (the Evil Queen) is so concerned she begins having him see a therapist, Dr. Archie Hopper (Jiminy Cricket). Despite this, Henry never gives up on his ideas, and one day travels to Boston to locate his birth mother, Emma Swan, who he believes is the "savior" of Storybrooke. Amidst driving Henry back to Storybrooke, Henry tells Emma his beliefs in the book and that she is in it herself.[20] Regina later reads through the book and notices the torn out pages, questioning Henry about it. In an effort to bond with Henry, Emma decides the two must burn the missing pages of the book so that Regina does not see them.[21]
