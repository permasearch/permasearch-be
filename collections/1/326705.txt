Since 1986, Wigan has hosted an international jazz festival.[113] Wigan remains a centre of popular music for young people, with a number of alternative pubs/clubs in the town centre. The town also had a music collective which existed to promote the scene and help out local musicians and bands. They host bi-weekly gigs at The Tudor (closed 2014) and also host various other activities such as recording sessions and gig advice for young musicians.[114] Throughout the early 1990s The Den was a popular venue for bands with acts such as Green Day heading over to play.
