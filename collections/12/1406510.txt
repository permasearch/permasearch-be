Just curious.  Does anyone have any idea what this song is referring to?  I suppose it's something obvious to someone here.  It almost sounds like it's describing some sort of apocalypse such as the book of revelations, in a very militaristic way ("we'll watch them fall", "we will smoke them").  And yet something tells me Mr. Lovesexy Symbol is not exactly a Rapture-hoping evangelical member of the 700 Club...  so what the hell *does* this weirdass song mean?  -Kasreyn 10:12, 13 January 2006 (UTC)
