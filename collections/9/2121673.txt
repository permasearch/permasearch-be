After noticing the controversy surrounding the book and investigating complaints about the medical advice it gives to new parents,[19] Multnomah Books stopped publishing the text in September 2001.[20] They returned the book rights to GFI. Subsequent printings have been produced by Parent-Wise Solutions, an imprint formed by the Ezzos to publish their books.
