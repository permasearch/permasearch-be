Parliament can dismiss an outgoing Prime Minister and his cabinet by adopting a motion of no confidence against the government. In order for a motion to be initiated, it must be signed by at least a quarter of deputies and senators and for it to pass, a majority of deputies and senators must vote in favour of it. After a motion of no confidence is adopted, the Prime Minister and his Cabinet are officially dismissed and the President must designate an individual to form a new government.[6] Since 1989, three Prime Ministers have been dismissed following the adoption of a motion of no confidence: Emil Boc(2009)[7], Mihai RÄƒzvan Ungureanu(2012)[8] and Sorin Grindeanu(2017)[9].
