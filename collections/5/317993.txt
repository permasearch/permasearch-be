Upon arrival, they are taken hostage by a population of players controlled with redstone chips by the psychopathy artificial intelligence computer screen PAMA (Prototype: Autonomous Management Agent), who was created by redstone user Harper but, against Harper's will, controlled the population in order to "make them useful". Wanting to invade Jesse's territory and world, PAMA questions him and takes over Petra and Lukas, allowing it to see what they know. Jesse and Ivor escape PAMA with the help of Harper, who shows them her laboratory, where she reveals that she is an "old builder". They are soon attacked by PAMA controlled monsters, alongside the mind controlled Lukas and Petra. Through a stroke of luck, Jesse manages to destroy the redstone chips controlling some spiders, and either Lukas or Petra.
