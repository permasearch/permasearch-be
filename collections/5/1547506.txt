On April 16, 2014, Jay-Z and Eric Garcetti (the mayor of Los Angeles) held a press conference at Los Angeles City Hall and announced that the Made in America festival would take place not only in Philadelphia, but in Los Angeles as well during the 2014 Labor Day Weekend. The location of the Los Angeles festival would be Grand Park. "On Labor Day weekend we are going to celebrate our golden state of mind right here in LA with a sellout crowd right on the steps of city hall and into Grand Park," Garcetti said. "The 'Made in America Festival' will attract 50,000 fans Saturday and Sunday. Fans who will inject millions of dollars into the LA economy."[1] [12]
