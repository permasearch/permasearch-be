Larry Flick of Billboard called it a "charming rock ballad", where Adams "returns to the pensive, romantic tone of his record-breaking hit '(Everything I Do) I Do It for You'." Flick noted that the singer "excels at laying agile [instrumentation] for his gravelly, dramatic vocal delivery."[2] David Hiltbrand and Craig Tomashoff of People named it the best of the ballads on the album.[4] James Hunter of Rolling Stone named it a moodier "eloquent mall ballad,"[5] while Jan DeKnock of Chicago Tribune noted that "he really does shine brightest on [the] beautifully bittersweet [ballad]."[6]
