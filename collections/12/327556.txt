Illegal Immigrants and would-be asylum seekers have used the tunnel to attempt to enter Britain. By 1997, the problem had attracted international press attention, and by 1999, the French Red Cross opened the first migrant centre at Sangatte, using a warehouse once used for tunnel construction; by 2002, it housed up to 1,500Â people at a time, most of them trying to get to the UK.[121] In 2001, most came from Afghanistan, Iraq, and Iran, but Africa countries were also represented.[122]
