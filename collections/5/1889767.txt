Criticisms against the implementation living wage laws have taken similar forms to those against minimum wage. Economically, both can be analyzed as a price floor for labor. A price floor, if above the equilibrium price and thus effective, necessarily leads to a “surplus”. In the context of a labor market, this means that unemployment goes up as the number of employers willing to hire people at a “living wage” is below the number they would be willing to hire at the equilibrium wage price. As such, setting the minimum wage at a living wage has been criticized for possibly destroying jobs.[75][76] For more information, see price floor.
