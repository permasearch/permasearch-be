Natural gas traction is quite popular in Italy, due to the existence of a capillar distribution network for industrial use since the late 50s and a traditionally high retail price for petrol. As of April 2012 there were about 1173 filling stations, mainly located in the northern regions,[66] while the fleet reached 730,000 CNG vehicles at the end of 2010.[4]
