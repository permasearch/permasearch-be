Soon after, FIDE dropped the short knockout format for a World Championship and announced the FIDE World Chess Championship 2005, a double round robin tournament to be held in San Luis, Argentina between eight of the leading players in the world.

The tournament was convincingly won by the Bulgarian Veselin Topalov, and negotiations began for a Kramnikâ€“Topalov match to unify the title.
