Some solutions, like copper(II)chloride in water, change colour at a certain concentration because of changed conditions around the coloured ion (the divalent copper ion). For copper(II)chloride it means a shift from blue to green,[6] which would mean that monochromatic measurements would deviate from the Beer-Lambert law.
