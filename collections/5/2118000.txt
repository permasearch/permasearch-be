On a hunch, Holly calls a policeman (Mia's father) in the neighborhood. When he gets to Lola's house, he sees through a window the bloody floor and chair and breaks in. In an attempt to attract the policeman's attention, Brent makes noise by throwing objects at the doors, alerting the policeman of his presence. But when he opens the doors, Lola appears behind the policeman and Brent cannot say anything to warn him. Lola drives a meat cleaver into his face and the policeman falls down, dropping his gun. Brent attempts to shoot Lola, but she quickly moves out of the way where she finds Brent's necklace on the floor. She then informs Brent that she is going to go to his house and kill his mother, Carla for murdering her father, and Holly for breaking her heart. Brent notices a large pile of bones in the pit. That gives him the idea to pile up the dead bodies, and he manages to climb out.
