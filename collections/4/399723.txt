In 2001, Disney opened small, 60-foot parachute rides in two of its brand-new parks, named Jumpin' Jellyfish.  At Disney California Adventure Park there are two towers located in the park's Paradise Pier section.  In Tokyo DisneySea there are three towers in the indoor section of the park's Mermaid Lagoon.  Both rides are themed with "parachutes" resembling jellyfish, although they are simply for theming.  The rides both ascend and bounce down while pulled by the cables, and do not actually freefall like other parachute attractions.
