Cesare was suspected of murdering his brother Giovanni, but there is no clear evidence to confirm this. However, Giovanniâ€™s death cleared the path for Cesare to become a layman and gain the honors his brother received from their father, Pope Alexander VI.[10] Although Cesare had been a cardinal, he left the holy orders to gain power and take over the position Giovanni once held: a condottiero. He was finally married to French princess Charlotte d'Albret.
