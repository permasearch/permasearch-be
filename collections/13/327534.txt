Germany (DB) has since around 2005 tried to get permission to run train services to London. At the end of 2009, extensive fire-proofing requirements were dropped and DB received permission to run German Intercity-Express (ICE) test trains through the tunnel. In June 2013 DB was granted access to the tunnel.[80] In June 2014 the plans were shelved, because there are special safety rules that requires custom made trains (DB calls them Class 407).[81]
