The Maya ruins of Belize[1][2] include a number of well-known and historically important pre-Columbian Maya archaeological sites. Belize is considered part of the southern Maya lowlands of the Mesoamerican culture area, and the sites found there were occupied from the Preclassic (2000 BCEâ€“200 CE) until and after the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century.
