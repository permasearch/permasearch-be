As Blackburn Rovers were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the 2011â€“12 season, the East Lancashire derby took place in the Football League Championship for the first time since the name change (from First Division). The first fixture took place at Turf Moor on 2 December 2012. Unlike previous fixtures, the match received relatively low coverage by the media, although there was a large police presence at the game. Jordan Rhodes converted a Mauro Formica cross to give Rovers the lead 68 minutes in, a lead which was cancelled out by a late Sam Vokes header to salvage a point for the Clarets. It was Rovers however who salvaged a point in the reverse fixture on 17 March 2013, with David Dunn's 95th-minute equaliser cancelling out Jason Shackell's first half strike extending the Clarets' long wait for a victory over their rivals. Dunn's goal was the subject of much controversy in the aftermath of the match as replays showed he was clearly standing in an offside position. Although it was a number of yards offside, it was understandable how the referees assistant failed to give the decision. When the initial ball was played, Dunn was stood onside. However, as the ball traveled towards the Burnley box, Rovers midfielder Jason Lowe got a slight touch on the ball, flicking it on to Dunn, who had since moved into an offside position. Therefore, Dunn had received the ball in an offside position and the goal should have been disallowed. The referees assistant did not see Lowe's touch and therefore allowed the goal to stand.
