German verbs may be classified as either weak, with a dental consonant inflection, or strong, showing a vowel gradation (ablaut). Both of these are regular systems. Most verbs of both types are regular, though various subgroups and anomalies do arise. The only completely irregular verb in the language is sein (to be). although, textbooks for learners often class all strong verbs as irregular. There are more than 200 strong and irregular verbs, but there is a gradual tendency for strong verbs to become weak.[citation needed]
