The children of both government and private slaves were born slaves.[107] Government slaves could be granted freedom by the emperor if they were deemed too elderly, if the emperor pitied them, or if they committed a meritous act worthy of a manumission.[108] In one exceptional case, the former slave Jin Midi (d. 86 BCE) became one of the regents over the government.[109] Private slaves could buy their freedom from their master, while some masters chose to free their slaves.[110] Although slaves were subject to beatings if they did not obey their masters, it was against the law to murder a slave; kings were stripped of their kingdoms after it was found that they had murdered slaves, while Wang Mang even forced one of his sons to commit suicide for murdering a slave.[111] An edict of 35 CE repealed the death penalty for any slave who killed a commoner.[112]
