Large deer with impressive antlers evolved during the early Pleistocene, probably as a result of abundant resources to drive evolution.[8] The early Pleistocene cervid † Eucladoceros was comparable in size to the modern elk.[58] † Megaloceros (Pliocene–Pleistocene) featured the Irish elk (M. giganteus), one of the largest known cervids. The Irish elk reached 2 metres (6.6 ft) at the shoulder and had heavy antlers that spanned 3.6 metres (12 ft) from tip to tip.[59] These large animals are thought to have faced extinction due to conflict between sexual selection for large antlers and body and natural selection for a smaller form.[60] Meanwhile, the moose and reindeer radiated into North America from Siberia.[61]
