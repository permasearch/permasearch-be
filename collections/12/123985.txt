In November 2004, an opposition day motion seeking a ban similar to Denmark's was introduced by Jack Layton of the New Democratic Party, and passed through the House of Commons by an overwhelming 193â€“73 vote.[108] Like all Commons motions, it served as an expression of the views of the House but was not binding on the government and has no force under the law.
