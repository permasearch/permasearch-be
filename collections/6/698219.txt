India's government had initially estimated that the Golden Quadrilateral project would cost ₹600 billion (US$8.7 billion) at 1999 prices. However, the highway has been built under-budget. As of August 2011, cost incurred by Indian government was about half of initial estimate, at ₹308.58 billion (US$4.5 billion). The eight contracts in progress, as of August 2011, were worth ₹16.34 billion (US$240 million).[7]
