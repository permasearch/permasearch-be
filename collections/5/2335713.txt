In "Apotheosis", the Surgeon is still partially alive. Scott and Liam take him to the animal clinic to treat and for information. The lead para-scientist however, jolts awake and hears the voice of Beast of Gevuadan, Sebastien Valet calling to him. He bursts out of the clinic, and staggers to his knees before Sebastien walks up to him. Sebastien rips off the Mask, revealing his disfigured, inhuman face. Sebastien recognizes the Surgeon as his loving friend, Marcel. Sebastien scolds Marcel that if his appearance is what immortality promised him, he was misled. Marcel, dying, justifies and declares his centuries of twisted acts and experiments was all for Sebastien. He tells Sebastien the Pike, which he now uses as his cane was taken by the Argents. Marcel dies.
