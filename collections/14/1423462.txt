From west to east the road runs as Euston Road to King's Cross, then Pentonville Road to the Angel, Islington.[14] The three streets in the purple set all converge at Trafalgar Square,[15] and the red set are all adjacent to each other as part of the A4 road, a major road running west from Central London.[16] The orange set is related to locations dealing with the police and law.[17] The yellow set has an entertainment and nightlife-based theme; Leicester Square is known for cinemas and theatres, Coventry Street for clubs and restaurants, and Piccadilly for hotels.[18] The streets in the green set have a background in retail and commercial properties.[19]
