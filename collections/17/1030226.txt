Two constitutions were submitted to General Meade; the Committee on Reconstruction adopted the "moderate" one, on Meade's recommendation. Through the reapportionment, less than a fourth of voters could elect a majority of the State Senate, and less than a third the Assembly. As said in a letter to Senator David Yulee, "Under our Constitution the Judiciary & State officers will be appointed & the apportionment will prevent a negro legislsture." Freedmen's Bureau agent William J. Furman later bragged that he had prevented Florida from being "niggerized".[4]:531
