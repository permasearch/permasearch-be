Foraging turtles frequently cross lakes or travel linearly down creeks.[69] Daily crossings of large ponds have been observed.[68] Tag and release studies show that sex also drives turtle movement. Males travel the most, up to 26 km (16 mi), between captures; females the second most, up to 8 km (5 mi), between captures; and juveniles the least, less than 2 km (1.2 mi), between captures.[67] Males move the most and are most likely to change wetlands because they seek mates.[68]
