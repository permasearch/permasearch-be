Dale Horvath, portrayed by Jeffrey DeMunn,[8] is an older man and former car salesman. His age, calm affect, worldly experience, and RV provide the nucleus around which the small community of survivors has formed. He is wise, and the respected elder of the group. He is also rather feisty and not afraid to speak his mind or call others out for mistakes in judgment. Dale manages to talk Andrea out of a suicide attempt by putting himself at risk, as well. Dale becomes wary of Shane, after witnessing that Shane contemplated assassinating Rick beforehand as well as guessing that Shane killed Otis while retrieving medical supplies for Carl. Dale becomes upset at the group when they decide to kill Randall to avoid any risks he might have posed and argues for sparing his life, leading to the execution being postponed. Dale is killed by a walker, who was accidentally lured by Carl earlier that day. Dale's death causes the group to reevaluate their unity and allow Randall to live.
