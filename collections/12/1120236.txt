The National Rifle Association (NRA) was founded to promote firearm competency in 1871. The NRA supported the NFA and, ultimately, the GCA.[40] After the GCA, more strident groups, such as the Gun Owners of America (GOA), began to advocate for gun rights.[41] According to the GOA, it was founded in 1975 when "the radical left introduced legislation to ban all handguns in California."[42] The GOA and other national groups like the Second Amendment Foundation (SAF), Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership (JPFO), and the Second Amendment Sisters (SAS), often take stronger stances than the NRA and criticize its history of support for some firearms legislation, such as GCA. These groups believe any compromise leads to greater restrictions.[43]:368[44]:172
