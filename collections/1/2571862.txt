The Betsy Ross House is a landmark in Philadelphia purported to be the site where the seamstress and flag-maker Betsy Ross (1752-1836) lived when she sewed the first American Flag. The origins of the Betsy Ross myth trace back to her relatives, particularly her grandsons, William and George Canby, and the celebrations of the Centennial of 1876.[1] Evidence for the precise location of Ross' home came from verification provided by several surviving family members,[2]although the best archival evidence indicates the house would have been adjacent to the one that still stands today as The Betsy Ross House.[3] Although the house is one of the most visited tourist sites in Philadelphia,[4] the claim that Ross once lived there, and that she designed and sewed the first American flag, sometimes called the Betsy Ross flag, are considered false by most historians.[5][6]
