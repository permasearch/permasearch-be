The Zanclean flood created the Strait of Gibraltar; it is questionable that tectonic or volcanic events could have created the strait themselves seeing as the main plate boundaries do not run through the strait and there is little seismic activity in its area.[40] The current morphology of the strait is characterized by two sills, the maximally 284 metres (932Â ft) deep Camarinal Sill and the somewhat deeper Spartel Sill[41] farther west; the narrowest part of the strait is located east of either sill,[42] and this narrowest part is considerably deeper.[41] It is possible that these sills were formed after the flood through gravity-induced movement of neighbouring terrain.[43]
