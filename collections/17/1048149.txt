In November 2014, The Weather Network and CBC News announced a content-sharing relationship, in which TWN-produced national weather forecasts would appear on CBC News Network and during The National, and The Weather Network would be able feature weather-related stories from CBC News on its own television and digital outlets. The arrangement began on December 8, 2014 as a one-year trial.[7]
