Still, she often floundered about what to do and how to spend her time ("drifting" was the word she frequently used),[117] always struggling with her many eccentricities,[116][118] and her lifelong melancholy and moodiness.[119][120] As she approached her sixtieth birthday, she told a frequent walking companion "In a few days, it will be the anniversary of the sorrow that never leaves me, that will never leave me for the rest of my life."[121] To another friend, she said, in 1971, "I suppose I suffer from very deep depression."[122] It is also arguable, says one biographer, that she was bipolar. "I am very happy one moment, the next there is nothing left for me," she said in 1933.[122]
