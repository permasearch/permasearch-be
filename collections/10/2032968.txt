The plot is divided into two different action threads: the present, in which Kvothe tells the story of his life to Devan Lochees (known as Chronicler) in the Waystone Inn, and Kvothe's past, which makes up the majority of the first two books. The present-day interludes are in the third person from the perspective of multiple characters, while the story of Kvothe's life is told entirely in the first person from his own perspective.
