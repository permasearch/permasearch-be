The Patriots began the second half where they left off in the first, driving 73 yards in more than 6 minutes for another touchdown, this one a 3-yard reception by Watson. The Bills responded with a 29-yard Terrence McGee kickoff return that led to a 52-yard Rian Lindell field goal to cut the Patriots lead to 42–10. The Patriots' next series, their seventh of the game, also ended in their seventh touchdown of the game, setting a Patriots franchise single-season touchdown record (1961 and 1980, 52).[77] A Welker screen pass went 24 yards to put the Patriots in the Bills' red zone, and a 1-yard Eckel touchdown run on the first play of the fourth quarter gave the Patriots a 49–10 lead. On the second play of the Bills' next drive, Sanders forced a fumble by running back Dwayne Wright after a 5-yard reception, which Hobbs recovered and returned 35 yards for the Patriots' eighth and final touchdown of the game. The Patriots' 56 points tied a franchise record,[77] and were the most points scored by a road team in the NFL since 1973.[78] Their 46-point scoring margin was also the second-largest in team history.[77] The Patriots' 56–10 win brought their record to 10–0, the tenth time since 1970 a team started a season 10–0.[77]
