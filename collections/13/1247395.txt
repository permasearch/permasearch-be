Rhonda (voiced by Kathy Kinney) is a very rude, unhygenic, lazy and obnoxious walrus (though she is depicted with buck teeth instead of tusks). She appears in the episode "Roomies" where she is transferred into Marlene's habitat. At first Marlene is excited to have another girl to hang out with, but gets annoyed by Rhonda very quickly due to her disgusting and obnoxious behavior. She asks the penguins to ship her out overnight, but stops the shipment after hearing she is getting taken to a polar bear reserve. Instead they send her to the Hoboken Zoo. At the end, we see that she is one of Dr. Blowhole's agents and stole Kowalski's plasma cutter.
