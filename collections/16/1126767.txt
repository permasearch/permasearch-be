Alan Greenspan, ex-Chairman of the Federal Reserve, stated in March 2008 that the 2008 financial crisis in the United States "is likely to be judged in retrospect as the most wrenching since the end of World War II".[18] A chief economist at Standard & Poor's said in March 2008 he had projected a worst-case-scenario in which the country would endure a double-dip recession, in which the economy would briefly recover in the summer 2008, before plunging again.[citation needed] Under this scenario, the economy's total output, as measured by the gross domestic product (GDP), would drop by 2.2Â percentage points, making it among the worst recessions in the post World War II period.[citation needed]
