From the 27 August, the Japanese attacks increased in intensity along both approaches.[321] On the Abuari track, reinforcement by two companies of the 2/16th Battalion was able to stay the advance of the 2/144th Battalion on this axis. Japanese sources later noted that the defence by the 53rd and 2/16th on the right offered them "little opportunity to make a speedy exploitation",[322] although, the Japanese commander has been criticised for not pressing his advantage there,[321] apparently under the belief that it was more strongly held.[323]
