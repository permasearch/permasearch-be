Overarching Mystery Events: The gang discovers a musical phrase which has appeared on the Planispheric Disk. When the Hex Girls sing the phrase, the Disk reveals another set of coordinates, which leads the gang to the restaurant owned by Skipper Shelton, whereupon they find that his hat (given to him by Handsome Jimmy from "Night on Haunted Mountain") bears the name "S. Llave" written under the brim. Scooby visits Nova in the hospital, only to see her flatline. Just afterward, she sits up in bed and says "Nibiru. Nibiru is coming", before regaining life.
