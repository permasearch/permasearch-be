By 1962 the Brill Building contained 165 music businesses:[4] A musician could find a publisher and printer, cut a demo, promote the record and cut a deal with radio promoters, all within this one building.  The creative culture of the independent music companies in the Brill Building and the nearby 1650 Broadway came to define the influential "Brill Building Sound" and the style of popular songwriting and recording created by its writers and producers.[5]
