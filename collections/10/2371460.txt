A cervical pessary is being studied as an alternative to cervical cerclage since there are fewer potential complications. A silicone ring is placed at the opening to the cervix early in the pregnancy, and removed later in the pregnancy prior to the time of expected delivery. Further study is needed to determine whether a cervical pessary is equal or superiour to current management.[9]
