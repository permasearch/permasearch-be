Bridge over Troubled Water received a generally positive critical reception. The record was both criticized and lauded for its individual sound that incorporated genres ranging from rock, R&B, gospel and jazz to world music and pop. Writing in Melody Maker in February 1970, Richard Williams identified "a few dull moments" on the album, adding "but they're worth enduring for the jewels they surround". Williams concluded: "Not, perhaps, another classic like Bookends, but still worth hearing for Simon's constantly surprising timing, and for the way he can make his guitar sound like a small orchestra and the orchestra sound like a big guitarÂ ..."[75] According to Steve Horowitz of PopMatters, contemporary critics compared the album to The Beatles' White Album "in that one can hear the incipient break up of the band in the way they separately perform the material".[65]
