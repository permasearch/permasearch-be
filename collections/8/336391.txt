The 1973 model was marginally shorter than previous models, but had a heavier, bulker appearance. Three towing packages were optional, each with increasing towing capacity.[31] For law men, there were multiple Police package versions available with engines ranging from the 351 2v to the powerful 460 Police Interceptor. Taxi packages continued to be offered as well.[32] All 1973 full-sized Fords now came with a 351 2v V8-engine and SelectShift automatic transmission as their base driveline. Four-door sedans with metal door frames were replaced with a new "Pillared Hardtop" model which featured a thin "B" post and frameless door glass. This body style was offered together with the traditional pillarless four-door hardtop.
