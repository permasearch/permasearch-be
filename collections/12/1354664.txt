On February 10, 2011, the U.S. FDA issued an advisory on metal-metal hip implants, stating it was continuing to gather and review all available information about metal-on-metal hip systems.[53] On June 27â€“28, 2012, an advisory panel met to decide whether to impose new standards, taking into account findings of the study in The Lancet.[40][54][55] No new standards, such as routine checking of blood metal ion levels, were set, but guidance was updated.[56] Currently, FDA has not required hip implants to be tested in clinical trials before they can be sold in the U.S.[57] Instead, companies making new hip implants only need to prove that they are "substantially equivalent" to other hip implants already on the market. The exception is metal-on-metal implants, which were not tested in clinical trials but because of the high revision rate of metal-on-metal hips, in the future the FDA has stated that clinical trials will be required for approval and that post-market studies will be required to keep metal on metal hip implants on the market.[58]
