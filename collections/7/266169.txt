Batman frees himself and attacks Joker, but is paralyzed by Joker venom, allowing Joker to escape. Batman is recovered by the Bat-family and taken to the Batcave, where he confesses that after an early battle with Joker, he discovered a joker playing card in the Batcave; he dismisses the idea that Joker has found the cave, but the family fears that Joker knows their identities and blame Batman for concealing such a possibility. Later, Batman interrogates an Arkham guard, who admits that Joker is waiting for him at the Asylum. As he ventures into the Asylum, his internal dialogue reveals that the movements he had previously seen in Joker's eyes when they met indicated love.[9] In the backup story, Joker is shown to have taken over the Asylum and meeting with the institutionalized Riddler.[10]
