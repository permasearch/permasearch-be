As news of the Alamo's fall spread, volunteer ranks swelled, reaching about 1,400 men on March 19.[221] Houston learned of Fannin's defeat on March 20 and realized his army was the last hope for an independent Texas. Concerned that his ill-trained and ill-disciplined force would only be good for one battle and aware that his men could easily be outflanked by Urrea's forces, Houston continued to avoid engagement, to the immense displeasure of his troops.[222] By March 28, the Texian army had retreated 120 miles (190Â km) across the Navidad and Colorado Rivers.[223] Many troops deserted; those who remained grumbled that their commander was a coward.[222]
