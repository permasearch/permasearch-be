By the time infants reach the age of two, their brain size has reached 90 percent of an adult-sized brain;[60] a majority of this brain growth has occurred during the period of life with the highest rate of sleep. The hours that children spend asleep influence their ability to perform on cognitive tasks.[61][62] Children who sleep through the night and have few night waking episodes have higher cognitive attainments and easier temperaments than other children.[62][63][64]
