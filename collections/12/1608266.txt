In some cases, internal and external bleeding may occur.[1] This typically begins five to seven days after the first symptoms.[25] All infected people show some decreased blood clotting.[22] Bleeding from mucous membranes or from sites of needle punctures has been reported in 40â€“50% of cases.[26] This may cause vomiting blood, coughing up of blood, or blood in stool.[27] Bleeding into the skin may create petechiae, purpura, ecchymoses or hematomas (especially around needle injection sites).[28] Bleeding into the whites of the eyes may also occur.[29] Heavy bleeding is uncommon; if it occurs, it is usually in the gastrointestinal tract.[30] The incidence of bleeding into the gastrointestinal tract has decreased since earlier epidemics and is now estimated to be approximately 10% with improved prevention of disseminated intravascular coagulation.[24]
