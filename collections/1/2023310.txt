In the 1997 season, North Sydney again made the preliminary final against Newcastle at The Sydney Football Stadium.  The winner of the match was to play minor premiers Manly in The Grand final.  With the score 12-8 in favor of Newcastle with under 10 minutes to play Jason Taylor set up Michael Buettner for a try which made the score 12-12.  Normally a very reliable kicker and one of the most accurate in the competition, Taylor had already missed two previous conversions in the match but if he was to kick this goal it could send North Sydney through to their first grade final since 1943.  Taylor ended up missing the goal.  With the scores locked at 12-12, Newcastle player Matthew Johns kicked a field goal with 2 minutes to play to make it 13-12.  With only seconds remaining Norths frantically threw the ball around and lost it, the ball was swooped up by Newcastle's Owen Craigie and he raced away to score a try and won the game.[18][19]
