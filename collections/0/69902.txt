The song appears in the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel The Great Gatsby, when Daisy Buchanan and Gatsby meet again after many years, and the latter insists Klipspringer, his apparently permanent "guest," to play it for them.[10][16] It also appears in Dorothy Parker's 1929 short story, "Big Blonde."[17] Warner Brothers used the song in two musicals during the early 1950s: The Gus Kahn biopic I'll See You in My Dreams and The Eddie Cantor Story.[15] Woody Allen used the song in his 1983 film Zelig.[18]
