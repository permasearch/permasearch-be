The gumshoe used several large markers with flashing siren lights on them. If a location was correctly identified, the light turned on and a siren went off. Incorrect guesses were marked by a two-note buzzer.  One incorrect guess per location was allowed, but a second incorrect guess forced the gumshoe to leave the marker on the board and return for the next location. If the gumshoe succeeded and captured Carmen before time expired, he/she won the grand prize trip anywhere in the continental United States (season 1) or anywhere in North America (all subsequent seasons) plus a package of educational items similar to those given in round two. Otherwise, Carmen escaped and the gumshoe received just the prize package instead.
