In 1999, Park appeared in Star Wars: Episode I â€“ The Phantom Menace, as the Sith Lord Darth Maul. While the character had few lines, Park's voice was dubbed over with that of actor Peter Serafinowicz. From his work on Star Wars, Park was cast in a cameo role in Fanboys as a Skywalker Ranch security guard who says, "Time for you to get mauled, boy," as he pulls out two nightsticks.
