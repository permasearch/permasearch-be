In "Trends with Benefits", Charlie Russell states that Finn was a "drag" the last time she worked with his father, though Russell believes that this time will be different. She is also shown to be extremely comfortable in D.B.'s house, rifling his fridge for food. In "Malice in Wonderland", Finn states that she hates weddings as her feet hurt when wearing expensive footwear, though she later attends a wedding ceremony and returns evidence to the victim's husband, demonstrating her sentimental tendencies for the first time. Season 12 also reveals that antibody profiling is Finn's specialty ("Split Decisions"), and she is not afraid to embrace her sexuality ("Altered Stakes"). In "Altered Stakes", Russell makes Finn attend a baseball game for "the team", in which she pretends to have a stitch to flirt with Detective Carlos Moreno on third base. The two appear to be in a sexual relationship by the following episode, "Dune and Gloom". Later, she is instrumental in the reopening of a case involving evidence improperly processed by Grissom.
