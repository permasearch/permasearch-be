The fastest pitch on record was thrown by Eddie Feigner of "The King and His Court" who was clocked at 104 mph.[3]  Feigner was at his best in the 1950s, and it is doubtful if this figure is correct. More recently, measured with modern radar guns, the best women are clocked at up to 75 mph and the best men at 85 mph.
