The Henry rifle used a .44 caliber cartridge with 26 to 28 grains (1.7 to 1.8Â g) of black powder.[8] This gave it significantly lower muzzle velocity and energy than other repeaters of the era, such as the Spencer. The lever action, on the down-stroke, ejected the spent cartridge from the chamber and cocked the hammer. A spring in the magazine forced the next round into the follower; locking the lever back into position pushed the new cartridge into the chamber and closed the breech. As designed, the Henry lacked any form of safety. When not in use its hammer rested on the cartridge rim; any impact on the back of the exposed hammer could cause a chambered round to fire. If left cocked, it was in the firing position without a safety. Current Henry models will not fire if dropped or the hammer is released partially by accident. It can be safely carried with a chambered round both hammer cocked or hammer down. From owners manual "This firearm is designed with an ultra-safe patented Transfer Bar Safety Mechanism. This safety system prevents the gun from being fired under all circumstances, except when the hammer is fully cocked and the trigger is pulled. If the hammer is fully cocked and the trigger is pulled, the gun would fire as normal. However, if the hammer is fully cocked and is accidentally dislodged by some other means other than the trigger being pulled, the gun will not fire. If the hammer is in the process of being cocked and is accidentally released and dropped into the fired down position, before it is fully cocked, the gun will not fire. This rifle can be safely carried fully loaded with the hammer in the fired down resting position. Please note that this rifle does not have a half cock safety position nor a crossbolt safety." [9]
