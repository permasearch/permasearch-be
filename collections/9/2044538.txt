BuddyTV staff columnist Don Williams felt the addition of Ruby was a "cheap ploy" to attract teen male viewers, that the character distracted viewers from the "brotherly bond that made the show so special in the first place," and that Cassidy "was cast more for her looks than her acting prowess."[38] However, he later admitted Ruby "remains one of the more interesting and ambiguous evildoers on the series."[39] Although IGN's Diana Steenbergen had looked forward to Ruby's introduction, she ultimately found the third-season incarnation a "wasted" character who did little to improve the series. Her main concerns consisted of Ruby's "unlikable and manipulative" qualities and her tendency to make the Winchesters "look stupid." Cassidy "never quite [pulled off]" the "tough chick" persona of Buffy the Vampire Slayer's Faith or Battlestar Galactica's Six.[40] TV Guide's Tina Charles, however, liked Ruby's action-packed introduction in "The Magnificent Seven."[41] She was "intrigued" by the character in "The Kids Are Alright," and felt Cassidy was "doing a good job."[42] Ruby made a "plausible addition" to "Malleus Maleficarum," with Charles finding it "cool" to learn Ruby's backstory due to its implications for Dean's storyline.[43] Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune thought Cassidy "wasn't awful" in "The Magnificent Seven."[44] Though "not great enough for Ackles to really play off of" in "Malleus Maleficarum," the actress was "good enough to make her weaker acting chops kind of work for her."[45] While under the impression that Ruby had been killed off in "No Rest for the Wicked," Peterson wrote that the character "got gone just as [she was] getting interesting" and deemed her a "decent traveling [companion]."[46]
