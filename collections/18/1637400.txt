After lambs are stabilized, lamb marking is carried out â€“ this includes ear tagging, docking, castration and usually vaccination.[1] Ear tags with numbers are the primary mode of identification when sheep are not named; it is also the legal manner of animal identification in the European Union: the number may identify the individual sheep or only its flock. When performed at an early age, ear tagging seems to cause little or no discomfort to lambs.[1][3] However, using tags improperly or using tags not designed for sheep may cause discomfort, largely due to excess weight of tags for other animals.[1]
