It was directed by Michael Curtiz and stars Lee Tracy, Fay Wray, and Lionel Atwill. The film is notable for having been shot in Technicolor and being produced before the motion picture Production Code was enforced. Thus, mature themes such as murder, rape, cannibalism, and prostitution are interwoven into the story.
