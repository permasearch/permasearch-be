The books of Harry Wu describe his experience in reform through labor prisons from 1960 to 1979. They say he was imprisoned for criticizing the government while he was in college and that he was not released until 1979 after which he moved to the United States and eventually became an activist. Party officials have argued that he far overstates the present role of Chinese labor camps and ignores the tremendous changes that have occurred in China since then.
