Headlight flashing in the United Kingdom is often used as a signal that the driver flashing you is offering to let you go first. Such use is however strongly discouraged because it can lead to accidents where the driver flashing has not seen the approach of another road user.[26] Using it to indicate that you are coming through and the other driver must wait, could lead to an accident.[citation needed]
