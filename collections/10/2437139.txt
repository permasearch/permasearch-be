But Jerome Joseph, also from the Los Angeles Times, was not as positively receptive of the single, arguing that it sounded like a "Brandy or Monica reject", and called Lopez "Paula Abdul 2000".[37] Similarly, Hartford Courant writer Roger Catlin stated that the song is "more of a bland R&B number that could have been sung by anybody", suggesting that it has "little Latin flair".[38] While Scott Iwasald of Deseret News characterized Lopez's vocals as "sultry" but thin, he noted that she finds a "nice ring" in songs such as "If You Had My Love".[39] At the 1999 Teen Choice Awards, the song won the award for "Song of the Summer".[40]
