Sam is portrayed by actor Chord Overstreet. Unlike much of the original cast, Glee creator Ryan Murphy did not find Overstreet on Broadway.[12] He landed the role after auditioning with Commodores' "Easy" and Gavin DeGraw's "I Don't Want to Be".[13] He later sang "Billionaire" by Travie McCoy featuring Bruno Mars as a studio test, and eventually sang this in the season premiere "Audition", along with "Every Rose Has Its Thorn" by Poison.[13][14] Following Overstreet's casting, media speculation suggested Sam might have been created as a boyfriend for Kurt.[15][16] Overstreet later confirmed this, but stated that his storyline had been adjusted to pair Sam with Quinn, as a result of the chemistry the producers detected between himself and Agron.[17] Chord Overstreet said of his casting process: "It was like a week long process. I did three or four auditions. I went in the casting office with Robert Ulrich and sang three or four songs. Did the studio test, network test, and I found out the next day and went right into the studio to record 'Billionaire.'"[18]
