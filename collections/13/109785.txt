In October 2015, shortly after the start of Russia's military intervention in Syria, a senior ex-US official was paraphrased as saying "the "moderates” had collapsed long ago" in a piece by Robert Fisk, who added that many fighters had defected to other rebel groups,[502] while Russia's foreign minister Sergey Lavrov called the FSA "an already phantom structure",[503] but later proclaimed that Russia was ready to aid the FSA with airstrikes against ISIS.[504] On the other hand, in December 2015, according to the American Institute for the Study of War, groups that identify as FSA were still present around Aleppo and Hama and in southern Syria, and the FSA was still “the biggest and most secular of the rebel groups.”[505]
