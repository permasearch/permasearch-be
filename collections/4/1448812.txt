Vikram believes that as Hari's son (whom he affectionately calls Master Mayur) is the next generation of Mayur industries, he should be taken back with him. Bijuriya, who is a bar dancer at Banjo's Beer Bar, objects to this, thinking he is here to separate her and Nandu. Vikram and Bijuriya have not met yet. Vikram does not even know who has brought his nephew up. Bijuriya knows that if Vikram goes to court, she will lose Nandu forever.
