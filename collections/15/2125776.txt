As a result of litigation against public accounting firms, amounts in excess of $300 million have been awarded to these parties.[2] Even with professional liability insurance to cover such losses, occasionally the total amounts granted to plaintiffs have surpassed the maximum amounts the insurance can or will cover. If investors sustain losses they will attempt to recover them as long as the price to bring suit is low and there is a chance for recovery. Any public accounting firm may find itself in litigation no matter how careful the CPAs were. CPAs are often required to make further payments for investors and creditors uninsured losses. The firm itself can make these payments, as can personnel who have worked on the engagement.
