Toms (stylized as TOMS) is a for-profit[2][3][4] company based in Playa Del Rey, California.[5] The company was founded in 2006 by Blake Mycoskie, an entrepreneur from Arlington, Texas.[6][7][8] The company designs and sells shoes based on the Argentine alpargata design,[9] eyewear, coffee, apparel, and handbags. When Toms sells a pair of shoes, a new pair of shoes is given to an impoverished child,[10] when Toms sells eyewear, part of the profit is used to save or restore eyesight for people in developing countries. The company launched TOMS Roasting Co. in 2014, and with each purchase of TOMS Roasting Co. coffee, the company works with other organizations that they refer to as "giving partners" to provide 140 liters of safe water, equal to a one week supply, to a person in need. In 2015, TOMS Bag Collection was launched to help contribute to advancements in maternal health. Purchases of TOMS Bags help provide training for skilled birth attendants and distribute birth kits containing items that help women practice safe childbirth.[11]
