Owen first appears in the film while with four raptors (Blue, Delta, Echo, and Charlie), that he has been rearing and training since they hatched (so they would imprint on him). He is approached by Vic Hoskins, head of security for the bio-engineering company, InGen. Hoskins proposes using raptors as military weapons. Owen objects, explaining that his relationship with the four raptors is a personal one and they only respond to him under controlled conditions. This is demonstrated when he risks his life saving an employee who falls into the raptor paddock. Later, Claire asks Owen to inspect the park's latest attraction, the Indominus rex. Owen criticizes the Indominus' paddock, saying that it provides no social interaction besides a feeding crane, while his raptors have each other and himself for companionship. At the paddock, it appears that the Indominus rex has escaped, since it is not seen, its heat signature is lost, and there are claw marks on the wall that reach the top. Once inside, however, Owen discovers it is still there, having camouflaged itself and masked its own heat signature. He barely survives, although two staff are killed. When the Indominus rex escapes, Owen demands it be hunted and killed, knowing that it is intelligent, and it tricked them into going into its cage. However, Masrani, the park owner, considers it too valuable and wants it captured alive. Owen and Claire search for her nephews, Zach and Gray, who are exploring the park on their own. Owen is shocked by how little Claire knows about her nephews. While searching for the two boys, he and Claire come across dead and dying Apatosaurus, realizing that the Indominus is killing not for food, but just for 'sport'.
