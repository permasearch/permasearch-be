As a boy I had such a musical bump,     And its size so struck Mr. HELMORE, That he said, "Though you sing those songs like a trump,     You shall write some yourself that will sell more." So I packed off to Leipsic, without looking back,     And returned in such classical fury, That I sat down with HANDEL and HAYDN and BACH,—     And turned out "Trial by Jury."  But W.S.G. he jumped for joy     As he said, "Though the job dismay you, Send Exeter Hall to the deuce, my boy;     It's the haul with me that'll pay you." And we hauled so well, mid jeers and taunts,     That we've settled, spite all temptations, To stick to our Sisters and our Cousins and our Aunts,—     And continue our pleasant relations.
