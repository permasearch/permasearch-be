Holy Orders is one of seven Catholic sacraments that make an indelible mark called a sacramental character on the recipient's soul (the other two are baptism and confirmation). This sacrament can only be conferred on baptized men.[1] If a woman attempts to be ordained, both she and the person who attempts to ordain her are excommunicated latae sententiae.[2]
