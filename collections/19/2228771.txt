Maturation is submitted by the assembly of bacteriophage DNA and capsids into virions. Late proteins are important in assembly. Assembly is complicated but varies in bacteriophage stages, some are assembled in nucleus and some are assembled in cytoplasm, and may be seen as paracrystalline structures in cell.The tails and heads of the T even bacteriophage are assembled from protein subunits, and the head is packed with DNA and attached to the tail.
