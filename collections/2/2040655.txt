Simhasana yoga arises if at the time of birth only the 2nd, the 6th, the 8th and the 12th houses counted from the lagna are occupied by planets; Hansa yoga arises if at that particular moment only the lagna, the 5th, the 9th and the 7th houses are occupied by planets or if planets are situated only in Aries, Aquarius, Sagittarius, Libra and Scorpio (or Leo) signs; planets similarly occupying Cancer, Pisces, Gemini, Virgo and Sagittarius signs give rise to Danda yoga; these are all Raja yogas. However, Simhasana yoga is most effective for persons born in Aries, Libra or Capricorn lagna; Hansa yoga is most effective for those born in Capricorn, Cancer, Aquarius or Gemini lagna, in which eventuality these stated yogas gain the more exalted status of Chilhipuchccha yoga, also known as Yogadhiyoga, and become powerful twice-over.[17]
