Ashoka and Kalinga Ashoka (son of Bindusara) wanted to annex Kalinga with Magadha for commercial reasons, although some folktales indicates that he invaded for personal reason. Because Kalinga has many sea ports which Magadha lacks and Kalinga is between north and south part of India and main trade routes goes through it, Ashoka attacked Kalinga in 261 B.C. and a battle occurred between two armies near the river Daya. This site is now identified near Bhubaneswar, the capital city of Orissa. Although Ashoka was winner at the end of the day, the bloodshed and human suffering changed his mind forever.[citation needed]
