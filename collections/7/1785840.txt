Roxanne "Roxie" Hart is a fictional character originally from the 1927 play Chicago. The playwright, reporter Maurine Dallas Watkins, was inspired by the real-life 1924 murder trials of Beulah Annan and Belva Gaertner (for separate crimes), which she covered for the Chicago Tribune (both women were acquitted). Annan was the basis for Roxie Hart.[1]
