In Tucson, Arizona, all exits between Prince Road and 22nd Street are being reopened after an extensive, three-year improvement project. I-10 has been being widened from six to eight lanes, and seven bridges and underpasses have been built to deal with congestion.[13] Plans are also under way to widen I-10 from Marana north to the I-8 interchange at Casa Grande from four lanes to six lanes starting in the later half of 2007 and continuing into 2008 and 2009.
