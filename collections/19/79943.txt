In 2014 a lot of expectations were set on the team after what seemed like a successful first year for Chip Kelly. However, Nick Foles didn't perform as well as he did in 2013. His 2014 season would end during Week 9 when he breaks his collarbone. Mark Sanchez would take over for the rest of the season for the Eagles. They would collapse from their 9-3 record near the end of the season to go 10-6 again, but miss the playoffs due to losing their division to the Dallas Cowboys.
