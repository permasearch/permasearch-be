Bluestar's Prophecy was released on the 28th of July 2009.[41] It covers Bluestar's life from her early kit hood, or childhood, to the beginning of Into the Wild. The novel begins on the day of Bluestar's death as she saves Fireheart and ThunderClan from the dog pack, a scene from A Dangerous Path. The novel then returns to when Bluestar was still a kit, Bluekit. Bluekit is apprenticed to Stonepelt as Bluepaw, and proves to be an excellent hunter, catching a squirrel almost as big as herself on her first day of hunting. The next day, Goosefeather sees a sign in the vole Snowpaw (Bluepaw's sister) brings back to camp and proclaims that ThunderClan must attack WindClan. Later, he tells them that they must destroy WindClan's medicine supply in order to keep them at bay during winter. Pinestar is reluctant but agrees to attack at dawn. Bluepaw and Snowpaw are ordered to stay out of the fight, but they help Featherwhisker, the medicine cat apprentice, tend to the wounded. During the battle, Bluepaw's mother, Moonflower, gets close to destroying WindClan's medicine supplies, but is killed by Hawkheart, the WindClan medicine cat who had originally been a warrior. Bluepaw enters a state of grief which lasts until Sunfall, the deputy and her new mentor since Stonepelt was injured during the WindClan battle and never healed, talks her out of it, telling her that she must honor Moonflower by doing well. She attends the Gathering that night, where she meets and becomes friendly with Crookedpaw and Oakheart of RiverClan.
