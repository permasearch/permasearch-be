In the Republic of Ireland, Good Friday is not an official public holiday, but most non-retail businesses close for the day. As a predominantly observant Catholic country, religious ceremonies are well attended. It is illegal to sell alcoholic beverages on Good Friday, with some exceptions, so pubs and off-licences generally close.[55] Retail businesses that sell alcohol such as supermarkets are required by law to physically block access to the aisle(s) that display alcohol for the day by ways such as Stanchion systems (Irish supermarkets are designed so that it is not necessary to pass through alcohol aisles to get to non-alcohol products). Critics of the ban include the catering and tourism sector, but public surveys indicate substantial support.[56] In Northern Ireland, a similar ban operates until 5pm on Good Friday.[57]
