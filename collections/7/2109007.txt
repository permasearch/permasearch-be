In Great Britain, "high containment kerbs" are used at locations with pedestrians, fuel station pumps, and other areas that need greater protection from vehicle traffic. These are 14 inches (36Â cm) high - much higher than standard curb, with a sloped lower portion and a concave face. These are also known as "trief" curbs.[9]
