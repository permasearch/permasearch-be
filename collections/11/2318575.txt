"Stop Crying Your Heart Out" is a cover song recorded by British singer-songwriter Leona Lewis for her second studio album Echo (2009). Originally written by Noel Gallagher of rock band Oasis, the song was produced by Lewis and Steve Robson. Lewis decided to cover the track as she is a fan of Oasis and rock bands in general, and she really liked the song's sentiment. The strings were performed by London Session Orchestra, who were organised and arranged by Will Malone. The musical structure of the song is different from the conventional style which is normally used, as the song's melody does not gain momentum until the end of the song instead of by the first chorus.
