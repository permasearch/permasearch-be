On 9 March 2017 Coopers Brewery launched a limited edition premium beer (in both can and carton) to commemorate the bicentenary of the Bible Society.[20][21] Public outcry arose over the use of the Coopers Brewery branded beer in a video[22] of the Bible Society debate over the issue of marriage equality.[23][24][25] Coopers Brewery issued two statements on 12 March 2017 in response to the backlash[26][27] and also posted a tweet saying they were not trying to push a religious message.[28] Various venues in Melbourne and Sydney subsequently announced they would no longer be stocking Coopers beers.[29][30] On 14 March Coopers issued a further statement[31][32] and accompanying video[33] declaring they were cancelling the release of the Bible Society commemorative cans and joining Australian Marriage Equality. On 15 March the Bible Society replaced the original video of the debate between Federal MPs Tim Wilson and Andrew Hastie with a four-second clip advising "We have decided to remove this video. Thank you for your understanding."
