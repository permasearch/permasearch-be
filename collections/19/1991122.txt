In 2015, Snapchat updated their privacy policy, causing outrage from users because of changes in their ability to save user content.[145] These rules were put in place to help Snapchat create new and cool features like being able to replay a Snapchat, and the idea of “live” Snapchat stories. These features require saving content to snapchat servers in order to release to other users at a later time. The update stated that it has the rights to reproduce, modify, and republish photos, as well as save those photos to Snapchat servers. Users felt uncomfortable with the idea that all photo content was saved and the idea of “disappearing photos” advertised by Snapchat didn’t actually disappear. There is no way to control what content is saved and what isn’t. Snapchat responded to backlash by saying they needed this license to access our information in order to create new features, like the live snapchat feature.[145]
