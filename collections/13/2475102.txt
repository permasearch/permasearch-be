Tcl (pronounced "tickle" or tee cee ell, /ˈtiː siː ɛl/) is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language. It was designed with the goal of being very simple but powerful.[6] Tcl casts everything into the mold of a command, even programming constructs like variable assignment and procedure definition.[7] Tcl supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles.
