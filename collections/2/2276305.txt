Though there are no steamboats in the town, except for an allegorical "steamboat" playground in West Lincoln Park, the area does offer two hot springs that are open to the public. The largest is at the Old Town Hot Springs,[14] with multiple pools and two slides. Located in the hills a few miles out of town is Strawberry Park Hot Springs,[15] with two pools and natural rock features. Strawberry Park Hot Springs offers excellent stargazing opportunities due to the lack of ambient light.
