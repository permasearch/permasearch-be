The ENHG period saw the rise of several important cross-regional forms of chancery German, one being gemeine tiutsch, used in the court of the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, and the other being MeiÃŸner Deutsch, used in the Electorate of Saxony in the Duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg.[25] Alongside these courtly written standards, the invention of the printing press led to the development of a number of printers' languages (Druckersprachen) aimed at making printed material readable and understandable across as many diverse dialects of German as possible.[26] The greater ease of production and increased availability of written texts brought about increased standardization in the written form of the German language.
