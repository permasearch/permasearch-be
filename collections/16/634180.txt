James was born in Limerick, Ireland,[6] to Welsh parents, and grew up in Lanner, Cornwall, UK, with two older sisters, in a "very happy" childhood during which they "were pretty much left to do what [they] wanted".[7] He enjoyed living there, feeling apart from nearby cities and the rest of the world.[8] Some of his earliest musical experiments as a child involved James playing with the strings inside his family's piano, similar to composer John Cage's prepared piano experiments, and at age nine he began purchasing tapes and tape recorders.[9] James attended Redruth School in Redruth, Cornwall,[10] and claimed to have produced sound on a Sinclair ZX81 (a machine with no sound hardware) at age 11:
