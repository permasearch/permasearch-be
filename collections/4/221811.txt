Jack is arrested, and put in a cell with Tom. The next day Tom is brought before the court, and, despite the best efforts of his solicitor, Martin Hopkins, is sentenced to three months' imprisonment. Jack is next to be tried, and the magistrate simply repeats, word-for-word, his summary of Tom's trial. Jack refuses to accept the validity of the court: "It's all very well to say we're equal under the law, but when you're starving you're only equal to the next poor bugger who's starving". Jack is sentenced to one month in prison: a martyr. Jessie is impressed: "Bastard! You wonderful, cunning bastard!"
