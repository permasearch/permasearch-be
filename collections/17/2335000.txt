Carson, who has been called the "Godfather of Grunge" graphic design, developed a technique of "ripping, shredding and remaking letters"[131][132]  and using "overprinted, disharmonious letters" and experimental design approaches, including "deliberate 'mistakes' in alignment".[133] Carson's art used "...messy and chaotic design" and he did not "..respect any rule of composition", using an "..experimental, personal and intuitive" approach.[134] Another "grunge graphic designer" was Elliott Earls, who used "distorted...older typefaces" and "aggressively illegible" type which adopted the "unkempt expressiveness" of the "grunge [music] aesthetic"; this radical, anti-establishment approach in graphic design was influenced by the 1910s-era avant-garde Dada movement.[133] Hat Nguyen's Droplet, Harriet Goren's Morire and Eric Lin's Tema Canante were all "signature grunge fonts."[131][132] Sven Lennartz states that grunge design images have a "realistic, genuine look" which is created by adding simulated torn paper, dog-eared corners, creases, yellowed scotch tape, coffee cup stains, hand-drawn images and handwritten words, typically over a "dirty" background texture which is done with dull, subdued colours.[135]
