Goals are chosen by the families through the annual or biannual Individual Family Service Plan (IFSP), which evolves from a meeting where families and staff members talk together about current concerns, as well as celebrating achievements. McWilliam's Routines-Based Interview, in which caregivers talk about the details of the child's and family's day, is used in many parts of the world to develop the family's chosen goals.
