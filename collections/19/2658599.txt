The studio's official press release was presented on May 20, 2010 and confirmed that Smallville would be remaining at its Friday, 8 p.m. time slot. It also revealed that Smallville would be reteaming with Supernatural, a series that was originally slotted just behind Smallville on Thursday nights for four seasons. The press release did not list Mack in the list of stars.[2] On May 21, 2010, Mack released a statement confirming that she would not return as a series regular, but would return for multiple episodes to wind up her storyline.[28] However, at the 2010 Comic-Con, Peterson stated that, despite her long absence and limited episode count, Mack would remain a series regular.[3] Mack stated that her hope is that the character of Chloe will hold on to her integrity as the writers close out her storyline. For the actress, watching as her character matured over the years—from sacrificing the things she wanted for the sake of her friends, to finally reaching a point where she can strive to satisfy her own needs and wants—has been important for her.[36] Tom Welling, who served as a part-time producer for season nine, was announced as a full executive producer for season ten.[2] Welling was also set to direct two episodes during the season, and Justin Hartley was contracted to direct another episode.[37]
