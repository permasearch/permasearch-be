Since the 1950s, there has been consensus among archaeologists as to the African origins of Great Zimbabwe.[58][59] Artefacts and radiocarbon dating indicate settlement in at least the fifth century, with continuous settlement of Great Zimbabwe between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries[60] and the bulk of the finds from the fifteenth century.[61] The radiocarbon evidence is a suite of 28 measurements, for which all but the first four, from the early days of the use of that method and now viewed as inaccurate, support the twelfth to fifteenth centuries chronology.[60][62] In the 1970s, a beam that produced some of the anomalous dates in 1952 was reanalysed and gave a fourteenth-century date.[63] Dated finds such as Chinese, Persian and Syrian artefacts also support the twelfth and fifteenth century dates.[64]
