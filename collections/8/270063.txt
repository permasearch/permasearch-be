The Seven Dwarfs returned home and immediately noticed someone had sneaked in, because the house was cleaned. During their loud discussion, they discovered the sleeping Snow White. She woke up and explained to them what happened. The Dwarfs took pity on her, saying: "If you will keep house for us, and cook, make beds, wash, sew, and knit, and keep everything clean and orderly, then you can stay with us, and you shall have everything that you want." They warn her to be careful when alone at home, and to not let anyone in while they are delving in the mountains.
