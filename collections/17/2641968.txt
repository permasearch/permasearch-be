Progress in forecasting methods has allowed more efficient or "smart" operation at certain California reservoirs, such as Lake Mendocino. If dry weather is forecast, water is allowed to be stored above the legal flood control limit, rather than being wasted downstream. This program is known as "Forecast Informed Reservoir Operations".[10] In addition, capital improvements such as the $900 million spillway project at Folsom Dam[11] will allow greater flexibility in water releases, making it safer to maintain a high reservoir level during the wet season.
