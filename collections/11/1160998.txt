When Kathy faked her death in 2006 unknown to anyone at the time, Ben (now Charlie Jones) came to England to live with Phil. Phil became engaged to Stella Crawford (Sophie Thompson), unaware that she was physically and mentally abusing Ben behind his back. This is revealed on their wedding day, and Stella committed suicide in the aftermath. The wedding was also significant for the Mitchell family as it saw the introduction of Phil's cousins, Ronnie (Samantha Womack) and Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons), as wild and fun-loving sisters from Ibiza. They buy the local club, R&R. Ronnie and Roxy's father, the manipulative Archie (Larry Lamb) is introduced a year later in 2008, sharing a good relationship with Roxy but a broken one with Ronnie. The true reason of Ronnie and Archie's bad relationship is soon revealed; Archie had the baby she had as a teenager adopted out against her will. Archie and Peggy, once his sister-in-law, start a relationship soon after he moves to Walford.
