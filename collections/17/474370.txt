Holliday was reported to have been involved in a shooting on the Withlacoochee River, Georgia, in 1873. At age 22, Holliday went with some friends to their favorite swimming hole, but discovered it was occupied by a group of African-American youths. Holliday and his companions told them to leave, but they refused. Accounts of this event vary. Holliday left and returned carrying either a shotgun or a pistol and started shooting, either at or over the heads of the youths. Some of them may have shot back. There are no contemporaneous accounts of the incident. Some family members and friends allege that Holliday killed one to three of the youths, but other members of Holliday's family dispute those accounts.[3]:64â€“67
