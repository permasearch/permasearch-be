Several characters from the other dimension arrive in the original dimension to thank their counterparts for saving the day. Platyborg, freed from his evil programming, reverts to his normal self, and Phineas-2 and Ferb-2 take him home. The kids are distraught to learn that Perry will be relocated since his cover is blown, but Carl remembers Doofenshmirtz has an Amnesia-inator that can erase memories. Phineas, Ferb, Candace, and their friends have their memories erased, allowing them to keep Perry. Before they forget, Phineas and Ferb say their goodbyes to Perry, and Isabella seizes the opportunity to kiss Phineas. Perry enters his lair and uploads photos from the day onto his computer, smiling happily.
