Arthur, the obnoxious son of the new mall owner, joins the Bobby Wasabi dojo. Rudy bends over backwards to please the owner, but Arthur rubs everyone the wrong way, and after an altercation with Jack, Arthur's dad forces Rudy to kick Jack out of the dojo or he will bring in a wrecking ball and turn the dojo into a parking lot. Rudy proves his loyalty to Jack and the gang by chaining himself inside the dojo. Mr. Turner brings the wrecking ball to scare them away. The gang does not leave, though, and they get to keep the dojo because Arthur gets in trouble by his dad. Meanwhile, Kim tries to get better stories to document on the news team.
