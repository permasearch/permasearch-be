The round 5, 2002 Showdown was the second time in a row Port Adelaide had won by 8 points. After the game players from both sides coincidentally came across each other at the Ramsgate Hotel in Henley Beach. During the match Josh Carr had been tagging Mark Ricciuto holding him to only 6 kicks (for comparison Ricciuto averaged 13 over his career).[34] After the game when the groups of players met at the Ramsgate Hotel the two started an argument, and with the assistance of alcohol, a brawl between the two groups broke out. No one was badly injured. The publicity of this incident resulted in the only consecutive Showdown crowds of 50,000 at Football Park.[35]
