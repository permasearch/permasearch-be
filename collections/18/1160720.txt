The ICEL Psalter was meant to replace the Grail Psalms, but the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments did not grant recognitio to the translation,[6] and thus it was rejected for use. In 2001, Pope John Paul II promulgated the encyclical Liturgiam authenticam, which called for a more literal translation of liturgical texts. This led to an interest in updating the Grail. In 2008, Conception Abbey completed a wide-scale revision in accordance with the encyclical, published under the title The Revised Grail Psalms. The 2008 version is used in the ICEL translation of The Liturgy of the Hours published by Paulines Publications Africa, now promulgated for use in every Bishops' Conference of Africa.[7]
