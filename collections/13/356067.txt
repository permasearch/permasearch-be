The wizards of Middle-earth were Maiar: spirits of the same order as the Valar, but lesser in power.[1]:389 The first three of these five wizards were known in the Mannish tongues of the Lord of the Rings series as Saruman "man of skill" (Rohirric), Gandalf "elf of the staff" (northern Men), and Radagast "tender of beasts" (possibly Westron).[1]:390–391 Tolkien never provided non-Elvish names for the other two; one tradition gives their names in Valinor as Alatar and Pallando,[1]:393 and another as Morinehtar and Rómestámo in Middle-earth.[3] Each wizard in the series had robes of a characteristic  colour:  white for Saruman (the chief and the most powerful of the five), grey for Gandalf, brown for Radagast, and sea-blue for Alatar and Pallando (known consequently as the Blue Wizards or "Ithryn Luin"). Gandalf and Saruman both play important roles in The Lord of the Rings, while Radagast appears only briefly. Alatar and Pallando do not feature in the story, as they are said to have journeyed far into the east after their arrival in Middle-earth.[1]:390
