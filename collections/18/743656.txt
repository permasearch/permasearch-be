The EU, under the leadership of Jean-Claude Juncker, threatened to sue Ireland over its tax deals, although Juncker himself had approved similar tax deals in his own country, Luxembourg. Apple paid all of its taxes in Ireland as required by that country so Ireland is appealing the EU decision. HP, Nike, Microsoft and others use the same tax arrangements in Ireland, Luxembourg and other countries,[citation needed] but Apple is frequently cited as a media example.[29] Irish companies are required to pay taxes in Ireland, but if they convince authorities[which?] that they are "managed and controlled" from abroad, the companies may win an exemption.
