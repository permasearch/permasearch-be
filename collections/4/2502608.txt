Area code 772 serves the Treasure Coast of the state of Florida. It covers Sebastian, Fellsmere, Vero Beach, Fort Pierce, Port St. Lucie, Jensen Beach, Stuart, Hobe Sound, Indiantown, and other areas in east central Florida. It was created in 2002 as a split from area code 561 when there was a need for more phone numbers (due in part to the increase of cell phone users).
