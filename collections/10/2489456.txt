The four coordinate functions      x  a   ( τ ) ,  a = 0 , 1 , 2 , 3   {\displaystyle x^{a}(\tau ),\;a=0,1,2,3}   defining a world line, are real functions of a real variable     τ   {\displaystyle \tau }   and can simply be differentiated in the usual calculus. Without the existence of a metric (this is important to realize) one can speak of the difference between a point     p   {\displaystyle p}   on the curve at the parameter value      τ  0     {\displaystyle \tau _{0}}   and a point on the curve a little (parameter      τ  0   + Δ τ   {\displaystyle \tau _{0}+\Delta \tau }  ) farther away. In the limit     Δ τ → 0   {\displaystyle \Delta \tau \rightarrow 0}  , this difference divided by     Δ τ   {\displaystyle \Delta \tau }   defines a vector, the tangent vector of the world line at the point     p   {\displaystyle p}  . It is a four-dimensional vector, defined in the point     p   {\displaystyle p}  . It is associated with the normal 3-dimensional velocity of the object (but it is not the same) and therefore called four-velocity        v →      {\displaystyle {\vec {v}}}  , or in components:
