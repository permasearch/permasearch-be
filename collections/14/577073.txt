True brood parasitism is rare among insects. Cuckoo bumblebees in the subgenus Psithyrus are among the few insects which, like cuckoos and cowbirds, are fed by adult hosts. Their queens kill and replace the existing queen of a colony of the host species then use the host workers to feed their brood.[31]
