In the general case, suppose that      X  = [  x  1   , … ,  x  n    ]  T     {\displaystyle \mathbf {X} =[x_{1},\dots ,x_{n}]^{T}}  ,      Σ    {\displaystyle \mathbf {\Sigma } }   is the covariance matrix relating the quantities      x  i     {\displaystyle x_{i}}  ,        x ¯      {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}}   is the common mean to be estimated, and      J    {\displaystyle \mathbf {J} }   is a design matrix equal to a vector of ones     [ 1 , . . . , 1  ]  T     {\displaystyle [1,...,1]^{T}}   (of length     n   {\displaystyle n}  ). The Gauss–Markov theorem states that the estimate of the mean having minimum variance is given by:
