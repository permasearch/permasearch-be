Most of the U.S.'s largest universities were also slow to realize rocketry's potential. Just before World War II, the head of the aeronautics department at MIT, at a meeting held by the Army Air Corps to discuss project funding, said that the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) "can take the Buck Rogers Job [rocket research]."[61] In 1941, Goddard tried to recruit an engineer for his team from MIT but couldn't find one who was interested.[15]:326 There were some exceptions: MIT was at least teaching basic rocketry,[15]:264 and Caltech had courses in rocketry and aerodynamics. After the war, Dr. Jerome Hunsaker of MIT, having studied Goddard's patents, stated that "Every liquid-fuel rocket that flies is a Goddard rocket."[15]:363
