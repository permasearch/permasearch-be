Rogers receives a large back-pay reimbursement dating back to his disappearance at the end of World War II, and a government commission orders him to work directly for the U.S. government. Already troubled by the corruption he had encountered with the Nuke incident in New York City,[104] Rogers chooses instead to resign his identity,[105][106] and then takes the alias of "the Captain".[107] A replacement Captain America, John Walker, struggles to emulate Rogers' ideals until pressure from hidden enemies helps to drive Walker insane. Rogers returns to the Captain America identity[108] while a recovered Walker becomes the U.S. Agent.[109]
