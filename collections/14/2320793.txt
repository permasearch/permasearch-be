Campbell's dwarf hamster has cheek pouches, which are an extension of the mouth, extending from the mouth all the way to the rear legs.[15] Food is transferred into these pouches through the diastema. The inside of the pouch contains a large number of folds of dermal papillae. When the pouch is full, it extends and becomes part of the structure of the skin.[16] By 11 days of age, the cheek pouches are fully grown and can carry objects up to the size of a sunflower seed.[17] When the cheek pouches become full, they extend back to the shoulder blades, which restrict movement.[15]
