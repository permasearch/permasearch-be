In February 1963, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) proposed a two-track tunnel for the New York City Subway, which would cross the East River at 76th Street. The location of the tunnel was changed several times thereafter.[30] Also in 1963, a new railroad terminal for the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) was being proposed in eastern Midtown Manhattan.[31]:17 (PDF p. 20) In 1965, the NYCTA finally decided to construct the tunnel at 63rd Street.[32] In April 1966, a third track was added to the plans for the subway tunnel. The track would serve LIRR trains to east Midtown, alleviating train traffic into Pennsylvania Station while integrating the LIRR with the subway.[33] A fourth track was added to the plans in August 1966 after it was determined that LIRR trains would be too big to run on subway tracks. This amendment increased the number of LIRR tracks to two, and provided dedicated tracks for the LIRR and the subway.[34]
