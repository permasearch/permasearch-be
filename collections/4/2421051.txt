Target operating models provide the vision for organisations undergoing change. The reason for any new TOM is likely to be a new strategy or new business model or a significant failure in the performance of the existing operations for one or more stakeholders. Hence TOM work should be closely linked to strategy work. Form follows function; in other words TOM follows strategy. Typically a TOM project also includes the roadmap over time that specifies what the company needs to do to move from the "as is" to the "to be".[5]
