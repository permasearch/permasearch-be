After the international success of their debut single, "I Want You", there were high expectations for the song as its follow-up. During the song's first charting in America, the song entered the Top 40 of the Hot 100 for only one week, peaking at #37 the final week of August 1997. In the United Kingdom, the single was originally released in late September 1997, and there it failed to chart in the Top 40, stalling at #55 for one week.
