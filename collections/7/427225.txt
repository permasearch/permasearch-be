Vasco da Gama, 1st Count of Vidigueira was the first European to reach India by sea. His initial voyage to India (1497â€“1499) was the first to link Europe and Asia by an ocean route, connecting the Atlantic and the Indian oceans and, in this way, the West and the East. He reached Goa on 11 September 1524 but died at Kochi three months later. His remains were eventually returned to Portugal and interred at St Jeronimos monastery.[2]
