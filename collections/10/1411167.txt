In August 2015, Universal announced that it would replace Disaster! with a new Fast & Furious attraction. It was later revealed that Universal would utilize it's new "virtual line" technology with the ride, allowing guests to select what time they would like to ride the attraction. It is set to open in Spring 2018.
