In July 2012, the Department of Health and Human Services released a memo notifying states that they are able to apply for a waiver for the work requirements of the TANF program. Critics claim the waiver would allow states to provide assistance without having to enforce the work component of the program.[25] The administration has stipulated that any waivers that weaken the work requirement will be rejected.[26] The DHHS granted the waivers after several Governors requested more state control.[27] The DHHS agreed to the waivers on the stipulation that they continue to meet all Federal requirements.[28] States were given the right to submit their own plans and reporting methods only if they continued to meet Federal requirements and if the state programs proved to be more effective.
