In several stories, enemies use the tracers to lure him into a trap. Enemies with sufficient technical knowledge can reprogram the tracers into overloading his spider-sense, making it hard for him to tell the difference between real danger and the tracer.[75] Or they just attune it to his sixth sense and they can simply put to a target of their own, just like Tracer did in "The Other".
