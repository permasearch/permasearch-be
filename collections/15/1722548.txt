The epiblast, a single epithelial layer blastodisc, is the source of all embryonic material in amniotes[1] and some of its cells will give rise to the primitive streak.[4] All cells in the epiblast can respond to signals from the marginal zone,[1] but once a given region is induced by these signals and undergoes streak formation, the remaining cells in the epiblast are no longer responsive to these inductive signals and prevent the formation of another streak.[5]
