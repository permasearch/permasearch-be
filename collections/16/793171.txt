During the early 1990s, the Order stated that it was entering the second stage of its development, in which it would leave behind its prior focus on recruitment and public outreach within the occult community and that it would instead focus on refining its teachings; its resulting quietness led some occultists to erroneously speculate that the ONA had become defunct.[47] In 2000, the ONA established a presence on the internet, using it as a medium to communicate with others and to distribute its writings.[10]   In 2008, the ONA announced that it was entering the third phase in its history, in which it would once again focus heavily on promotion, utilising such social media as online blogs, forums, Facebook, and YouTube to spread its message.[47] In 2011, the "Old Guard", a group of longstanding members of the Order, stated that they would withdraw from active, public work with the group.[48] In March 2012, Long announced that he would be withdrawing from public activity, although appears to have remained active in the Order.[13]
