The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay accused Hamas militants of violating international humanitarian law by "locating rockets within schools and hospitals, or even launching these rockets from densely populated areas."[362] The European Union condemned Hamas, and in particular condemned "calls on the civilian population of Gaza to provide themselves as human shields."[403][404] Confirmation of this practice was produced by correspondents from France24, The Financial Times, and RT, who respectively filmed a rocket launch pad which was placed in a civilian area next to a hotel where international journalists were staying,[405] reported on rockets being fired from near Al-Shifa Hospital, and reported on Hamas firing rockets near a hotel.[406] In September 2014, a Hamas official acknowledged to an Associated Press reporter that the group had fired rockets from civilian areas.[407]
