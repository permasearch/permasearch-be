On any bike with only rear wheel braking, the maximum deceleration is significantly lower than on a bike equipped with a front brake.[29] As a vehicle brakes, weight can be transferred towards the front wheel and away from the rear, decreasing the amount of grip the rear wheel has. Transferring the rider's weight back increases rear wheel braking efficiency, but a front wheel fitted with an ordinary brake might provide 70% or more of the braking power when braking hard.[citation needed]
