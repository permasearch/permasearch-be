The New Testament states Isaac was "offered up" by his father Abraham, and that Isaac blessed his sons.[27] Paul contrasted Isaac, symbolizing Christian liberty, with the rejected older son Ishmael, symbolizing slavery;[5][33] Hagar is associated with the Sinai covenant, while Sarah is associated with the covenant of grace, into which her son Isaac enters. The Epistle of James chapter 2, verses 21â€“24,[34] states that the sacrifice of Isaac shows that justification (in the Johannine sense) requires both faith and works.[35]
