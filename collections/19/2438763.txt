President Kennedy's motorcade route through Dallas with Johnson and Connally was planned to give him maximum exposure to local crowds prior to his arrival[19] for a luncheon at the Trade Mart, where he would meet with civic and business leaders. The White House staff informed the Secret Service that the President would arrive at Dallas Love Field via a short flight from Carswell Air Force Base in Fort Worth.[19][20]
