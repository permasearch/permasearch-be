The juxtaposition of huge agricultural surpluses and the many deaths due to insufficient food shocked many, as well as some of the administrative decisions that happened under the Agricultural Adjustment Act.[11] For example, in an effort to reduce agricultural surpluses, the government paid farmers to reduce crop production[12] and to sell pregnant sows as well as young pigs.[13] Oranges were being soaked with kerosene to prevent their consumption and corn was being burned as fuel because it was so cheap.[11] There were many people, however, as well as livestock in different places starving to death.[11] Farmers slaughtered livestock because feed prices were rising, and they could not afford to feed their own animals.[11] Under the Agricultural Adjustment Act, "plowing under" of pigs was also common to prevent them reaching a reproductive age, as well as donating pigs to the Red Cross.[11]
