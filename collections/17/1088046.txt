From at least the classical period, the number of Spartans was very small in comparison to that of the helots. In a celebrated passage, Thucydides stresses that "most Spartan institutions have always been designed with a view to security against the Helots".[13] Aristotle compares them to "an enemy constantly sitting in wait of the disaster of the Spartans".[14] Consequently, fear seems to be an important factor governing relations between Spartans and Helots. According to tradition, the Spartiates always carried their spears, undid the straps of their bucklers only when at home lest the Helots seize them, and locked themselves in their homes.[15] They also took active measures, subjecting them to what Theopompus describes as "an altogether cruel and bitter condition".[16]
