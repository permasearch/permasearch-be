Kramnik played to defend his title at the World Chess Championship 2007 in Mexico. This was an 8-player double round robin tournament, the same format as was used for the FIDE World Chess Championship 2005. This tournament was won by Viswanathan Anand, thus making him the World Chess Champion. Because Anand's World Chess Champion title was won in a tournament rather than a match, a minority of commentators questioned the validity of his title.[62] Kramnik also made ambiguous comments about the value of Anand's title, but did not claim the title himself.[63] Subsequent world championship matches returned to the format of a match between the champion and a challenger.
