A study by James N. Druckman and Lawrence R. Jacobs discusses how Presidents collect their information for policymaking. They found that on one hand, they collect data about the public’s preference on salient matters like crime and economy. This reflects a populist type of democracy where the government portrays respect toward the people’s views and they are connected. On the other hand, government institutions and elites believe the general populations’ understanding of certain issued is limited, therefore they exercise autonomy when making these decisions.[33][32]
