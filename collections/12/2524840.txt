The Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons was established in October 2001 as a result of the passing of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000. This enabling legislation required the President to create a bureau within the State Department to specifically address human trafficking and exploitation on all levels and to take legal action against perpetrators. Additionally, this act was designed to also enforce all laws within the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution that apply.
