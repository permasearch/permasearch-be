Muslims believe that the verses of the Quran were revealed to Muhammad by God through the archangel Gabriel (JibrÄ«l) on many occasions between 610 CE until his death on June 8, 632.[71] While Muhammad was alive, all of these revelations were written down by his companions (sahabah), although the prime method of transmission was orally through memorization.[72]
