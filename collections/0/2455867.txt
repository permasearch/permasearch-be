Aiden makes it to the river by confusing the pack, using his blood to spread his scent and making it harder for them to track him. Gabriel, angry that Aiden has escaped, attempts to follow him to kill him anyway. Vivian helps to protect Aiden by throwing Gabriel off his scent. Not recognizing Vivian in wolf form, Aiden strikes her with a silver knife. Vivian starts to bleed to death, quickly requiring an antidote to silver poisoning.
