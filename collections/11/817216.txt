The number of letters in the Latin alphabet has varied. When it was first derived from the Etruscan alphabet, it contained only 21 letters.[43] Later, G was added to represent /รยก/, which had previously been spelled C, and Z ceased to be included in the alphabet, as the language then had no voiced alveolar fricative.[44] The letters Y and Z were later added to represent Greek letters, upsilon and zeta respectively, in Greek loanwords.[44]
