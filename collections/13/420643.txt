Mulan's opening weekend box office gross revenues were $22.8 million,[2] making it the second-highest grossing movie that week, behind only The X-Files.[60] It went on to gross $120 million in the U.S. and Canada combined, and $304 million worldwide, making it the second-highest grossing family film of the year, behind A Bug's Life, and the seventh-highest grossing film of the year overall.[61] While Mulan domestically outgrossed the two Disney films which had preceded it, The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Hercules, its box office returns failed to match those of the Disney films of the early 1990s such as Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King.[62] Internationally, its highest grossing releases included those in the United Kingdom ($14.6 million) and France ($10.2 million).[63]
