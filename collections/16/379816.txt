South Carolina's swampy wetlands also made it a prime area for the cultivation of rice.[29] In the 1700s, the South Carolina economy was based upon the exportation of rice from its tidewater region. The first attempts at cultivation were failures, and South Carolinian planters began to pay premiums to have slaves imported from specific regions in Africa where rice was grown.[30]
