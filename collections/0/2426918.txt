The hotel, designed by architect Martin Stern, Jr.,[4] was built in 1969 by Kirk Kerkorian and opened originally as the International Hotel. Upon opening, the International was the largest hotel in the world. Barbra Streisand was the opening-night performer, along with Peggy Lee performing afterwards in the hotel's lounge.
