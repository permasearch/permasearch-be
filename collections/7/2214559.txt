Announced on November 24, 2007, the XPS 720 is the same as the XPS 720 H2C, except it does not have the "dual-stage radiator cooling technology." It comes in two versions, the Red Special Edition, which is the same as the Black normal one, they both come with a 1Â kW power supply. This is now not available in the UK. Like the XPS 720 H2C this is only available in the U.S. through Dell Outlet.
