The war caused serious dislocations to both the economies and populations of central Europe, but may have done no more than seriously exacerbate changes that had begun earlier.[90][91] Also, some historians contend that the human cost of the war may actually have improved the living standards of the survivors.[92] According to Ulrich Pfister, Germany was one of the richest countries in Europe per capita in 1500, but ranked far lower in 1600. Then, it recovered during the 1600â€“1660 period, in part thanks to the demographic shock of the Thirty Years' War.
