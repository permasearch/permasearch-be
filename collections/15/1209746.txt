Drawing from federal and state law definitions, the term assault weapon refers primarily to semi-automatic rifles, pistols, and shotguns that are able to accept detachable magazines and possess one or more other features.[2][9][10] Some jurisdictions define revolving cylinder shotguns as assault weapons.[11][12] Legislative definitions do not include fully automatic weapons, which are regulated separately as Title II weapons under federal law.[13][n 1] A key defining law was the now-defunct Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994.[13] At that time, the United States Department of Justice said, "In general, assault weapons are semiautomatic firearms with a large magazine of ammunition that were designed and configured for rapid fire and combat use."[3]
