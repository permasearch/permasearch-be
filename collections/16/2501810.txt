Each board is responsible for assigning a rating to films, and while most movies will likely obtain the same rating, there can be differences.  For instance, the film The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning was rated 18A in Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario while Manitoba and the Maritimes gave the film an R and Quebec gave the film a 16+ (it was R in the USA). Also, Deadpool (film) was rated 14A in Alberta, British Columbia & Saskatchewan and rated 18A in Ontario & Manitoba while Deadpool 2 was rated 18A in Ontario & British Columbia and 14A in Alberta & Manitoba.
