One of the limitations of the Arrhenius definition is its reliance on water solutions. Edward Curtis Franklin studied the acidâ€“base reactions in liquid ammonia in 1905 and pointed out the similarities to the water-based Arrhenius theory. Albert F. O. Germann, working with liquid phosgene, COCl2, formulated the solvent-based theory in 1925, thereby generalizing the Arrhenius definition to cover aprotic solvents.[21]
