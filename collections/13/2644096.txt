Historically, the chain's highest grossing location is at Haymarket Leicester Square, which opened in 1992 in Central London. The Haymarket branch is also regarded as the 'most popular' branch as well as being financially most successful. In October 2009, Haymarket broke the world record for biggest profit made in any week, throughout TGI Fridays' history, and has also been home to several past winners from the bartenders Olympics, a contest started by Dan Scoggin.[12]
