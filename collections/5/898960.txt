By this point, it was widely accepted that Kenyan independence was inevitable, with the British Empire having been dismantled throughout much of Asia and British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan having made his "Wind of Change" speech.[222] In January 1960, the British government made its intentions for Kenya to transition to independence and majority-rule clear.[223] It invited representatives of the Kenyan anti-colonial movement to discuss the transition at London's Lancaster House. An agreement was reached that an election would be called for a new 65-seat Legislative Council, with 33 seats reserved for black Africans, 20 for other ethnic groups, and 12 as 'national members' elected by a pan-racial electorate.[195] It was clear to all concerned that Kenyatta was going to be the key to the future of Kenyan politics.[224]
