In 2006, Padr贸n retired from MDC. He collected $893,286 in lump sum benefits and started receiving retirement pay of $14,631 a month. One month later, Padr贸n returned to his position at the college and was receiving his annual salary again. This practice, which has been undertaken by a number of Florida public officials, has been criticized by local media sources as "double dipping". Padr贸n's spokesperson said that college trustees asked Padr贸n to come back after he had announced his retirement. The spokesperson said that the practice is legal.[7][8][4]
