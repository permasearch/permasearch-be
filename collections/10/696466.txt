Washington nominated William Paterson for the Supreme Court on February 27, 1793.[4] The nomination was withdrawn by the President the following day. Washington had realized that since the law establishing the positions within the Supreme Court had been passed during Paterson's term as a Senator (a post he had resigned in November 1790 after being elected Governor of New Jersey) the nomination was a violation of Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution. Washington re-nominated Paterson to the Court on March 4, 1793, after Paterson's term as Senator had expired, and Paterson was confirmed by the Senate.[4]
