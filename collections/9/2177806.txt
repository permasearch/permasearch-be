Mukunda Deva (also known as Mukunda Harichandana)[72] came to throne, in 1559, in a bloody coup. According to the Madala Panji (temple records), he was a Chalukya.[72] During this period, Odisha was going through many internal conflicts. Mukunda stuck an alliance with Akbar, that he made him a foe of Sulaiman Khan Karrani, the ruler of Bengal. Sulaiman sent his son, Bayazid Khan Karrani and his infamous general, Kalapahad, to conquer Odisha, in 1567.
