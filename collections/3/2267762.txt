In North America, Brazil nuts are sometimes known by the epithet "nigger toes,"[8] though the term has fallen out of favor as public use of the racial slur became increasingly unacceptable by the 1960s. They can be seen being sold in a market under this name in a scene from the 1922 Stan Laurel film The Pest.
