The word raga refers to the "color"[28] and, more specifically, the emotion or mood produced by a combination or sequence of pitches.[29] A raga is composed of a series of melodic motifs, based upon a definite scale or mode of the seven Swara psalmizations,[30] that provide a basic structure around which the musician performs. Some ragas may be associated with times of the day and year.[27] There are 31 main ragas in the Sikh system, divided into 14 ragas and 17 raginis (minor or less definite ragas), 31 mishrat ragas in 17 taala. Within the raga division, the songs are arranged in order of the Sikh gurus and Sikh bhagats with whom they are associated.
