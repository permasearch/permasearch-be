It is International Week at Zack and Cody's school. A Japanese singer (Kumiko Mori as herself) visits the Tipton, and Zack uses her for his school project. When Zack loses the singer at school, Carey, Cody, and Zack end up performing for a large Japanese audience, until Kumiko returns. Meanwhile, London allows Maddie to select some of her old clothes in her closet. But the doorknob broke off the door, locking London and Maddie inside it.
