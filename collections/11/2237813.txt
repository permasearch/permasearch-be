In 1926, Chu Chia-hua invited Max Bauer to survey investment possibilities in China and the next year Bauer arrived in Guangzhou and was offered a post as Chiang Kai-shek's advisor. Soon, he managed to recruit 46 other German officers to advise and train nationalist forces, while he devised the strategy that allowed the nationalist to win its 1929 campaigns against the warlords.[10] In 1928, Bauer returned to Germany recruit a permanent advisory mission for China industrialisation efforts. However, Bauer was not entirely successful as many firms hesitated because of China's political instability, and because Bauer was persona non grata for his participation in the 1920 Kapp Putsch. In addition, Germany was still constrained by the Treaty of Versailles, which made direct military investment impossible. Max Bauer contracted smallpox after his return to China, died and was buried in Shanghai.[11] Bauer's provided the foundation for later Sino-German cooperation. He argued for the reduction of the Chinese army to produce a small but elite force, and supported opening up the Chinese market to spur German production and exports.
