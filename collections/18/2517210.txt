Amy develops an on-off relationship with Paul's rival Leo Tanaka (Tim Kano), as she helps him and his brother David Tanaka (Takaya Honda) to find their father.[18] Of Amy and Leo's early relationship, Cramond said "I think there's something that draws her towards him but he just keeps letting her down and that's kind of a repetition of all the men in Amy's life."[18] Leo pursues Amy for a number weeks and she initially resists his advances, until he finally persuades her to go out on a date with him.[19] Amy and Leo have a good time, until Elly Conway (Jodi Anasta) interrupts the date and reveals that she and Leo had a bet about whether he could get Amy to go out with him by Christmas.[19] Kano commented that Amy was "furious and heartbroken" by Leo's actions. Amy thought the relationship was going somewhere and she feels let down and embarrassed.[19]
