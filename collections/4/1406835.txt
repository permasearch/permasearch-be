Affleck's first starring film role was as an aimless art student in the college drama Glory Daze (1995), with Stephen Holden of The New York Times remarking that his "affably mopey performance finds just the right balance between obnoxious and sad sack".[43] He then played a bully in filmmaker Kevin Smith's comedy Mallrats (1995), and became friends with Smith during the filming. Affleck began to worry that he would be relegated to a career of "throwing people into their lockers",[35] but Smith put him in the lead role in Smith's romantic comedy Chasing Amy (1997).[4][35] The film was Affleck's breakthrough.[35] Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised Affleck's "wonderful ease" playing the role, combining "suave good looks with cool comic timing".[44] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly described it as a "wholesome and quick-witted" performance.[45] When Affleck starred as a recently returned Korean War veteran in the coming-of-age drama Going All the Way (1997), Todd McCarthy of Variety found him "excellent",[46] while Janet Maslin of The New York Times noted that his "flair for comic self-doubt made a strong impression."[47]
