Temple structures were built on foundations of stone slabs set into sand-filled trenches.[92] Walls and other structures were built with large blocks of varying shapes.[93][Note 5] The blocks were laid in courses, usually without mortar. Each stone was dressed to fit with its neighbors, producing cuboid blocks whose uneven shapes interlocked.[94] The interiors of walls were often built with less care, using rougher, poorer-quality stones.[95] To build structures above ground level, the workers used construction ramps. When cutting chambers in living rock, workers excavated from the top down, carving a crawlspace near the ceiling and cutting down to the floor.[96] Once the temple structure was complete, the rough faces of the stones were dressed to create a smooth surface. In decorating these surfaces, reliefs were carved into the stone or, if the stone was of too poor quality to carve, a layer of plaster that covered the stone surface.[97] Reliefs were then decorated with gilding, inlay, or paint.[98] The paints were usually mixtures of mineral pigments with some kind of adhesive, possibly natural gum.[97]
