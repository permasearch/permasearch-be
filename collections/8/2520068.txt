The human and mouse reference genomes are maintained and improved by the Genome Reference Consortium (GRC), a group of fewer than 20 scientists from a number of genome research institutes, including the European Bioinformatics Institute, the National Center for Biotechnology Information, the Sanger Institute and McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University in St. Louis. GRC continues to improve reference genomes by building new alignments that contain fewer gaps, and fixing misrepresentations in the sequence.
