Griffith won her role as Katie Connor, on the 2007 television series Damages,[3] after taking a last-minute audition one month after moving to New York City. The role saw her with an imitated American accent; she says "[the producers] were a little concerned at first about a Brit playing an American, especially because they already had an Australian (Rose Byrne) playing an American,"[4] and so Griffith addressed them in an American accent from the beginning to the end of the audition.[1] Griffith returned to the series as a main cast member for the second season, which aired in 2009.
