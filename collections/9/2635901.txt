A 10th-century soapstone mold found at TrendgÃ¥rden, Jutland, Denmark is notable for allowing the casting of both crucifix and Thor's hammer pendants.[14] A silver specimen found near Fossi, Iceland (now in the National Museum of Iceland) can be interpreted as either a Christian cross or a Thor's hammer. Unusually, the elongated limb of the cross ends in a beast's (perhaps a wolf's) head.
