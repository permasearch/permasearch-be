During the three years Patrick spent in the United Kingdom, she raced in Formula Vauxhall and Formula Ford,[9] coming ninth in points in the 1999 British Formula Vauxhall Championship.[4] She competed for Haywood Racing in Formula Ford and was the lead test driver for Mygale.[16] Patrick was uncompetitive in Formula Ford, claiming the equipment she received was of poor quality.[13] Nevertheless, she came second in the 2000 Formula Ford Festival at Brands Hatch with Haywood Racing, tying Danny Sullivan's best performance by an American in the event.[4] That strong result led to her receiving a Formula Three test with Carlin in 2001. Jaguar Racing team principal Bobby Rahal organized a second test for her with the expectation it would lead to her being put in the Paul Stewart Racing development program, but it was cancelled in the summer of 2001, after new owner Niki Lauda fired Rahal.[5][18] That year, she was awarded the Gorsline Scholarship Award as the most aspiring road course competitor and was recognized as the top female open wheel race car driver with experience on the international scene.[7]
