Rural India contains over 68% of India's total population,[30] and half of all residents of rural areas live below the poverty line, struggling for better and easy access to health care and services.[31] Health issues confronted by rural people are many and diverse â€“ from severe malaria to uncontrolled diabetes, from a badly infected wound to cancer.[32] Postpartum maternal illness is a serious problem in resource-poor settings and contributes to maternal mortality, particularly in rural India.[33] A study conducted in 2009 found that 43.9% of mothers reported they experienced postpartum illnesses six weeks after delivery.[34] Furthermore, because of limited government resources, much of the health care provided comes from non profits such as The MINDS Foundation.[35]
