Koufax was born in Brooklyn, New York, to a Jewish family, and raised in Borough Park.[8] His parents, Evelyn (nÃ©e Lichtenstein) and Jack Braun, divorced when he was three years old. His mother was remarried when he was nine, to Irving Koufax.[9] Shortly after his mother's remarriage, the family moved to the Long Island suburb of Rockville Centre. Before tenth grade, Koufax's family moved back to the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn.[10]
