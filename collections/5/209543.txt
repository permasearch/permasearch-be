Netbooks, also called mini notebooks or subnotebooks, are a subgroup of laptops[40] acting as a category of small, lightweight and inexpensive laptop computers suited for general computing tasks and accessing web-based applications. They are often marketed as "companion devices", with an intention to augment other ways in which a user can access computer resources.[40] Walt Mossberg called them a "relatively new category of small, light, minimalist and cheap laptops."[41] By August 2009, CNET called netbooks "nothing more than smaller, cheaper notebooks."[40] Initially, the primary defining characteristic of netbooks was the lack of an optical disc drive, requiring it to be a separate external device. This has become less important as flash memory devices have gradually increased in capacity, replacing the writable optical disc (e.g. CD-RW, DVD-RW) as a transportable storage medium.
