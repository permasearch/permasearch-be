The full hybrid system combines a 2.5-liter Atkinson cycle gasoline engine with a powerful electric motor, a high voltage generator, a 204 cell nickel–metal hydride battery located under the rear seats, a power control unit, and a power split device. RAV4 Hybrids are available in both front and all-wheel drive variants. The all-wheel edition comes equipped with a second, 50 kW high-voltage, rear mounted electric motor that offers increased traction and a 1,750-pound (790 kg) towing capacity. The rear's electric motor is capable of operating independently from the hybrid system front's electric motor, driving the rear wheels alone.[38]
