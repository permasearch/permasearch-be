On June 10, 2016, CMT announced that they would pick up the primetime network series Nashville after ABC's cancellation of the series, and renewed the series for a fifth full season of 22 episodes; it will continue to be streamed beginning the day after an episode's first airing on Hulu.[16] In 2017, when the network announced a transition into an unscripted programming-oriented schedule, Nashville's sixth season (which CMT renewed) would also be its last; Nashville was CMT's last original scripted show at the time.[17][18]
