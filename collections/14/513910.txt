The United States Army Air Assault School, officially the Sabalauski Air Assault School (TSAAS), is a FORSCOM TDA unit located at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. Its primary task is training leaders and soldiers assigned to the 101st Airborne Division (AASLT), other United States Army units and United States Armed Forces service members in several courses annually. The school is named for Command Sergeant Major Walter James Sabalauski. Air Assault School is known as the ten toughest days in the United States Army and the dropout rate is around 50 percent.[1] Approximately 15 percent of the class does not make it through the challenging Zero day which includes the demanding obstacle course.[2] An average of approximately 30-40 students fail the course of those who make it past "Zero" day. Of those who fail after Zero day, many typically don't make it through the sling load testing in phase two.[3]
