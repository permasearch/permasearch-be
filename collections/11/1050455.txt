The Book of Zechariah twice mentions colored horses; in the first passage there are three colors (red, speckled/brown, and white),[47] and in the second there are four teams of horses (red, black, white, and finally dappled/"grisled and bay") pulling chariots.[48] The second set of horses are referred to as "the four spirits of heaven, going out from standing in the presence of the Lord of the whole world."[48] They are described as patrolling the earth, and keeping it peaceful. It may be assumed that when the tribulation begins, the peace is taken away, so their job is to terrify the places in which they patrol.[3]
