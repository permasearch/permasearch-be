As the volumes of gold ore increased, the engineers constructed small, local hydro-electric plants to generate electricity for the electric tramway and the ore crushers at the reduction works, built in 1897.[2] In 1911 the 2,000 kW Belvedere power station (at 24°39′18″S 30°50′12″E﻿ / ﻿24.65500°S 30.83667°E﻿ / -24.65500; 30.83667﻿ (Belvedere power station)) was completed on the Blyde River, some 30 km to the east. It supplied hydro-electric power to Pilgrim's Rest and adjacent communities up to 1992.[3] Pilgrim's Rest was southern Africa's second town with street electricity, the first being Kimberley, also a mining town.[2]
