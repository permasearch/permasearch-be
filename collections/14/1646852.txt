All of the enzymes for the citric acid cycle are in the matrix (e.g. citrate synthase, iso-citrate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, fumarase, and malate dehydrogenase) except for succinate dehydrogenase which is on the inner membrane and is part of protein complex II in the electron transport chain. The cycle produces coenzymes NADH and FADH2 through the oxidation of carbons in two cycles. The oxidation of NADH and FADH2 produces GTP from succinyl-CoA synthetase.[2]
