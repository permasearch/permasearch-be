In 1990, thanks to the generosity of Penny Cook, daughter of then Senator John Tower, who wrote them a check for $10,000 so that they could record an album, the Dixie Chicks recorded their first studio album, Thank Heavens for Dale Evans, named after the pioneering, multi-talented performer Dale Evans.[7] They paid $5,000 for the 14-track album.[8] The album included two instrumental tunes. In 1987, Maguire (still known then as Martie Erwin) had won second place, and in 1989, third place in the National fiddle championships held at the Walnut Valley Festival in Winfield, Kansas.[9]  A Christmas single was released at the end of the year â€“ a 45 RPM vinyl record titled Home on the Radar Range, with "Christmas Swing" on one side and the song on the flip side named "The Flip Side".  The record titles were significant; during that period of time, the bandmates dressed up as "cowgirls", and publicity photos reflected this image.  However, even with an appearance at the Grand Ole Opry,[10] with few exceptions, such as Garrison Keillor's radio show A Prairie Home Companion,[11] they didn't get much national airplay.
