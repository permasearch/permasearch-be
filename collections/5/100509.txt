Saudi Arabia has been seen as a moderating influence in the Arabâ€“Israeli conflict, periodically putting forward a peace plan between Israel and the Palestinians and condemning Hezbollah.[249] Following the Arab Spring Saudi Arabia offered asylum to deposed President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia and King Abdullah telephoned President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt (prior to his deposition) to offer his support.[250] In early 2014 relations with Qatar became strained over its support for the Muslim Brotherhood, and Saudi Arabia's belief that Qatar was interfering in its affairs. In August 2014 both countries appeared to be exploring ways of ending the rift.[251]
