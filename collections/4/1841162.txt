After her marriage, Duncan split her time mostly between England and India, often spending much of it alone in rented flats in Kensington, London. The travelling was necessitated by her continued writing commitments in several countries.[7] There had been plans for her and Everard to return permanently to England in 1894, but these came to nothing: her husband reinvented himself as a journalist and edited the Calcutta-based Indian Daily News in 1894â€“97, later becoming managing director of the Eastern News Agency. Although Marian Fowler, a biographer, argued that the couple's marriage was unhappy, hers is not the accepted view. Duncan certainly supported her husband in various work-related endeavours. She also cultivated a friendship with James Louis Garvin while he was editor of The Outlook and The Observer, at least in part hoping he might find a position for Everard in Britain.[3][8][9] Warkentin suggests that theirs may have been "one of those marriages in which a difficult woman and a gentle, agreeable man made common cause".[10]
