The western edge of Newark Bay was originally the Newark Meadows, shallow tidal wetlands covering about 12 square miles (31Â km2). In the 1910s, the city of Newark began excavating an angled shipping channel in the northeastern quadrant of the wetland. This became the basis of Port Newark.[5][6] Work on the channel and terminal facilities on its north side accelerated during World War I, when the federal government took control of Port Newark. During the war, nearly 25,000 troops were stationed at the Newark Bay Shipyard.[7]
