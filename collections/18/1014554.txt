Radio astronomy was founded with the work of Karl Jansky in the early 1930s, while working for Bell Labs. He built a radio antenna to look at potential sources of interference for transatlantic radio transmissions. One of the sources of noise discovered came not from Earth, but from the center of the Milky Way, in the constellation Sagittarius.[10] In 1942, JS Hey captured the sun's radio frequency using military radar receivers.[1]:26 Radio spectroscopy started with the discovery of the 21-centimeter HÂ I line in 1951.
