The Andaman islands have been inhabited for several thousand years, at the very least. The earliest archaeological evidence yet documented goes back some 2,200 years; however, the indications from genetic, cultural and isolation studies suggest that the islands may have been inhabited as early as the Middle Paleolithic.[5] The indigenous Andamanese people appear to have lived on the islands in substantial isolation from that time until the 18th century CE.
