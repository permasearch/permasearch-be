On 10 August, Lance Corporal Matthew David Smith, aged 26 from the Corps of Royal Engineers, was part of a troop that had been tasked to build a new checkpoint next to the Nahr-e Bughra canal in the Nad-e-Ali district of Helmand province when he was hit by small arms fire. He received immediate first aid before being evacuated by helicopter but, despite all efforts to save him, he sadly died of his wounds.
