A special prime time edition of Hot Seat aired at 8:00 pm on Monday, 8 June 2009,[10] featuring a contestant, Barry Soraghan, playing for the format's first million-dollar question.[11] Ultimately, Soraghan answered the question incorrectly, and won only $1,000.[11] At the completion of the taped episode, Soraghan was visited live on air at his Blackburn home by McGuire,[11] who then awarded him a two-week holiday for him and his family, as well as $5,000 in spending money.[11] The episode achieved a ratings figure of 1,224,000 viewers nationally,[12] and was the eleventh-highest rating program for the night,[12] which was a vast improvement from the 812,000 viewers that Hot Seat managed in its regular timeslot on the same night.[12]
