Debs was noted by many to be a charismatic speaker who sometimes called on the vocabulary of Christianity and much of the oratorical style of evangelism â€“ even though he was generally disdainful of organized religion.[36] It has been said, that Debs was what every socialist and radical should be; fierce in his convictions, but kind and compassionate in his personal relations.[37] As Heywood Broun noted in his eulogy for Debs, quoting a fellow Socialist: "That old man with the burning eyes actually believes that there can be such a thing as the brotherhood of man. And that's not the funniest part of it. As long as he's around I believe it myself."[38]
