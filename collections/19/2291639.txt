Mary Mae Ward showed up in Port Charles after Laura Spencer bought the Ward House. Mary Mae and Laura became instant friends and ran an orphanage out of the Ward House. After her son Bradley Ward was found dead in Luke and Laura Spencer's yard, Mary Mae's grandson Justus and granddaughter Keesha came to Port Charles to attend Bradley's funeral. Bradley had been murdered, but who killed him? Keesha began dating the young, rich Jason Quartermaine. Mary Mae and Edward Quartermaine, both grandparents of the teens, weren't happy about the two dating each other. Soon all evidence of Bradley's death was pointing to Edward as the murderer. Edward was arrested and charged. He swore on his life to Mary Mae that he was not her son's killer. Mary Mae knew it and revealed during her testimony that Bradley was Edward's son. Edward had wartime romance with Mary Mae when she was a blue singer years ago which resulted in the conception of Bradley. Edward was later acquitted.
