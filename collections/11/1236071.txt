2010 ended with a home friendly against France, another familiar side who had also performed dismally at the World Cup, and were struggling to return to normal. England were outplayed and outclassed from start to finish, and France took a deserved 2â€“1 victory. England's fans booed the players off at the end of the game, bringing the curtain down on a troubled year for the team, which most media critics dubbed as "the worst season ever".
