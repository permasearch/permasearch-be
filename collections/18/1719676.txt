The company had its first national press advertisement in 1934, and entered formally into retailing in 1937 through the acquisition of Abbotts chain of shops based around London and the provinces. "Peter Lord" was created by Hugh Bryan Clark as a retail brand to avoid alarming agents or alerting competitors to the companyâ€™s activities. It steadily evolved into a national network of stores.
