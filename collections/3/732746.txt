As of November 2014, over 1500 mobile models accounting for 700 million units were shipped globally in 2014, using MediaTek chips, and the company posted revenues of US$5.3 billion in the first half of 2014, nearly as much as the whole of 2013.[16] The revenue growth was however partly due to revenue recognition from the acquisition of MStar which became effective at the beginning of 2014.[17]
