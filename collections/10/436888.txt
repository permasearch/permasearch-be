Changes for the 1976 model year included fuel economy improvements that also reduced emissions and reduced warmup time.[8] This was accomplished by reshaped carburetor air passages that pushed the fuel efficiency of a 232-equipped AMC Gremlin to 30 mpg‑US (7.8 L/100 km; 36 mpg‑imp) as tested by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, compared to 24 mpg‑US (9.8 L/100 km; 29 mpg‑imp) in 1975.[8]
