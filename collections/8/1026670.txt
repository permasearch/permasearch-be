"I don't know if you [the class] know what a screen test is, you haven't got the part yet. [...] You stand in front of (sic) a green screen in costume, hair, make-up, everything as if you got the part. And then they stand you next to whoever you'll be filming with. So, I stood next to Benedict [Clarke]. And I also stood next to Ariella [Paradise]. And so I stood there in hair, and make-up and everything and after that, [I] got off [for] a couple of hours and I was wearing contacts, [they] took the contacts out, put them in, had my hair up, put it down again..."[57][58][59]
