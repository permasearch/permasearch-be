Despite its original symbolism, in Northern Ireland the tricolour, along with most other markers of either British or Irish identity, has come to be a symbol of division.[42] The Ulster Unionist Party Government of Northern Ireland adopted the Ulster Banner (based on the flag of Ulster) in 1953.[45] Thus it is this flag and the Union Flag that are flown by unionists and loyalists, while the tricolour is flown by nationalists and republicans.[42] In Northern Ireland, each community uses its own flags, murals and other symbols to declare its allegiance and mark its territory, often in a manner that is deliberately provocative.[46] Kerb-stones in unionist and loyalist areas are often painted red, white and blue,[47] while in nationalist and republican areas kerb-stones may be painted green, white and orange, although this is a much less frequent occurrence.[48] Elements of both communities fly "their" flag from chimneys, tall buildings and lamp-posts on roads.[49]
