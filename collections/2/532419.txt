The series of events propagated by Richard come to a head. He is captured by the farmers, who know that he has been stalking them, and brought before the community. The farmers have also found the map that Richard had given the (now dead) Americans, furious with the community for breaking their deal to not allow anymore newcomers. Richard's part in the sexual betrayals of Françoise, Étienne and Bugs has already frayed the community's cohesion. The lead farmer gives Sal a gun loaded with a single bullet and orders her to make a choice: kill Richard and the group will be allowed to stay, or else they must all leave immediately. Sal pulls the trigger, but the chamber is empty. Shocked by her willingness to commit murder, the community abandons Sal, leaving the island and going their separate ways.
