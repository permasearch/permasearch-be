Note:     cos ⁡  θ  1     {\displaystyle \cos \theta _{1}}   must be positive, which it will be if n is the normal vector that points from the surface toward the side where the light is coming from, the region with index      n  1     {\displaystyle n_{1}}  . If     cos ⁡  θ  1     {\displaystyle \cos \theta _{1}}   is negative, then n points to the side without the light, so start over with n replaced by its negative.
