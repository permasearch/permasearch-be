The first Winter Olympic Games were held in 1924 in Chamonix, France.[10] Chapter 1, article 6, of the 2007 edition of the Olympic Charter defines winter sports as "sports which are practised on snow or ice".[11] Ice hockey and figure skating were permanently integrated in the Winter Olympics programme.[12] The IOC made the Winter Games a permanent fixture and they were held the same year as the Summer Games until 1992. Following that, further Winter Games have been held on the third year of each Olympiad.[13]
