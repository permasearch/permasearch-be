We would be one as now we join in singing, Our hymn of love, to pledge ourselves anew. To that high cause of greater understanding Of who we are, and what in us is true. We would be one in living for each other, To show to all a new community.  We would be one in building for tomorrow A nobler world than we have known today. We would be one in searching for that meaning Which binds our hearts and points us on our way. As one, we pledge ourselves to greater service, With love and justice, strive to make us free.[6]
