The Modular Sleep System (MSS) is a sleeping bag kit used by the United States Army and manufactured by Tennier Industries. It consists of a camouflaged, waterproof, breathable bivy cover, a lightweight patrol sleeping bag, and an intermediate cold-weather sleeping bag (note that the color differs depending on the vintage of the gear). Compression sacks are included to store and carry the system. The MSS is available in a variety of camouflage patterns. The patrol bag provides weather protection from 35–50 °F (2–10 °C). The intermediate bag provides cold weather protection from −5–35 °F (−21–2 °C). Combining the patrol bag and intermediate bags provides extreme cold weather protection in temperatures as low as −30 °F (−34 °C). The bivy cover can be used with each of three MSS configurations (patrol, intermediate, or combined) to provide environmental protection from wind and water. The sleeping bags are made of ripstop nylon fabrics and continuous-filament polyester insulation; the camouflage bivy cover is made with waterproof, breathable, coated or laminated nylon fabric; the compression sacks are made with water-resistant and durable nylon fabrics.[61]
