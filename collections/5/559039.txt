The earliest archaeological evidence yet documented goes back some 2,200 years. However, genetic and cultural studies suggest that the indigenous Andamanese people may have been isolated from other populations since some time during the Middle Paleolithic, which ended 30,000 years ago.[6] Since that time, the Andamanese have diversified into distinct linguistic, cultural and territorial groups.
