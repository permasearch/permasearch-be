In addition to its military role, it is increasingly used by hunters and civilian long-range shooting enthusiasts. The .338 Lapua Magnum is capable of taking down any game animal, though its suitability for some dangerous game (Cape buffalo, hippopotamus, white rhinoceros, and elephant) is arguable, unless accompanied by a larger "backup" calibre: "There is a huge difference between calibres that will kill an elephant and those that can be relied upon to stop one."[6] In Namibia the .338 Lapua Magnum is legal for hunting Africa's Big five game if the loads have ≥ 5,400 J (3,983 ft⋅lbf) muzzle energy.[7]
