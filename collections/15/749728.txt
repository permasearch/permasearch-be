Giving the album three of five stars, Chris Pearson of The Times praised Nat King Cole & Me: "It took Nat King Cole half his career to graduate from small groups to string orchestras. Gregory Porter has managed it in just five albums... Some of Vince Mendoza's arrangements are so close to the originals that it's a jolt when a different voice enters."[20] Gareth Hipwell of Rolling Stone Australia gave the album a four star rating, declaring "Porter distils the wide-screen cinematic romance of the Forties, Fifties and Sixties, mantling his celebrated, honeyed baritone in glistening updrafts of strings, horns and woodwind".[21] Keith Bruce of The Glasgow Herald wrote that "[Porter] sings the Cole canon superbly [but] the arrangements and production of Vince Mendoza – and the playing of a London studio ensemble – are what really lift this 12-song collection". Bruce also felt that Porter's rendition of The Christmas Song "should certainly be this Yuletide's chart-topper".[22]
