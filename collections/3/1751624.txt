Sea anemones are found in both deep oceans and shallow coastal waters worldwide. The greatest diversity is in the tropics although there are many species adapted to relatively cold waters. The majority of species cling on to rocks, shells or submerged timber, often hiding in cracks or under seaweed, but some burrow into sand and mud, and a few are pelagic.[1]
