There is no general right to privacy in English law.[148] Attempts to establish such a right in Kaye v Robertson and Wainwright v Home Office were rejected on the basis that it could only be done by Parliament.[149] The creation of a tort of infringement of privacy had been recommended by Sir David Calcutt in his Review of Press Self-Regulation published in 1993,[150] but no action was taken.[151] Instead, a patchwork of different torts combine to protect certain aspects of privacy,[152] such as breach of confidence and misuse of private information.[153] In Campbell v Mirror Group Newspapers Ltd, the House of Lords confirmed that a person will be subject to a duty of confidence if they receive information in circumstances where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy and where there is no justification for interference with that right to privacy.[154] This was followed by Douglas v Hello! Ltd where a magazine was successfully sued for publishing unauthorised photographs of a celebrity wedding.[citation needed][nb 3]
