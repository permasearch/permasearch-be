In Marine aircraft squadrons MSgts usually serve as NCOICs of the ordnance and avionics divisions in the aircraft maintenance department. The Aircraft Maintenance Chief/NCOIC is usually a MGySgt (q.v.), and there are eight aviation-related MSgt billets in each Marine Aviation Logistics Squadron (MALS). (A MALs is organic to each Marine Aircraft Group (MAG) and performs intermediate aviation supply, aircraft maintenance (including aviation life support equipment and avionics), and aviation ordnance support for its supported aircraft squadrons.)
