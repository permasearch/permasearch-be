On 3 September 1939, following the German invasion of Poland, the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany and the war in the West began. The RAF bombed German warships and light vessels in several harbours on 3 and 4 September.[73] Eight German Kriegsmarine men were killed at Wilhelmshaven â€“ the war's first casualties to British bombs;[74] attacks on ships at Cuxhaven[75] and Heligoland followed.[76][77] The 1939 Battle of the Heligoland Bight showed the vulnerability of bombers to fighter attack.
