Around 1940, Rose (Rooney Mara), an orphaned young woman, evacuates from Northern Ireland to live with her aunt in the Irish Republic, which is a neutral country. There, seemingly without any intent, she attracts the interest of many of the local men. She has a brief flirtation with Michael McNulty (Jack Reynor), a Protestant who sympathizes with the British war effort and soon leaves to join the RAF. She tries to avoid the inappropriate attention of the local Catholic priest, Father Gaunt (Theo James). She dances with Jack Conroy (Aidan Turner), one of a group of anti-British Catholics. After a fight between Father Gaunt and Jack, to prevent trouble her aunt sends Rose to live in a deserted farmhouse outside the village.
