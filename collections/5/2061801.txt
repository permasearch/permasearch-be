I do not believe the inclusion of unsourced parodies enhances the usefulness of this article. Any lyric may have sophomoric parodies made of it, but unless those parodies become notable in their own right in an independently-verifiable way, there is no justification I can see for including those parodies within the article of the original song. Don't get me wrong- I went through a phase in which I wrote dozens of song parodies myself- but I wouldn't go and add the alternate sets of lyrics to the original songs' articles. It makes no sense. --Notyourbroom (talk) 01:04, 13 March 2009 (UTC)
