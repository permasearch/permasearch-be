Kyle Davies, domestic distribution chief for Paramount, felt the controversy around the casting had damaged reviews, and said: "You're always trying to thread that needle between honoring the source material and make a movie for a mass audience. That's challenging, but clearly the reviews didn't help."[47] Conversely, Deadline argued that the negative critical assessment was instead due to the film being "cold, boring, thoughtless, and the same old same old next to its futuristic ancestors The Matrix and Blade Runner" and suggested that Paramount held the film from review because they "knew they had a lame duck". Deadline also reported that the film is expected to lose at least $60 million against its total advertising and production costs of $250 million.[13]
