In some countries, such as the United States, an ornamental key – the "Key to the City" – is presented to esteemed visitors, residents, or others whom the city wishes to honour. This practice is a variation on the Freedom of the City tradition, and has a similar symbolic meaning; evoking medieval walled cities, the gates of which would be guarded during the day and locked at night, the key symbolises the freedom of the recipient to enter and leave the city at will, as a trusted friend of city residents.[14]
