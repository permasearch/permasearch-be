Important Malay figures of early Kuala lumpur also include the Dato' Dagang ("chief of traders") and Haji Tahir.[24] The Minangkabaus later became another important group of people; Minangkabau traders from Sumatra include Utsman Abdullah,[35] and Haji Mohamed Taib who was involved in the early development of Kampung Baru.[36][37] The Minangkabaus are also important socio-religious figures, for example Utsman bin Abdullah was the first kadi of Kuala Lumpur as well as Muhammad Nur bin Ismail.[38]
