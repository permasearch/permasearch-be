The buildings had high mansard roofs, and tricolor facades of broke, stone, and slate. In the beginning, a statue of Louis III on horseback was placed in the center. A smaller square, Place Dauphine, originally with thirty-two houses, was built on the [[Ile-de-la-CitÃ© next to the Pont Neuf between 1607 and 1610]]. It faced an equestrian statue of Henry IV of France. [16]
