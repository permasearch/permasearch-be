The first use of lapse-time to record the movement of flowers took place in Yosemite in late 1911â€“1912 by Arthur C. Pillsbury, who built a special camera for this purpose and recorded the movements of flowers through their life cycle.[citation needed] Pillsbury owned the Studio of the Three Arrows in the Valley and applied the technique to solving the problem of ensuring the survival of the rapidly shrinking varieties in the meadows.  The United States Cavalry, then in charge of Yosemite, were mowing the meadows to produce fodder for their horses.
