The Zuchon is a small designer dog with a height around 12 inches and weighing 12 to 14 pounds. Zuchon is a portmanteau name combining the two breed names and is not accepted as a breed by the AKC or any other major recognised dog breed registry. [2] It is a dog that does not shed but it also requires maintenance with regular grooming. Because it is a hybrid dog from two purebreds, it is known to have hybrid vigor, when they are first generation, could possibly have better health than the purebred dogs. [3] However, if they are not first generation, health problems can exist. The dog breed has a short history beginning only at the turn of the 21st century. [3]
