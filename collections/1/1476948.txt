Chaos theory can be applied outside of the natural sciences, but historically nearly all such studies have suffered from lack of reproducibility; poor external validity; and/or inattention to cross-validation, resulting in poor predictive accuracy (if out-of-sample prediction has even been attempted). Glass [95] and Mandell and Selz [96] have found that no EEG study has as yet indicated the presence of strange attractors or other signs of chaotic behavior.
