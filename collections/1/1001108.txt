As a character, Jasmine is both similar to and different from Disney heroines who proceeded her.[18] She possesses many qualities associated with traditional Disney Princesses,[39] grace and beauty among them.[40] However, marketed by Disney as "a heroine of the Nineties",[41] Jasmine is "born-before-her-time", and thus her intelligence and ambitions tend to more-so resemble contemporary incarnations, namely Belle.[40] Brian Lowry of Variety likened Jasmine's strong-willed personality to that of Belle, describing her as an "anachronistically liberated" heroine.[42] Meanwhile, The Hollywood News' Rob Burch observed that the princess is very similar to Ariel, being "independent, beautiful, and desperate for the chance to live her own life," while at the same time concealing kindness beneath "a shield of anger".[43] Belonging to "a series of spunky heroines" inspired by both contemporary feminism and the girl power movement,[44][45][46] Jasmine was recognized by Hearing a Film, Seeing a Sermon: Preaching and Popular Movies author Timothy B. Cargal as a member of Disney's "continued efforts to reshape their heroines for a more feminist age",[47] in addition to providing young girls with strong female role models with whom they can identify.[46] At only 15 years of age,[48] Jasmine is already more resourceful than her two immediate predecessors,[44] while sharing their same preference for assertiveness and empowerment over passiveness, traits echoed by several other Disney Princesses introduced throughout the decade.[39][49] At the same time, Jasmine is depicted as being feistier than Belle and less naive than Ariel.[50]
