Paige and Frankie film a video for Bizaardvark in which they are dressed as chocolate bananas while singing a song. When they begin editing the video, they realize that their costumes actually resemble feces and decide not to publish the video. The next day, graffiti is discovered on some of Sierra High School's lockers. Paige and Frankie realize that they caught the suspect in the background on their video, but they are hesitant to show the embarrassing tape to Principal Karen. More graffiti appears the next day, and Amelia becomes the suspect after a security guard spotted her leaving school the night before. After Amelia receives detention, Paige and Frankie plan to secretly create new graffiti during a school event that she will be attending, in order to demonstrate that she is not the vandal. However, Paige and Frankie are caught with spray paint and are brought into Principal Karen's office. The real culprit Simon Vandalman is caught by Security Guard Clark before Paige and Frankie hand over their video to Karen, but the footage is taken anyways as possible evidence, leading to the video being aired on a news program. Meanwhile, Bernie considers Dirk to be his best friend and says so to him, but he is upset when Dirk does not repeat it back.
