Knoxville's two tallest buildings are the 27-story First Tennessee Plaza and the 24-story Riverview Tower, both on Gay Street.[69] Other prominent high-rises include the Tower at Morgan Hill (21 stories),[70] the Andrew Johnson Building (18),[71] the Knoxville Hilton (18), the General Building (15), the Holston (14), the TVA Towers (12),[72] and Sterchi Lofts (12). The city's most iconic structure is arguably the Sunsphere, a 266-foot (81Â m) steel truss tower built for the 1982 World's Fair[73] and, with the Tennessee Amphitheater, one of only two structures that remain from that World's Fair.[74]
