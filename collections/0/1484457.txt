Mr Carson overhears the news of Lord Grantham's della Francesca painting selling "amazingly well" and takes advantage of this news to hire a new footman at Downton Abbey.

Carson had expressed his concerns about Andrew's suitability to fill the new footman's post (because of the gambling club incident), but head housekeeper Mrs Hughes, Mr Barrow, and Daisy Mason urge him to give Andrew a second chance.
