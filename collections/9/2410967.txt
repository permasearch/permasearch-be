The foramina were named after the Scottish physician and University of Edinburgh graduate Alexander Monro, who first described an enlarged foramen in the context of hydrocephalus in a presentation to the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh in 1764,[7] and subsequently in his 1783 publication, Observations on the Structure and Functions of the Nervous System.[3]
