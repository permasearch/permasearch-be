Following the outbreak of World War II, many of the men who worked for Sainsbury's were called to perform National Service and were replaced by women. The Second World War was a difficult time for Sainsbury's, as most of its stores were trading in the London area and were bombed or damaged. Turnover fell to half the pre-war level. Food was rationed, and one particular store in East Grinstead was so badly damaged on Friday 9 July 1943 that it had to move to the local church, temporarily, while a new one was built. This store was not completed until 1951.[16]
