Tales about the origin of Robinson's nickname even varied across the color line, a consequence of differing opinions of him by blacks and whites. To whites, for example, his nickname "Bojangles" meant happy-go-lucky, while the black variety artist Tom Fletcher claimed it was slang for "squabbler."[27] Robinson himself said he got the nickname as a child in Richmond; it is the most commonly accepted version.[5]: p. 37
