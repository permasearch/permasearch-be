The regulation in Germany from 1988 to 2004 provided for medical doctors who wanted legal qualification or license to serve as “Arzt im Praktikum” (physician in internship) for 18 months. In 2004 this regulation was abolished. Since then doctors of medicine, who have successfully finished their medical studies, have received legal qualification immediately and the status of assistant doctor when taking up a medical occupation. However, they cannot enter private practice or work unsupervised until receiving their „Facharzt“ (full board certification) in their chosen specialty.
