Snap music is a subgenre of crunk that emerged from Atlanta, Georgia in the late 1990s.[137] The genre gained mainstream popularity and in mid-2005, artists from other southern states such as Tennessee began to emerge performing in this style. Tracks commonly consist of an Roland TR-808 bass drum, hi-hat, bass, finger snapping, a main groove and a vocal track. Hit snap songs include "Lean wit It, Rock wit It" by "Dem Franchize Boyz", "Laffy Taffy" by D4L, "It's Goin' Down" by Yung Joc and "Crank That (Soulja Boy)" by Soulja Boy Tell 'Em.
