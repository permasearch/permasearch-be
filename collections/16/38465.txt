On August 19, 1995, a scheduled preseason game between the Oilers and the San Diego Chargers had to be canceled due to the dilapidated condition of the playing field. Oilers owner Bud Adams demanded a new stadium, but the city of Houston refused to fund it. After years of threats, Adams moved the team to Tennessee after the 1996 season.[19] Around that time the Astros also threatened to leave the city unless a new ballpark was built.[19] The retractable-roofed Enron Field (now known as Minute Maid Park) opened for the 2000 season in downtown Houston.
