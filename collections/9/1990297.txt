Conway's cosmological theorem asserts that every sequence eventually splits ("decays") into a sequence of "atomic elements", which are finite subsequences that never again interact with their neighbors. There are 92 elements containing the digits 1, 2, and 3 only, which John Conway named after the chemical elements up to Uranium, calling the sequence audioactive. There are also two "transuranic" elements for each digit other than 1, 2, and 3.[3][4]
