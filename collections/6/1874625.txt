Public opinion polls have shown a majority of the public supports various levels of government involvement in health care in the United States,[49] with stated preferences depending on how the question is asked.[50] Polls from Harvard University in 1988,[51] the Los Angeles Times in 1990,[52] and the Wall Street Journal in 1991[53] all showed strong support for a health care system compared to the system in Canada.  More recently, however, polling support has declined for that sort of health care system,[49][50] with a 2007 Yahoo/AP poll showing a majority of respondents considered themselves supporters of "single-payer health care,"[54] a majority in favor of a number of reforms according to a joint poll with the Los Angeles Times and Bloomberg,[55] and a plurality of respondents in a 2009 poll for Time Magazine showed support for "a national single-payer plan similar to Medicare for all."[56]  Polls by Rasmussen Reports in 2011[57] and 2012[58] showed pluralities opposed to single-payer health care.  Many other polls show support for various levels of government involvement in health care, including polls from New York Times/CBS News[59][60] and Washington Post/ABC News,[61] showing favorability for a form of national health insurance.  The Kaiser Family Foundation[62] showed a majority in favor of a form of national health insurance, often compared to Medicare, and a Quinnipiac poll in three states in 2008 found majority support for the government ensuring "that everyone in the United States has adequate health-care" among likely Democratic primary voters.[63]
