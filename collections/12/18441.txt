Wynonna Earp, the great-great-granddaughter of legendary lawman Wyatt Earp, battles revenants, the reincarnated outlaws that Wyatt killed. She also fights other supernatural beings that inhabit the Ghost River Triangle, a cursed territory near the Canadian Rockies that includes Purgatory, her home town. Upon her 27th birthday, Wynonna inherited the special power to return revenants to Hell with her ancestor's 16-inch barrel special "Peacemaker" revolver. She is recruited by the Black Badge Division (BBD), a secret government agency led by Special Agent Xavier Dolls which eventually includes an ageless Doc Holliday and Wynonna's sister, Waverly Earp. Nicole Haught, Waverly's girlfriend and a Purgatory Sheriff's Deputy, assists the team in her local police role.
