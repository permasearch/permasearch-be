The Straight Dance is considered to be more dignified or formal than other pow wow dances.[3][4] The general steps for the dance involve a "toe-heel" step where the dancer taps the ground with his toe on the first drum beat and then places his whole foot down on the second beat. The dance resembles a hunting or warring party and therefore the dancer must not dance backwards as that would symbolize a retreat from the enemy.[5] Instead they always dance clockwise around the circle. As a Southern dance, it is danced to a Southern Drum.[6]
