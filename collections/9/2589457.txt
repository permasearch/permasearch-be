In mid-2012, Universal Republic Records changed its name to its former name Republic Records. All Universal Republic Records roster were moved to Republic Records. The label has since released albums by Lil Wayne, Kid Cudi and Tyga among others. The new Republic became the number one label in soundtrack production and sales.[9] On March 31, 2014, it was announced that Big Machine and Republic Records revived Dot Records, and that Chris Stacey would be head of the label.[10] Dot is the third imprint -- technically the fourth, counting Big Machine itself -- launched under Big Machine Label Group, following Valory (Brantley Gilbert, Justin Moore, Reba McEntire) and Republic Nashville (Florida Georgia Line, The Band Perry, Eli Young Band).[11]
