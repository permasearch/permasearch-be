Not all of the ring material need have been swept up right away: the thickened crust of the Moon's far side suggests the possibility that a second moon about 1,000km in diameter formed in a Lagrange point of the Moon. The secondary, smaller moon may have remained in orbit for tens of millions of years. As the two moons migrated outward from the Earth, solar tidal effects would have made the Lagrange orbit unstable, resulting in a slow-velocity collision that "pancaked" the smaller moon onto what is now the far side, adding material to the crust.[19][20] Lunar magma cannot pierce through the thick crust of the far side, causing lesser lunar maria, while the near side has a thin crust displaying the large maria visible from Earth.[21]
