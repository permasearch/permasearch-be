Beth and a reluctant Mandy first tried to kill Trevor using weed-killer brought around by Sinbad. When this failed, Beth started buying large amounts of pain-killers from Ron Dixon's shop and putting them into his food. This however only served to make Trevor ill. The pair persevered with this plan despite its failings, making Trevor more unwell each time.
