Historically, justices have come from some tradition of public service; only George Shiras, Jr. had no such experience.[110] Relatively few justices have been appointed from among members of Congress. Six were members of the United States Senate at the time of their appointment,[111][112] while one was a sitting member of the House of Representatives.[113] Six more had previously served in the Senate. Three have been sitting governors.[111][114] Only one, William Howard Taft, had been President of the United States.[115] The last justice to have held elected office was Sandra Day O'Connor, who was elected twice to the Arizona State Senate after being appointed there by the governor.
