Watt scored the touchdown on a one-yard catch after coming into the game as a tight end.[55][56] Watt scored his second touchdown of the season on September 28, 2014, against the Buffalo Bills. Watt picked off a pass from Buffalo’s E.J. Manuel that was intended for Fred Jackson, and returned 80 yards for the touchdown.[57] With this touchdown, Watt became tied at sixth for the longest interception return by a defensive lineman.
