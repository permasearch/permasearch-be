In 1906, the writing staff defected over disputes with McClure and formed The American Magazine. McClure's began to lose readers and went into debt. S. S. McClure was forced to sell the magazine to creditors in 1911. It was re-styled as a women's magazine and ran inconsistently in this format, with publication from October 1921 to February 1922, September 1924 and April 1925, and February to May 1926. The later issues, from July 1928 until March 1929, were published under the name New McClure's Magazine. The last issue was in March 1929, after which the magazine was taken over by The Smart Set.[8]
