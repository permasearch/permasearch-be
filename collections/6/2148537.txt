By 2012 Indian Insurance is a US$72 billion industry. However, only two million people (0.2% of the total population of 1 billion) are covered under Mediclaim. With more and more private companies in the sector, this situation is expected to change. ECGC, ESIC and AIC provide insurance services for niche markets. So, their scope is limited by legislation but enjoy some special powers.  The majority of Western Countries have state run medical systems so have less need for medical insurance.  In the UK, for example, the corporate cover of employees, when added to the individual purchase of coverage gives approximately 11–12% of the population on cover [[3]]- due largely to usage of the state financed National Health Service (NHS), whereas in developed nations with a more limited state system, like USA, about 75% of the total population are covered under some insurance scheme.
