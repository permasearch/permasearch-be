It is covered, in front, by the integument, superficial fascia, the Platysma (platysma) muscle, deep fascia, the clavicular origin of the Sternocleidomastoideus (sternocleidomastoid) muscle, the Sternohyoideus (sternohyoid) muscle, and the Sternothyreoideus (sternothyroid) muscle, and another layer of the deep fascia. It is crossed by the internal jugular vein and the vertebral vein, by the vagus nerve and the cardiac branches of the vagus and sympathetic, and by the subclavian loop of the sympathetic trunk which forms a ring around the vessel. The anterior jugular vein is directed laterally in front of the artery, but is separated from it by the Sternohyoideus and Sternothyreoideus. Below and behind the artery is the pleura, which separates it from the apex of the lung; behind is the sympathetic trunk, the Longus collie and the first thoracic vertebra (T1). The right recurrent nerve winds around the lower and back part of the vessel.
