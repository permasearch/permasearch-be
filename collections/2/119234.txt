'The typist home at teatime' section was originally in entirely regular stanzas of iambic pentameter, with a rhyme scheme of ababâ€”the same form as Gray's Elegy, which was in Eliot's thoughts around this time. Pound's note against this section of the draft is "verse not interesting enough as verse to warrant so much of it". In the end, the regularity of the four-line stanzas was abandoned.
