Filming took place on location in Jamaica between 16 January[32] and 21 February 1962; five days later filming began at Pinewood Studios in England with sets designed by Ken Adam,[19] who had previously worked with Broccoli on the 1960 film The Trials of Oscar Wilde.[33] Maurice Binder created the title sequence and introduced the gun barrel motif that appears in all the Eon Bond films.[34] Monty Norman wrote the accompanying soundtrack, which included the "James Bond Theme", heard in the gun barrel sequence and in a calypso medley over the title credits; the theme was described by another Bond film composer, David Arnold, as "bebop-swing vibe coupled with that vicious, dark, distorted electric guitar, definitely an instrument of rock 'n' rollÂ ... it represented everything about the character you would want: It was cocky, swaggering, confident, dark, dangerous, suggestive, sexy, unstoppable. And he did it in two minutes".[35] The theme was arranged by John Barry, who was uncredited for the arrangement[36] but credited for his performance.[18]
