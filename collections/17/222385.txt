Rastas refer to the totality of their religion's ideas and beliefs as "Rastalogy".[16] The scholar of religion Ennis B. Edmonds described Rastafari as having "a fairly cohesive worldview",[16] however Cashmore thought that its beliefs were "fluid and open to interpretation".[17] Because it has no systematic theology or highly developed institutions, the sociologist of religion Peter B. Clarke stated that it was "extremely difficult to generalise" about Rastas and their beliefs.[18] Attempts have been made to summarise Rastafari belief, but these have never been accorded the status of a catechism or creed within the movement.[19] Emphasis is placed on the idea that personal experience and intuitive understanding should be used to determine the truth or validity of a particular belief or practice.[20] No Rasta therefore has the authority to declare what beliefs and practices are orthodox and which are heterodox.[19] The conviction that Rastafari has no dogma "is so strong that it has itself become something of a dogma", according to Clarke.[21]
