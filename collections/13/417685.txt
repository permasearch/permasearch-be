Distributions with zero excess kurtosis are called mesokurtic, or mesokurtotic. The most prominent example of a mesokurtic distribution is the normal distribution family, regardless of the values of its parameters. A few other well-known distributions can be mesokurtic, depending on parameter values: for example, the binomial distribution is mesokurtic for     p = 1  /  2 Â±   1  /  12     {\displaystyle p=1/2\pm {\sqrt {1/12}}}  .
