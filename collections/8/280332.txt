General elections were held in Liberia on 1 May 1951, the first to be held under universal suffrage, as previously only male descendants of Americo-Liberians had been allowed to vote. This was the first elections in Liberia where women and the local Liberians owning property were allowed to vote based on a Constitutional Referendum in 1945-46. In the presidential election, William Tubman of the True Whig Party was the only candidate, and was re-elected unopposed.[1]
