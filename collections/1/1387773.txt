Due to the influence of the One Ring, Gollum's life was extended far beyond that of other members of his clan. An average Hobbit lifespan is over 100 years, but a span of 556 years separates Gollum's finding of the Ring in T.A.Â 2463 and its destruction in T.A. 3019, by which time he would have been approaching an age of 600 years.[16]
