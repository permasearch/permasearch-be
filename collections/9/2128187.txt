After the war, Kittan became the Chief of the Legal Affairs Bureau in Kamina City, but starts to resent Rossiu when he sentences Simon to death and then allow his sister Kinon to wear an explosive-equipped vest to accompany Simon in the case he attempts to escape. Though he eventually understands the position Rossiu was in, Kittan resigns after discovering about Rossiu's plan to evacuate Earth using the Arc-Gurren, along a small fraction of the human population, and abandoning the rest to die, when the moon falls. Before leaving, he demanded Rossiu to return the Core Drill he took from Simon and rushed on his Gunman to deliver it back to him.
