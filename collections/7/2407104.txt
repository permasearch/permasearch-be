Much of Providence culture is synonymous with the culture of Rhode Island as a whole. Like the state, the city has a non-rhotic accent that can be heard on local media. Providence also shares Rhode Island's affinity for coffee, with the most coffee and doughnut shops per capita of any city in the country.[95] Providence is also reputed to have the highest number of restaurants per capita of major U.S. cities,[96] many of which are founded or staffed by Johnson & Wales University graduates.[97]
