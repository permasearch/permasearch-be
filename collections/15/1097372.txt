The rules in Iron Chef America are thought to favor the Iron Chef less[citation needed] than the original program, however, some challengers have noted favoritism in the selection of theme ingredients.[12] On Iron Chef the Iron Chef's food was always tasted second, while on Iron Chef America, the chef whose food is tasted first is determined by toss of coin before the show.
