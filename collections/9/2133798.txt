In the aftermath of Gale's murder, Gus brings both Walt and Jesse to the lab, and kills his associate Victor right in front of them in a gruesome show of force. The tension of working under tighter security creates a rift between Walt and Jesse, and Gus uses the opportunity to bring Jesse to his side by having Mike train him in hopes of eventually replacing Walt. Walt figures out what Gus is up to and gives Jesse homemade ricin with which to poison Gus, but Jesse never goes through with it. Meanwhile, Walt buys the car wash where he used to work and uses it to launder his drug money.
