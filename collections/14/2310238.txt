Later, Socks and Ruby wander into his territory; they were adopted as house cats, but later become lost and forgotten when their owners move; as dependent pets, they never learned to hunt for their own food. They ask Scourge for help, but he snarls at them, asking why he should help them after everything they did to him. Ruby then asks if blood means anything to him, to which Scourge replies that it is everything to him and how the blood of his enemies soaks into his fur. He then says that he is the leader of BloodClan, which shocks his siblings. Scourge finally lets them eat some of his food until they are full, but after they are finished, Scourge permanently banishes them from his territory, completing his transformation into a cold-blooded villain.
