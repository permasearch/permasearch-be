Some companies have faced class action lawsuits over false advertising claims that the product was, "super-hydrating", "nutrient-packed", and "mega-electrolyte".[4] The plaintiffs also alleged that one company, Vita Coco, falsely claimed that its product had "15 times the electrolytes found in sports drinks" and misrepresented the levels of sodium and magnesium as advertised. The company denied any wrongdoing and settled the lawsuit for US$10 million in April 2012.[4]
