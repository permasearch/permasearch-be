Critics of the project contend that there are many environmental issues to be considered, such as the link between El Niño (ENSO) and the threat to water supplies posed by El Niño. The ACP has commissioned studies by several consultants about water supply and quality problems. Some of the most prominent critics of the canal expansion plan from the point of view of water quality issues are Eric Jackson[49] (editor of the online Panama News), Gonzalo Menendez[50] (former head of Panama's National Environmental Authority), and Ariel Rodriguez[51] (a biologist at the University of Panama), and former Vice Minister of Public Works Grettel Villalaz de Allen.[52]
