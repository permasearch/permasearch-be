Producers decided to have Ruffo working closely with Lynne McGranger who plays Irene Roberts and form a comedy partnership.[14][15] Irene takes Chris into her home as a lodger and then gives him a job. Ruffo said that "Chris lives with Irene, he works with Irene in the diner and they have this "mother/son" relationship and its a lot of fun to work with her. She is always telling me off." McGranger also enjoyed the on-screen partnership and branded Ruffo one of her favourite cast members to work with.[16] McGranger told Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy that the two characters share "good comedy scenes" and she "loved" working on the relationship.[15]
