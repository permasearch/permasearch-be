Make It Last Forever is the debut album of American R&B recording artist Keith Sweat. It was recorded at INS Recording and Power Play Studios in New York City.[2] Released on November 24, 1987, the album went to #1 on the Top R&B Albums chart for three weeks (and topped the Billboard Year-End R&B chart for 1988), and #5 on the Billboard 200. Make It Last Forever was one of the earliest R&B albums to showcase the up-and-coming new jack swing sound, as it was mostly produced by Sweat himself and music producer Teddy Riley.
