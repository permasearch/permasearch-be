Whorf's views have been compared to those of philosophers such as Friedrich Nietzsche[58] and the late Ludwig Wittgenstein,[59][60] both of whom considered language to have important bearing on thought and reasoning. His hypotheses have also been compared to the views of psychologists such as Lev Vygotsky,[61] whose social constructivism considers the cognitive development of children to be mediated by the social use of language. Vygotsky shared Whorf's interest in gestalt psychology, and he also read Sapir's works. Others have seen similarities between Whorf's work and the ideas of literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin, who read Whorf and whose approach to textual meaning was similarly holistic and relativistic.[62][63] Whorf's ideas have also been interpreted as a radical critique of positivist science.[24]
