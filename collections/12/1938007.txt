In the summer of 2004 Europe went on a festival tour through the European continent.[24] The concert setlists included the old hits, but also introduced the title track from Start from the Dark.[24] The album was released on 22 September 2004, the same day that John Norum became a father. Start from the Dark featured a more modern sound compared to Europe's previous albums. "We wanted to be doing something at least that was a little bit relevant now; bit of a dry mix, detuned a bit," Tempest said, "So we felt like we didn't want to do an 1980s album per se, we just wanted to start like a fresh band really."[27] Eventually, the album sold in excess of 600,000 copies worldwide.[12]
