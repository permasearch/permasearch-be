A number is represented in a floating point format as     m ×  b  p     {\displaystyle m\times b^{p}}   which is also called scientific notation. Its square root is       m   ×  b  p  /  2     {\displaystyle {\sqrt {m}}\times b^{p/2}}   and similar formulae would apply for cube roots and logarithms. On the face of it, this is no improvement in simplicity, but suppose that only an approximation is required: then just      b  p  /  2     {\displaystyle b^{p/2}}   is good to an order of magnitude. Next, recognise that some powers, p, will be odd, thus for 3141.59 = 3.14159x103 rather than deal with fractional powers of the base, multiply the mantissa by the base and subtract one from the power to make it even. The adjusted representation will become the equivalent of 31.4159x102 so that the square root will be √31.4159 x 10.
