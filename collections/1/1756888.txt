London's Docklands had their origins in the lack of capacity in the Pool of London which particularly affected the West India trade. In 1799 The West India Dock Act allowed a new off-river dock to be built for produce from the West Indies[1] and the rest of Docklands followed as landowners built enclosed docks with better security and facilities than the Pool's wharves.
