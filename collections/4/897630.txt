The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are provided for in many of India's educational programmes.[142] Special reservations are also provided for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in India, e.g. a reservation of 15% in Kendriya Vidyalaya for Scheduled Castes and another reservation of 7.5% in Kendriya Vidyalaya for Scheduled Tribes.[142] Similar reservations are held by the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in many schemes and educational facilities in India.[142] The remote and far-flung regions of North-East India are provided for under the Non-Lapsible Central pool of Resources (NLCPR) since 1998â€“1999.[143] The NLCPR aims to provide funds for infrastructure development in these remote areas.[143]
