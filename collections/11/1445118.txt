The mock newspaper, dated 7 January 1972, also includes the entire lyrics to "Thick as a Brick" (printed on page 7), which is presented as a poem written by Bostock,[17] whose disqualification from a poetry contest is the focus of the front-page story. This article claims that although Bostock initially won the contest, the judges' decision was repealed after protests and threats concerning the offensive nature of the poem, along with the boy's suspected psychological instability.[23] The front cover includes a piece where Bostock is accused without foundation of being the father of his 14-year-old friend Julia's child.[24] The inside of the paper features a mock review by "Julian Stone-Mason BA", a pseudonym of Anderson's.[25]
