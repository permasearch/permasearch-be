Ray Manzarek played the song's bass line with his left hand on a Fender Rhodes Piano Bass, while performing the other keyboard parts on a Vox Continental using his right hand. After the recording session, producer Paul A. Rothchild brought in session musician Larry Knechtel to overdub[8] a Fender Precision Bass guitar to double the keyboard bass line.[9][10][11] When the Doors played the song at live concerts, Manzarek used the Fender Rhodes Piano Bass without augmentation.
