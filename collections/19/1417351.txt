Opened on the same date as the outdoor memorial, The Legacy Museum: From Enslavement to Mass Incarceration is a museum that displays and dramatizes the history of slavery and racism in America. The progress through the museum is chronological, beginning with slavery, and progressing through the heyday of lynching, the Civil Rights era, and the present.[11] This includes the enslavement of African-Americans, racial lynchings, segregation, and racial bias. The memorial complex features artwork by Hank Willis Thomas, Glenn Ligon, Jacob Lawrence, Elizabeth Catlett, Titus Kaphar, and Sanford Biggers. One of its displays is a collection of soil from lynching sites across the United States.[5] This exhibit stands to show the vast impact of slavery, lynching, and black oppression across state lines. The exhibits in the 11,000-square-foot museum include oral history, archival materials, and interactive technology.[24]
