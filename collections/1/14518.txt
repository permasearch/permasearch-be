The centrepiece of the coronation regalia is named after Edward the Confessor and is placed on the monarch's head at the actual moment of crowning by the Archbishop of Canterbury.[77] Made of gold in 1661, St Edward's Crown has four fleurs-de-lis and four crosses pattée with two depressed arches on top. Surmounting the arches is a jewelled monde and cross pattée. Its frame is embellished with 444 precious and semi-precious stones, including amethysts, garnets, peridots, rubies, sapphires, topazes, tourmalines and zircons.[78]
