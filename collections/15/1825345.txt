Beethoven's late period began around 1815. Works from this period are characterised by their intellectual depth, their formal innovations, and their intense, highly personal expression. The String Quartet, Op. 131 has seven linked movements, and the Ninth Symphony adds choral forces to the orchestra in the last movement.[96] Other compositions from this period include the Missa Solemnis, the last five string quartets (including the massive Gro√üe Fuge) and the last five piano sonatas.
