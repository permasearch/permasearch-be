Newsreels died out because of technological advances such as electronic news-gathering for television news, introduced in the 1970s, rendered them obsolete. Nonetheless, some countries such as Cuba, Japan, Spain, and Italy continued producing newsreels into the 1980s and 1990s.[9] Newsreel-producing companies excluded television companies from their distribution, but the television companies countered by sending their own cameramen to film news events.
