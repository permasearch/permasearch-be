Jaime prepares to mobilize the army. Cersei reveals she lied and will not join Daenerys and Jon's cause; Euron left for Essos to transport the mercenary Golden Company, with which she will fight the presumably weakened faction that wins the Great War. Jaime is disgusted at her callousness and refuses to break his word; despite Cersei's threat to have the Mountain kill him, he rides north alone. Snow falls on King's Landing.
