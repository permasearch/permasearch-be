There was an outbreak in the Horn of Africa. In spite of successful local negotiations the previous year that had allowed access to some populations for the first time in three years and a vigorous vaccination campaign, vaccination levels remained low. In April, a case of wild polio in Mogadishu was reported, the first in Somalia since 2007.[96] By October, over 170 cases had been reported in the country,[97] with more cases in neighboring Kenya and the Somali Region of Ethiopia.
