While not a huge ratings success, the first season garnered solid enough numbers to justify being renewed for a second season.[10] For instance, the premiere episode ranked #28 for the week with an 18.6/28 rating/share. However, during the second season, the show dropped out of the top 50 shows, losing share to CBS' hit Magnum, P.I. As a result, NBC canceled the series in May 1984.
