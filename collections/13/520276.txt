The radial engine is a reciprocating type internal combustion engine configuration in which the cylinders point outward from a central crankshaft like the spokes of a wheel. It resembles a stylized star when viewed from the front, and is called a "star engine" (German Sternmotor, French Moteur en Ã©toile) in some languages. The radial configuration was very commonly used in aircraft engines before turbine engines became predominant.
