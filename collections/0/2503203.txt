In October 2000, Heinz introduced colored ketchup products called EZ Squirt, which eventually included green (2000), purple (2001), pink (2002), orange (2002), teal (2002), and blue (2003).[27] These products were made by adding food coloring to the traditional ketchup. As of January 2006[update] these products were discontinued.[28]
