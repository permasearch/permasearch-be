This total represents civilian deaths due to war-related violence that have been reported by media organizations, non-governmental-organization-based reports, and official records.[18] The IBC project has been criticized by some who believe it counts only a small percentage of the number of actual deaths because of its reliance on media sources.[29][93] The IBC project's director, John Sloboda, has stated, "We've always said our work is an undercount, you can't possibly expect that a media-based analysis will get all the deaths."[94] However, the IBC project rejects many of these criticisms as exaggerated or misinformed.[95]
