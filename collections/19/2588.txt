In season eight, Enzo falls under the control of the siren Sybil, killing many humans across the country with Damon. His love for Bonnie, however, prevents him from falling completely under Sybil's control. Bonnie rescues him and the two resume their relationship, eventually planning for Enzo to take the cure and buy a house together in New York. Enzo is murdered by Stefan (on Cade's orders), which causes Bonnie to unleash her psychic powers. She sees visions of Enzo but breaks their connection in order to channel her powers into saving Caroline's daughters. Enzo makes her promise to live her life and swears he will see her again before she lets him go. Enzo then makes Bonnie realize her strength, and continues to watch over her as she fulfills her promise by living her life as she happily travels the world.
