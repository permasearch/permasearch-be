Mount Bromo showed signs of increasing activity beginning in November 2015, when the amount of smoke coming out of the crater intensified.[11] By late November Mount Bromo began to eject ashes into the air.[12] Indonesian Volcano Monitoring Bureau (PVBMG) issued a warning that forbade people from climbing Mount Bromo. Later the warning was extended into a 1Â km exclusion zone, before eventually extended into wider range which virtually barred visitors from coming down into the caldera floor, which is popularly known as Sandsea.[13]
