The 323 area code was created in 1998 as yet another split of 213.[1] When 213 was divided, it kept Los Angeles exchanges 1, 7 and 10, while exchanges 2 through 6, 8, 9, and 11 through 14 went to 323. This split made 213 one of the smallest area codes in the nation, covering only Downtown Los Angeles and its immediately adjoining neighborhoods, such as Chinatown. Completely surrounding 213, 323 covered most of the remainder of central Los Angeles, including Hollywood, as well as several neighboring cities, including Bell, Huntington Park and Montebello.[2]
