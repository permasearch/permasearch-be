A sense of destiny is present in the novel through patterns of repetition, including reversals of destiny in a number of characters.[56] Characters who are paired together tend to suffer the same destiny: Ti Noel and Monsieur Lenormand de Mezy both witness the marvels of the age and slowly decline; both Pauline and SolimÃ¡n indulge in their wealthy positions and then sink into madness.[57] There is a clear pattern of succession from fortune to misfortune.[58]
