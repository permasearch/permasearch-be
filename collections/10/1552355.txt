To be totally realistic in this representation of daylight, four lanterns should be used to cover one area of the stage, in two pairs at 45 degree angles, so on each side of the actor's face both a warm and a cool light would be present. This would enable the lighting designer at midday to switch the warm light from one side of the actors face to the other, simulating the sun passing overhead in real life, enhancing the realism. Alternatively, this effect can be achieved with two lanterns equipped with scrollers (a device which fits on the end of the lantern capable of holding different colour gels and switching them during the performance) each containing a warm and a cool gel. However, scrollers are renowned for breaking unexpectedly in the middle of shows, and therefore in a best case scenario two lanterns from each side should be used. Having said this, smaller theatres with fewer resources use this method to great success with only two lanterns per area of the stage.
