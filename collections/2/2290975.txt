The preorbital gland secretion of muskoxen has a "light, sweetish, ethereal" odor.[7] Analysis of preorbital gland secretion extract showed the presence of cholesterol (which is nonvolatile), benzaldehyde, a series of straight-chain saturated gamma-lactones ranging from C8H14O2 to C12H22O2 (with C10H18O2 being most abundant), and probably the monounsaturated gamma lactone C12H20O2.[7] The saturated gamma-lactone series has an odor similar to that of the secretion.[7]
