During the course of the Mau Mau legal battle in London, a large amount of what was stated to be formerly lost Foreign Office archival material was finally brought to light, while yet more was discovered to be missing.[250] The files, known as migrated archives, provided details of British human rights abuses (torture, rape, execution)[251] in its former colonies during the final stages of empire, including during Mau Mau, and even after decolonisation.
