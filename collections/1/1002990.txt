In total protein normalization (TPN), the abundance of the target protein is normalized to the total amount of protein in each lane, removing variations associated with normalization against a single protein.[16][17] TPN was first introduced in 1995,[18] but became widely adopted for western blot normalization around 2008.[16] Re-evaluation of the housekeeping protein normalization technique led to the finding that HKP loading controls may not be as accurate as initially thought since there are experimental conditions that can affect their expression.[4][6] Alternatively, total protein normalization has been proposed as an improved, more appropriate strategy for sample normalization.[19] TPN involves incubating the gel or membrane with a total protein stain, either before or after detection with antibodies.[16][17] A more efficient stain-free method has also recently become available.[20][21]
