In 1858 Pl√ºcker observed the deflection of "cathode rays" (electrons) with the use of magnetic fields.[5] This effect was used by Ferdinand Braun in 1897 to build simple cathode ray oscilloscopes (CROs) measuring devices.[6] In 1891 Riecke noticed that the cathode rays could be focused by magnetic fields, allowing for simple electromagnetic lens designs. In 1926 Hans Busch published work extending this theory and showed that the lens maker's equation could, with appropriate assumptions, be applied to electrons.[2]
