Shurley found no signs of brain damage but observed a few persistent abnormalities in Genie's sleep, including a significantly reduced amount (and much larger than average variance in duration) of REM sleep and an unusually high number of sleep spindles.[9][41] He eventually concluded Genie had been mentally retarded from birth, specifically citing her significantly elevated number of sleep spindles.[5][96][97] The other scientists following the case remained divided on this issue. Much later, for example, Susan Curtiss emphatically argued that, though Genie clearly had serious emotional difficulties, she could not have been retarded. She pointed out that Genie made a year's developmental progress for every calendar year after her rescue, which would not be expected if her condition was congenital, and that some aspects of language Genie acquired were uncharacteristic of mentally disabled people.[5][22][98] She instead believed that Genie was born with at least average intelligence, and that the abuse and isolation of her childhood had left her functionally disabled.[5][98]
