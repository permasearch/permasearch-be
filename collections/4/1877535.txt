Several studies have been made on immigrants' net contribution to the public sector. With the low immigrant unemployment rate and a smaller share of the total population, the studies concluded that immigrant net contribution to the public sector was either negligible, neutral or slightly positive up until the 1970s. With increasing unemployment rates and a larger share of the total population, this was shown no longer to be true in 1999 by Ekberg.[62] More recent studies such as Ruist show that the cost of refugees were 1% of GDP in 2007 and AldÃ©n & Hammarstedt show that the average cost of an refugee that had been living in Sweden for five years was 120 000 SEK per year.[63][64]
