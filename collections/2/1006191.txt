July is the hottest month in Minnesota statewide and is usually the month when the peak heat waves occur. In July 1936, Minnesota and the rest of the Midwest suffered through its most severe heat wave on record. Most of the state was engulfed in 100 °F (38 °C) temperatures for several days in a row, and Minnesota's all-time record high temperature of 114 °F (46 °C) was equaled during this stretch. This heat wave was also responsible for the Twin Cities' all-time record high of 108 °F (42 °C), as well as the all-time record high of several other cities across the state.[62]
