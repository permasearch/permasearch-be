Japan's Children's Day (子供の日, kodomo no hi) is celebrated on 5 May, a National Holiday since 1948, to celebrate the happiness of all children and to express gratitude toward mothers. There is a long tradition, from the 8th century, to celebrate children's day twice a year; 3 March for girls and on 5 May for boys. On 3 March, also known as the Doll Festival, Japanese people decorate their households with traditional Heian Period doll sets and plum blossom, and drink Amazake. On 5 May, also known as 端午の節句 (tango-no sekku), they fly carp streamers outside, display Samurai dolls, and eat chimaki.
