In December 2016, the Thai cabinet of Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha agreed "in principle" with a plan to dredge stretches of the Mekong and demolish rocky outcrops that are hindrances to easy navigation. The international Lancang-Mekong River navigation improvement plan for 2015-2025, conceived by China, Myanmar, Lao, and Thailand, aims to the make the river more navigable for 500-tonne cargo ships sailing the river from Yunnan to Luang Prabang, a distance of 890 kilometres.[13] China has been the driving force behind the demolition plan as it aims to expand trade in the area with larger cargo ships.[14] The plan is split into two phases. The first phase, from 2015-2020, involves a survey, a design, and an assessment of the environmental and social impacts of the project. These have to be approved by the four countries involved, China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand. The second phase (2020-2025) involves navigational improvements from Simao in China to 243 border posts in China and Myanmar, a distance of 259 km.[13]
