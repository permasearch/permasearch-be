More intuitively, we can think of X as our "data", perhaps     X = (  X  1   , … ,  X  n   )   {\displaystyle X=(X_{1},\ldots ,X_{n})}  , where      X  i   ∼  F  θ     {\displaystyle X_{i}\sim F_{\theta }}   i.i.d. The X is the set of things the decision rule will be making decisions on. There exists some number of possible ways      F  θ     {\displaystyle F_{\theta }}   to model our data X, which our decision function can use to make decisions. For a finite number of models, we can thus think of θ as the index to this family of probability models. For an infinite family of models, it is a set of parameters to the family of distributions.
