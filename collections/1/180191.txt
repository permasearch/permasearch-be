According to Mike Noyes, the series amalgamates elements of "classic fantasy epics".[55] Todd Douglass, Jr. called the plot engaging, well-thought-out, and meaningful. The series' concept is "well-realized", with a consistent story. Douglass wrote that the characters "[have] a real sense of progression", and praised the writers for their humor, drama, and emotion.[57] Joshua Miller called the series surprisingly dark despite its "silly" theme; the plot is livelier than that of Lost and, similar to the latter show, emphasizes character development. According to Miller, its writing was "true adult levels of storytelling".[58] Tim Janson described the series as more than fantasy-and superhero-themed, seeing the characters as central and relateable.[59] "Cricket" Te praised the series' use of Buddhist philosophies and the diverse presentation of its themes of courage and life.[61] Kirk Hamiltion praises the series for expressing towards its audience to be themselves and for its quiet progressivism.[63]
