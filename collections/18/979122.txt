As with all species in the genus Amelanchier, the flowers are white, with five quite separate petals. In A. alnifolia, they are about 2–3 cm (3⁄4–1 1⁄4 in) across,[citation needed] and appear on short racemes of three to 20[3] somewhat crowded together, in spring while the new leaves are still expanding.
