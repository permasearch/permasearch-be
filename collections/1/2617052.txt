Launched on 15 April 1986, the Racing Post is a daily national print and digital publisher dedicated to the horseracing industry and horse racing, greyhound racing and sports betting. The paper was founded by UAE prime minister and Emir of Dubai Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, a prominent racehorse owner, and edited by Graham Rock, who was replaced by Michael Harris in 1988. In 1998 Sheikh Mohammed sold the licence for the paper to Trinity Mirror, owners of The Sporting Life, for £1 - Sheikh Mohammed still retains ownership of the paper’s name, and at the sheikh’s suggestion, Trinity Mirror donated £10 million to four horseracing charities as a condition of the transfer.
