Rodrick is Greg's formerly aggressive older brother. He is the drummer in a garage band called "LÃ¶ded Diper" (loaded diaper), noted for their substandard heavy metal concerts and limited musical abilities. However, once pop star Max Mudd, Joe Elliott, and Mutt Lange began producing the band's work, and Joe Keery took over lead vocals, the band became a worldwide hit as they shifted their genre from heavy punk metal to glam pop metal, very much influenced by and in the style of Def Leppard. Rodrick is not an exception to Frank's notorious distrust of all teenagers.
