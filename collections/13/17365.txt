Lily Luna Potter is the daughter of Harry and Ginny, the youngest of their three children. Her name honors two women important to her parents—her paternal grandmother Lily Potter, and her parents' good friend Luna Lovegood.[39] She is two years younger than her brother Albus Severus, making her around nine, and is close in age to her cousin Hugo. It is also stated that she has her mother's and possibly both of her own grandmothers' red hair. In the epilogue of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, she accompanied her parents as they escorted James and Albus Potter to Platform 9¾ to the Hogwarts express.
