The termination of the British mandate over Palestine and the Israeli Declaration of Independence sparked a full-scale war (1948 Arab–Israeli War) which erupted after May 14, 1948. On 15–16 May, the four armies of Jordan, Syria, Egypt and Iraq[45] invaded/intervened in what had been the area of the British Mandate[16] followed not long after by units from[45] Lebanon.[16]
