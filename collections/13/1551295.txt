Each project spans a pair of 30-minute episodes, in which Mike buys a vehicle, turns it over to his mechanic for repairs, then sells it on. For the first series, the budget was £1000, for Series 2, £2000, and for Series 3, £3000. Budgets in subsequent series have varied, depending on the target vehicle. For example, a £10,000 budget was set on buying and restoring a Ferrari Dino 308 GT4 in Series 6. For series 11 (2014), the budget is listed on the show's Discovery UK website as "up to £20,000".
