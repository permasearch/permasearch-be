The theory of evolution described by Charles Darwin in On the Origin of Species (1859) was opposed by many Quakers in the nineteenth century,[48] particularly by older evangelical Quakers who dominated the Religious Society of Friends in Great Britain. These religious leaders were suspicious of Darwin's theory, and believed that natural selection needed to be supplemented by another process.[49] For example, influential British Quaker scientist Edward Newman[50] stated that this theory was "not compatible with our notions of creation as delivered from the hands of a Creator".
