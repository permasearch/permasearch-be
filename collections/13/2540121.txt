By then, Fox had some advantages that DuMont did not have back in the 1950s. During its first few years, Fox programmed just under the number of hours to be legally considered a network by the FCC (by method of carrying only two hours of programming a few nights a week, expanding to additional nights before eventually filling all seven nights in 1993), allowing it to make money and grow in ways that the established networks were prohibited from doing. News Corporation also had the money and the resources to get and keep programming and talent on Fox, while DuMont constantly operated on a shoestring budget. In addition, the expansion of cable television in the 1980s and 1990s allowed more viewers to receive UHF stations clearly, along with local VHF stations, through cable systems without having to struggle with either over-the-air antennas or television sets with limited channel tuners to receive them.[44] Boosted by successful shows like Married... with Children, 21 Jump Street, Cops, Beverly Hills, 90210, In Living Color, Melrose Place, and The X-Files (all appealing to the highly coveted and lucrative 18-49 demographic), Fox proved profitable by the 1990s.
