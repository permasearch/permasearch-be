For a disaster recovery plan to be successful, the central responsibility for the plan must reside on top management. Management is responsible for coordinating the disaster recovery plan and ensuring its effectiveness within the organization. It is also responsible for allocating adequate time and resources required in the development of an effective plan. Resources that management must allocate include both financial considerations and the effort of all personnel involved.
