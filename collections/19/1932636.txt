After arriving in New Orleans on December 1, 1814,[91] Jackson instituted martial law in the city, as he worried about the loyalty of the city's Creole and Spanish inhabitants. At the same time, he formed an alliance with Jean Lafitte's smugglers, and formed military units consisting of African-Americans and Muscogees,[92] in addition to recruiting volunteers in the city. Jackson received some criticism for paying white and non-white volunteers the same salary.[93] These forces, along with U.S. Army regulars and volunteers from surrounding states, joined with Jackson's force in defending New Orleans. The approaching British force, led by Admiral Alexander Cochrane and later General Edward Pakenham, consisted of over 10,000 soldiers, many of whom had served in the Napoleonic Wars.[92] Jackson only had about 5,000 men, most of whom were inexperienced and poorly trained.[94]
