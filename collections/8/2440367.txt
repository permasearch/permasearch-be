This notion of building up the operating system from a collection of dynamically loaded libraries is a core concept of Windows that persists as of  2015[update]. DLLs provide the standard benefits of shared libraries, such as modularity. Modularity allows changes to be made to code and data in a single self-contained DLL shared by several applications without any change to the applications themselves.
