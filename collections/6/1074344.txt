A Pitot (/ˈpiːtoʊ/ PEE-toh) tube, also known as Pitot probe, is a flow measurement device used to measure fluid flow velocity. The pitot tube was invented by the French engineer Henri Pitot in the early 18th century[1] and was modified to its modern form in the mid-19th century by French scientist Henry Darcy.[2] It is widely used to determine the airspeed of an aircraft, water speed of a boat, and to measure liquid, air and gas flow velocities in certain industrial applications. The pitot tube is used to measure the local flow velocity at a given point in the flow stream and not the average flow velocity in the pipe or conduit.[3] Errors induced due to the location of the measuring tube on the aircraft, and the effect of localised airflow upon it, are known as "position errors" and need to be factored into resultant calculations.
