Ancient technology is among the most advanced encountered in the Stargate universe rivaled only by the Ori, who are the same race as the Ancients, and the Asgard who revealed some of their most advanced technologies only shortly before their extinction. Their technology was so advanced that even after 10,000 years with no advancements, it is still superior to the Asgards[33] and the Ori.  Among their many achievements, the Stargates and Atlantis are perhaps their most famous, but they have also developed technology as diverse as flying cities, advanced power sources, advanced healing devices and DNA Resequencer (Stargate). Much of the Ancients' weapons technology was used or designed for use in the centuries-long war with the Wraith in the Pegasus Galaxy.
