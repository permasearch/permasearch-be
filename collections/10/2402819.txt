After overcoming the pain that resulted from the death of her father and the relinquishing of his body, Miss Emily eventually found hope in a prospective companion of hers. Many people in the town believed that she would marry a man named Homer Barron who had just moved into their town.[7] But when it was discovered that Homer was not a marrying man, despite his current engagement to Miss Emily, he suddenly disappeared, and the townspeople believed he had moved away.[1] Miss Emily would now be alone again. The townspeople noticed that she stopped coming out of her house and would eventually “fall ill in the house filled with dust and shadows, with only a doddering Negro man to wait on her.”[8]
