Around the world and especially in English-speaking countries, the VOC is widely known as the "Dutch East India Company". The name ‘Dutch East India Company’ is used to make a distinction with the [British] East India Company (EIC) and other East Indian companies (such as the Danish East India Company, French East India Company, Portuguese East India Company, and the Swedish East India Company). The company's alternative names that have been used include the ‘Dutch East Indies Company’, ‘United East India Company’, ‘United East Indian Company’, ‘United East Indies Company’, ‘Jan Company’, or ‘Jan Compagnie’.[22][23]
