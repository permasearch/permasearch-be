Bill is buried on a hilltop cemetery in Brooklyn, adjacent to Priest Vallon. Amsterdam buries his father's razor and leaves for San Francisco with Jenny, narrating that in time New York would be rebuilt as if "we were never here". The passage of time is depicted rapidly, with modern New York being built up over the next hundred years and the graves of Bill and the Priest becoming overgrown and forgotten.
