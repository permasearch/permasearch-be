In the 1990s and early 2000s, loans by companies to executives with low interest rates and "forgiveness" often served as a form of compensation. Before new loans were banned in 2002, more than 30percent of the 1500 largest US firms disclosed cash loans to executives in their regulatory filings,[256] and this "insider indebtedness" totaled $4.5 billion, with the average loan being about $11 million. "About half" of the companies granting executive loans charged no interest, and half charged below market rates,[257] and in either case the loans were often "forgiven." An estimated $1 billion of the loans extended before 2002 (when they were banned) will eventually be forgiven, either while the executives are still at their companies or when they leave.[258][259] Much of money loaned was used to buy company stock, but executives were not barred from simultaneously selling shares they already owned,[260] and could delay disclosure of their sales of company stock (useful when executive knew the price would fall) for far longer than it could normal sales[261] by selling stock to the company to pay off loans.
