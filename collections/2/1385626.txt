Shortly afterwards, Stone's troops are hit by air strikes as well. Taken completely by surprise, and with his forces being quickly overrun, Stone instructs all his soldiers to fight to the death.  After overrunning Stone's armored and artillery positions, the Mexican tanks charge headlong, targeting the enemy headquarters.
