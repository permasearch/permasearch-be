Amphetamine and other stimulants are used by some athletes for their psychological and performance-enhancing effects.[15][16] In competitive sports, this form of use is prohibited by anti-doping regulations.[15] In healthy people at oral therapeutic doses, amphetamine has been shown to increase physical strength,[15][17] acceleration,[15][17] stamina,[15][18] and endurance,[15][18] while reducing reaction time.[15] Like methylphenidate and bupropion, amphetamine increases stamina and endurance in humans primarily through reuptake inhibition and release of dopamine in the central nervous system.[17][18]
