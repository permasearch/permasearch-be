New growth in trees occurs in a layer of cells near the bark. A tree's growth rate changes in a predictable pattern throughout the year in response to seasonal climate changes, resulting in visible growth rings. Each ring marks a complete cycle of seasons, or one year, in the tree's life.[1] As of 2013[update], the oldest tree-ring measurements in the Northern Hemisphere are a floating sequence extending from about 12,580 to 13,900 years.[2] Dendrochronology derives from Ancient Greek: δένδρον (dendron), meaning "tree limb", χρόνος (khronos), meaning "time", and -λογία (-logia), "the study of".
