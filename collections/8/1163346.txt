The design of the car has been changed to a more conservative appearance. The "fluidic sculpture" design that persisted across the Hyundai portfolio since 2011 is gone in the sixth generation Elantra. The car is now more like a fastback with its roofline sloped from the windshield to the rear of the car and it has less curves overall with pentagonal head and tail lights, a hexagonal grille, and redesigned body panels and bumper emphasizing straight lines along the body. The windshield is drawn back from the hood further than the prior generation, making for a more traditional sedan look. The interior is also less curved, with a cockpit, audio/temp controls and glove compartment in a single bow line across the dash. This was done without reducing the interior cabin space of the prior generation at 110.2 cubic feet (while the Elantra is sold under the compact class, it classifies as a mid-size sedan according to the EPA.)[45]
