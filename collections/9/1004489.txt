Since the late 1990s, custom dog tags have been fashionable amongst musicians (particularly rappers), and as a marketing give-away item. Numerous companies  offer customers the opportunity to create their own personalized dog tags with their own photos, logos, and text. Even high-end jewelers  have featured gold and silver dog tags encrusted with diamonds and other jewels.
