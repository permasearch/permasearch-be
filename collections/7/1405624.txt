The reformed group's Myspace webpage confirmed that a new single would be released 24 April entitled "Hangin' Around". "Hangin' Around" became the group's lowest charting hit to date, peaking outside the UK top 40. However, despite this setback, the group continued and they announced that their second album "Re-Entry" (originally due for a May release) would finally be released in early 2007. The third single from the album (as "Yours Fatally" was to be included), confirmed as "Big Bro Thang", was announced to have a release before the album.[citation needed] The song won the fan's voting poll vote on their official website and due to popular demand, was picked as the third single.
