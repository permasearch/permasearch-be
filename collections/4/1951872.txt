Marvel worked closely with Capcom to include dialogue quips and mid-match events between the companies' characters.[12] Comic book writer Frank Tieri was assigned to write the character dialogue and endings for the game.[19] Marvel also gave Tieri full use of their library of characters for storyline purposes.[20] As a result, several unplayable characters from the Marvel and Capcom universes, such as the Fantastic Four, Ghost Rider, Daredevil, MegaMan Volnutt, Nemesis, and Phoenix Wright, make cameo appearances in the campaign stages and Arcade Mode endings.[21]
