The main television coverage of Celebrity Big Brother was screened on CBS during the winter of the 2017–18 network television season. CBS decided to schedule the spin-off during the February 2018 sweeps period to counterprogram NBC's coverage of the 2018 Winter Olympics.[15] Episodes aired on Sundays, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays with two special episodes on Thursday, February 8 and Saturday, February 24. All episodes aired for one hour and aired from 8:00-9:00 p.m. EST; the Friday episodes and the season finale, however, ran for two hours each (from 8:00-10:00 p.m. EST).[28] The live Internet feeds returned for the American version of Celebrity Big Brother as part of CBS All Access.[15][12] Alongside the weekly shows on CBS, the companion series Big Brother: After Dark returned on Pop under the title Celebrity Big Brother: After Dark. The show provided live coverage nightly from inside the House.[15][29]
