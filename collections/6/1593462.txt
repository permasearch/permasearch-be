Laureates are announced with the Nobel Prize laureates, and receive the award at the same ceremony.[3] The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awards the prize "in accordance with the rules governing the award of the Nobel Prizes instituted through his [Alfred Nobel's] will,"[8] which stipulate that the prize be awarded annually to "those who ... shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind."[19]
