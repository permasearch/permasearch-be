The main hall measures 456 by 310 feet (139 by 94 m).  The barrel vault ceiling is 137 feet (42 m) high.  Ten pairs of three-hinged steel trusses support this unusually large clear span; there are no supporting columns.  Each pair of trusses spans 350 feet (110 m) and weighs 220 short tons (200 t).  The trusses are tied to the frame columns to allow the building to flex slightly with wind and ground pressure. The barrel ceiling consists of painted aluminum tiles.  It is decorated to resemble Roman bath tiles, and extends over 196,000 square feet (18,200 m2).[6]
