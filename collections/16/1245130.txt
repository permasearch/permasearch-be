I-10 enters Texas northwest of El Paso near Anthony and travels southward, concurrent with US 85 and US 180. US 85 splits off in West El Paso at exit 13 (Sunland Park Drive, Paisano Drive), where US 85 heads south on Paisano Drive, through downtown El Paso, and ends at the Stanton Street Bridge and the border with Mexico via local streets. As of Summer 2016, Interstate 10 through El Paso is undergoing a major construction project, which seeks to link North/South Desert Boulevard (the westside frontage roads) with Gateway East and Gateway West (the central and eastside frontage roads). Several miles of frontage road are being built where none previously existed. I-10/US 180 continues turning to the east towards downtown El Paso. I-10 then meets I-110 and US 54 (the "Patriot Freeway", or North–South Freeway) in a complex, three-level interchange referred to by locals as the "Spaghetti Bowl." I-10 and US 180 diverge east of downtown at exit 23B (Paisano Drive) as US 180 heads off to the northeast (joining US 62 and Paisano Drive northbound) and I-10 to the southeast. I-10's frontage road system is called Desert Boulevard in West El Paso, and Gateway Boulevard in Central and East El Paso. Of these, Gateway East Boulevard is the longest, extending continuously for roughly 22 miles (35 km). Heading towards Tornillo and Fabens, I-10 turns to the southeast and begins to parallel the Rio Grande and Mexican border for approximately 60 miles (97 km).
