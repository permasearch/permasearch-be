Arkansas started their next drive at their own 47-yard line after a 41-yard kickoff return by Dennis Johnson, and drove 53-yards for a touchdown, scoring on fourth-and-one from the Bama twelve-yard line on a Dick pass to Andrew Davie.[47] Bama responded with a 68-yard drive capped off by a 25-yard touchdown pass from John Parker Wilson to Julio Jones.[47] Arkansas put together a steady drive on their next possession, but Justin Woodall intercepted Dick at the Bama 26-yard line and returned it 74-yards for a touchdown.[49] Arkansas put together another solid drive, but facing a first and goal at the Bama one-yard line, Arkansas was kept out by the stout Bama defense on a goal line stand to close out the half with Bama up 35â€“7.[47]
