Being a British colony until 1947, many British traditions stayed on in India.[19] Christmas is a state holiday in India, although Christianity in India is a minority with only 2.3% (of 1.237Â Billion)[20] of the population. Most of the Christians, especially Catholics in India attend the midnight mass.[21] Many Christian houses in India decorate Christmas cribs, hang brightly lit stars outside their houses and distribute sweets and cakes to their neighbors. In many of the schools that are run by the Christian missionaries, the children actively participate in Christmas programs. Also in many non-religious schools, there is tradition of Christmas celebration. Christmas is also increasingly celebrated by other religions in India.[22] Christmas is known as "Badaa Din" (Big Day) in North and North-West India and people plant trees on this day.[23][24][25]
