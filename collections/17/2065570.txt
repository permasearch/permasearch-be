On 19 November 2007, Singapore Deputy Prime Minister S. Jayakumar refuted Malaysia's claim that Singapore was attempting to subvert the status quo by claiming sovereignty of Pedra Branca. He said Singapore was "an honest, law-abiding state that has never and will never do anything to endanger navigational safety, security arrangements or the Singapore Strait's environment". Rather, it was Malaysia that had sought to alter the status quo by publishing a map in 1979 that altered maritime boundaries with seven neighbouring countries. This was evidenced by a telegram that the Malaysian Government had sent to its overseas missions in December 1979, notifying them that the map would "affect" Brunei, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore and Vietnam.[46]
