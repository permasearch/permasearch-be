In January 2007, the band announced they were in the process of making a music video.[43] In February, the band went on their first UK tour in three years.[44] After touring and promoting previous record Déjà Entendu, the band became increasingly reluctant to give interviews or talk to the press in promotion of the record.[45] In one of a few exceptions during the UK tour, Lacey discussed that this was due to many journalists and publications misrepresenting and taking quotes out of context in order to make their interviews more interesting.[46] Lacey also felt "more comfortable" not having to worry about photo shoots and music videos and instead just concentrate on writing and performing music.[47] Few television, radio or online performances were given either. Lead singer Jesse Lacey was interviewed by WFNX on 24 April 2007 at the First Act Guitar Studio, Boston as part of an acoustic performance for VW Green Room that was subsequently made available to download.[29][48] The track "Jesus Christ" was performed on both NBC's Late Night with Conan O'Brien and the Late Show with David Letterman on CBS.
