In 2013, there are persistent disparities in SIDS deaths among racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. In 2009, the rates of death range from 20.3 per 100,000 live births for Asian/Pacific Islander to 119.2 per 100,000 live births for American Indians/Alaska Native. African American infants have a 24% greater risk of having a SIDS related death[77] and experience a 2.5 greater incidence of SIDS than in Caucasian infants.[78] Rates are per 100,000 live births and enable more accurate comparison across groups of different total population size.
