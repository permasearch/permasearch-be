The island was first inhabited by people who crossed over the land bridge from the European mainland. Human footprints have been found from over 800,000 years ago in Norfolk[31] and traces of early humans have been found (at Boxgrove Quarry, Sussex) from some 500,000 years ago[32] and modern humans from about 30,000 years ago.
