In December 2005, News 12 Networks generated criticism when it changed its website and mobile app to a pay subscription service for those who live outside the News 12 viewing area.  The News 12 website is offered free of charge to subscribers of Cablevision, Charter Spectrum, Comcast,  or Service Electric.  This has been used as a marketing tool against customers signing up for Verizon FiOS, or satellite providers DirecTV or Dish Network, which are available in many of the areas News 12 covers. In response, Verizon FIOS created FiOS1 News in 2007 and later expanded to the Lower Hudson Valley in 2014, which can be viewed only by FiOS customers[6] Unlike News 12, FiOS1's website is not under the paywall and is open to all users, with the exception of its live broadcast (which is only offered to FiOS customers).
