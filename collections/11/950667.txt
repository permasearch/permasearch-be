In November 2015, an elderly woman, Marion Munns, died after jumping from the A3057 bridge that crosses over the M27, into westbound traffic, just before Junction 3. She had become distressed due to mental illness, and escaped from her Southampton home through an upstairs window before climbing off the garage roof and running away. 9 people were taken to hospital to receive treatment for shock.
