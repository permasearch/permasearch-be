Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane created a cartoon short entitled Life of Larry.[8] The short centered around a middle-aged man named Larry and his anthropomorphic dog Steve.[9] In 1997, when MacFarlane was working for Hanna-Barbera Studios, writing for shows such as Johnny Bravo, Dexter's Laboratory, and Cow and Chicken,[10] he made a sequel to Life of Larry.[11] The short caught the eye of 20th Century Fox representatives, who asked him to create a TV series revolving around the characters.[9] MacFarlane received a US$50,000 budget to develop a pilot for the show, which was, as MacFarlane stated in a 2006 interview, "[...] about one twentieth of what most pilots cost".[10] MacFarlane claims to have drawn inspiration from several sitcoms, namely The Simpsons and All in the Family.[12] Several premises were also carried over from several 1980s Saturday morning cartoons he watched as a child, namely The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang, and Rubik, the Amazing Cube.[13]
