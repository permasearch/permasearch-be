On 23 August 1963, the "She Loves You" single was released in the United Kingdom with "I'll Get You" as the B-side.[21] The songwriting credit on the label was switched to "Lennon–McCartney" for this release—a switch from the "McCartney–Lennon" order of nearly all prior Beatles releases—and would remain this way during the remainder of the band's tenure.[22]
