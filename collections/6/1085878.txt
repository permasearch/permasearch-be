It is now generally settled in caselaw that jurisdictions in the U.S. and Canada have the right to enact breed-specific legislation.[59] Despite these holdings by the courts, there is some public skepticism over whether the laws are effective.[60] One point of view is that pit bulls are a public safety issue that merits actions such as banning ownership, mandatory spay/neuter for all pit bulls, mandatory microchip implants and liability insurance, or prohibiting people convicted of a felony from owning pit bulls.[61] Another point of view is that comprehensive "dog bite" legislation, coupled with better consumer education and legally mandating responsible pet-keeping practices, is a better solution to the problem of dangerous pit bulls than BSL.[31][62]
