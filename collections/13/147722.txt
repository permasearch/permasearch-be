Zack and Cody accept the offer to become the stars of the television show, although Cody gets stage fright and can't act, leading to a fight, so Carey gives them a timeout. During the timeout, some twins (guest stars The Veronicas) sing in front of the audience, and the writers fire Zack & Cody and hire them. Meanwhile, London and Maddie sneak onto a movie set to see a cute actor, and the director mistakes them for stunt doubles.
