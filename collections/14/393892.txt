Bongo (voiced by Morgan Deare, Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin voiced by Jeff Bergman) is a cartoon gorilla bouncer of The Ink and Paint Club. The password that Eddie uses to get in was "Walt sent me" and Bongo lets him in. He also tosses Eddie out of the club when he catches Eddie spying on Jessica Rabbit and Marvin P. Acme in Jessica's dressing room. He is seen again in the deleted Pig Head scene where he knocks Eddie out cold for sneaking back into Jessica's dressing room. In those parts of the movie, he was supposedly a henchman of Doom until the final scene where he is seen with the other Toons following Judge Doom's destruction. It is possible after Doom's death that Bongo reformed and is now good.
