Despite Southern California's continued rapid growth and the proliferation of cell phones and pagers, 213 was not projected to exhaust until 2050. In contrast, 323 was projected to exhaust in 2017.[2] Since 213 still had an abundance of numbers available, and rather than add yet another area code to California's 30+ area codes already in service, the California Public Utilities Commission approved a plan that merged the boundary between 213 and 323, converting them into overlay area codes for all of central Los Angeles. Since this change went into full effect on July 8, 2017, telephone companies have been able to assign any available 213 numbers in the former 323 area and vice versa, and customers with 213 or 323 phone numbers have been required to dial the area code even to call other 213 or 323 numbers (10/11-digit dialing).[3][4] This change brought back 213 to some areas that had used it for more than half a century prior to 1998.[1]
