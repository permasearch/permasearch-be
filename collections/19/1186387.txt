In 1952, the agency launched a campaign for Schweppes using the beverage maker's United States president, Edward Whitehead, as company spokesman "Commander Whitehead".[10][17] The campaign increased sales by 600 percent in six months and grew from a single ad to a TV campaign that lasted through the 1960s.[17] That same year, Hewitt, Ogilvy, Benson, & Mather produced the "Come to Britain" campaign for the British Tourist Authority, which led to Britain rising from the fifth to first American tourist destination.[13]
