Individuals identified as having a condition known as hyperthymesia are able to remember very intricate details of their own personal life, but the ability seems not to extend to other, non-autobiographical information.[22][medical citation needed] They may have vivid recollections such as who they were with, what they were wearing, and how they were feeling on a specific date many years in the past. Patients under study, such as Jill Price, show brain scans that resemble those with obsessiveâ€“compulsive disorder. In fact, Price's unusual autobiographical memory has been attributed as a byproduct of compulsively making journal and diary entries. Hyperthymestic patients may additionally suffer from depression stemming from the inability to forget unpleasant memories and experiences from the past.[23] It is a misconception that hyperthymesia suggests any eidetic ability.
