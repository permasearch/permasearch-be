Some food, such as butter, eggs, milk, and such need to be kept cool.  Before modern refrigeration was available, iceboxes were popular. However, the problem with an icebox was that the cabinet housing it was large, but the actual refrigerated space was quite small, so a clever and innovative solution was invented, the "cold pantry", sometimes called a "California cooler".[4]  The cold pantry usually consisted of a cabinet or cupboard with wooden-slat shelves (to allow for air circulation).  An opening near the top vented to the outside, either through the roof or high out the wall.  A second opening near the bottom vented also to the outside, but low near the ground and usually on the north side of the house where the air was cooler.  As the air in the pantry warmed, it rose, escaping through the upper vent.  This in turn drew cooler air in from the lower vent, providing constant circulation of cooler air.  In the summertime, the temperatures in the cold pantry would usually hover several degrees lower than the ambient temperature in the house, while in the wintertime, the temperature in the cold pantry would be considerably lower than that in the house.
