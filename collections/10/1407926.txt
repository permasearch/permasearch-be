Prior to the referendum on same-sex marriage, the church remained neutral on the issue.[54] In 2015, the Bishop of Cork, the Rt. Rev. Paul Colton,[55] Bishop Michael Burrows of Cashel,[56] and two retired archbishops of Dublin endorsed same-sex marriage.[57] While voting "no" on gay marriage, Bishop Pat Storey endorsed civil unions.[58] Also, 55 clergy signed a letter supporting the blessing of same-sex couples.[59] In its pastoral letter, the church reiterated that, presently, church marriages are only for heterosexual couples, but that clergy may offer prayers for same-sex couples.[60] When asked about clergy entering into civil same-sex marriages, the letter stated that "all are free to exercise their democratic entitlements once they are enshrined in legislation. However, members of the clergy, are further bound by the Ordinal and by the authority of the General Synod of the Church of Ireland."[60] Services of Thanksgiving for same-sex marriage have taken place in congregations; for example, St. Audoen's Church hosted "a service of thanksgiving" for same-sex marriage.[61] LGBTI services are also allowed by the Diocese of Cork, Cloyne and Ross.[62]
