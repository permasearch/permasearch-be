The cause of malaria was unknown until the late 19th century. Colonial physicians attributed it to " miasma" or bad air.[26] In reality this disease is a parasite that is found in certain species of mosquitoes, which bred more rapidly as virgin soil was broken in the Carolina lowlands for rice cultivation.[27] The parasite found the slaves as a reservoir for the infection of the mosquito. The mosquito then transmitted the parasite to other slaves and the white population, causing rapid development of highly malarious communities. The disease spread across the South and Northwest. People who newly arrived from Europe were especially vulnerable to the deadly forms, but after the second generation, the colonists typically suffered non-fatal cases, characterized by a feverish season for a few weeks every year.[28]
