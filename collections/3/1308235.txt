Former guidance counselor for students at Andover and college admissions authority, Donald Dunbar, suggested that essays must emphasize personal character and demonstrate intellectual curiosity, maturity, social conscience, concern for the community, tolerance, and inclusiveness.[193] He advises don't just "be yourself", but show your "best self",[194] and that demonstrating class participation suggests a "willingness to go beyond selfishness" and shows enthusiasm for learning.[195] Alan Gelb suggests that the only no-no is "shameless self-promotion".[196] Topics to avoid[according to whom?] include babysitting experiences, pets, encounters with illegal drugs or alcohol or criminal activity,[197] excuses to explain a low grade,[197] stories about a former home or big brother or sister,[198] simply listing achievements,[197] expressing thanks for being chosen as a leader, talking about a "wilderness leadership course",[199] general complaining or whining,[197] racism or sexism or disrespect for groups of people,[197] bad taste or profanity or vulgarity or bathroom humor,[197] early love or sex experiences,[197] criticism or disrespect for parents,[197] telling only jokes,[197] excessive bragging or too many instances of the "I" pronoun,[197][200] divulging personal health information about yourself or a friend or a family member,[197] copy-and-pasting a term paper in the essay form[197] such as about global warming or the European debt crisis, and experiences involving lawbreaking or illegal activity.[197] Applicants should not express opinions too strongly as if no possible counterviews were possible.[197] The topic should be something the applicant cares about,[201] and should show leadership in the sense of "asserting yourself to help others have more success." According to Dunbar, leadership is not necessarily about being in charge such as being the team captain or school president.[202] Applicants should present a broad perspective and avoid simplistic words such as never, always, only, or nobody, which suggest narrow thinking.[203] Dunbar advised against the standard "tell 'em what you've told 'em" essay formula but doing something different, interesting, and exciting.[204]
