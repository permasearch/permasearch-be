Pepper Jack cheese is a derivative of Monterey Jack that is flavored with spicy chili peppers, as well as various peppers and herbs.[9] Pepper Jack is often used as an alternative to regular Jack cheese in dishes such as quesadillas, but can be eaten with bread or crackers as a snack or as part of an hors d'oeuvre. There are some other versions that are flavored with garlic or pesto, although they are less common than Pepper Jack.[citation needed]
