The coagulation factors are generally serine proteases (enzymes), which act by cleaving downstream proteins.  The exceptions are tissue factor, FV, FVIII, FXIII.[8] Tissue factor, FV and FVIII are glycoproteins, and Factor XIII is a transglutaminase.[7] The coagulation factors circulate as inactive zymogens. The coagulation cascade is therefore classically divided into three pathways. The tissue factor and contact activation pathways both activate the "final common pathway" of factor X, thrombin and fibrin.[9]
