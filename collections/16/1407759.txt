Swedish artist Oscar Reutersvärd was one of the first to deliberately design many impossible objects. He has been called "the father of impossible figures".[6] In 1934 he drew the Penrose triangle, some years before the Penroses. In Reutersvärd's version the sides of the triangle are broken up into cubes.
