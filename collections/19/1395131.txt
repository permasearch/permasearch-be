Sheila eventually overcomes her conditions and continues to spend a great deal of her time with Frank. Sheila starts a relationship with Jody and they appear to have a loving, healthy relationship. However, when Karen has an accident, Sheila breaks things off with Jody and encourages him to take care of Karen. In season 4, Sheila starts internet dating. She meets a Native American man with five little nieces and nephews. She wants to adopt the children but is required to be married, so she marries Frank while he is unconscious in the hospital. However, he is still married to Monica so they never really get married. Her request for adoption is denied. Then, Sheila and Sammi begin to disagree about Frank and the house and many other things, and Frank finds himself in the middle of their little "war". All three get into a fight and Frank yells at both of them, and his home brewing setup blows up destroying Sheila's home. She steals an RV and leaves to fulfill her dream to travel and go live with Karen and Jody.
