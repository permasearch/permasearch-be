Conventional models of drumlin formation fall into two camps:[9] constructional, in which they form as sediment is manipulated into shape, for example via subglacial deformation; and remnant/erosional, which proposes that drumlins form by erosion of material from an unconsolidated bed (reference).  A hypothesis that catastrophic sub-glacial floods form drumlins by deposition or erosion challenges conventional explanations for drumlins.[10]  It includes deposition of glaciofluvial sediment in cavities scoured into a glacier bed by subglacial meltwater and remnant ridges left behind by erosion of soft-sediment or hard-rock by turbulent meltwater. This hypothesis requires huge, subglacial meltwater floods, each of which would raise sea-level by tens of centimetres in a few weeks. Studies of erosional forms in bedrock at French River, Ontario, Canada provide evidence for such floods.
