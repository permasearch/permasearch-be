In 2008, Michael's rough upbringing was visited. Michael Gross was introduced to the series as his father River Baldwin, a man Michael "thinks is a low-life, reprobate. A guy who refused to go to Vietnam and left Gloria to raise their son alone."[6] LeBlanc thought it was a "great story", although it took a while to come to fruition.[7] LeBlanc said that Michael's yearning to find his birth father stemmed from having his own son, Fen, explaining: "I think it all started when he had Fen. It keys it off for a lot of fathers. This is a man who went to prison. He went to therapy to change his dark ways. He was a violent man and he claimed he never had a family. Then his family shows up and then you find out why he denied his family for so long."[7] Speaking of whether or not Michael could shift back to his "dark side", he said "I donâ€™t know if it will be his downfall or not, because Lowell is such an unexpected character, and it certainly pushes all those buttons again".[7]
