In his review of the two-episode premiere, Hank Stuever of The Washington Post graded it a "B+" and wrote the series "is right in line with the tone and style of the original, now-classic series", and that it "raises more questions in two hours than it will readily answer".[37] Stephen Marche of Esquire wrote that the first few episodes were better than those of Breaking Bad.[38] Kirsten Acuna of Business Insider declared the initial episodes "everything you could possibly want from a spinoff television series".[39] Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times wrote, "Better Call Saul is better than good: It's delightful – in a brutal, darkly comic way, of course."[40] Vulture writer Eric Konigsberg noted the show was special as it was "the first spinoff of this golden age of premium cable."[41] Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com gave the first season a positive review, saying, "Better Call Saul is not only a great show in the context of the program that birthed it into existence, but would be a great show with or without Walter White."[42]
