At the following year's North American International Auto Show, Ford introduced a redesigned Mustang previewed by the 2003 concept vehicle that was codenamed "S-197". Its platform was the D2C for the 2005 model year. Developed under the direction of Chief Engineer Hau Thai-Tang and exterior styling designer Sid Ramnarace, the fifth generation Mustang drew inspiration from the first-generation 1964-1970 Mustangs.[9][10] The design aesthetic of J Mays, Ford's Senior Vice President of Design, has been described as "retro-futurism."[11]
