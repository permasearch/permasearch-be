Following an undefeated season in the American Athletic Conference and their victory over the Auburn Tigers—who had beaten both the Alabama Crimson Tide and the Georgia Bulldogs in the regular season before losing to Georgia in the 2017 SEC Championship Game—in the 2018 Peach Bowl, the UCF Knights claimed to have won the national championship by virtue of being the only undefeated team in the FBS level of college football.[9] This claim, however, is not recognized by any major poll. The selection committee ranked UCF 12th at the end of the regular season, below a number of two-loss teams from the Power Five conferences, which left them out of the CFP.[3] UCF announced plans for a victory parade at Disney World[10] and to hang a national championship banner at their stadium to celebrate this achievement.[11] The school also paid national championship bonuses to all of its assistant coaches, many of whom left UCF after the Peach Bowl to follow head coach Scott Frost to his new head coaching job at Nebraska; Frost himself (who coached UCF in the game) did not receive such a bonus because he had already been paid all of the bonuses allowed by his UCF contract.[12]
