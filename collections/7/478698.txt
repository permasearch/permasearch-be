The council received further criticism for their lack of support on 18 June 2017.[228] Some families were reported to be sleeping on the floor in local centres four days after the event.[229] A leading volunteer in the relief effort said: "Kensington and Chelsea are giving £10 to the survivors when they go to the hotels – a tenner – there is money pouring in from all these amazing volunteers. We can't get access to this money."[229]
