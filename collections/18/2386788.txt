Since the 2007 model redesign, the Navigator no longer uses the same transfer case as the Expedition. Expedition four-wheel drives continue to use a two-speed dual range transfer case with off-road low range reduction gearing and default off-road program that remaps (reprograms) the electronic throttle control and traction control system response for off-road conditions. Navigator four-wheel drives have been demoted to a light-duty one-speed single range transfer case which lacks low range gearing.
