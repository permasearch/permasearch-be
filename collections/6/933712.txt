In 1958, Rockefeller established the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association (DLMA), which commissioned Skidmore, Owings and Merrill to draw up plans for revitalizing Lower Manhattan. The plans, made public in late June 1960, called for a World Trade Center to be built on a 13-acre (53,000 m2) site along the East River, at the South Street Seaport, one of the Lower Manhattan ports that had seen a continuous decline in business over the past decade.[11][12] The site would be bounded clockwise from the south by Old Slip, Water Street, Fulton Street, and South Street,[13][14] and the complex itself would be located on "a two-story platform that would supersede and displace the conventional street grid".[12] The proposed complex included a 900-foot-long (270 m) exhibition hall, as well as a 50- to 70-story building with a hotel located on some of its upper floors.[15]  Other amenities would include a theater, shops, and restaurants.[16]  The plan also called for a new securities exchange building, which the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association hoped would house the New York Stock Exchange.[14]
