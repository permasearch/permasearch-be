The basic quark contains about 0.2% fat;[citation needed] this basic quark or skimmed quark (Magerquark) must under German Law have less than 10% fat by dry mass.[31][32] Quark with higher fat content is made by adding cream after cooling.[31][26] It has a very smooth and creamy texture and is slightly sweet (unlike sour cream). A firmer version called Schichtkäse (layer cheese) is often used for baking. Schichtkäse is distinguished from quark by having an added layer of cream sandwiched between two layers of quark.
