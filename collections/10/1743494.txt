Ring Mall is the main pedestrian road used by students and faculty to travel around the core campus. The road measures up to a perfect mile and completely encircles Aldrich Park.[35] Most schools and libraries are lined up by this road with each of these schools having their own central plaza which also connects to the Aldrich Park.
