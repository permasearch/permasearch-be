As a result, SSB transmissions use the available amplifier energy more efficiently, providing longer-range transmission with little or no additional cost. Receivers normally select one of the two sidebands to amplify anyway, so implementing SSB in the receiver is simply a matter of allowing it to choose which sideband to amplify on reception, rather than simply choosing one or the other in the design stage.
