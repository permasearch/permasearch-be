Starting 2004, Hotels.com has published a twice-yearly review of international hotel room price trends called the Hotels.com Hotel Price Index based on the prices paid per room by its customers using a weighted average based on the number of rooms sold in each of the markets in which it operates.[10] Information includes notable price changes and comparisons between destinations, hotel types, and other price-related analyses for the previous six months.[11] The Hotel Price Index is published both digitally and in print, and is aimed at journalists, the media, and hoteliers as part of its public relations.
