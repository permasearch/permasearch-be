On 4 August the ship was at Cape Cod, from which Hudson sailed south to the entrance of the Chesapeake Bay. Rather than entering the Chesapeake he explored the coast to the north, finding Delaware Bay but continuing on north. On 3 September he reached the estuary of the river that initially was called the "North River" or "Mauritius" and now carries his name. He was not the first European to discover the estuary, though, as it had been known since the voyage of Giovanni da Verrazzano in 1524. On 6 September 1609 John Colman of his crew was killed by Indians with an arrow to his neck.[25] Hudson sailed into the upper bay on 11 September,[26] and the following day began a journey up what is now known as the Hudson River.[27] Over the next ten days his ship ascended the river, reaching a point about where the present-day capital of Albany is located.[28]
