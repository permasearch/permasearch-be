The online attention the wedding received made Mirza the most searched woman tennis player and Indian sportsperson in 2010, according to Google Trends.[57] The wedding was controversial because Malik was accused by another woman of already being married to her and hence he could not marry Mirza without first divorcing her. Initially for many days, Malik refused to grant the divorce claiming he was never married and as this resulted in media attention, he finally divorced the woman.[58]
