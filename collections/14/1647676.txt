Maulana Abdus Salam Nomani (d. 1987), an Imam of the Gyanvapi mosque,[7] contested the claim that a temple was destroyed to build the mosque. According to him, the foundation of the mosque was laid by the third Mughal emperor Akbar, and Akbar's grandson and Aurangzeb's father Shah Jahan started a madrasah called Imam-e-Sharifat at the site of the mosque in 1048 hijri (1638-39 CE).[8][9]
