Silver is 6% more conductive than copper, but due to cost it is not practical in most cases. However, it is used in specialized equipment, such as satellites, and as a thin plating to mitigate skin effect losses at high frequencies. Famously, 14,700 short tons (13,300Â t) of silver on loan from the Treasury were used in the making of the calutron magnets during World War II due to wartime shortages of copper.
