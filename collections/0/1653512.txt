it follows that the expectation value changes sign under inversion. We used here the fact that       I     {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {I}}}  , being a symmetry operator, is unitary:        I    − 1   =    I    ∗      {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {I}}^{-1}={\mathfrak {I}}^{*}\,}   and by definition the Hermitian adjoint        I    ∗      {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {I}}^{*}\,}   may be moved from bra to ket and then becomes        I    ∗ ∗   =   I      {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {I}}^{**}={\mathfrak {I}}\,}  . Since the only quantity that is equal to minus itself is the zero, the expectation value vanishes,
