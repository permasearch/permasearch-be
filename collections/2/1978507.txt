Hungary is a historically Christian country. Hungarian historiography identifies the foundation of the Hungarian state with Stephen I's baptism and coronation with the Holy Hungarian Crown in A.D. 1000. Stephen promulgated Roman Catholicism as the state religion, and his successors were traditionally known as the Apostolic Kings. The Catholic Church in Hungary remained strong through the centuries, and the Archbishop of Esztergom was granted extraordinary temporal privileges as prince-primate of Hungary. Contemporary Hungary has no official religion, but the constitution "recognizes Christianity's nation-building role".[183] Hungary is a secular country, and freedom of religion is a constitutional right.
