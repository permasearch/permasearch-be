As Parsons wrote, "The deep structures do not as such articulate any sentences which could convey coherent meaning. The surface structures constitute the level at which this occurs. The connecting link between them is a set of rules of transformation, to use Chomsky's own phase."[174] The transformative processes and entities are generally, at least on one level of empirical analysis, performed or actualized by myths and religions,[175] but philosophies, art systems, or even semiotic consumer behavior can, in principle, perform that function.[176]
