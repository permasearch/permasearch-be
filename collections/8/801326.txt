On March 16, 2017, NBC announced that it would air the final four episodes of the 42nd season live in all time zones for the first time in its history. NBC executive Robert Greenblatt explained that the show's significant viewership had made it part of the "national conversation", and thus they felt that it would be appropriate for the entire country to be "in on the joke at the same time".[141]
