That night, Buddy complains to Tia that while he can sell anything, he gets bored quickly. On discovering that the neighborhood can be seen on satellite photos via a website called MyEarth (seemingly a parody of Google Earth) but that his house is not visible, Buddy decides to make it visible using Christmas lights. As his display grows bigger, including live animals, it gets Buddy known around town, upsetting Steve and threatening his position as "the Christmas guy" and chairman of the town's WinterFest. Enmity grows between the men; in various incidents, Steve's Christmas-card photo is ruined, his car doors are ripped off, and his private Christmas-tree lot is destroyed. Eventually Buddy's house is completely lit, and even synchronized to music. Steve attempts to deflate the light show by filling Buddy's fusebox with snow, but a backup generator foils his plan. Buddy discovers the sabotage and gets back at Steve by stealing the town Christmas tree and putting it in Steve's house, and "buying" him a car -- for which he forged Steve's signature to a loan for which Steve is on the hook.
