On prom night, when Margaret continues to beg Carrie not to go, Carrie sends her flying into the prayer closet and locks her in.  When Carrie and Tommy get to the prom they dance and have fun with the other people. Carrie even starts to come out of her shell and joke. Meanwhile, Chris has secretly entered the gym with the help of her best friend, Tina Blake, who then stuffs the ballet box. Tommy and Carrie are declared prom king and queen. As Carrie reaches her star on stage Chris dumps a bucket of pig's blood on her. Covered in blood, Carrie stands there stunned. Tommy yells, "What the hell!" before Chris's henchwoman, Tina, projects the video of the shower incident on the big screens. As Carrie starts to leave the stage, the rope holding the bucket slips, dropping it on Tommy and killing him. Chris and her boyfriend Billy run, fearing that they will get caught, as Carrie rushes to Tommy and cradles his head crying. Looking up she sees her own bloody reflection in a pair of sunglasses. Slowly rising, she turns around to face the crowd. The lights begin to flicker as blood droplets begin to levitate off her skin. Her eyes dilate. She screams and knocks everyone to the ground with a telekinetic wave. She locks the doors and sending objects flying all over the gym to kill those she believes are responsible. After opening the sprinklers, she uses electrical wiring to electrocute most of the survivors. Then she levitates across the gym as flames engulf the back stage and curtains.
