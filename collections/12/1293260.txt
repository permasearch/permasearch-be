After presiding over a last place season with the Pirates, Branch Rickey proposed cutting the pay of power superstar Ralph Kiner. When Kiner objected, Rickey famously quipped, "Son, we could have finished last without you!" Health problems forced Branch Rickey to retire in 1955; however, his contributions would help lead to a World Championship for Pittsburgh in 1960. This includes the drafting of Roberto Clemente.[citation needed]
