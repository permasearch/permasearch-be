After earning a medical degree (M.D. or D.O.), the length of training in the United States for a general dermatologist to be eligible for Board Certification by the American Academy of Dermatology, American Board of Dermatology or the American Osteopathic Board of Dermatology is a total of four years.  This training consists of an initial medical, transitional, surgical, or pediatric intern year followed by a three-year dermatology residency.[2][11][12] Following this training, one- or two- year post-residency fellowships are available in immunodermatology, phototherapy, laser medicine, Mohs micrographic surgery, cosmetic surgery, dermatopathology, or pediatric dermatology.  For the past several years, dermatology residency positions in the United States have been one of the most competitive to obtain.[13][14][15]
