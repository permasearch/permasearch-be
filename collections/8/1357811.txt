At first, the outfit was underwhelming, looking much like a one piece swimsuit, with a white yarn puff tail and a headband with bunny ears.   However, Hefner reportedly saw promise in it, and suggested modifications to make it more visually appealing, such as cutting the leg much higher on the hip, exposing more of the wearer's leg and sharpening the v-shape of the costume.  For mass production, the costume was manufactured for the Playboy Clubs by the Chicago-based Kabo Corset Company, and was based upon a "merry widow" style of corset within their line.
