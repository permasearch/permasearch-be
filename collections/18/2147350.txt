Soon, the truth of Fayeâ€™s murder starts to surface and Kate fears being found out. She covers up the truth by framing her employees Joe and Ethel, the only people who know what really happened. At this point, she loses the will to live, especially when she is visited by her second son Aron, who is disgusted by her. Literary critic Sarah Aguiar notes that this incident causes Kate to feel remorse for the first time.[9] She signs over all her possessions to Aron, not Cal.[10] She then commits suicide by taking a lethal dose of morphine.
