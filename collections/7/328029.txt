Fasi as the replacement for the Honolulu Rapid Transit Company (HRT), Honolulu's TheBus system was honored in 1994–1995 and 2000–2001 by the American Public Transportation Association as "America's Best Transit System". TheBus operates 107 routes serving Honolulu and most major cities and towns on O'ahu. TheBus comprises a fleet of 531 buses, and is run by the non-profit corporation O'ahu Transit Services in conjunction with the city Department of Transportation Services.
