Postnatal proinsulin is crucial for metabolic regulation. However, proinsulin in neonates is important for normal development of the nerves of the eye, development of the heart, and general survival of embryonic cells.[18] Regulation of the concentration of proinsulin during embryonic development is crucial, as too much or too little of the peptide can cause defects and death of the fetus.[18] Thus far in the study of neonatal diabetes mellitus, only amino acid change mutations found in the B domain lead to the disease.[8]
