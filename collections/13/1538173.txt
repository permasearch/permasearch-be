Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, running unopposed for president, won the 2012 Yemeni elections.[148] The Houthis (or Ansar Allah), a Zaidi Shia movement and militant group thought to be backed by Iran, took control of the Yemeni government through a series of actions in 2014 and 2015. Saudi Arabia and other countries denounced this as an unconstitutional coup d'Ã©tat.[149]
