With the Beatles still together officially in December 1969, Harrison had no plans to make a solo album of his own and reportedly intended to offer "My Sweet Lord" to Edwin Hawkins.[34][35] Instead, following the Delaney & Bonnie tour, he decided to record it with Billy Preston,[3] for whom Harrison was co-producing a second Apple album, Encouraging Words.[36][37] Recording took place at Olympic Studios in London, in January 1970,[9] with Preston as principal musician,[17] supported by the guitarist, bass player and drummer from the Temptations' backing band.[12] The Edwin Hawkins Singers happened to be on tour in the UK as well, so Harrison invited them to participate;[12][34] Hawkins' gospel group also overdubbed vocals onto the Harrisonâ€“Preston collaboration "Sing One for the Lord" at this time.[5]
