"Alouette" is a popular French-Canadian[1] children's song, commonly thought to be about plucking the feathers from a lark, in retribution for being woken up by its song.[citation needed] Although it is in French, it is well-known among speakers of other languages; in this respect it is similar to "Fr√®re Jacques". Many US Marines and other Allied soldiers learned the song while serving in France during World War I and took it home with them, passing it on to their children and grandchildren.[2][3]
