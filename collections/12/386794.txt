In April and May 2016, three new girls, Ava Briglia, Willow McCarthy, and Aviva Winick were cast in the title role. Lesli Margherita and Karen Aldridge also returned to reprise their roles as Mrs. Wormwood and Mrs. Phelps, respectively. In December 2016, it was announced that Winick had sustained an injury and would not be continuing with the rest of her run. Former Matilda Tori Feinstein rejoined the cast for the remaining run time.
