In 1919, the Stoughton Wagon Company of Stoughton, Wisconsin, had begun putting custom wagon bodies on Model T chassis.[11] By 1929 Ford was by far the biggest seller of station wagons. Since Ford owned its own hardwood forest and mills, at the Ford Iron Mountain Plant in the Michigan Upper Peninsula, it began supplying the wood components for the Model A wagon (although initially some final assembly still took place away from the factory, by Briggs, in Detroit, with wood from the Mengel Company in Louisville, Kentucky).[11] The same year, J. T. Cantrell provided woodie bodies for Chrysler vehicles until 1931.[11]
