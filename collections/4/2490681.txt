Founded 128Â years ago as Birkdale Golf Club in 1889, the club was awarded "Royal" status in 1951.[2] Birkdale Golf Club moved to a new site in Birkdale Hills in 1894,[2] and built a new distinctive art deco clubhouse in 1935.[2] In early 1939, Birkdale was nominated as the venue for the 1940 Open Championship[3] but the Second World War started in September 1939 and the Championship was cancelled.
