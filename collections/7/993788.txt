In each episode, a situation will present itself that can be solved by learning a new skill. When the skill has been learned, and the situation resolved, the Squirrels receive one of Duggee's badges. Each episode ends with a "Duggee Hug", where all the children hug Duggee at once. They then return to their parents with the badge they have earned.
