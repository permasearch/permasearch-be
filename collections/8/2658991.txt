Other key techniques in this field are negative sampling[132] and word embedding. Word embedding, such as word2vec, can be thought of as a representational layer in a deep learning architecture that transforms an atomic word into a positional representation of the word relative to other words in the dataset; the position is represented as a point in a vector space. Using word embedding as an RNN input layer allows the network to parse sentences and phrases using an effective compositional vector grammar. A compositional vector grammar can be thought of as probabilistic context free grammar (PCFG) implemented by an RNN.[133] Recursive auto-encoders built atop word embeddings can assess sentence similarity and detect paraphrasing.[133] Deep neural architectures provide the best results for constituency parsing,[134] sentiment analysis,[135] information retrieval,[136][137] spoken language understanding,[138] machine translation,[104][139] contextual entity linking,[139] writing style recognition,[140] Text classification and others.[141]
