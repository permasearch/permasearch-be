Go on then, brother, in the great reformation you have undertaken.... In all your enterprises for the good of your people, you may count with confidence on the aid and protection of the United States, and on the sincerity and zeal with which I am myself animated in the furthering of this humane work.  You are our brethren of the same land; we wish your prosperity as brethren should do.  Farewell.[32]
