With no hope for five days, most of the remaining crew-members are eaten by sharks or die of salt water poisoning by drinking seawater (which also caused some of those injured to die from infectious wounds). Others swim off from their groups after hallucinating of a non-existent island, never to be seen again. On the 5th day, the surviving crew are rescued by an airplane pilot who spots them by chance and calls for a rescue. Only 317 survive the disaster. Looking for a scapegoat for their own gross negligence, the US Navy court-martials and convicts Captain McVay for "hazarding his ship by failing to zigzag", despite overwhelming evidence supporting McVay (such as even having the former captain of the IJN's I-58 submarine to testify for the trial, which proved McVay to be not at fault). It ends with Captain McVay finally committing suicide years after the tragedy after being harassed and tormented with phone calls and mail from angry and grief-stricken relatives of the deceased crew-members, as well as the media (mostly in the form of newspapers, which placed the blame on him for the ship's sinking).
