The continued remembrance and popularity of the Pony Express can be linked to Buffalo Bill Cody, his autobiographies, and his Wild West Show. The first book dedicated solely to the Pony Express was not published until 1900.[73] However, in his first autobiography, published in 1879, Cody claims to have been an Express rider.[74][75] While this claim has recently come under dispute,[73] his show became the "primary keeper of the pony legend" when it premiered as a scene in the Wild West Show.[73]
