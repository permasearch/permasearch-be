As of the late 1990s Japanese students spent 240 days a year at school, 60 days more than their American counterparts[8] even with the amount of time spent preparing for school festivals and events.[2][8] Traditionally Japanese students attended class on Saturdays;[8] although education reforms from 2002 have made them no longer mandatory,[7] many schools have begun to bring them back to have more time to cover the rigorous material required by the Ministry of Education.
