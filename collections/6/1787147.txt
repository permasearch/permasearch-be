The gravy recipe is genuine – Kelly learnt it from his father-in-law: "Just add flour, salt, a little red wine and don't forget a dollop of tomato sauce".[8] In the late 1970s, Kelly met his future wife, Hilary Brown, at one of his early gigs – the relationship is described in the 1992 song, "When I First Met Your Ma", written for their son, Declan (born 1980).[8][14] In 1984 Brown and Kelly divorced.
