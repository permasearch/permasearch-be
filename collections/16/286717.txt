The most militant working class organization of the 1905–1920 era was the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), formed largely in response to abysmal labor conditions (in 1904, the year before its founding, 27,000 workers were killed on the job[51]) and discrimination against women, minorities, and unskilled laborers by other unions, particularly the AFL.[52] The "Wobblies," as they were commonly known, gained particular prominence from their incendiary and revolutionary rhetoric. Openly calling for class warfare, direct action, workplace democracy and "One Big Union" for all workers regardless of sex, race or skills,[53] the Wobblies gained many adherents after they won a difficult 1912 textile strike (commonly known as the "Bread and Roses" strike) in Lawrence, Massachusetts. They proved ineffective in managing peaceful labor relations and members dropped away. But according to historian Howard Zinn, "the IWW became a threat to the capitalist class, exactly when capitalist growth was enormous and profits huge."[54] The IWW strongly opposed the 1917–18 war effort and faced a campaign of repression from the federal government.[55][56] More than a few Wobblies, such as Frank Little, were beaten or lynched by mobs or died in American jails.[57] The union exists to this day and has been involved in various labor disputes throughout the 2000s.[58][59]
