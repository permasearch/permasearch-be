Korean Air Lines flight 007 (KAL-007) was headed toward Seoul, South Korea from Anchorage, AK on Sept. 1, 1983. On its way, the flight passed over the Soviet Kamchatka Peninsula, which was not a part of the flight plan. Soviet fighters launched air-to-air missiles and shot down the passenger plane under orders from Soviet commanders. KAL-007 crashed into the Pacific Ocean, and the 269 souls on board were lost.[57] Among the dead was Larry McDonald, a US Congressman from Georgia.[58]
