The Godfather was a blockbuster, breaking many box office records to become the highest grossing film of 1972. It earned $81.5 million in theatrical rentals in the USA & Canada during its initial release,[133] increasing its earnings to $85.7 million through a reissue in 1973,[134] and including a limited re-release in 1997 it ultimately earned an equivalent exhibition gross of $135 million.[130] It displaced Gone with the Wind to claim the record as the top rentals earner, a position it would retain until the release of Jaws in 1975.[131][135] News articles at the time proclaimed it was the first film to gross $100 million in North America,[131] but such accounts are erroneous since this record in fact belongs to The Sound of Music, released in 1965.[136] The film repeated its native success overseas, earning in total an unprecedented $142 million in worldwide theatrical rentals, to become the highest net earner.[137] Profits were so high for The Godfather that earnings for Gulf & Western Industries, Inc., which owned Paramount, jumped from 77 cents per share to $3.30 a share for the year, according to a Los Angeles Times article, dated December 13, 1972.[131] To date, it has grossed between $245 million and $286 million in worldwide box office receipts,[138] and adjusted for ticket price inflation in North America, ranks among the top 25 highest-grossing films.[139]
