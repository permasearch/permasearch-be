She was the only member to stay after Haley kicked Jason out and became Peyton's label's only artist. After being freaked out by Victoria she came back with the realization that music is about talking to people not money which wins Peyton over. She then overcame her demons when she played at TRIC in front of Jason and a whole crowd. She was approached by Peyton's former boss but tricked him into launching her under Peyton's label. After returning from tour she admits to Peyton that she is unable to write anything for the label. Haley begins to help her write again and she starts dating Chase. In season seven, she hardballs Miranda Stone by threatening to not record if Red Bedroom Records is shut down. Miranda relents and agrees to work with Haley and Mia to keep the label going. She broke up with Chase via a text message because she was never there. However, in the season seven finale she asked him if they could date again via a text message. An answer was not given. She is heartbroken when she finds out about Chase and Alex and soon becomes jealous of her and eventually a rivalry starts between them. To take her mind off things, she heads to Portland as part of a Life Unexpected crossover, with Haley to sing at a festival.
