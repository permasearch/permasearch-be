Peter Bramley discovered in the 1990s that a single phytoene desaturase gene (bacterial CrtI) can be used to produce lycopene from phytoene in GM tomato, rather than having to introduce multiple carotene desaturases that are normally used by higher plants.[15] Lycopene is then cyclized to beta-carotene by the endogenous cyclase in Golden Rice.[16]
