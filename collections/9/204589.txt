The Cougars made the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time in 1929 with Carson Cooper leading the team in scoring.[12][15] The Cougars were outscored 7â€“2 in the two-game series with the Toronto Maple Leafs.[16] In 1930, the Cougars were renamed the Falcons, but their woes continued, as they usually finished near the bottom of the standings, even though they made the playoffs again in 1932.[17][18][19][20]
