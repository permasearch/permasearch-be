On June 7, 2014, Machado was running to third base on a ground ball when he was tagged by Oakland Athletics third baseman Josh Donaldson. This incident led to a bench clearing brawl. On June 8, 2014, Machado struck Athletics catcher Derek Norris with his bat during the follow-through of his swing. Norris was taken out of the game as a result. In the 8th inning, Machado threw his bat in the direction of third base in response to two consecutive inside pitches thrown by Oakland reliever Fernando Abad. The umpires determined that the bat was meant for Abad, and both Abad and Machado were ejected from the game. The next day, Machado issued a formal apology to his teammates and the Oakland players, specifically Derek Norris.[26] On June 10, Machado was fined and suspended five games for his actions.[27] After losing an appeal, Machado began serving his suspension on June 30.[28]
