Belarus has not expressed a desire to join NATO but has participated in the Individual Partnership Program since 1997,[142] and Belarus provides refueling and airspace support for the ISAF mission in Afghanistan.[143] Belarus first began to cooperate with NATO upon signing documents to participate in their Partnership for Peace Program in 1995.[144] However, Belarus cannot join NATO because it is a member of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation. Tensions between NATO and Belarus peaked after the March 2006 presidential election in Belarus.[145]
