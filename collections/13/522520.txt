The film opened to mostly positive reviews. It was panned by Andrew Sarris in The New York Observer, David Denby in New York magazine, Stanley Kauffmann in The New Republic and Georgia Brown in The Village Voice.[11] Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader called the film "soulless".[39] The Washington Post reviewed the film twice; Hal Hinson's review on the day of the film's release was negative, describing it as "nearly all chases and dull exposition". Although he praised Ford and Connery, he felt the film's exploration of Indiana's character took away his mystery and that Spielberg should not have tried to mature his storytelling.[40] Two days later, Desson Thomson published a positive review praising the film's adventure and action, as well as the fatherâ€“son relationship's thematic depth.[41] Joseph McBride of Variety observed the "Cartoonlike Nazi villains of Raiders have been replaced by more genuinely frightening Nazis led by Julian Glover and Michael Byrne," and found the moment where Indiana meets Hitler "chilling".[42] In his biography of Spielberg, McBride added the film was less "racist" than its predecessors.[7]
