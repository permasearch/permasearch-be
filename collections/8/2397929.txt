Sing Something Simple was a half-hour radio programme, which featured Cliff Adams and The Cliff Adams Singers, with Jack Emblow on accordion. The programme ran for 42 years from 1959 until 2001, initially on the Light Programme and later on BBC Radio 2, and earning itself the title of the longest-running continuous music programme in the world.[1]
