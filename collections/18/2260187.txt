In 1996, a new generation model was introduced with 2.5-liter turbodiesel engines developing 103 hp (77 kW). Other engine options include two sixteen-valve fuel injected gasoline engines and a naturally aspirated diesel.[24] The previous 2.6-liter unit was replaced with a new, considerably more powerful 2.4-liter engine with 145 hp (108 kW).[24] The car participated in the Dakar Rally in 2005. Production ended in 2006. These were only built in Laem Chabang, Thailand, and were also exported to Japan between 1997 and 1999. In late 2001 the third generation pickup underwent a facelift with new headlights and other changes.
