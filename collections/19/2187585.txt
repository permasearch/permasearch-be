The Flyers' record when "God Bless America" is played or sung in person stood at a remarkable 100 wins, 29 losses, and five ties as of April 20, 2016.[8] Smith and her song remain a special part of Flyers' history. In 1987, the team erected a statue of Smith outside their arena at the time, the Spectrum, in her memory. The Flyers still show a video of her singing "God Bless America" in lieu of "The Star Spangled Banner" for good luck before important games.[citation needed] The video of her performance is now accompanied by Lauren Hart, daughter of the late Hockey Hall of Fame broadcaster, Gene Hart, longtime voice of the Flyers, and anthem singer for the Flyers. Before games whenever "God Bless America" is performed, Lou Nolan, the public address announcer for the Flyers at Wells Fargo Center would say: "Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we ask that you please rise and remove your hats and salute to our flags and welcome the number-one ranked anthemist in the NHL, Lauren Hart, as she sings (if the visiting team is from Canada, "O Canada" (or Canadian national anthem) followed by) "God Bless America", accompanied by the great Kate Smith."[9]
