According to the World Health Organisation, fewer than 20% of males are circumcised in New Zealand.[3] In New Zealand routine circumcision for which there is no medical indication is uncommon and no longer publicly funded within the public hospital system.[49] In a study of men born in 1972â€“1973 in Dunedin, 40.2% were circumcised.[50] In a study of men born in 1977 in Christchurch, 26.1% were circumcised.[51] A 1991 survey conducted in Waikato found that 7% of male infants were circumcised.[52] Circumcision for cultural reasons is routine in Pacific Island countries.[49]
