The object of the game is for a player to move all seven of his or her pieces along the course (two proposed versions of which are shown at right) and off the board before his or her opponent.[21] On all surviving gameboards, the two sides of the board are always identical with each other, indicating that the two sides of the board belong to each player.[13] When a piece is on one of the player's own squares, it is safe from capture,[17] but, when it is on one of the eight squares in the middle of the board, the opponent's pieces may capture it by landing on the same space, sending the piece back off the board so that it must restart the course from the beginning.[17] This means there are six "safe" squares and eight "combat" squares.[17] There can never be more than one piece on a single square at any given time,[22] so having too many pieces on the board at once can impede a player's mobility.[23]
