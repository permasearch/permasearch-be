Many animal welfare groups, campaigners and activists believe that fox hunting is unfair and cruel to animals.[109] They argue that the chase itself causes fear and distress and that the fox is not always killed instantly as is claimed. Animal rights campaigners also object to fox hunting, on the grounds that animals should enjoy some basic rights (such as the right to freedom from exploitation and the right to life).[110][111]
