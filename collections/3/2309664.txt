Polyadenylate polymerases are not as ancient. They have separately evolved in both bacteria and eukaryotes from CCA-adding enzyme, which is the enzyme that completes the 3' ends of tRNAs. Its catalytic domain is homologous to that of other polymerases.[73] It is presumed that the horizontal transfer of bacterial CCA-adding enzyme to eukaryotes allowed the archaeal-like CCA-adding enzyme to switch function to a poly(A) polymerase.[76] Some lineages, like archaea and cyanobacteria, never evolved a polyadenylate polymerase.[87]
