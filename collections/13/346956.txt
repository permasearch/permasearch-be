The main hardware platform for iOS is the ARM architecture. iOS releases before iOS 7 can only be run on iOS devices with 32-bit ARM processors (ARMv6 and ARMv7-A architectures). In 2013, iOS 7 was released with full 64-bit support (which includes native 64-bit kernel, libraries, drivers as well as all built-in applications),[115] after Apple announced that they were switching to 64-bit ARMv8-A processors with the introduction of the Apple A7 chip.[116] 64-bit support was also enforced for all apps in the App Store; All new apps submitted to the App Store with a deadline of February 2015, and all app updates submitted to the App Store with a deadline of June 1, 2015.[117] iOS 11 drops support for all iOS devices with 32-bit ARM processors as well as 32-bit applications,[118][119] making iOS 64-bit only.[120]
