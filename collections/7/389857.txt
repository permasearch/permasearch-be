The three lower divisions of the SPFL—the Championship, Scottish League One (formerly the Second Division) and Scottish League Two (formerly the Third Division)—continue with the promotion/relegation playoff system their predecessor leagues used in the SFL era. In the Championship/League One and League One/League Two, while the champions are automatically promoted and the bottom team relegated, there are playoffs of the second-bottom teams against the second, third and fourth placed teams from the league below. Home and away ties decide semi-finals and a final, and the overall winner plays in the higher league the following season, with the loser in the lower league.
