North Carolina briefly suspended giving driver's licenses to DACA grantees while awaiting the state attorney generalâ€™s opinion. The attorney general decided that even without formal immigration status, DACA grantees were to be granted legal presence. Subsequently the state once again continued to give driver's licenses and allowed DACA grantees to become legal members of North Carolina.[101]
