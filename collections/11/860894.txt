In the Boca Raton News (The News) of March 19, 1992, an article based on the film was published under the title "Molly Ringwald learns real world in TV movie", written by Stacy Jenel Smith. In the article, Ringwald spoke about meeting the real Alison Gertz. The article noted that Ringwald had little idea of just how intense the emotional experience would become when she agreed to play Gertz. From her first phone conversation with her real-life counterpart to her final scene in the telefilm, the then 24-year-old actress found herself facing stresses she'd never faced before. She stated in an afternoon interview "I spent a weekend with Ali two weeks before we started the movie. Did I feel nervous? Yes. Guilty? Oh, sure. I remember having dinner with Carol and Jerry - Ali's mother and father. They sat there looking at her and looking at me and we're close to the same age and I'm healthy... I guess it was hard for everyone. Meeting her sort of made me panic like: "How am I going to get that voice right?" Then I realized - I'm not an impersonator. I didn't want to try to imitate Ali. And I think it's stronger because I didn't. This person I play, she could be any girl. She is a very, very strong personality. Maybe when you start facing your own mortality, you just don't have the time to B.S. people, or to be diplomatic even. Ali says whatever is on her mind. She'll just tell you what she thinks. I'm not used to that in people." During filming of the movie - particularly after days of hospital sequences, it was revealed that Ringwald was very fragile emotionally. She stated "You could look at me the wrong way and I'd burst into tears." Finally, the article noted that Ringwald found that the experience of making the film led her to a new understanding of "how people react and deal with you when you have AIDS."[3]
