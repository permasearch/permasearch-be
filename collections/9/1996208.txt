A biofilm may also be considered a hydrogel, which is a complex polymer containing many times its dry weight in water. Biofilms are not just bacterial slime layers but biological systems; the bacteria organize themselves into a coordinated functional community. Biofilms can attach to a surface such as a tooth, rock, or surface which may include a single species or of a diverse group of microorganisms. The biofilm bacteria are able to share nutrients and are sheltered from harmful factors in the environment, such as desiccation, antibiotics, and a host body's immune system. A biofilm usually begins to form when a free-swimming bacterium attaches to a surface.[12][pageÂ needed]
