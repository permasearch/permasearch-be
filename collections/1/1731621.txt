Jamie is a former firearms officer with Dorset Police and now runs his own security firm. Using knowledge acquired in the industry, he managed to stay well hidden on his time on the run, mostly by hitching lifts to travel long-distance and going off-grid. However, the hunters got an idea of his whereabouts when they tracked down a delivery driver who gave him a lift from Ramsbottom to Dorset, where he lives. But worried about his wife Lesley, who was due to give birth during his time on the run, he met up with her secretly. However, the hunters intercepted their meeting and Jamie was caught in Badbury Rings, Dorset.
