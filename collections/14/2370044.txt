Terminal 9 opened in 1959 and was used by United Airlines[16] and Delta Air Lines.[24] Delta moved to Terminal 2 when they acquired Northeast Airlines.[92] Braniff International moved from Terminal 2 to Terminal 9 in 1973, and operated in Terminal 9 until its bankruptcy in 1982.[93] United used Terminal 9 from its opening in 1959 until it vacated the terminal in 1991 and became a tenant at British Airways' Terminal 7. Terminal 9 then became the home of American Airlines' domestic operations and American Eagle flights for the remainder of its life. The terminals were demolished in the early-to-mid-2000s and replaced with a new Terminal 8.[81]
