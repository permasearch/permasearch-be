One week later, Chelsea again triumphed in a London derby, defeating Tottenham 4–0 home. First, Samuel Eto'o capitalised on a mistake from Jan Vertonghen before Younès Kaboul fouled the Cameroonian and was subsequently sent off, conceding a penalty that Eden Hazard converted. Spurs played the last 30 minutes with ten men, and in the last five minutes, Demba Ba scored twice to triple his goal tally for the season. The win moved Chelsea seven points ahead of second place with the other teams behind having played fewer games.[58]
