By the late 18th century Father Christmas had become a stock character in the Christmas folk plays later known as mummers plays. During the following century they became probably the most widespread of all calendar customs.[32] Hundreds of villages had their own mummers who performed traditional plays around the neighbourhood, especially at the big houses.[33] Father Christmas appears as a character in plays of the Southern England type,[34][35] featuring in 46 of the surviving 18th and 19th century texts.[36] His ritual opening speech is characterised by variants of a couplet closely reminiscent of John Taylor's "But welcome or not welcome, I am come..." from 1652.
