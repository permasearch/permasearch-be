One attack against SHA-1 was Marc Stevens[45] with an estimated cost of $2.77M to break a single hash value by renting CPU power from cloud servers.[46] Stevens developed this attack in a project called HashClash,[47] implementing a differential path attack. On 8 November 2010, he claimed he had a fully working near-collision attack against full SHA-1 working with an estimated complexity equivalent to 257.5 SHA-1 compressions. He estimated this attack could be extended to a full collision with a complexity around 261.
