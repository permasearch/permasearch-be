In the 2006 film, Poseidon, the ship is not a cruise ship, but a British ocean liner registered in Southampton, which is sailing from an unnamed port in the United Kingdom (presumably London as one of the characters mentions it briefly) to New York City. While the first film used Queen Mary as a stand-in for Poseidon, the ship in the 2006 film has an original exterior design not based on any real-life vessel, although the interior was inspired by the modern ocean liner RMS Queen Mary 2. This Poseidon is also struck by a huge rogue wave just after midnight on New Year's Eve and capsizes, but unlike the original the cause of the wave is never explained.
