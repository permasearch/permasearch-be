The insolvent is divested of all his estate: that is, all the property he owned at the date of sequestration and that he may acquire during the sequestrationâ€”except such property as the insolvent is entitled to retain as a separate estate. "Property" in this context is defined to include "movable or immovable property wherever situate in South Africa."[24] It includes a right of action, unless the action is one that the insolvent is permitted to institute. It also includes property that is, or the proceeds of property that are, in the hands of a sheriff under a writ of attachment. The insolvent's property includes contingent interests in property, other than the contingent interests of a fideicommissary heir or legatee.
