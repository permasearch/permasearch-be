A high commissioner from one Commonwealth realm to another carries a simple and often informal letter of introduction from one head of government (prime minister) to that of another, host country, while ambassadors carry formal letters of credence from their head of state addressed to the host country's head of state. The difference in accreditation is also reflected in the formal titles of envoys to Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth states: e.g., British high commissioners to the Commonwealth countries are formally titled "The High Commissioner for Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom", whereas British ambassadors to non-Commonwealth countries are known as "Her Britannic Majesty's Ambassador".
