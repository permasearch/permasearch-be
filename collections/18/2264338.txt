The event was hosted by Eva Longoria — who had 13 outfit changes, one of which was shaped like a huge Spanish ham — she introduced the crowd to a gang of hunks, pretending they were family. The actress joked, "I recently did some research into my ancestry and it turns out I'm 70 percent Spanish! I tracked down some of my relatives in Madrid (and) I promised that I'd bring them out on stage. A big welcome to the Longorias!".
