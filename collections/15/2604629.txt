Dr. Flor’s formula accounts for the information deficit especially, among the Third World countries, where information utilization is constrained by factors such as “low literacy, limited media access and availability, low computer literacy, low levels of education and unsound communication policy. The framework that Dr. Flor presented is best described as “the communication revolution contributes to the quantity of information generated thus, information explosion happens”. Since the relationship of the two phenomena is reciprocal, “the quantity of information, the quality of information and the information overload determine the information wastage in an information society”. The outcome of this wastage ratio provides support for the initiation of communication policies to ensure full utilization of information in varied fields.
