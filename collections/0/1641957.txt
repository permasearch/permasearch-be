The interior of the F-Pace features several existing Jaguar design cues, including the rotary gear selector which rises when the car is started. The central console, when equipped with the upgraded InControl Touch Pro system, features a 10.2 inch (26.5Â cm) touch screen allowing access to in-car entertainment, satellite navigation and various vehicular settings, such as the G-Meter and engine/gear shift/steering/suspension parameters. Navigation can also be shown full-screen, in 3D on an additional 12.3-inch HD virtual instrument cluster. The F-Pace features smartphone connectivity with Wifi Hotspot and some models allow the owner to control the vehicle remotely, pre-heating the interior or unlocking the car using a smartphone application.[1] The F-Pace is also the first vehicle in Jaguar's range to feature the Activity Key, a waterproof wrist band that unlocks the F-Pace allowing the main keys to be left inside, thus preventing possible water damage.[1]
