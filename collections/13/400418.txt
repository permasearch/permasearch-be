Since 2008, O2 is partnered with Live Nation and the Academy Music Group, allowing O2 to rename the music venues.[47] The partnership allows O2 to offer customers priority access to all events at O2 Academy venues as well as Live Nation promoted events across the United Kingdom. The partnership was renewed in 2017 for a further ten years.[48]
