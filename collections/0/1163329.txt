The LPI Hybrid came equipped with the 1.6-liter Gamma engine, a 15 kilowatts (20 hp) electric motor, and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The LPI Hybrid delivered 41.9 miles per US gallon (5.61 L/100 km; 50.3 mpg‑imp). Compared to the conventional 1.6-liter model, and considering South Korean gasoline prices, the LPI Hybrid can travel 39 kilometres (24 mi) for the price of one liter of gasoline, while the conventional model would be able to travel only 15 kilometres (9.3 mi).[14] The engine emitted 99 g/km of CO2, which allows the car to qualify as a Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (SULEV).[14] The LPI Hybrid produced 90 percent fewer emissions than an equivalent standard gasoline powered model, and LPG is a low carbon emitting hydrocarbon fuel that burns more cleanly than either gasoline or diesel, and also is free of the particulates associated with diesel.[16] The LPI Hybrid shares its powertrain with the Kia Forte LPI Hybrid.[17]
