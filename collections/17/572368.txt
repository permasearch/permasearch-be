Season 7 was the seventh and final season of Medium. CBS renewed the show in May 2010, but they put the show in the 8:00pm Friday Night slot replacing Ghost Whisperer. The ratings began to fall so by mid-autumn, CBS had cut the episodes from a full 22 down to 13. Ariel goes off to Dartmouth College this season and we see little of her, but more of Bridgette and Marie. Bridgette has more bigger roles this season, as compared to the last six seasons. Allison and Joe's relationship begins to dwindle a bit this season as we learn the two aren't seeing eye to eye on everything from work to the girls, to waking up to a "different" Allison every day. In Season Four's Burn Baby Burn Parts 1 and 2, Allison tells Marjorie (Joe's mother) that she will be fine, but the little white lie proved not true. Marjorie passes away from a brain tumor/cancer in Blood on the Tracks and she warns Allison about the darkness ahead of them. Lee Scanlon deals with his deceased brother for a few episodes and admits to Allison that he has let the woman kill him a few seasons back. Devalos decides to run for the Mayor and Allison and Joe both plan to enroll in school which has caused tension between them. Laura San Giacomo who played in the show Just Shoot Me guest stars as a neighbor in the episode The People in Your Neighborhood. Allison's half brother Michael comes back after a three-season hiatus, this time played by Patricia's real life brother David Arquette.
