Even though the Spanish Jews engaged in many branches of human endeavor—agriculture, viticulture, industry, commerce, and the various handicrafts—it was the money business that procured to some of them their wealth and influence. Kings and prelates, noblemen and farmers, all needed money and could obtain it only from the Jews, to whom they paid from 20 to 25 per cent interest. This business, which, in a manner, the Jews were forced to pursue[citation needed] in order to pay the many taxes imposed upon them as well as to raise the compulsory loans demanded of them by the kings,[citation needed] led to their being employed in special positions, as "almonries", bailiffs, tax farmers (tax collectors).
