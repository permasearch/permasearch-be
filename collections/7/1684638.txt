The South African government has set a target of transferring 30% of productive farmland from whites to 'previously disadvantaged' blacks by 2014.[5] Land reform has been criticised both by farmers' groups and by landless workers, the latter alleging that the pace of change has not been fast enough, and the former alleging racist treatment and expressing concerns that a similar situation to Zimbabwe's land reform policy may develop,[6] a fear exacerbated by comments made by former deputy president Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka.[7][8] On 27 February 2018, the National Assembly voted to set in motion a process to amend the Constitution so as to allow for the expropriation of land from white farmers without compensation.[9]
