Advances in polynomial algebra were made by mathematicians during the Yuan era. The mathematician Zhu Shijie (1249â€“1314) solved simultaneous equations with up to four unknowns using a rectangular array of coefficients, equivalent to modern matrices.[137][138] Zhu used a method of elimination to reduce the simultaneous equations to a single equation with only one unknown.[139] His method is described in the Jade Mirror of the Four Unknowns, written in 1303. The opening pages contain a diagram of Pascal's triangle. The summation of a finite arithmetic series is also covered in the book.[140]
