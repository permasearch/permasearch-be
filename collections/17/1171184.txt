Solidus Snake (ソリダス・スネーク, Soridasu Sunēku), also known as George Sears (ジョージ・シアーズ),[113] is the third clone of Big Boss. The character's existence was first alluded as the President of the United States during the original Metal Gear Solid. He makes his official first appearance as the main antagonist in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, where his full codename and public identity are established. His design was based on Yoji Shinkawa's thoughts regarding how Solid Snake would look when older.[89] During the events of Sons of Liberty, Solidus leads a terrorist takeover of the Big Shell (with Olga Gurlukovich and Revolver Ocelot) while posing as his brother Solid Snake.[114][115] For combat, Solidus wears a powered suit.[92] After the Patriots removed his President status, Solidus turned against the organization and wished to form his own nation to leave his impact on the world.[116] Revealed as Raiden's adoptive father,[85] Solidus tries to kill Raiden to use his foster son's nanomachines to lead him to the Patriots.[117] However, Raiden defeats Solidus in their duel atop Federal Hall National Memorial, slicing into the spine of Solidus's powered exoskeleton with a high frequency blade. In Metal Gear Solid 4, Solidus's body is used when Liquid Ocelot hacks into the Patriots' AI.[118]
