The track has received polarized reviews. A main point critics attributed to the song was its ability to be kid-friendly, yet appeal to all music listeners, with Gerrick Kennedy of The Los Angeles Times calling the song radio, club, and recess-friendly,[11] and Daniela Capistrano of MTV News calling it a "kid-friendly club banger".[12] Kennedy commented, "don't let her age fool you; the song packs serious punch."[11] Capistrano said that the song's "crazy" beat works on the schoolyard and dancefloor.[6] Commenting that the song was age-appropriate, Gina Serpe of E! Online said, that accomplishment was commendable, stating, "it's got to be a bit of a battle finding material suitable for someone still in the single-digits."[5] Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly commended the song, complimenting the production value, stating the song was "Lil Mama meets Rihanna".[20] CBC said while the song may not be deep, it was the best to be expected from a "fourth grade fashionista", commenting the track was more "schoolyard friendly" than any music released by Miley Cyrus.[13] The Guardian described the track as "a pretty good R&B belter in the same vein as Rihanna, all heavily treated vocals and huge juddering beats".[14] BET Sound Off blog commented that Smith had more personality on the track than fellow artists three times her age.[17] Melinda Newman of HitFix complimented Smith's "competent" singing voice.[21]
