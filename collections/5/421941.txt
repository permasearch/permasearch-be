Passenger staterooms have largely deteriorated because they were framed in perishable softwoods such as pine, leaving a warren of hanging electrical wire, light fixtures and debris interspersed with more durable items like brass bed frames, light fixtures, and marble-topped washstands. Woodwork with attachments like doorknobs, drawer-pulls or push-plates survive in better condition because of the small electric charge emitted by metal which repels fish and other harmful organisms. On the whole hardwoods like teak and mahogany, the material for most stateroom furnishings, are more resistant to decay. Lavatories and bathrooms within the passenger quarters survive because they were framed in steel.
