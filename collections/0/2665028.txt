Instead of rejoicing in the discipline-less school, Bart feels guilty about causing Principal Skinner's dismissal. In an effort to get Principal Skinner his job back, Bart attempts to expose Ned's poor leadership to Superintendent Chalmers. Despite the state of chaos at the school, Superintendent Chalmers is not concerned and even admits that he never really cared for Skinner. However, upon hearing Ned utter a brief mention of God over the intercom, Superintendent Chalmers immediately fires Ned for reciting a school prayer. Principal Skinner is soon re-hired as principal. Bart and Principal Skinner share an amicable chat about their typically antagonistic relationship, then affectionately pat each other on the back. However, as they turn from each other, it is revealed Bart has taped a "Kick Me" sign on Principal Skinner's back, and Principal Skinner has taped a "Teach Me" sign on Bart. The two chuckle to themselves as they walk away.
