Some concerns exist about the impact of the international trade in mass-produced bumblebee colonies. Evidence from Japan[98] and South America[99] indicates  bumblebees can escape and naturalise in new environments, causing damage to native pollinators. Greater use of native pollinators, such as Bombus ignitus in China and Japan, has occurred as a result.[100] In addition, mounting evidence indicates mass-produced bumblebees may also carry diseases, harmful to wild bumblebees[101][102] and honeybees.[102]
