In Mexico, Merlot is cultivated primarily in the Valle de Guadalupe of Baja California, the country's main wine-producing area. Plantings have increased substantially since the 1980s, and cultivation has spread into the nearby areas of Ojos Negros and Santo Tom√°s.[9] The grape can also be found in the north eastern Mexican wine region of Coahuila, across the border from Texas.[1]
