Most users have a history of smoking regular cigarettes.[50] At least 52% of smokers or ex-smokers in one area have vaped.[32] Of smokers who have, one British study reported that less than 15% became everyday e-cigarette users.[7] Though e-cigarette use among those who have never smoked is very low, it continues to rise.[51] One United States survey of e-cigarette users conducted from 2011â€“2012 found that only 1% of respondents used liquid without nicotine.[52]
