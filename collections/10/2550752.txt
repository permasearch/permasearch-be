Big Chill is a Necrofriggian (necro- meaning death, and -frigid meaning very cold) from the planet Kylmyys (the Finnish word for coldness). Moth-like creatures who can fold their wings to resemble hooded figures, Necrofriggians can become intangible and freeze an opponent in various ways, one of which utilizes intangibility to freeze anything that they pass through.[note 1]
