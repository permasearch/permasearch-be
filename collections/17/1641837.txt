The lyrics reference the yellow idol in J. Milton Hayes' poem, The Green Eye of the Little Yellow God. Another line in the song is "There's UFO's over New York and I ain't too surprised". In the liner notes to his 1974 album Walls and Bridges he said, "On the 23rd August 1974 at 9 o'clock I saw a U.F.O. - J.L.". The line "Nobody told me there'd be days like these...strange days indeed...most peculiar, mama" is in contrast to the old adage "My mother told me there'd be days like this."
