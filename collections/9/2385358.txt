Eggman sneaks away from Tails and Amy with the last Emerald and arms the Eclipse Cannon. When he tries to fire it, the colony begins falling and a prerecorded message from Gerald broadcasts: he programmed the ARK to collide with Earth if the Emeralds were used, destroying it in revenge for the government condemning his research and killing his colleagues, including his granddaughter Maria. Everyone works together to access the cannon's core and neutralize the ARK using the Master Emerald.[28]
