The song is one of the musical themes or leitmotives used in the music written for film series. It is a variation on Frodo's theme, which is a hymn-like variation on the Shire theme, and features a snippet of the Fellowship theme as the bridge of the song. It was originally the main end-credits song, a direct continuation of the Breaking of the Fellowship piece, which features the Hymn variant as well.
