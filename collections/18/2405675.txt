The well-known cover of this song by the rock band Three Dog Night appeared in 1973 on the Billboard Hot 100, on the top 40 from the beginning of June through the end of August, reaching #3 in both the pop singles and adult contemporary categories,[1] #1 on the Cashbox Magazine charts,[2] and an isolated week at #1 on WLS.[3] Headed toward the Hot 100's summit in late July, had it not run out of steam, “Shambala” would have completed an uncommon distinction of a Hot 100 chart-topper for each of four consecutive years for the group.  The song, the first one that the group had specifically cut as a single, rather than an album cut,[4] later appeared on Cyan, Three Dog Night's ninth album, and subsequently on numerous anthologies and compilation albums.[1][5]
