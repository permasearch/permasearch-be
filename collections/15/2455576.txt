Torok became a member of Louisiana Hayride on KWKH-AM in Shreveport. In 1954, his song "My Arabian Baby" appeared as the B-side of Snow's hit "I Don't Hurt Anymore". He gained a No. 8 country hit with "Hootchy Kootchy Henry (From Hawaii)" and in 1956, after joining Decca Records in Nashville, he had top ten success on the UK Singles Chart with his and Gail's song, "When Mexico Gave Up The Rhumba" and "Red Light, Green Light".[1] This success led to a four-month tour of the United Kingdom in 1956, headlining in all the old famous vaudeville houses in England, Ireland and Scotland, including the London Palladium. His shows included English comedian Dickie Henderson and the "Goldfinger" singer, Shirley Bassey, and it marked the only time Mitchell has performed with a full pit orchestra with written arrangements on all the songs, led by Torok's own conductor, Maurice " Tex" Bromley, at the on-stage piano with him. In the next few years, Torok made further recordings for Mercury, and RCA. His last US chart entry was "Instant Love" for the Reprise record label in 1967.
