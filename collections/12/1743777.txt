The edits of editor 128.231.77.217 of 16 August 2011 are intended to impose a particular point of view that is not supported by the majority of authoritative sources that are cited on the page on this particular point. The physical content of that particular point of view is already stated in the lead of the article. There is a difference and distinction between the first law of thermodynamics and the principle of law of conservation of energy. The particular point of view of editor 128.231.77.217 tries to ignore or by-pass or erase that distinction; if the distinction did not matter then it would come into question whether there should be separate articles about the two subjects first law of thermodynamics and law of conservation of energy.
