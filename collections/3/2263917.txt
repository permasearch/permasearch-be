Some literature gives the word a full Greek etymology,[12][13] but it appears to be a composite of the Latin preposition pro ("for") and the Greek adjective βιωτικός (biōtikos), "fit for life, lively",[14] the latter deriving from the noun βίος (bios, "life").[15] The term contrasts etymologically with the term antibiotic.
