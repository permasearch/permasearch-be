The Portuguese were a seafaring part of the Iberian peninsula, and in the early fifteenth century, Portugal began its expansion from a small area of the peninsula, to seizing the Muslim fortress of Ceuta in North Africa. Its maritime exploration then proceeded down the coast of West Africa and across the Indian Ocean to the south Asian subcontinent as well as the Atlantic islands off the coast of Africa. They sought the sources of gold, ivory, and African slaves that were high value goods of the African trade. The Portuguese set up fortified trading "factories" (feitorias), whereby permanent, fairly small commercial settlements anchored trade in a region. The initial costs of setting up these commercial posts was borne by private investors, who in turn received hereditary titles and commercial advantages. From the Portuguese crown's point of view, its realm was expanded with relatively little cost to itself.[3] On the Atlantic islands of the Azores, Madeira, and Sāo Tomé, the Portuguese began plantation production of sugarcane using forced labor, a precedent for Brazil's sugar production in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.[4]
