In early 1943, British POWs arrive by train at a Japanese prison camp in Burma. The commandant, Colonel Saito, informs them that all prisoners, regardless of rank, are to work on the construction of a railway bridge over the River Kwai that will connect Bangkok and Rangoon. The senior British officer, Lieutenant Colonel Nicholson, informs Saito that the Geneva Conventions exempt officers from manual labour. He later informs his officers that he had no intention of attempting an escape and forbids them from doing so, not because it's supposedly impossible, as Saito claims, but because they had been ordered by headquarters to surrender and an escape attempt could be seen as a treasonous defiance of orders.
