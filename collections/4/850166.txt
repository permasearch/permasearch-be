The migrant workforce has historically played a vital role nationally and across local communities in recent times. Economic globalization has created more migrant workers than ever before. While developed countries have increased their demand for labour, especially unskilled labour, workers from developing countries are used. As a result, millions of workers and their families travel to other countries to find work. This influx of migrant workers contributes to growth of slums and urban poverty, according to Mike Davis.[47] Some of these workers, usually from rural areas, cannot afford housing in cities and thus live in slums.[48] Some of these unskilled workers living in slums suffer from unemployment and make a living in the informal sector.[49] According to International Labor Organization, as of 2013 there were approximately 175 million migrants around the world.[50]
