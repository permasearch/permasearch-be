The Ministry of Magic is in disbelief of Voldemort's return, despite evidence such as Voldemort's new video blog and his review of 17 Again, starring an idol of the show, Zac Efron. Meanwhile, Harry is consumed with stress over the situation and ostracizes his friends with his self-centered behaviour. Malfoy attempts to mock Harry, but is humiliated once again in front of the student body and vows revenge. Ginny attempts to clarify her relationship with Harry, but he explains (using the Spider-Man film trilogy as reference) that as long as Voldemort is at large, they cannot be together. As Ginny runs off in tears once more, a disguised Dumbledore summons Harry to his office to discuss Voldemort.
