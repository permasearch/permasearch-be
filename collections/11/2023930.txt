MIDI events can be sequenced with computer software, or in specialized hardware music workstations. Many digital audio workstations (DAWs) are specifically designed to work with MIDI as an integral component. MIDI piano rolls have been developed in many DAWs so that the recorded MIDI messages can be extensively modified.[29] These tools allow composers to audition and edit their work much more quickly and efficiently than did older solutions, such as multitrack recording.
