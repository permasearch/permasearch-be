Many saddle seat horses also wear certain devices to increase their action while in training. Use of these devices is controversial, though when used correctly, they are said to help develop necessary muscles and should not be used in a manner that causes the horse physical pain. Devices used include stretchies (elastic rubber tubing attached to the front legs by fleece-covered leather half-hobbles, used to provide resistance training), weighted rattles (large beads) or chains placed around the fetlock, and "shackles" or a "running-W", devices composed of pulleys and ropes that help increase the horses' range of motion. Depending on the breed, some devices may be used in the warm-up area but not the show ring, while other breeds ban them from the show grounds entirely.
