In 1998, Ferguson was named in a list of the biggest private financial donors to the Labour Party.[232] He is a self-described socialist.[233][234] In January 2011 Graham Stringer, a Labour MP in Manchester and Manchester United supporter, called for Ferguson to be made a life peer. If this happened, it would make Ferguson the first current or former footballer or football manager to sit in the House of Lords.[235] Stringer and fellow Manchester Labour MP Paul Goggins repeated this call after Ferguson announced his retirement in May 2013.[236]
