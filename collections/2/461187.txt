On 3 February 2012, Coronation Street confirmed Frank would be killed-off as part of a whodunit storyline.[26] The news came shortly after the episode showing Frank being found not guilty of raping Carla was broadcast.[26] A writer for the official Coronation Street website said "Now events will take an even more dramatic turn as tensions rise and vengeance will be on the minds of several characters, climaxing in Frank's death! And with so many residents having a motive for killing the twisted factory boss â€“ the list of suspects reads like a 'Who's Who' of Weatherfield."[26] Over the following weeks, Frank manages to alienate himself as he tries to get revenge on Carla for dragging him through court.[26] Lancel said Frank's true colours would be exposed and he does not think his life is in danger for a moment.[26] His body would be found in the factory, following "days of arguments and confrontations with associates, lovers and enemies alike."[26] A reporter for the Metro later announced that five regular characters would become suspects during the investigation into Frank's murder.[27] Frank would be found dead on the floor of the Underworld factory by Sally Webster.[27] The Metro reporter said Sally comes under suspicion when she is found standing over Frank's body with bloodied hands.[27] Carla, Peter and Michelle are questioned by the police, while Sally's ex-husband, Kevin, will also fall under suspicion.[27] Lancel praised his character's final storyline, calling it "classic Corrie".[28] It was later revealed that Frank's mother, Anne, was the killer during a showdown between her, Carla, Sally and Kevin.
