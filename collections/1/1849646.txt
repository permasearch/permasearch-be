The College endured financial difficulties from 1952 to 1960. In the summer of 1960, a 37-year-old priest from Sevilla Bohol, Rev. Fr. Constancio P. Mesiona, arrived to take over the new directorship of the College. Rev. Fr. Mesiona graduated Magna Cum Laude for his Seminary course and for his master's at the San Jose Seminary, Manila. He earned his Doctor of Canon Law (J.C.D.) at the Universidad Pontifica de Comillas in Santander, Spain.
