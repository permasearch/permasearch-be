On August 31, 2006, ABC Family introduced a new slogan and imaging campaign, "A New Kind of Family". The rebranding coincided with a new original programming strategy, which targeted the teen and young adult demographics.[36] Following the rebranding, ABC Family began to premiere more original teen dramas, along with series incorporating more diverse portrayals of family life.[36][37] In addition, ABC Family discontinued Jetix, an action-oriented morning children's block that debuted on the network in 2002, relegating the block exclusive to sister channel Toon Disney.[38]
