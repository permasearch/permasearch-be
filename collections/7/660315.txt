On 8 August 1942, Mahatma Gandhi issued the Quit India speech at Gowalia Tank in Mumbai, demanding that the British leave India. Shastri, who had just then come out after a year in prison, travelled to Allahabad. For a week, he sent instructions to the independence activists from Jawaharlal Nehru's home, Anand Bhavan. A few days later, he was arrested and imprisoned until 1946.[14] Shastri spent almost nine years in jail in total.[15] During his stay in prison, he spent time reading books and became familiar with the works of western philosophers, revolutionaries and social reformers.
