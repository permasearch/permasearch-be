On December 7, 1941, Miller, a crewman aboard West Virginia, awoke at 06:00. After serving breakfast mess, he was collecting laundry when at 07:57 Lieutenant Commander Shigeharu Murata from the Japanese aircraft carrierÂ Akagi[6] launched the first of nine torpedoes that would hit West Virginia. When the "Battle Stations" alarm went off, Miller headed for his battle station, an anti-aircraft battery magazine amidship, only to discover that a torpedo had destroyed it.
