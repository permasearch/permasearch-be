Between 1980 and 2013, there have been 8 Government shutdowns in the United States.[9] Most of these shutdowns revolved around budget issues including fights over the debt ceiling and led to the furlough of certain 'non-essential' personnel. The majority of these fights lasted 1â€“2 days with a few exceptions lasting more than a week.
