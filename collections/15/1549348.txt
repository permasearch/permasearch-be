When nightfall came, Stanton marked the landing zone with infrared glow sticks. Reese had readied his gun to shoot her in the back, but lowered it at the last moment, only for Stanton to turn and shoot him. She apologized, saying she had orders from Snow, and was told Reese had ties to terrorists. Reese laughed, telling her he had the same orders and that they were being set up, with the beacon actually signaling for a shelling, not extraction. Reese then made his escape, leaving Stanton standing in shock. Overhead, a drone observed as an incoming cruise missile targeted the beacons. The wounded Reese managed to escape the blast radius, and turned back to see the explosion apparently killing his partner.
