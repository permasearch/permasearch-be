After searching for the nearest area closest to the "center of the world", Homunculus, now sullen and driven by pride and greed, gathered the people living there and founded Amestris under the title of "The Eastern Sage" and taught alchemy to its people for the sake of his master plan: engineering every war in the country's history to bring it into the form of a perfect circle with sites of bloody carnage at all the cardinal points—the necessary configuration for the transmutation of another Philosopher's Stone and repeat his actions in Cselkcess on a higher scale to open the Gate and become a "perfect being" with absolute freedom. Father then attempted to purge out his cardinal sins, thinking that removing his basic emotions would make him perfectly good, and thus superior to humans and close with God. In order to satisfy his desire to have a family like that of humans, Father incarnates these very same emotions into homunculi. Father then uses his homunculi to gather "sacrifices", alchemists of notable skill who attempted human transmutation and survived and gained knowledge of the "Truth"; these 'sacrifices'' are necessary for Father's plan to work.[ch. 100] As an additional precaution against alchemists, Father stationed himself underground above the tectonic plates so that he can negate any form of alchemy that derives its power from tectonic energy.[ch. 54] Having left the eyes of the Amestrian public, he keeps in touch with the country's highest ranking human officials in order to keep the country's growth under his absolute authority and control.
