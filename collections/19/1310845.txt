Saint Paul has a variation of the strong mayor-council form of government.[104] The mayor is the chief executive and chief administrative officer for the city and the seven-member city council is the legislative body.[105][106] The mayor is elected by the entire city, while members of the city council are elected from seven different geographic wards of approximately equal population.[107][108] Both the mayor and council members serve four-year terms.[109] The current mayor is Melvin Carter (DFL). Carter is Saint Paul's first African-American mayor. Aside from Norm Coleman, who became a Republican during his second term, Saint Paul has not elected a Republican mayor since 1952.[110]
