Toyota is the world's market leader in sales of hybrid electric vehicles, one of the largest companies to encourage the mass-market adoption of hybrid vehicles across the globe, and the first to commercially mass-produce and sell such vehicles, with the introduction of the Toyota Prius in 1997.[96][97] The company eventually began providing this option on its main passenger cars such as Camry and later with the Lexus divisions, producing some hybrid luxury vehicles. It labeled such technology in Toyota cars as "Hybrid Synergy Drive" and in Lexus versions as "Lexus Hybrid Drive". Cumulative global sales of Toyota and Lexus hybrid passenger car models passed the 10 million milestone in January 2017.[11] Its Prius family is the world's top-selling hybrid nameplate with more than 6 million units sold worldwide as of January 2017[update].[11]
