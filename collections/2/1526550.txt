In November 2012, Séléka, a coalition of rebel groups, took over towns in the northern and central regions of the country. These groups eventually reached a peace deal with the Bozizé's government in January 2013 involving a power sharing government[7] but this deal broke down and the rebels seized the capital in March 2013 and Bozizé fled the country.[35][36]
