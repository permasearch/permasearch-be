History Nate is the son of Olivia Barber Winters and her first husband, the late Nathan Hastings, Sr. He was delivered early due to his mother's ovarian cancer scare. Later, when Olivia found out about her husband's affair with Keesha Monroe, a woman with AIDS, Nathan kidnapped Nate and disappeared. After several weeks on the run, Nathan decided to return Nate to Olivia. When Nate wandered away from his father on a crowded street, Nathan rushed to find his son and was fatally struck by a car.
