In the meantime, the Cali Cartel forms an alliance with the right-wing CastaÃ±o brothers, Don Berna and Judy Moncada, whose husband Kiko was murdered by Escobar in Season 1. Judy vows revenge against Escobar after he kills her brother Jaime. In a meeting with the Cali Cartel leaders, Judy reluctantly gives the location of Escobar's drug labs to the Search Bloc, resulting in the arrest of multiple cartel members. Enraged, Escobar ambushes a convoy, killing nearly all police officers therein. Among the dead was Colonel Horacio Carillo, who had killed Gustavo and wanted to kill Escobar for years.
