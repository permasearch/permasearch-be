On January 7, Nick Saban officially accepted the head coaching position with the Crimson Tide. In his first season at Alabama, the team experienced many highs-and-lows, but the team finished with a winning record after a victory in the Independence Bowl. In the 2008 season, Saban led the Crimson Tide to their first undefeated regular season since the 1994 season, but the Tide then proceeded to lose their final two games in the SEC Championship Game and Sugar Bowl. In 2009, Saban led Alabama to a perfect 14–0 record and to their first BCS National Championship, and their first overall national championship since the 1992 season. After a relatively disappointing 10–3 2010 season, Saban then led the Crimson Tide to back-to-back BCS National Championships in both the 2011 and 2012 seasons.[1] The 2013 team won the first 11 games of the season, but failed to capture a third consecutive national championship for Alabama, losing the last two games. Saban's 2014 team won the SEC West division and SEC championship and lost to the Ohio State Buckeyes in the inaugural College Football Playoff's semi-final round at the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans to finish 12-2. Saban won his 4th championship at Alabama in 2015 and his 5th at the new Mercedes-Benz Stadium in 2018.
