Although there are several lysine and arginine residues in the serum albumin structure, very few of them can take part in the glycation reaction.[12][20] It is not clear exactly why only these residues are glycated in serum albumin, but it is suggested that non-covalent binding of glucose to serum albumin prior to the covalent bond formation might be the reason.[21]
