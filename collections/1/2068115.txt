In June and July, Bocelli gave two open-air concerts at historic sites, the first at Masada, in Israel,[129] with all proceeds dedicated to support the residents of the Israeli regions of Galilee and Negev,[130] and the second at Syracuse's ancient Greek theatre, in Sicily,[131] with all proceeds donated to the Fiamme di SolidarietÃ  (Flames of Solidarity) organization, to raise awareness of issues concerning the poorest and most marginalized in Italy.[132]
