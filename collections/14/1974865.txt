Captain Nicole Galassini (portrayed by Kellie Martin) is an Army intelligence officer with the 32nd Airborne Division. She was assigned to COL Frank Sherwood's brigade as an intelligence analyst for the Africa mission and rescued 2LT Trevor LeBlanc's platoon from a potentially catastrophic hostage situation through negotiation. When the convoy was returning to base, her Humvee was ambushed and she was injured by a stray bullet. She was awarded the Bronze Star (with a "V" device) for her bravery.
