Attentional blink (AB) is a phenomenon that reflects the temporal costs in allocating selective attention.  The AB is typically measured by using rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) tasks, where participants often fail to detect a second salient target occurring in succession if it is presented between 180-450 ms after the first one. Also, the AB has been observed using two backward-masked targets[1] and auditory stimuli.[2][3] The term attentional blink was first used in 1992,[4] although the phenomenon was probably known before.[5][6]
