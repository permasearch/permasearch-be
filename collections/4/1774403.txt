Polish Ministry of Education established by King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski in 1773 was the first ministry of education in the world,[2][3] and the traditions continue. The international PISA 2012 praised the progresses made by Polish education in Mathematics, Science and Literacy; the number of top-performers having increased since 2003 while the number of low-performers decreased again.[4] In 2014, the Pearson/Economist Intelligence Unit rated Polish education as 5th best in Europe and 10th best in the world.[5]
