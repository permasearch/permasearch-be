For the remake, the gameplay was adjusted to resemble its sequel, along with adjusting it to a 16:9 screen ratio from the original 4:3, and interface adjustments for ease of play. The character artwork was redone by Soejima. The voice work was remastered instead of being rerecorded as some of the characters' voice actors had retired.[25] In addition to these changes, a new story quest set in Karukozaka High School, the setting for Shin Megami Tensei If..., was added.[26] The storyline for the new quest was written by Kazuyuki Yamai.[8] The remake was announced for a western release in May 2011. Until this point, Innocent Sin was the only Persona game not to be released overseas.[27] For its European release, the game was published by Ghostlight.[1] The western release did suffer a few content cuts: namely, the ability to create custom quests in the Climax Theater and additional DLC episodes for the Climax Theater that included several former Persona and Shin Megami Tensei settings. They were removed due to what were described as "a number of challengesâ€”technical and otherwise".[28]
