UEFI systems can access GPT disks and boot directly from them, which allows Linux to use UEFI boot methods. Booting Linux from GPT disks on UEFI systems involves creation of an EFI system partition (ESP), which contains UEFI applications such as bootloaders, operating system kernels, and utility software.[32][33][34] Such a setup is usually referred to as UEFI-GPT, while ESP is recommended to be at least 512Â MiB in size and formatted with a FAT32 filesystem for maximum compatibility.[29][31][35]
