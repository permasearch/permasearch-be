A spider angioma (also known as a nevus araneus, spider nevus, vascular spider, and spider telangiectasia[1]) is a type of telangiectasis[2] (swollen blood vessels) found slightly beneath the skin surface, often containing a central red spot and reddish extensions which radiate outwards like a spider's web. They are common and may be benign, presenting in around 10â€“15% of healthy adults and young children.[3] However, having more than three spider angiomas is likely to be abnormal and may be a sign of liver disease. It also suggests the probability of esophageal varices.[4]
