Flux-less soldering with aid of conventional soldering iron, ultrasonic soldering iron or specialized solder pot and active solder that contains an active element, most often Ti, Zr or Cr.[26] The active elements, owing to mechanical activation, react with the surface of the materials generally considered difficult to solder without premetallization. The active solders can be protected against excessive oxidation of their active element by addition of rare earth elements with higher affinity to oxygen (typically Ce, La). Another common additive is Ga – usually introduced as a wetting promoter. Mechanical activation, needed for active soldering, can be performed by brushing (for example with use of stainless wire brush or steel spatula) or ultrasonic vibration (20 – 60 kHz). Active soldering has been shown to effectively bond ceramics,[26] aluminium, titanium, silicon,[27] graphite and carbon nanotube based structures [28] at temperatures lower than 450 °C or use of protective atmosphere.
