The first known usage of the "Hook 'em" phrase can be attributed to the University of Minnesota through the 1930s. Minnesota didn't trademark the phrase or the hand signal.  Neither did the University of Iowa. There was also a Texas basketball team during this era known as the "Hook 'Em Cows" which may have contributed to the use of the phrase and gesture at the University of Texas.[2]
