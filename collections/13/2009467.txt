Daniel's late brother Alex was the editor-in-chief of another Meade publication, Hudson. Part of Daniel's motivation as a character was proving that he could hold his own without living in Alex's shadow. However, he was unaware Alex was not only alive and had a sex change, but plotting to have Daniel removed from the job. When Alexis attempted to fire Daniel, he fired back with an injunction because "Alex" was legally dead and therefore no longer had any ownership of the company. The ensuing sibling rivalry was negotiated by Betty playing mediator between the two. Daniel and Alexis were ultimately forced by their mother to share co-Editor in Chief duties until Alexis' departure from the show.
