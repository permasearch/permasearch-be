To promote continuing interest in these products, Burger King occasionally released limited-time (LTO) variants on its premium burgers that have different ingredients from the standard sandwich recipes. Being one of the company's major business strategies, these sandwiches have sometimes been the center of product advertising for the company. Additionally, as a major product group within the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in these products.[Notes 3]
