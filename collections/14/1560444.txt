N. T. Wright considers the detailed narration of the Emmaus journey in Luke 24:13-35 as one of the best sketches of a biblical scene in the Gospel of Luke.[4] Jan Lambrecht, citing D.P. Moessner, writes: "the Emmaus story is one of Luke's 'most exquisite literary achievements'."[5] It describes the encounter on the road to Emmaus and the supper at Emmaus, and states that a disciple named Cleopas was walking towards Emmaus with another disciple when they met Jesus. They did not recognize him, and discussed their sadness at recent events with him. They persuaded him to come and eat with them, and in the meal event at Emmaus they recognized him.
