Prime Minister Hun Sen has vowed to rule until he is 74.[98][99] He is a former Khmer Rouge member who defected. His government is regularly accused of ignoring human rights and suppressing political dissent. The 2013 election results were disputed by Hun Sen's opposition, leading to demonstrations in the capital. Demonstrators were injured and killed in Phnom Penh where a reported 20,000 protesters gathered, with some clashing with riot police.[100] From a humble farming background, Hun Sen was just 33 when he took power in 1985, and is by some considered a long ruling dictator.[101]
