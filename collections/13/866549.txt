The Arab Spring were large-scale protests that erupted in the Arab World in 2011, demanding economic and political reforms.[83] Many of these protests tore down regimes in some Arab nations, leading to instability that ended with violent civil wars.[83] In Jordan, in response to domestic unrest, Abdullah replaced his prime minister and introduced a number of reforms including: reforming the Constitution, and laws governing public freedoms and elections.[83] Proportional representation was re-introduced to the Jordanian parliament in the 2016 general election, a move which he said would eventually lead to establishing parliamentary governments.[84] Jordan was left largely unscathed from the violence that swept the region despite an influx of 1.4 million Syrian refugees into the natural resources-lacking country and the emergence of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).[84]
