Cycling is a growing mode of transportation in Atlanta, taking 1.1% of all commutes in 2009, up from 0.3% in 2000,[33] and organizations like the Atlanta Bicycle Coalition[34] continue to lobby for increased accessibility to bicyclists. However, heavy automobile traffic, Atlanta's famed hills, the lack of bike lanes on many streets, and difficulty in crossing major streets deter many residents from cycling frequently in Atlanta.[35] The city's transportation plan calls for the construction of 226 miles of bike lanes by 2020.[36] The BeltLine which will include multi-use, paved trails, may help the city achieve this goal.[citation needed]
