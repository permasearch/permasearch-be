Interviews with Guns N' Roses band members suggest that between 1994 and 1996, the band sporadically began to write and record new material, most of which, according to Slash, had been written by Rose.[109] Rose has stated the exact opposite in the open letter on the official Guns N' Roses website in 2008, saying that the album was mostly a "Slash album" and Rose was allowed very little input into the album.[110] According to Matt Sorum, in 1996, the band had recorded 7 songs, with 7 more in the writing stages, and intended to release a single album with 10 or 12 songs, with a release date of Spring 1997.[111] Sorum also mentioned that Slash's Snakepit's debut album, It's Five O'Clock Somewhere, "could have been a Guns N' Roses album, but Axl didn't think it was good enough."[111]
