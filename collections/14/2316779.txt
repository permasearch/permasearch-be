Four of the known machines have inner wheels of complements, which were used to enter the first operand in a subtraction.  They are mounted at the center of each spoked metal wheel and turn with it.  The wheel displayed in the picture above has an inner wheel of complements but the numbers written on it are barely visible. On a decimal machine, the digits 0 through 9 are carved clockwise, with each digit positioned between two spokes so that the operator can directly inscribe its value in the window of complements by positioning his stylus in between them and turning the wheel clockwise all the way to the stop lever.[11] The marks on two adjacent spokes flank the digit 0 inscribed on this wheel.
