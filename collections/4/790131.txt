Toward the end of the East India Company's governance in India, an increasing number of documents were sent to London and incorporated into the records.  In fact, it was one of the most documented administrations ever.  However, when the control of India was transferred to the India Office, they set up a committee to review the records provided by the East India Company.  On the committee's recommendation, more than 300 tons of records were sold as wastepaper.  Although this was certainly a great loss to the collection, there is evidence that many of these records were duplications, or contained very little relevant information.
