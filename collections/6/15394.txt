One of these was the apostrophus,[34] in which 500 (usually written as "D") was written as |Ɔ, while 1,000 was written as C|Ɔ instead of "M".[15] This is a system of encasing numbers to denote thousands (the Cs and Ɔs functioned in this case as the Roman equivalent of parentheses), and has its origins in Etruscan numeral usage. Each extra set of C combined with Ɔ, raises C|Ɔ by a factor of ten, for example, CC|ƆƆ is 10,000 and CCC|ƆƆƆ is 100,000. Whereas the |Ɔ (representing 500) is raised by a factor of ten by combining it with a Ɔ, for example, |ƆƆ is 5,000, and |ƆƆƆ is 5,000. The D and M used to represent 500 and 1,000 in conventional Roman numerals were probably derived from |Ɔ and C|Ɔ, respectively.
