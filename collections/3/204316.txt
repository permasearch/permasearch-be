To shoot Lawrence, Super Panavision technology was used meaning spherical lenses were used instead of anamorphic ones, and the image was exposed on a 65mm negative, then printed onto a 70mm positive to leave room for the soundtracks. As the montage-like rapid cutting was more disturbing on the wide screen, filmmakers had to apply longer and more fluid takes. Shooting such a wide ratio produced some unwanted effects during projection, such as a peculiar 'flutter' effect, a blurring of certain parts of the image. To avoid the problem, the director often had to modify blocking, giving the actor a more diagonal movement, where the flutter was less likely to occur.[45] When asked whether he could handle CinemaScope, David Lean said, "If one had an eye for composition, there would be no problem."[46]
