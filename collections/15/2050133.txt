It is parasitised externally by fleas and mites, including the "house martin flea", Ceratophyllus hirundinis,[22] and internally by endoparasites such as Haemoproteus prognei (avian malaria), which are transmitted by blood-sucking insects including mosquitoes.[23] A Polish study showed that nests typically contained more than 29 specimens of ectoparasite, with C. hirundinis and Oeciacus hirundinis the most abundant.[24]
