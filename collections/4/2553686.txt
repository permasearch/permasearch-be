During the polio epidemics, the iron lung saved many thousands of lives, but the machine was large, cumbersome and very expensive:[46] in the 1930s, an iron lung cost about $1,500â€”about the same price as the average home.[47] The cost of running the machine was also prohibitive, as patients were encased in the metal chambers for months, years and sometimes for life:[44] even with an iron lung the fatality rate for patients with bulbar polio exceeded 90%.[48]
