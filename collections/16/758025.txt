The music video, directed by Daniel Kleinman, takes place on a dancing floor in a dark room with a chandelier, a rocking horse, a jukebox, and television sets displaying scenes from The Breakfast Club. The room gets increasingly cluttered with random objects as the video progresses, up until the last minute. The video on YouTube had been viewed over 94 million times as of January 29, 2018.[6]
