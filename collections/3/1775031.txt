Both the Allies and the Central Powers quickly adapted the overhead camshaft engine designs that had been used in racing cars just before the First World War to their liquid-cooled aircraft engines. The 1914 Mercedes SOHC racing car engine became the starting point for both Mercedes' six-cylinder aero-engine family and the Rolls-Royce Eagle V12, whose cylinder heads were reverse-engineered from a Mercedes racing car left behind in England at the beginning of the war. The Mercedes designs culminated in the Mercedes D.III. Other SOHC designs included the fully enclosed-drivetrain Hispano-Suiza 8 â€“ a V8 engine designed by Marc Birkigt and the late-war Liberty L-12 on the Allied side; and the powerful BMW IIIa on the side of the Central Powers.
