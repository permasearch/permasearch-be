The Panzer Army Africa (Panzerarmee Afrika), composed of German and Italian infantry and mechanised units under Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel, had struck deep into Egypt by 12 July 1942 after its success at the Battle of Gazala. This threatened the British Empire's control of the Suez Canal and Mandatory Palestine. General Claude Auchinleck withdrew the Eighth Army to within 80 kilometres (50 mi) of Alexandria to a point where the Qattara Depression came to within 64 kilometres (40 mi) of El Alamein on the coast. This gave the defenders a short front to defend and provided secure flanks because tanks could not traverse the Depression. The Axis advance was halted here in early July in the First Battle of El Alamein.
