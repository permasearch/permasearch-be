On September 15, Météo-France began monitoring a cyclone in the Bay of Biscay that they claimed was subtropical, having apparently possessing an asymmetric wind field of tropical-storm force winds and a warm thermal core.[122][123] However, American meteorological agencies disagreed and determined it was non-tropical,[124] as proven by surface analysis data from NOAA, which showed that the cyclone still had an occluded front connected to it – signs that usually indicate an extratropical cyclone.[125] The system drifted southeastwards, attaining a peak intensity of 996 mbar (29.4 inHg),[122] and eventually made landfall near the border of Spain and France, rapidly weakening and eventually dissipating shortly thereafter, early on September 16.[126] The Free University of Berlin, in accordance with their naming of cyclones that affect their area, named the cyclone "Stephanie".[127]
