The literary Dracula transforms into a bat several times in the novel, and vampire bats themselves are mentioned twice in it. The 1927 stage production of Dracula followed the novel in having Dracula turn into a bat, as did the film, where BÃ©la Lugosi would transform into a bat.[150] The bat transformation scene was used again by Lon Chaney Jr. in 1943's Son of Dracula.[153]
