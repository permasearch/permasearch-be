Shardik is also a novel by Richard Adams; King took the name from this book, something some members of Roland's ka-tet recognize: Susannah realizes the source of the name (although the book was published a decade after the year she was drawn from), while Eddie mentions that he thinks of rabbits when he hears the name Shardikâ€”a reference to Watership Down, another of Adams' books. Adams' Shardik, like King's, is a giant bear.
