Major urban areas in East Anglia include the cities of Norwich, Cambridge and Peterborough, and the town of Ipswich. Smaller towns and cities include Bury St Edmunds, Ely, Lowestoft, Great Yarmouth and King's Lynn. Much of the area is still rural in nature with many villages surrounded by agricultural land. The landscape of Cambridgeshire and Norfolk has been heavily influenced by Dutch technology, from the use of red clay pantiles to the draining of the Fens.[citation needed]
