Under new manager Ronald Koeman, Wanyama came into his own in the 2014–15 season.[31] He scored his first goal for the club in a 1–0 league victory over Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium on 20 September 2014, after replacing James Ward-Prowse in the 69th minute.[32] His next goal came in an 8–0 trouncing of Sunderland on 19 October 2014.[33] Wanyama would score his third goal for the Saints in spectacular fashion, a 40-yard shot after Eldin Jakupović's poor clearance fell straight to him, in what proved to be the only goal in a win over Hull City.[34] His performances saw him awarded the league's African Player of the Month for September,[31] with him stating "It is wonderful being recognised as someone who has done well for his club."[31]
