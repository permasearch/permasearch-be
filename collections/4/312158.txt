"Oops!... I Did It Again" was released as the lead single from the album and achieved worldwide popularity. It became Spears's third top-ten hit single on the US Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number nine; however, in comparison to the huge success of her debut single "...Baby One More Time", Jive Records considered "Oops!... I Did It Again" a minor disappointment.[40] The song peaked at number one on the US Mainstream Top 40,[41] holding the record for the most radio additions in one day. "Oops!... I Did It Again" peaked atop the charts in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.[42] An accompanying music video for "Oops!... I Did It Again" saw Spears on Mars in now-iconic red shiny catsuit, while she is visited by an American astronaut who hands her the fictional Heart of the Ocean jewel which Rose threw into the sea at the end of Titanic.[43]
