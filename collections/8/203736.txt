By his father's will in 1589 Hawkyns inherited an annuity of £40. His uncle, Sir John Hawkyns, left him by will in 1595, besides a share of the prospective profits of the last fatal voyage to the West Indies, £10 a year to be paid quarterly, "on condition that he do not alienate nor sell the same annuity nor rent-charge, or any part thereof, for otherwise this gift shall be void." He left also legacies of £100 to each of Hawkyns's children, to be payable "to every such child at the time of their marriage, or at the accomplishment of their several ages of eighteen years, which shall first happen." From the wording of this clause it would seem probable that the children were girls; but we know nothing more of them.
