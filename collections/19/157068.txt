Villanova honors outstanding former players, coaches, and others by retiring their numbers or jerseys. For those honored, a replica jersey is hung in the rafters of the Pavilion. Uniform numbers of retired jerseys remain in circulation, while retired numbers are no longer used. Paul Arizin's #11 is the only retired number. As of 2011[update], 19 have been honored with a retired number or jersey, including 14 players, four coaches, and longtime trainer Jake Nevin.[20]
