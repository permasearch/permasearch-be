In Google Chrome, the address bar (or "Omnibox") doubles as a search plugin bar which pulls incremental returns for typed phrases from Google Suggest's pre-emptive search. An add-on is also available for Firefox that duplicates this functionality,[3] and newer versions have the capability built-in.[4] This "Omnibox" is also capable of, in addition to the quick search function listed above, interpreting any non-URL phrase typed into it as a search on the user's search engine of choice.[5]
