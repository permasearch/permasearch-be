The South Atlantic High and the South Pacific High both influence the pattern of winds in Argentina.[1] Owing to the greater high of the Andes at latitudes north of 40oS, much of Argentina is dominated by wind circulation patterns from the South Atlantic High.[13][14] The South Atlantic High transports moisture from the Atlantic Ocean to Argentina.[1][23] This occurs throughout the year due to the atmospheric pressure being lower on land than in the ocean.[24] Much of the north and central parts of the country are affected by the South Atlantic High, with a strong influence in the eastern parts than in the west.[1] This is due to the eastern parts being more frequently affected by the South Atlantic High, causing precipitation to decrease westwards.[13]
