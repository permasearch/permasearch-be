The following items typically comprise a product backlog: features, bugs, technical work, and knowledge acquisition. A feature is wanted, while a bug is unintended or unwanted (but may not be necessarily something defective). An example of technical work could be to run a virus check on all developers' workstations. An example of knowledge acquisition could be to research Wordpress plugin libraries and making a selection.
