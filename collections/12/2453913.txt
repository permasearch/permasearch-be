In "The Empty Hearse", while John is recovering from the hurt and shock of discovering Sherlock is still alive, she accompanies Holmes on some casework. It is revealed that she was a confidante and a key element when Sherlock faked his death. Sherlock also tells her that Moriarty made a mistake in believing that she did not matter to him, when he, in fact, admits to her that she was “the one person who mattered the most.” During the first two episodes of the third season, she is engaged to Tom (Ed Birch) who looks and dresses quite a bit like Sherlock. In "The Sign of Three", Molly stabs Tom with a plastic fork when he interrupts Sherlock. By "His Last Vow", the engagement has been broken off—Sherlock observes she is not wearing her engagement ring. During her engagement to Tom, when Molly mentions the intimacy she and Tom are sharing, Sherlock appears confused.
