Rhett and Link met in 1984 on September 4th (this is the exact date they started school in Harnett County) at Buies Creek Elementary School in Buies Creek, North Carolina, where they attended first grade, a meeting about which they have subsequently written a song and made a movie (Looking For Ms. Locklear - 2008). They met through having to stay in at recess, as they were both doodling on their desks. In an interview on The Tonight Show, they state that they stayed in during recess because both of them had written swear words on their desks. They stayed in and colored in mythical creatures such as a unicorn (hence their YouTube channel name, GMM/Good Mythical Morning)[3] In their freshman year of high school at Harnett Central High School in Angier, North Carolina, both Rhett and Link signed a blood oath on a piece of paper which said, "We will do something together some day". Link kept it through his adulthood in a wallet. Unfortunately, the wallet was lost, along with the original copy of the paper.
