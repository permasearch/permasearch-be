Following rehearsals in a dance school in Shepherd's Bush, Genesis recorded Foxtrot at Island Studios between August and September 1972.[70] During the initial sessions, disagreements among Charisma and Anthony contributed to the end of his association with Genesis. After two replacement engineers were tried out, the band settled with John Burns and a new producer, Dave Hitchcock.[71] The album features the 23-minute track "Supper's Ready", a suite of various musical segments. The track included an opening acoustic piece, a Gabriel-penned song called "Willow Farm" and a piece derived from a jam by Banks, Rutherford and Collins called "Apocalypse in 9/8".[72] Other songs were the science-fiction themed "Watcher of the Skies" and the property development-themed "Get 'Em Out By Friday".[73] Foxtrot was released in October 1972 and reached No. 12 in the UK. It fared even better in Italy, where it went to No. 1.[74] Foxtrot was well received from critics. Chris Welch of Melody Maker thought Foxtrot was "a milestone in the group's career", "an important point of development in British group music", and that Genesis had reached "a creative peak".[75] Stephen Thomas Erlewine thought Foxtrot marked the first time "Genesis attacked like a rock band, playing with a visceral power".[76]
