Muslims under the Rashidun Caliphate from what is now Saudi Arabia, invaded the region from the south.[41] The Arab Christian Ghassanids, clients of the Byzantines, were defeated despite imperial support.[47] While the Muslim forces lost to the Byzantines in their first direct engagement during the Battle of Mu'tah in 629, in what is now the Karak Governorate, the Byzantines lost control of the Levant when they were defeated by the Rashidun army in 636 at the Battle of Yarmouk just north of modern-day Jordan.[41] The region was Arabized, and the Arabic language became widespread.[41]
