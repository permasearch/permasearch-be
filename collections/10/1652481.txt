By the way, I am familiar with no original research.  If any Wikipedia editor does original research with respect to the "unclear if the person is in the line of succession or not" topic that produces new and useful results, surely some reliable source that is interested in royal succession would be interested in publishing it, at which point it would be citeable.  davidwr/(talk)/(contribs)/(e-mail) 17:15, 4 April 2009 (UTC)
