A Diamondback, specifically Crotalus atrox, is a rattlesnake which is a very common sight in the Arizona desert and a fearsome symbol. The club adopted the symbol upon its formation in 1998. A baseball field is also called a "diamond". The team is often called the "D-backs" for short, and as of 2007 the team is wearing shirts that read "D-backs".  On the left sleeve is a stylized "db" which forms the head of a snake.
