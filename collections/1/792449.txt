While leading the team, to recapture the escaped Decipticons, they come across Steeljaw, an escaped convict who has his own plan to lead the pther escaped convicts. The Autobots would later receive a visit from Bumblebee's old comrade Jazz, who informed Bumblebee that his actions in departing Cybertron had angered the high council. After helping apprehend a fugitive named Ped, Jazz volunteered to return to Cybertron and inform the council of what had taken place. The team then received another group of Cybertronian visitors, in the form of Autobot bounty hunter Drift, Decepticon bounty hunter Fracture, and their Mini-Con teammates. Both Cybertronians arrived to collect a bounty placed on Bumblebee by the High Council for his actions, but Drift was convinced of Bumblebee's nobility after Bee saved his life. The team managed to defeat Fracture, and though his ship was lost they gained the use of his ground bridge.
