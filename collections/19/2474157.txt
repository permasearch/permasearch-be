Having led worship in churches, stadiums and open fields around the world, United's Live in Miami is the first live album from the band since 2009 and features 22 tracks, all captured during the bandâ€™s sold-out worship night in Miami. In 2011, best-selling modern worship band Hillsong United brought a new and fresh approach to tours, visuals, songs and multimedia to the U.S. for the widely successful "Aftermath Tour". The tour logged sold out worship nights in venues across the country - from New York to Los Angeles (where the band became the first Christian band to sell out Staples Center) and back east to Miami where the CD and DVD were recorded.
