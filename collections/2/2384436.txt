The New York Liberty are one of the original teams of the WNBA, which was formed in 1997.  The team's main venue moved from Madison Square Garden to Westchester County Center after the 2017 season. During a massive renovation project at the arena between 2011 and 2013, the Liberty temporarily played their home games at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey.
