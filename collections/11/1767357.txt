During the celebrations United's captain Peter Schmeichel and manager Alex Ferguson lifted the trophy together to the crowd. Despite their suspensions, both Keane and Scholes received winners' medals on the rostrum. Keane claims that to date he has not looked at the medal, feeling that his absence had tainted the accomplishment to the extent that he "didn't deserve the medal".[85] Substituted Bayern legend Lothar Matth√§us removed his runner-up medal as soon as he received it, and later remarked that United were "lucky" to win the final.[86]
