The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt wrote a slightly more critical review, noting the episode's lack of structure.[17] He wrote that "['Christmas Wishes'] is not a terrible episode of television, but it’s formless to the point where it avoids having to make any sort of statement."[17] He did, however, positively comment on the Andy and Erin subplot and suggested that the episode was "positioned as a transition point," featuring an Andy-Erin-Jessica love triangle and a darker Robert California.[17] He ultimately gave the episode a "B–".[17] Many reviews considered "Christmas Wishes" to be the best episode of the first part of the season.[16][18]
