Elephants, and therefore also mahouts, have long been integral to politics and the economy throughout Southern and Southeastern Asia. The animals are given away per request of government ministers and sometimes as gifts. In addition to more traditional occupations, today mahouts are employed in many countries by forestry services and the logging industry, as well as in tourism.
