There is some dispute over the origin of the word teetotaler. One anecdote attributes the origin of the word to a meeting of the Preston Temperance Society in 1833. The story attributes the word to Richard Turner,[2] a member of the society, who in a speech said "I'll be reet down out-and-out t-t-total for ever and ever".[3]
