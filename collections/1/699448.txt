One of Mayo's (1924) earliest research efforts involved workers at a Philadelphia textile mill.[12] The mill had been experiencing a high rate of turnover. Mayo believed that the repetitive work in the spinning department gave rise to mental abnormalities in the workers. He found that the introduction of rest periods helped reduce turnover. The research helped make Mayo more widely known in the U.S.[4]
