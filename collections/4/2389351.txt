Part 6 Stone Ocean shows examples of a single person possessing two Stands because of the ability of an extraordinary Stand. Enrico Pucci is able to produce artificial Stand users, by stealing others' Stands and transforming them into Discs (ディスク, Disuku) and then "inserting" them into certain individuals. Part 6 also features DIO's bone (DIOの骨, DIO no Hone), the sole remaining part of DIO which is instrumental in Pucci's Way to Heaven (天国へ行く方法, Tengoku e Iku Hōhō). It grants a new and more powerful Stand that ultimately leads to the creation of Made in Heaven メイド・イン・ヘヴン (Meido In Hevun), a powerful Stand that can accelerate the universe to the point of a universal reset.
