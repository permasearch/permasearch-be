Using the above characteristics, four well studied personality traits; locus of control, neuroticism, generalized self-efficacy, and self-esteem, were chosen as possible dispositional predictors of job satisfaction.  Each trait had previously presented as a relatively powerful predictor of various job outcomes; however, until this time, these traits' predictive powers had only been studied in isolation.  When studied together, Judge et al. (1997)[1] discovered that these four traits would form a broader personality trait called core self-evaluations, which could predict job satisfaction better than each individual trait could when examined alone.  In other words, relative levels of each of these four traits in an individual can be explained by one broad underlying trait; core self-evaluations.  Furthermore, combining these traits allowed for better prediction of job satisfaction, and later, a variety of other outcomes.[10]
