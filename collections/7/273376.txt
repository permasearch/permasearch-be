However, what most separates supply-side economics as a modern phenomenon is its argument in favor of low tax rates primarily for collective and notably working-class reasons, rather than traditional ideological ones. Classical Liberals opposed taxes because they opposed government, taxation being the latter's most obvious form. Their claim was that each man had a right to himself and his property and therefore taxation was immoral and of questionable legal grounding.[10] Supply-side economists, on the other hand, argued that the alleged collective benefit (i.e. increased economic output and efficiency) provided the main impetus for tax cuts.
