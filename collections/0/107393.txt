A collection of data from the United States found that about half the water stations tested had hardness over 120Â mg per litre of calcium carbonate equivalent, placing them in the categories "hard" or "very hard".[20] The other half were classified as soft or moderately hard. More than 85% of American homes have hard water.[52] The softest waters occur in parts of the New England, South Atlantic-Gulf, Pacific Northwest, and Hawaii regions. Moderately hard waters are common in many of the rivers of the Tennessee, Great Lakes, and Alaska regions. Hard and very hard waters are found in some of the streams in most of the regions throughout the country. The hardest waters (greater than 1,000 ppm) are in streams in Texas, New Mexico, Kansas, Arizona, and southern California.[53]
