Port St. Joe is traversed by the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway (GIWW), a federally maintained canal with a channel of 12 feet (3.7 m) deep by 125 feet (38 m) wide, which provides access from St. Marks, Florida, to Brownsville, Texas. From the GIWW, barges can be moved inland on various river systems including the Mississippi River, Tombigbee River Waterway System, and the Apalachicola River. The Apalachicola River is Gulf County's eastern boundary.
