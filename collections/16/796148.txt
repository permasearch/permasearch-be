Gaining approval for the treaty was a challenge. Germany was cautious about giving up its stable currency, i.e., the German Mark,[11] France approved the treaty by a narrow margin[12] and Denmark refused to ratify until they got an opt out from monetary union as the United Kingdom, an opt-out which they maintain as of 2011.[13] On 16 September 1992, known in the UK as Black Wednesday, the British pound sterling was forced to withdraw from the fixed exchange rate system due to a rapid fall in the value of the pound.[14]
