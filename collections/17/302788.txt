Dashing thro' the snow, In a one-horse open sleigh, O'er the hills we go, Laughing all the way; Bells on bob tail ring, Making spirits bright, Oh what sport to ride and sing A sleighing song tonight.  |: chorus :| Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way; Oh! what joy it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh.  A day or two ago I tho't I'd take a ride And soon Miss Fannie Bright Was seated by my side. The horse was lean and lank Misfortune seemed his lot He got into a drifted bank And we—we got upsot.
