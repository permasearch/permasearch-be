Two very commonly used loss functions are the squared loss,     L ( a ) =  a  2     {\displaystyle L(a)=a^{2}}  , and the absolute loss,     L ( a ) =  |  a  |    {\displaystyle L(a)=|a|}  . However the absolute loss has the disadvantage that it is not differentiable at     a = 0   {\displaystyle a=0}  . The squared loss has the disadvantage that it has the tendency to be dominated by outliers—when summing over a set of     a   {\displaystyle a}  's (as in      ∑  i = 1   n   L (  a  i   )   {\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{n}L(a_{i})}   ), the final sum tends to be the result of a few particularly large a-values, rather than an expression of the average a-value.
