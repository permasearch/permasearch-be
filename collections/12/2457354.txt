On March 23, 2018, a second US Autopilot fatality occurred in Mountain View, California.[104] The crash occurred just before 9:30Â A.M. on southbound US 101 at the carpool lane exit for southbound Highway 85, at a concrete barrier where the left-hand offramp separates from 101. After the Model X crashed into the narrow concrete barrier, it was struck again by two following vehicles, and then it caught on fire.[105]
