Throughout the Renaissance, images and ideas from classical antiquity entered popular culture through the new medium of print and through pageants and other public performances at festivals. The FÃªte-Dieu at Aix-en-Provence in 1462 featured characters costumed as a number of classical deities, including Pluto,[218] and Pluto was the subject of one of seven pageants presented as part of the 1521 Midsummer Eve festival in London.[219] During the 15th century, no mythological theme was brought to the stage more often than Orpheus's descent, with the court of Pluto inspiring fantastical stagecraft.[220] Leonardo da Vinci designed a set with a rotating mountain that opened up to reveal Pluto emerging from the underworld; the drawing survives and was the basis for a modern recreation.[221]
