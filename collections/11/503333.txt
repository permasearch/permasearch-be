In 1956, Alan Sainsbury became chairman after the death of his father, John Benjamin Sainsbury.[15] During the 1950s and 1960s, Sainsbury's was a keen early adopter of self-service supermarkets in the United Kingdom; the first self-service store within the country was a co-operative store opened in 1942.[17] On a trip to the United States of America, Alan Sainsbury realised the benefits of self-service stores and believed the future of Sainsbury's was self-service supermarkets of 10,000 sq ft (930 m2), with eventually the added bonus of a car park for extra convenience.[18] The first self-service branch opened in Croydon in 1950.[19]
