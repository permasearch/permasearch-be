After the Great Fire, Chicago Tribune reporter Michael Ahern published a claim that the fire had started when a cow kicked over a lantern while it was being milked. The owner was not named, but Catherine O'Leary was soon identified, since the fire had begun in her family's barn. Illustrations and caricatures soon appeared depicting Mrs. O'Leary with her cow. The idea captured the popular imagination and is still widely circulated even today.[2] However, in 1893 Ahern finally admitted he had made the story up.[3]
