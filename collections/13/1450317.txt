Note that the term (     N  h     {\displaystyle N_{h}}   −      n  h     {\displaystyle n_{h}}  ) / (     N  h     {\displaystyle N_{h}}  ), which equals (1 −      n  h     {\displaystyle n_{h}}   /      N  h     {\displaystyle N_{h}}  ), is a finite population correction and      N  h     {\displaystyle N_{h}}   must be expressed in "sample units". Foregoing the finite population correction gives:
