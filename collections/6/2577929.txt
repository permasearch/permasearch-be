The team was founded as the Regina Rugby Club on Tuesday, September 13, 1910, adopting the colours of old gold and purple.[7] They played most of their home games at Park Hughes on 10th Avenue in Regina's north central section, where they would remain based for over a century. The team was also a founding member of the Saskatchewan Rugby Football Union as it was organized on September 22 of that year. Regina played their first game against the Moose Jaw Tigers on October 1, 1910, at the Moose Jaw Baseball Grounds where they were defeated 16â€“6. For the 1911 season, the team changed their colours to blue and white to match the Regina Amateur Athletic Association and won their first SRFU championship, but lost in the first season of the Western Canada Rugby Football Union playoffs.[8]
