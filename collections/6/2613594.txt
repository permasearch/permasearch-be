On March 24, 2015, it was announced that Smoke House Pictures' partners George Clooney and Grant Heslov would produce a thriller, Nocturnal Animals, based on Austin Wright's 1993 novel Tony and Susan.[15] Tom Ford was set to direct the film, based on his own script.[15] Ford said that the storytelling concept of the novel appealed to him, explaining, "The film is very different than the book itâ€™s based on. However, the central themes are the same, meaning that when I read the book, what appealed to me as a writer and a filmmaker was the idea of this device of communicating to someone through a work of fiction. Through a written work of fiction. And thereby communicating something that they had not been able to really communicate clearly. I loved that concept."[16]
