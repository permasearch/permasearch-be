Natural resources often occur in distinct regions.  Natural resource regions can be a topic of physical geography or environmental geography, but also have a strong element of human geography and economic geography.  A coal region, for example, is a physical or geomorphological region, but its development and exploitation can make it into an economic and a cultural region.  Some examples of natural resource regions include the Rumaila Field, the oil field that lies along the border or Iraq and Kuwait and played a role in the Gulf War; the Coal Region of Pennsylvania, which is a historical region as well as a cultural, physical, and natural resource region; the South Wales Coalfield, which like Pennsylvania's coal region is a historical, cultural, and natural region; the Kuznetsk Basin, a similarly important coal mining region in Russia; Kryvbas, the economic and iron ore mining region of Ukraine; and the James Bay Project, a large region of Quebec where one of the largest hydroelectric systems in the world has been developed.
