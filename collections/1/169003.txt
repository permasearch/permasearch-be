The basic suspension design, which contributed much to the Mk 1's success, was carried over largely unchanged from its predecessor. Along with a 10 percent stiffer bodyshell, according to Ford this offers a better ride, but critics claimed the car lacked the precise and poised handling of the Mk 1.[citation needed] The same body styles as the Mk 1 Focus were offered, though the saloon did not appear until mid-2005. A two-door coupÃ©-cabriolet with a retractable hardtop was added to the line-up in 2007.
