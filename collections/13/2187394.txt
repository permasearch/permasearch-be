Partially correct: depending where you are in the hispanic world the "v" ("beh" o "veh") may sound either like the english v, or b. The return to pronouncing it like a v is a feature from large numbers of Europeans (who colonized south america) adopting spanish: properly it was that it be pronounced "b" however this feature arose from obliterating the distinction...I don't remember why, but it was a dumb reason (see below, and no offense, insult, or attack: I speak spanish). It partially depends on country, region thereof, and community.
