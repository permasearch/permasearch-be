Evidence from a slightly later period comes from Irenaeus and from the Apostolic Tradition.  In his debate with gnostics who favoured an immaterial religion, the former affirms: "Whenever, then, the mixed cup and the bread that has been made receive the word of God, the Eucharist becomes the body of Christ, and by it the substance of our flesh is nourished and sustained".[37]  The Apostolic Tradition[38] poses a number of critical problems including the question as to whether the liturgies were ever used. However, the editors of The Study of Liturgy conclude that "it is clearly safe...to use the document as evidence for early third-century Rome".[39] It contain what must be considered a complete prayer of consecration including a version of the Institution narrative.
