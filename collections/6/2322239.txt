Finding that a villain can win in the real world by literally getting away with murder, Benedict hatches a plan to eliminate Slater by killing Schwarzenegger the actor, after which he can bring various villains out of their respective films and take over reality. He summons the Ripper, the main antagonist from Jack Slater III, to kill Schwarzenegger, but Slater saves the actor and kills the Ripper on a rooftop by electrocuting him. Benedict returns and reveals his scheme to Slater and Danny. After a fight with the two, during which Slater is shot, Slater takes out Benedict by shooting his explosive glass eye. Danny attempts to return Slater to his world, knowing that Jack Slater as the main protagonist would not be allowed to die, but discovers they are unable to enter the movie screen without the golden ticket. Death, another fictional character who escaped from his movie The Seventh Seal, reveals to Danny that he will need the other half of the ticket, which he succeeds in doing. Danny brings Slater back into his movie, where he is able to shrug off his wound, and Danny departs back to the real world. A recovered Slater then enthusiastically embraces the true nature of his reality when he talks to Dekker about his new plan, appreciating the differences between it and the "real" world.
