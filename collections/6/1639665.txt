On January 4, 1971, Wallace wed the former Cornelia Ellis Snively (1939â€“2009), a niece of former Alabama Governor Jim Folsom, known as "Big Jim". "C'nelia" had been a performer and was nicknamed "the Jackie Kennedy of the rednecks". The couple had a bitter divorce in 1978. A few months after that divorce, Cornelia told Parade magazine, "I don't believe George needs a family. He just needs an audience. The family as audience wasn't enough for his ego."[14] The second Mrs. Wallace died at the age of 69 on January 8, 2009.[67]
