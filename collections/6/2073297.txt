Rainforest CafÃ© has a variety of desserts as well. Offered are a "Safari Sundae" and on the kids menu "Lava Mud" which is a pudding with chocolate cookies in it with gummy worms to emulate dirt. The largest and most popular dessert, however, is the Sparkling Volcano. A volcano is made of three wedge-shaped brownies with vanilla ice cream between them and a scoop of whipped topping on top, drizzled with both chocolate and caramel sauce. Volcanoes were once served with a sparkler on top which the diner would blow out as it arrived at the table but it has been replaced by a shiny cocktail pick. When a volcano is ordered, the wait staff will shout "Volcano" across the restaurant as it's being served, and will even sing a birthday song if they're told it's a party member's birthday.[11]
