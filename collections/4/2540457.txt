Introduced in Age of Shadows, Paladins are spiritual warriors whose divine powers are karma based and available through the Chivalry system. They were one of two new additions, the other being the Necromancer. Notable examples of Paladins in Ultima Online include Dupre (companion of the Avatar), the Legendary Paladin Marduk Lorethian, and the Elder Paladin Luke Terrant â€“ his oldest friend and companion.
