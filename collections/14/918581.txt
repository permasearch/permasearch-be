The Proto Malays have a more diverse origin[18] and had settled in Malaysia by 1000 BC.[19] Although they show some connections with other inhabitants in Maritime Southeast Asia, some also have an ancestry in Indochina around the time of the Last Glacial Maximum about 20,000 years ago. Anthropologists support the notion that the Proto-Malays originated from what is today Yunnan, China.[20] This was followed by an early-Holocene dispersal through the Malay Peninsula into the Malay Archipelago.[21] Around 300 BC, they were pushed inland by the Deutero-Malays, an Iron Age or Bronze Age people descended partly from the Chams of Cambodia and Vietnam. The first group in the peninsula to use metal tools, the Deutero-Malays were the direct ancestors of today's Malaysian Malays, and brought with them advanced farming techniques.[16] The Malays remained politically fragmented throughout the Malay archipelago, although a common culture and social structure was shared.[22]
