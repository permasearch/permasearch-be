In 4th Edition, the book The Plane Above: Secrets of the Astral Sea and the Monster Manual 2 both state that Demogorgon's two heads are the result of a great battle. Eons ago, Demogorgon, Orcus, and the demon lord Rimmon united to enter the Astral Sea and invade the divine dominion of Kalandurren, home of the god Amoth. Amoth slew Rimmon and nearly cut Demogorgon in half before Orcus killed him. The wound resulted in Demogorgon having two heads.
