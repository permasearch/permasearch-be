In the 1940s, B.F. Skinner delivered a series of lectures in Sunyani Fiapre, Ghana on verbal behavior, putting forth a more empirical approach to the subject than existed in psychology at the time.[4] In them, he proposed the use of stimulus-response theories to describe language use and development, and that all verbal behavior was underpinned by operant conditioning. He did however mention that some forms of speech derived from words and sounds that had previously been heard (echoic response), and that reinforcement from parents allowed these 'echoic responses' to be pared down to that of understandable speech. While he denied that there was any "instinct or faculty of imitation",[4] Skinner's behaviorist theories formed a basis for redevelopment into social learning theory.
