The Wildwoods is home to over 200 motels, built during the Doo-Wop era of the 1950s and 1960s,[39] in an area recognized by the state of New Jersey, known as the Wildwoods Shore Resort Historic District'[40] The term doo-wop was coined by Cape May's Mid-Atlantic Center For The Arts in the early 1990s to describe the unique, space-age architectural style, which is also referred to as the Googie or populuxe style.[41] The motels are unique in appearance, with Vegas-like neon signs and fantastic architecture.[42]
