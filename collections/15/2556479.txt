Limbaugh traditionally breaks from his usual Open Line Friday format the day before each Super Bowl to interview NFL players regarding the game. In 2011, he interviewed James Farrior and Larry Foote, both from the Pittsburgh Steelers, and retired cornerback Rodney Harrison on the Friday before Super Bowl XLV. In 2012, prior to Super Bowl XLVI, Limbaugh interviewed personal friend Ken Hutcherson, former middle linebacker for the Dallas Cowboys.
