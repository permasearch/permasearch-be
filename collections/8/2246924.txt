Because a skew reflection leaves the hyperbola fixed, the pair of asymptotes is fixed, too. Hence the midpoint     M   {\displaystyle M}   of a chord     P Q   {\displaystyle PQ}   divides the related line segment       P ¯      Q ¯     {\displaystyle {\overline {P}}\,{\overline {Q}}}   between the asymptotes into halves, too. This means that      |  P   P ¯    |  =  |  Q   Q ¯    |    {\displaystyle |P{\overline {P}}|=|Q{\overline {Q}}|}  . This property can be used for the construction of further points     Q   {\displaystyle Q}   of the hyperbola if a point     P   {\displaystyle P}   and the asymptotes are given.
