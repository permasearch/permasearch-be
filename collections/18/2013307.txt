The English Renaissance and the Renaissance in Scotland date from the late 15th century to the early 17th century. Italian literary influences arrived in Britain: the sonnet form was introduced into English by Thomas Wyatt in the early 16th century, and developed by Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, (1516/1517 â€“ 1547), who also introduced blank verse into England, with his translation of Virgil's Aeneid in c. 1540.[29]
