The       1 4    V  g     {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}V_{g}}   term is the intraclass correlation among half sibs. We can easily calculate      H  2   =    V  g     V  g   +  V  e      =    4 ( S − W )   S + ( r − 1 ) W      {\displaystyle H^{2}={\frac {V_{g}}{V_{g}+V_{e}}}={\frac {4(S-W)}{S+(r-1)W}}}  . The Expected Mean Square is calculated from the relationship of the individuals (progeny within a sire are all half-sibs, for example), and an understanding of intraclass correlations.
