Big Daddy covered the song on their 1992 Sgt. Pepper tribute album, a release that Moore recognises as "the most audacious" of the many interpretations of the Beatles' 1967 LP. Moore says that "Within You Without You" serves as the album's "cleverest pastiche", performed in a free jazz style reminiscent of Ornette Coleman or Don Cherry.[203] Other acts who have covered the song for Sgt. Pepper tributes include Oasis, on a BBC Radio 2 project celebrating the album's 40th anniversary (2007);[106] Easy Star All-Stars (featuring Matisyahu), on Easy Star's Lonely Hearts Dub Band (2009);[204] Cheap Trick, on their Sgt. Pepper Live DVD (2009);[205] and the Flaming Lips, with featured guests Birdflower and Morgan Delt, on With a Little Help from My Fwends (2014).[206] A recording by Big Head Todd and the Monsters appeared on the 2003 Harrison tribute Songs from the Material World.[207]
