The park entrance is located on US Highway 62/180, approximately 18 miles (29Â km) southwest of Carlsbad, New Mexico. Carlsbad Caverns National Park participates in the Junior Ranger Program.[4] The park has two entries on the National Register of Historic Places: The Caverns Historic District and the Rattlesnake Springs Historic District.[5] Approximately two thirds of the park has been set aside as a wilderness area, helping to ensure no future changes will be made to the habitat.
