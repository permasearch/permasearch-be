No candidate received an absolute majority, so a runoff was held between the top two finishers on Tuesday, December 5, 2017. Atlanta City Council member Keisha Lance Bottoms appeared to have won, according to unofficial results on election night, but City Council member Mary Norwood called for a recount.[1]
