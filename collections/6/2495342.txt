The Great Famine was restricted to Northern Europe, including the British Isles, northern France, the Low Countries, Scandinavia, Germany, and western Poland.[10] It also affected some of the Baltic states except for the far eastern Baltic, which was affected only indirectly.[10] The famine was bounded to the south by the Alps and the Pyrenees.
