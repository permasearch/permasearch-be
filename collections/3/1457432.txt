While working as the companion to a rich American woman on holiday in Monte Carlo, the unnamed narrator, a naÃ¯ve young woman in her early 20s, becomes acquainted with a wealthy Englishman, George Fortescue Maximilian (Maxim) de Winter, a 42-year-old widower. After a fortnight of courtship, she agrees to marry him and, after the wedding and honeymoon, accompanies him to his mansion in Cornwall, the beautiful West Country estate Manderley.
