Christina McKelvie, Convener of the European and External Relations Committee of the Scottish Parliament, in March 2014 asked Viviane Reding, Vice-President of the European Commission, whether Article 48 would apply.[228] Reding replied that EU treaties would no longer apply to a territory when it secedes from a member state.[229] She also indicated that Article 49 would be the route to apply to become a member of the EU.[229] Jos√© Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, stated earlier that an independent Scotland would have to apply for membership, while the rest of the UK would continue to be a member.[230] In 2014, he reiterated that Scotland joining the EU would be "extremely difficult, if not impossible".[231]
