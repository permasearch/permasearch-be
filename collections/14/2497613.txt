He later appears in Season 10, Chapter 7, using a seagull as target practice. In the following chapter the Freelancers attack the Insurrectionist base. As they begin their attack, the Insurrectionist Sniper appears, alongside other snipers and pins down the Freelancers. Carolina asks North for help and he throws his Domed Energy Shield in the direction of the snipers. The enhancement lands beside the group and activates. The Sniper then tells the soldiers to hold their fire. However, one of the soldiers fires at the shield and the bullet bounces off and kills him. The dead soldier falls, firing the rest of his ammo inside the shield causing the bullets to ricochet, killing the remaining soldiers including the Sniper.
