Despite having a good start, Jonathan and Cheryl began to develop cracks during their honeymoon in New Zealand. These cracks further deepened at the dinner party which resulted in Jonathan exchanging numbers with Scarlett and the duo spent the night texting. At the first commitment ceremony, Cheryl claimed she didn't wish to continue with Jonathan as "he seemed more interested in someone else". The duo called it quits at the commitment ceremony. Jonathan is now dating someone else.
