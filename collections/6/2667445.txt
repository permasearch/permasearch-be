Between 2,064[11] and 2,122 species of brittlestars are currently known, but the total number of modern species may be over 3,000.[12] This makes brittlestars the most abundant group of current echinoderms (before sea stars). We know around 270 genera distributed in 16 families,[1] which makes them at the same time a relatively poorly diversified group structurally, compared with the other echinoderms.[11] For example, 467 species belong to the sole family of Amphiuridae (frail brittle stars which live buried in the sediment leaving only their arms in the stream to capture the plankton). There are also 344 species in the family of Ophiuridae.[11]
