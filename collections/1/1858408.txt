The effect can also be derived by using either the exact Schwarzschild metric (describing spacetime around a spherical mass)[83] or the much more general post-Newtonian formalism.[84] It is due to the influence of gravity on the geometry of space and to the contribution of self-energy to a body's gravity (encoded in the nonlinearity of Einstein's equations).[85] Relativistic precession has been observed for all planets that allow for accurate precession measurements (Mercury, Venus, and Earth),[86] as well as in binary pulsar systems, where it is larger by five orders of magnitude.[87]
