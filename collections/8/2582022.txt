A major center of activity was the link-sharing website Reddit,[19] where a subreddit was created for sharing the photos;[20] in a single day, it amassed over 100,000 followers. Reddit administrators were criticized for allowing this to take place in an alleged violation of their anti-doxing rules.[21][22] As McKayla Maroney claimed to be under 18 at the time the photos of her were taken, Reddit staff took photos of her down and warned that anyone re-posting them, or underage photos of Liz Lee which had been circulating prior to this incident, would be permanently banned from the site and could be prosecuted for distributing child pornography.[23] On September 7, citing copyright issues, Reddit banned its "TheFappening" subreddit,[20][24] also saying the workload of dealing with them had become too much.[25] Reddit banned another subreddit named "Fappening" on the same day.[24]
