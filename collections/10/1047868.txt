By 1999, glittery, sparkling makeup had come into style.[124] This was called "Y2K makeup", consisting of facial glitter and lip gloss. Blue-frosted eye shadow remained a staple of late 1990s makeup, although silver was ideal look. Dark eyeliner was considered bodacious. Pale, shiny lips became desirable, as lip gloss largely replaced lipstick.[121] An alternative for those who did not like metallics were purples and browns.[124] Goth makeup and Y2K makeup continued into the early 2000s.
