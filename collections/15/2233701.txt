Salmon is a fish with high fat content and smoked salmon is a good source of omega-3 fatty acids including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA).[6][7] Smoked salmon has a high sodium content due to the salt added during brining and curing.[7] Three ounces of smoked salmon contains approximately 660 mg of sodium, while an equivalent portion of fresh cooked salmon contains about 50 mg.[7] Although high salt content prevents the growth of microorganisms in smoked salmon by limiting water activity,[7] the American Heart Association recommends limiting sodium consumption.[8]
