In the United States, there are no regulations governing who may engage in sperm donation.[30] Rather, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and other expert groups (e.g., American Association of Tissue Banks) provide recommendations and guidelines.[30] The ASRM guidelines limit a donor to 25 live births per population area of 850,000,[20] although this is not enforced by law, there is no central tracking, and it has been estimated that only about 40% of births are reported. It is likely that some donors have over one hundred genetic children.[31] Some sperm banks impose lower limits; e.g., the Sperm Bank of California has a limit of ten families per donor,[32] and the Rainbow Flag Sperm Bank has a limit of donor children by six different women.[33]
