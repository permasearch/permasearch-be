Having granted her customary one request, the Mother of Faces prepares to depart, despite Misu and Aang's efforts to have her grant a second favor. Angered at their perceived ingratitude, the Mother of Faces summons the animal spirits of Forgetful Valley in an attempt to force them to leave. In the chaos, Rafa's mask is knocked off, revealing that Rafa's face was not disfigured but instead taken by Koh the Face Stealer, whom the Mother of Faces reveals to be her son. Repentant, the spirit restores Rafa's face and agrees to help Aang repair the relationship between Ursa and her children.
