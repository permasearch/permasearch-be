Intersex can therefore be contrasted with transgender,[107] which describes the condition in which one's gender identity does not match one's assigned sex.[107][108][109] Some people are both intersex and transgender.[110] A 2012 clinical review paper found that between 8.5% and 20% of people with intersex variations experienced gender dysphoria.[28] In an analysis of the use of preimplantation genetic diagnosis to eliminate intersex traits, Behrmann and Ravitsky state: "Parental choice against intersex may ... conceal biases against same-sex attractedness and gender nonconformity."[111]
