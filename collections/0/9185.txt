The primary catalyst for secession was slavery, especially Southern political leaders' resistance to attempts by Northern antislavery political forces to block the expansion of slavery into the western territories. Another explanation for secession, and the subsequent formation of the Confederacy, was white Southern nationalism.[2] The primary reason for the North to reject secession was to preserve the Union, a cause based on American nationalism.[3] Most of the debate is about the first question, as to why some southern states decided to secede.
