On October 6, 1966, the state of California made LSD a controlled substance, making the drug illegal.[21] In response to the criminalization of psychedelics, San Francisco hippies staged a gathering in the Golden Gate Park panhandle, called "The Love Pageant Rally",[21] attracting an estimated 700-800 people.[22] As explained by Allan Cohen, co-founder of the San Francisco Oracle, the purpose of the rally was twofold â€” to draw attention to the fact that LSD had just been made illegal, and to demonstrate that people who used LSD were not criminals, nor were they mentally ill. According to Cohen, those who took LSD were mostly idealistic people who wanted to learn more about themselves and their place in the universe, and they used LSD as an aid to meditation and to creative, artistic expression.[citation needed] The Grateful Dead played, and some sources claim that LSD was consumed at the rally.[23]
