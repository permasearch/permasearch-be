Land of the morning Child of the sun returning With fervor burning Thee do our souls adore.  Land dear and holy, Cradle of noble heroes, Neâ€™er shall invaders Trample thy sacred shores.  Ever within thy skies and through thy clouds And o'er thy hills and sea Do we behold the radiance, feel the throb Of glorious liberty  Thy banner dear to all our hearts Its sun and stars alight, Oh, never shall its shining fields Be dimmed by tyrants might!  Beautiful land of love, o land of light, In thine embrace 'tis rapture to lie But it is glory ever, when thou art wronged For us, thy sons to suffer and die
