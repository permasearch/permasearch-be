The University of Central Florida's Student Government Association (SGA) is an advocacy group for the students who attend the university, representing the university's nearly 60,000 undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. It is the largest Student Government within the state of Florida and one of the largest in the United States.[178] In addition, it also often places in the top ten SGAs nationally for the services and outreach it provides for the students it serves. The SGA operates within a multimillion-dollar budget.[179] It funds and operates three campus facilities—the main Recreation and Wellness Center, the Recreation and Wellness Center at Knights Plaza, and the Student Union—while also providing upwards of $1.5 million in funding to nearly 600 registered student organizations.[162][180]
