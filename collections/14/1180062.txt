When the series begins on Christmas Eve 2000, Nate is returning home from Seattle to celebrate Christmas with his family. Nate had abandoned the family business years earlier. After graduating from Bonaventure High School and attending U.C. Santa Cruz, Nate travelled through Europe and later settled in Washington State, where he was assistant produce manager of the largest organic food co-op in Seattle. However, after his father dies, Nate delays returning to Seattle for a few days. He and David each inherit half of their father's business, Fisher & Sons, and Nate ends up sticking around to help run the business after he comes to realize that he has a natural gift for comforting grieving people. He and David initially clash because David is angry at him for leaving home and constantly points out the undertaking-related mistakes Nate is making, but they eventually mend fences and work well together. He also develops a relationship with Brenda Chenowith that began as a random sexual encounter in an airport and slowly becomes something more.
