It is not merely trivial that the two terms 'law of conservation of energy' and 'first law of thermodynamics' survive. Some writers do indeed identify the two, and treat them as one and the same. The proper distinction is that the law of conservation of energy is more general than the first law of thermodynamics. The first law is stated in many texts in a way that refers to thermodynamic systems, which are members of only a specialized subset of physical systems. The law of conservation of energy refers to physical systems in general.Chjoaygame (talk) 18:15, 11 May 2015 (UTC)
