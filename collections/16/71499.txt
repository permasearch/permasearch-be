Zay Babineaux (Amir Mitchell-Townes) is Lucas' old friend from Texas who later moves to New York and enrolls at J.Q. Adams Middle School, becoming the unofficial fifth member of the group. He fancies himself a smooth talker, but his words and actions more often get him into trouble rather than out of it. When Zay and Lucas were classmates at their old school in Texas, Lucas was usually the one who bailed him out, which was the situation that got Lucas expelled.
