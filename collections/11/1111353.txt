The Brigade began publishing a humor magazine called The Log in 1913.[116] This magazine was discontinued in 2001[117] but returned to print in the fall of 2008. Among The Log's usual features were "Salty Sam," an anonymous member of the senior class who served as a gossip columnist, and the "Company Cuties," photos of male midshipmen's girlfriends. (This last was deemed offensive to women, and despite attempts to incorporate the boyfriends of female midshipmen in some issues, the "Company Cuties" were dropped from The Log's format by 1991.)[118] The Log was once featured in Playboy Magazine for its parody of the famous periodical,[119] called "Playmid." "Playmid" was an issue of The Log in 1989 and was ordered destroyed by Rear Admiral Virgil I. Hill, the Academy Superintendent at the time, but a handful of copies did survive, including the one which later showed. Earlier Log attempts to parody were much more successful, with the 18 April 1969, version as the most famous; some sections of this issue can be seen online at an alumni website.[120] In September 1949, the Log began publishing a half-sized Splinter bi-weekly, to alternate with its larger sized publication.[121][122][122]
