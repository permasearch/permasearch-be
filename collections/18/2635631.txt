New Dorp High School was originally located a few streets away in a smaller building which is now Staten Island Technical High School. Due to the growing population in the area, just as with the rest of the borough, the school was moved to its current, larger building in 1982. Since then, New Dorp High School has grown into a diverse academic community that reaches out to the area. Recent changes include developing new programs.
