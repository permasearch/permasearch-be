Results of studies regarding the effect of eliminating artificial food coloring from the diet of children with ADHD have been very varied. It has been found that it might be effective in some children but as the published studies have been of low quality results can be more related to research problems such as publication bias.[194] The UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) has called for a ban on the use of six artificial food colorings[195] and the European Union (EU) has ruled that some food dyes must be labeled with the relevant E number as well as this warning: "may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children."[196] Nevertheless, existing evidence neither refutes nor supports the association between ADHD and food colouring.[197]
