Adam wanders around London, climbs onto the railing of Waterloo Bridge and seems to consider jumping. Instead, he throws his notebook, recording the one million oysters shucked, into the river. Later he arrives at Reece's restaurant drunk and bangs on the windows until the cooks let him in and he makes a nuisance of himself in the kitchen. When he pulls a sous-vide bag over his head Reece dismisses his kitchen staff, rips the bag off Adam's head and cradles Adam when he breaks down. The next morning, Reece says that he knows Adam is the better chef and appreciates Adam's work because it pushes him to keep experimenting. They part on far better terms. Adam visits Dr. Rosshilde and attends his first group therapy session. When he returns to the hotel, he learns that Anne Marie has paid his drug debt. She also gives him her father's knives and urges him to be with Helene. Tony and Helene find Adam in his hotel room and tell him that the two men the night before were not Michelin reviewers. Adam is so thrilled to have another chance at getting a Michelin star, he kisses Tony. Visibly ruffled by the exchange, Tony leaves Helene with Adam to ensure he doesn't have a concussion and to dress his wounds. The scene ends with Adam and Helene sharing a passionate kiss.
