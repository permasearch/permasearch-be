Christina: Carmen has a close relationship with her mother, Christina, whom she has lived with since her parents' divorce. Carmen admits that she can be bratty with her mother, though Christina suggests this may be because she knows it is easier to get mad at people you love because you can trust them to still love you. Carmen can also be possessive of her mother and is worried both when Christina begins dating and when she gets pregnant. She does not want her mother to leave her.
