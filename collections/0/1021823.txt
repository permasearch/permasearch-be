Movers are typically entitled to a mover's lien under UCC ยง 7-307/308, to withhold a customer's goods to secure payment.  This is a possessory lien, and is the non-consensual type of lien (because it exists automatically under a statute instead of being affirmatively agreed upon).  However, the concept of a mover's lien is often abused in a moving scam known as a hostage load, whereby the moving company will fraudulently extort money not owed by the customer by refusing to deliver the goods unless the customer pays money inflated beyond the contractual estimate.  Because the customer has an interest in obtaining their own goods, they are under duress to pay the ransom.  Hostage loads in at least the interstate context are illegal under 49 U.S.C. 13905.  The FMCSA regulates the moving industry and sometimes takes enforcement action by fining and/or delicensure of offending moving companies.  Moving companies that deliberately engage in hostage-loading may also be considered to be engaging in racketeering in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.
