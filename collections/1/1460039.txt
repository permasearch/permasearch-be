Initially, decisions of the Supreme Court could be appealed to the Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council.  As well, litigants could appeal directly from the provincial courts of appeal directly to the Judicial Committee, by-passing the Supreme Court entirely. There was a provision in the 1875 Act which attempted to limit appeals to the Judicial Committee. That clause resulted in the Governor General reserving the bill for consideration by the Queen-in-Council.[8] After much debate between Canadian and British officials, royal assent was granted on the understanding the clause did not in fact affect the royal prerogative to hear appeals, exercised through the Judicial Committee.[9] The question of the power of Parliament to abolish appeals to the Judicial Committee eventually was tested in the courts.  In 1926, the Judicial Committee ruled that the Canadian Parliament lacked the jurisdiction to extinguish appeals to the Judicial Committee, as the right of appeal was founded in the royal prerogative and could only be terminated by the Imperial Parliament.[10]  Following the enactment of the Statute of Westminster, in 1933 the federal Parliament passed legislation again abolishing the right of appeal in criminal matters.  In 1935, the Judicial Committee upheld the constitutional validity of that amendment.[11]  In 1939, the federal government proposed a reference to the Supreme Court of Canada, asking whether the federal Parliament could terminate all appeals to the Judicial Committee. By a 4â€“2 decision, the Supreme Court held that the proposal was within the powers of the federal Parliament and would be constitutional.[12]  The question was then appealed to the Judicial Committee, but the hearing of the appeal was delayed by the outbreak of World War II.[13]  in 1946, the Judicial Committee finally heard the appeal and upheld the decision of the majority of the Supreme Court,[14] clearing the way for Parliament to enact legislation to end all appeals to the Judicial Committee, whether from the Supreme Court or from the provincial courts of appeal. In 1949, Parliament passed an amendment to the Supreme Court Act which abolished all appeals, making the Court truly the Supreme Court.[15]  However, cases which had been instituted in the lower courts prior to the amendment could still be appealed to the Judicial Committee. The last Canadian appeal to the Judicial Committee was not decided until 1960.[16]
