The latter two methods should be uncovered by routine audits, but often aren't if the audit is not sufficiently in-depth, because the paperwork appears to be in order. A publicly traded company must change auditors and audit companies every five years.

Employers have developed a number of strategies to deal with this problem. In fact, cash registers were invented just for this reason.
