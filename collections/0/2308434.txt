In 2002, Eric Rignot and R.H. Thomas found that the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets were losing mass, while the East Antarctic ice sheet was close to in balance (they could not determine the sign of the mass balance for The East Antarctic ice sheet).[62] Kwok and Comiso (J. Climate, v15, 487â€“501, 2002) also discovered that temperature and pressure anomalies around West Antarctica and on the other side of the Antarctic Peninsula correlate with recent Southern Oscillation events.
