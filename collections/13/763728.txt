The character of Will Smith is loosely based on the life of his actor of the same name (although in the show 'Will' is short for William, while in real-life it is short for Willard). Smith's charming and mischievous personality earned him the nickname "Prince," which eventually became "Fresh Prince". Smith became a successful rapper, but lost most of his money because of poor budgeting. When NBC signed Smith up for the sitcom, he was almost bankrupt, and it immediately launched his acting career.[1]
