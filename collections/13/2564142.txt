In games that feature the permanent death of playable characters, an epilogue can chronicle what has happened to the various characters that have survived the events of the game, depicting how their situation has changed after the story has come to a conclusion. For example, the 2015 video game Until Dawn features those who survived recounting their experiences to the Police after being rescued. This system can also be expanded on. In most games of the Fire Emblem series, relationships can be built between characters, allowing for unique outcomes to happen for characters depending on the actions of the player throughout the campaign.
