He went to Paris for study, where his main teachers were Friedrich Kalkbrenner, Anton Reicha and Henri Herz,[3] and where he also had friendships with people such as Hector Berlioz, Sigismond Thalberg and Johann Peter Pixis. In Paris, he made his living by demonstrating Duport pianos, and he also lived in Duport's household.[1] After completing his studies, he returned to Germany. In Stuttgart, he made the acquaintance of Frédéric Chopin after hearing him perform his Piano Concerto No. 1 in E minor. Schuncke dedicated his Capriccio in C minor, Op.10, to Chopin.[1] He then moved to Vienna, Prague and Dresden, appearing in concert,[4] before finally settling in Leipzig in December 1833.[5] He lived in a boarding house and his room was next door to that of Robert Schumann,[6] whose very close friend he became. Schuncke was one of the co-founders of the Neue Zeitschrift für Musik,[7] and one of its early contributors, under the pseudonym "Jonathan".[8][9] He was also a member of Schumann's Davidsbund.[3]
