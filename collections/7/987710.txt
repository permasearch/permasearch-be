Anton (voiced by Lewis MacLeod in “The Dress” Anthony Hull in every other appearance) is a simple-minded piece of toast who was forcibly drafted into Tina's gang despite his unwillingness to do so, and only appeases them to avoid their anger.[25] He is prone to being killed in various freak accidents, only to be resurrected by his parents after each occasion with a toaster which creates a new copy of him.[43]
