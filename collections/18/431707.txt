The days of Easter vary each year depending on the day determined by the Western Christian calendar. Until 1994 Easter Tuesday was a Bank Holiday in Victoria (it retains this status partially in Tasmania). The day after Good Friday and before Easter Sunday is traditionally known as Holy Saturday. However, the states where that day is a public holiday use different terminology â€“ it is officially gazetted as "Easter Saturday" in the ACT, New South Wales, and the Northern Territory;[3][4][5] as "the day after Good Friday" in Queensland and South Australia;[6][7] and as "Saturday before Easter Sunday" in Victoria.[9]
