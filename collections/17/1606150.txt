The agreement came after a North Korean intermediate-range ballistic missile launch in June 2016; China has rebuked the actions of the involved parties,[48] as destabilizing. South Korean military sources responded that a 12 February 2017 launch by North Korea represented a new technology, a 'cold launch' using compressed gas before the solid-fuel rocket ignition.[49] This type of launch is a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) technology.[49] China responded to the North Korean launch by cutting off their import of North Korean coal, which is 50% of North Korea's income.[50] [51] On 6 March 2017, North Korea launched four missiles from Tongchang-ri,[52] a known long-range missile site at 7:36 a.m. local time, one of which landed in the Sea of Japan, with the remaining three missiles landing in Japan's economic zone.[53] A fifth North Korean missile failed to launch.[54]
