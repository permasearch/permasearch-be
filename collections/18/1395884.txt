Sehwag's maiden century in mid-2001 in Sri Lanka was not enough to gain selection in the Test team for the corresponding series.[51] Sehwag made his Test debut in late 2001 in the First Test against South Africa in Bloemfontein as a middle-order batsman. He scored 105 on debut despite the South African win.[52] He was given a one-match suspension by ICC match referee Mike Denness for overappealing[53] in the Second Test in Port Elizabeth, which led to political dispute amongst the ICC and the two countries. He returned for the home series in 2001–02 against England and Zimbabwe. After scoring two half-centuries in the preceding series, he was promoted to a makeshift opener on the 2002 England tour after the failure of previous openers and an experiment with wicket-keeper Deep Dasgupta. He scored 84 in the new role at Lord's[54] and then a century in the Second Test at Trent Bridge,[55] and has batted there in Test matches ever since. He scored his maiden home century of 147 in the First Test against the West Indies in 2002–03 home season in Mumbai, which was at the time his top score in Test matches, earning him his first man of the match award.[56] After a poor tour to New Zealand, he scored passed 50 for the first time in 9 innings when he scored 130 in a Test at Mohali against New Zealand in late 2003[57][58] [5].
