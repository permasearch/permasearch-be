Zihuatanejo spent most of its history until recently as a sleepy fishing village.[1] The federal government's decision to develop the nearby resort in the 1970s has had major implications for both the city and municipality of Zihuatanejo. The area is now the third most-visited area in Mexico, after Canc√∫n and Puerto Vallarta, and the most popular for sports fishermen.[6] Zihuatanejo's population jumped from 6,887 to 37,328 by the early 1990s.[4] Recently, a new highway called the "Maxipista Siglo XXI" was built to connect Zihuatanejo with Morelia, cutting the travel time from Mexico City to about six hours.
