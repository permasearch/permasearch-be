Chang has an antagonistic relationship with almost every student and faculty member at Greendale. He is on especially bad terms with Professor Duncan ("Pascal's Triangle Revisited," "The Psychology of Letting Go"), who potentially foreshadows Chang's lack of teaching qualifications when, in "Advanced Criminal Law," he notes Chang demands to be called "SeÃ±or" because he is not a real professor. In the first-season finale, Chang and Duncan come to blows when Chang becomes a student and Duncan is suspended from teaching, resulting in a physical battle at the end-of-the-year dance. Though Duncan gets a restraining order against him, Chang in turn nullifies this by getting a restraining order against Duncan, thus allowing him to take his anthropology class. They seem to have formed a grudging respect for each other since.
