At the studios, Joey has started shooting with Richard Crosby (Gary Oldman) who keeps spitting while saying his lines which annoys Joey. When he can't stand it anymore, he talks to Richard about it, when Richard tells him that all good actors spit while saying their lines. Therefore, when they shoot the next scene, Joey and Richard both constantly spit at each other while saying their lines. When their scenes are over for the day, Joey is given lines for scenes for the next day. However, Joey can't come the next day since he is performing Monica and Chandler's wedding. Because he's still in the mood of saying the lines, he accidentally spits on the man who gave him the lines, while telling him that he has important plans due to which he can't come.
