Oil development began with the 1894 discovery of the Midway-Sunset Oil Field, now the third-largest in the United States, in the southwestern portion of Kern County near Maricopa. Yet it was an 1899 discovery along the Kern River, today part of the giant Kern River Oil Field, that was the breakthrough in Kern's oil production.[9] Oil was refined here even before the establishment of the county.[9] The Buena Vista Petroleum Company was organized and incorporated in 1864.[9] Soon thereafter a refinery was built that operated until April 1867 when work ceased because of high freight charges.[9]
