From 2011, the channel also began to experiment with showing select programmes in 3D. The first such broadcasts were the live men's and women's finals of the 2011 Wimbledon Championships[11] and continued with the broadcast of that year's Strictly Come Dancing final in December.[12] 2012 saw one of the most ambitious levels of 3D coverage with the BBC screening the opening and closing ceremonies and the men's 100m final of the 2012 Summer Olympics including a daily highlights programme in 3D.[13] In addition to this, the channel also broadcast in 3D the men's and women's finals of the 2012 Wimbledon Championships,[14] the natural history programme Planet Dinosaur Ultimate Killers in August,[15] the second half of the Last Night of the Proms on 8 September 2012,[16] the adaptation of Mr Stink on 23 December 2012 and Killer Dinosaurs and the Royal Christmas Message on 25 December.[17]
