The apocrine gland secretes an oily fluid with proteins, lipids, and steroids that is odorless before microbial activity. It appears on the skin surface mixed with sebum, as sebaceous glands open into the same hair follicle.[23] Unlike eccrine sweat glands, which secrete continuously, the apocrine glands secrete in periodic spurts.[20]
