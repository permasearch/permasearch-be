The initial version of Grand Theft Auto IV released in Australia and New Zealand was pre-censored by Rockstar to allow the game to meet the perceived requirements of the Australian classification system.[187] However, the game was resubmitted to the New Zealand OFLC by Stan Calif, a 21-year-old student who was unhappy that New Zealand received an edited version of the game as a result of Australian censorship laws. The unedited version was subsequently given an R18 rating and cleared for sale in New Zealand.[188] For the PC release, the uncensored version of the game was awarded MA15+ in Australia.[189] Following the release of The Lost and Damned, Rockstar distributed a patch which uncensored the Australian console version.[190]
