Private Franklin Donut is from Leggat Plains, Iowa. He first appears in Episode 3 of Season 1 as a new recruit, whose garrulous personality tends to annoy other members of the Red Team. He originally sported standard issue red armor, but due to an inadvertent series of events he is eventually given his own armor color; Pink. Initially insecure about this, he insists on calling it "Lightish Red". The pink armor invites teasing from his teammates, and even causes the Blues to think he's a girl for the first two seasons which causes Donut's normal gender behavior to alter.
