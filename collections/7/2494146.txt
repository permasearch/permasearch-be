I can't see why a boy should sigh when by his side Is the girl he loves so true, All he has to say is: "Won't you be my bride, For I love you? I can't see why I'm telling you this secret, When I know that you can guess." Harvest moon will smile, Shine on all the while, If the little girl should answer "yes."
