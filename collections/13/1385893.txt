Covert Redirection takes advantage of third-party clients susceptible to XSS or Open Redirect attacks.[49] Normal phishing attempts can be easy to spot, because the malicious page's URL will usually be off by a couple of letters from that of the real site. The difference with Covert Redirection is that an attacker could use the real website instead by corrupting the site with a malicious login pop-up dialogue box.[50]
