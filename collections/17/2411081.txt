All technologies except Fibre to the Node (FTTN) and Fibre to the Curb (FTTC, previously called Fibre to the distribution point (FTTdp)) provide User Network Interface (UNI) jacks (modular jacks for data (UNI-D, RJ45)) in premises. FTTN and FTTC each require premises to have a compatible VDSL2 modem. FTTC requires power to be provided from the premises to the kerb (distribution point).
