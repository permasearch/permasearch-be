I have partially reverted an edit by an anon user with no contribution history though I agree with some of their points so I have not fully reverted it. The edit appeared to focus on a more rounded group of arts to include more modern and non-Asian arts and I think that this is a reasonable suggestion. I've put a couple of what I consider to be the more well-known Asian arts back in as well as fixed some links that had been broken. The edit also removed a section on the popularising of Martial Arts in the West through media, I've put it back in though a little further down so it flows more naturally into the history section.
