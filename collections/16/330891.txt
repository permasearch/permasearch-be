Lutherans hold that sacraments are sacred acts of divine institution.[47] Whenever they are properly administered by the use of the physical component commanded by God[48] along with the divine words of institution,[49] God is, in a way specific to each sacrament, present with the Word and physical component.[50] He earnestly offers to all who receive the sacrament[51] forgiveness of sins[52] and eternal salvation.[53] He also works in the recipients to get them to accept these blessings and to increase the assurance of their possession.[54]
