An ice-cream headache, also known as brain freeze, cold-stimulus headache, trigeminal headache[1][2] or its given scientific name sphenopalatine ganglioneuralgia (meaning "pain of the sphenopalatine ganglion"), is a form of brief pain or headache commonly associated with consumption (particularly quick consumption) of cold beverages or foods such as ice cream and ice pops. It is caused by having something cold touch the roof of the mouth, and is believed to result from a nerve response causing rapid constriction and swelling of blood vessels[3] or a "referring" of pain from the roof of the mouth to the head.[4][5] The rate of intake for cold foods has been studied as a contributing factor.[6][7] Ice-cream headache is distinct from dentin hypersensitivity, a type of pain that can occur under similar circumstances.
