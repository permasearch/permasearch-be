The group appeared on many television shows of the day, including The Hollywood Palace, Shebang, and particularly The Ed Sullivan Show, where they became a favourite of the host. Performances exist of several of the album's songs from these myriad shows, including Go Where You Wanna Go, Another Day, Another Heartache, Pattern People, California My Way, and of course, the title track of the album.
