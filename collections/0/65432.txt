In 1954, language FORTRAN was invented at IBM by a team led by John Backus; it was the first widely used high level general purpose programming language to have a functional implementation, as opposed to just a design on paper.[5][6] It is still a popular language for high-performance computing[7] and is used for programs that benchmark and rank the world's fastest supercomputers.[8]
