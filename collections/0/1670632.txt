The ancestral SCSI standard, X3.131-1986, generally referred to as SCSI-1, was published by the X3T9 technical committee of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986. SCSI-2 was published in August 1990 as X3.T9.2/86-109, with subsequent revisions in 1994. Further refinements have resulted in improvements in performance and support for ever-increasing storage data capacity.[2]
