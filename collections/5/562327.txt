In 1940, the Stones sold the plantation to Georgian prince Dimitri Jorjadze and his American socialite wife, Audrey. The prince raced thoroughbreds under the nom de course, Boone Hall Stable, with the most notable of his horses being Princequillo, who in 1943 was the fastest distance runner in the United States.[9] The princely couple sold the plantation to Dr. Henry Deas in 1945, who in turn sold to Harris M. McRae and his wife Nancy in 1955. The McRaes continued to farm the land with a focus on growing peach trees, and eventually opened the plantation to public tours in 1956.
