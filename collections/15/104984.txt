To find the most effective antidepressant medication with minimal side-effects, the dosages can be adjusted, and if necessary, combinations of different classes of antidepressants can be tried. Response rates to the first antidepressant administered range from 50â€“75%, and it can take at least six to eight weeks from the start of medication to remission.[129] Antidepressant medication treatment is usually continued for 16 to 20 weeks after remission, to minimize the chance of recurrence,[129] and even up to one year of continuation is recommended.[167] People with chronic depression may need to take medication indefinitely to avoid relapse.[19]
