Lord Diplock's threefold classification of the grounds of judicial review in the GCHQ case – illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety – was adopted by the Singapore Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988).[10] Lord Diplock in the GCHQ case preferred to use the term irrationality to describe Wednesbury unreasonableness, and there is some uncertainty as to whether both concepts refer to the same thing. However, Singapore courts have stated that the test for irrationality is that of Wednesbury unreasonableness.[11] In cases such as Re Siah Mooi Guat (1988),[12] Kang Ngah Wei v. Commander of Traffic Police (2002),[13] and Mir Hassan bin Abdul Rahman v. Attorney-General (2009),[7] the courts applied the test of irrationality set out in the GCHQ case.
