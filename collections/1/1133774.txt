Letterman began his broadcasting career as an announcer and newscaster at the college's student-run radio station—WBST—a 10-watt campus station which now is part of Indiana Public Radio.[16] He was fired for treating classical music with irreverence.[16] He then became involved with the founding of another campus station—WAGO-AM 570 (now WWHI, 91.3).[17]
