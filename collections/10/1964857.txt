There are two different music videos. The most common one, based on the Bayside Boys Mix and directed by French director Vincent Calvet,[17] was created in 1996, featuring Los del Rio performing on a white backdrop. Ten women are also seen dancing with the band. Among them is Mia Frye, who choreographed the video. This version, where nine of the ten women lip sync the English lyrics, samples a line from The Graduate ("I am not trying to seduce you!") that had been earlier used by George Michael in "Too Funky", but was later removed due to possible copyright issues. The other, similar version of the music video was in black and white and was more instructional in that the women and men are clearly shown performing the specific dance moves.
