Four years later, in the game's present, the four have a run-in with a group of men led by Max and Badger while scavenging for supplies and gas from a junk yard. Javier is driven away from the others but is rescued by Clementine. She offers to help in exchange for their family truck, and takes him to Prescott, a fortified community within an old airfield, where he is introduced to Tripp, Conrad, Francine, and Eleanor. Tripp and Eleanor agree to help rescue Javier's family. In the rescue attempt, Mariana is killed by Max and Badger's men, and Kate is critically wounded, but Javier's allies manage to repel the attack. Kate is rushed back to Prescott, while Clementine identifies one of the attackers as a member of The New Frontier, a large group of survivors she had once met, claiming they were once good people, but have since become twisted and distrustful.
