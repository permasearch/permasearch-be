Hill then appeared as Sergeant Putnam in Gandhi (1982), directed by Richard Attenborough. Though Hill did not figure prominently in the cast, he benefited from being part of an Oscar-winning film. Next up for Hill was Roger Donaldsonâ€™s The Bounty (1984), a fourth dramatisation of the famed mutiny on HMS Bounty.
