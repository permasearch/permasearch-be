Sickle cell anemia is the most common genetic disorder among African Americans in the United States. While approximately 8% are carriers, 1 in 375 African Americans are born with the disease. Carriers are typically asymptomatic, but they may show symptoms at high altitudes or under oxygen-poor environments as in instances of extreme exercise.[5] Carriers are also known to be resistant to malaria, suggesting there is a heterozygote advantage in certain regions of Africa. This is a probable explanation for why the disease is most prevalent among African Americans [6]
