The eggs are derived from materials ingested as a larva and from the spermatophores received from males during mating.[47] Eggs are laid singly on the underside of a young leaf of a milkweed plant during the spring and summer months.[48] The eggs are cream colored or light green, ovate to conical in shape, and about 1.2×0.9 mm in size. The eggs weigh less than 0.5 mg each and have raised ridges that form longitudinally from the point to apex to the base. Though each egg is ​1⁄1000 the mass of the female, she may lay up to her own mass in eggs. Females lay smaller eggs as they age. Larger females lay larger eggs.[47] The number of eggs laid by a female, who may mate several times, ranges from 290 to 1180.[49] Females lay their eggs on milkweed; the offsprings' consumption of the milkweed benefits health and helps defend them against predators.[50][51] Eggs take 3 to 8 days to develop and hatch into larva or caterpillars.[10]:(p21) Monarchs will lay eggs along the southern migration route.[52]
