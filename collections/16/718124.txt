Along with the Legacy-based model, Subaru also released the first generation Impreza-based Outback Sport in 1994 to North America only for the 1995 model year. Derived from the Impreza hatchback, the Outback Sport featured an off-road appearance package, and a slightly raised suspension akin to the larger Legacy-based model. Subaru in North America launched subsequent generations in 2001 for the 2002 model year and 2007 for model year 2008, based on the second and third generation Impreza, respectively. Subaru discontinued the Outback Sport nameplate in 2011, replaced in 2012 for the 2013 year model with the Subaru XV as derived from the fourth generation model.
