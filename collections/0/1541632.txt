For the first time since 1975, the Ford Econoline was given a major redesign for the 1992 model year. Although the body and interior saw extensive changes, the fleet-oriented Econoline 150/250/350 made its return in both cargo and passenger configurations. For retail markets, the Club Wagon XLT made its return, joined by the luxury-oriented Chateau trim (reviving a trim used in the late 1970s). The Ford Club Wagon Chateau would go on to become the 1992 winner of Motor Trend magazine's Truck of the Year award.
