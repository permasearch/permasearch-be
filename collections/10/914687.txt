The Hornets had a successful offseason, however, despite a disappointing season. First they shipped Plumlee and Belinelli and the 41st pick in the 2017 NBA Draft to the Atlanta Hawks for former All-star and MVP candidate Dwight Howard and the 31st pick in 2017 draft. The trade reunited Howard with head coach Steve Clifford, both of whom worked together during Howard's time in Orlando and Los Angeles. In the draft, Charlotte selected Malik Monk with the 11th overall pick, as well as Frank Jackson with the 31st pick. They then sent Jackson to the New Orleans Pelicans for cash considerations and swing man Dwayne Bacon who was drafted 40th overall. Sessions signed with the New York Knicks, and, to replace the backup guard, the brought in former rookie of the year Michael Carter-Williams from the Chicago Bulls. The new Hornets core will now consist of a hopeful Kemba Walker, Nic Batum, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Marvin Williams, Dwight Howard, along with Cody Zeller and Malik Monk leading the second unit.
