In the United States, the original version of the song peaked at number 2 on the Hot Latin Songs chart and at number 19 on the Billboard Hot 100. Upon the release of the remixed version of the song, featuring Beyoncé, reached number 1 on the Hot Latin Songs chart, ending the 35-week reign led by "Despacito", becoming Balvin's fourth number 1 on the Hot Latin Songs Chart, as well as Beyoncé's highest-charting song on the chart after "Irreplaceable" peaked at number 4 and "Beautiful Liar" peaked at number ten in 2007. On the Hot 100, the remix moved from number 21 to number 3 after a full tracking week, giving both Balvin and William their first top ten single and Beyoncé her 17th top ten single (27th with Destiny's Child) on the chart. The remix also reached number one the US Digital Songs chart with 79,000 copies sold during that week (combined sales with the original version), becoming both Balvin and William's first number one song on that respective chart, and Beyoncé's sixth, as well as just the second mostly-Spanish sung song to top the chart after "Despacito".[5] This makes "Mi Gente", alongside "Despacito", as the first time in Billboard chart history for two non-English singles to reign in the Top 10.
