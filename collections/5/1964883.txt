Starting on line five of the sonnet, the narrator speaks about not being able to fully reminiscence about his friends using his own eyes.[24] He then recounts that friends of his are long gone within "death's dateless night," using the term dateless as time without limit.[25] It does not mean that these friends are necessarily dead, they are just hidden in night, basically a night that will never end.[26] Don Patterson also describes the statement "death's dateless night" as a more legalese and also a chilling phrase.[27] Further into the quatrain the narrator uses the term cancelled to describe the relationship with past friends, as if the time with them have expired. As if everything in his past has expired or been lost.[25] "Moan the expense" is also used to express the narrator's moaning over what the loss of "precious friends" and how is costs him in sorrow.[28]
