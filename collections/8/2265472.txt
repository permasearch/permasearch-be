The episode was the first of two tribute episodes to the Beatles. It features the marriage proposal by Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss) to Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer), the revelation of Rachel Berry's (Lea Michele) future on Broadway, the official dating of Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) and Kitty Wilde (Becca Tobin), and the return of Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) to Mckinley High School as the new principal. Two special guest stars debut on the show: Peter Facinelli as Rupert Campion, the Funny Girl director and Ioan Gruffudd as Paolo San Pablo, the Funny Girl lead actor.
