Leslie (Amy Poehler) excitedly prepares to present the parks department budget proposal, or "master plan". However, city manager Paul (Phil Reeves), announces due to Pawnee's huge budget deficit, all proposals will be postponed indefinitely. State auditors have been sent by the governor to solve the impasse, which makes Leslie fear severe cuts. Ron (Nick Offerman) is delighted because he hates any government spending, which leads him to heated arguments with Leslie. Meanwhile, April (Aubrey Plaza) is turning 21 and is having her birthday party at Tom's (Aziz Ansari) favorite nightclub, the Snakehole Lounge. Andy (Chris Pratt) debates whether to ask April to be his girlfriend, but worries about the age difference because he is 29. Ann (Rashida Jones) has broken up with Mark (Paul Schneider), and they meet for lunch to discuss the end of their relationship. Mark is confused as to why Ann has decided to break up with him because they never fought and everything seemed to be going perfectly smoothly. Ann explains that their lack of fighting was actually a bad thing because it meant their relationship had no passion, and she adds that Mark isn't used to dating anyone for a long period of time and over-stated the relationship's strength for that reason.
