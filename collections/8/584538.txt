Lakeith Stanfield[24] portrays L in the American film adaptation, as an enigmatic, near-mythical and highly-intelligent FBI investigator, who only takes up crime cases that interest him, usually ones that have stymied law enforcement agencies and governments. A number of changes were made to this version of the character, though his quirky, eccentric and socially awkward personality, fondness for sweets, preference to crouch than sit and genius-level intellect remain the same. He is shown to be of African-American origin and was raised in an isolated orphanage-like facility in Montauk, New York, where he was subjected to intensive mental conditioning and tests that severely affected his psyche before he was adopted by Watari, is a lot more aggressive, emotional and quick-tempered than his manga counterpart, wears a dark-colored hoodie and jeans, is more prone to aggressive outbursts, is less morally rooted and emotionally insecure, and has a willingness to kill "Kira", after his assistant and foster-father, Watari, meets his end at the hands of the serial-killer, despite his early moral code to never kill criminals. Although L initially suspects that high school student, Light Turner, is the world-famous serial-killer, "Kira", he is unable to detain him due to lack of evidence and the fact that one of the co-investigators and Light's father, Seattle detective James Turner, refuses to believe that his son is a serial-killer, with the rest of the film following L's efforts to prove that Light is "Kira", and comes to a climax when L goes on his own manhunt to apprehend Light, but is outwitted by Light in the end and is forced to leave Seattle. In the end, after L learns the involvement of Light's deceased girlfriend, Mia Sutton, in the serial-killings and uncovers a hidden page of the Death Note in her room, he contemplates writing Light's name in the Death Note page out of anger and thirst for vengeance, while the Death Note's original owner, Ryuk, learns of what L has done and simply comments to a bed-ridden Light in his hospital room, "You humans are so interesting", with a sinister grin in his face, possibly due to the fact that L had written down Light's name in the Death Note page.[25][26]
