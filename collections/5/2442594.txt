The first step toward high-speed rail travel in China was the upgrade of existing regular speed rail lines for high-speed train service. Following the sixth round of the "railway speed up campaign" on April 18, 2007, some 6,003 km (3,730 mi) of track could carry trains at speeds of up to 200 km/h (124 mph). Of these, 848 km (527 mi) could attain 250 km/h (155 mph). These include the Qinshen (Qinhuangdao–Shenyang), and sections of the Jiaoji (Qingdao-Jinan), Hukun (Shanghai-Kunming) between Hangzhou and Zhuzhou, Guangshen (Guangzhou-Shenzhen), Jinghu (Beijing–Shanghai), Jingha (Beijing-Harbin), Jingguang (Beijing-Guangzhou), Longhai between Zhengzhou to Xuzhou, Railways. Upgrade work continues on other lines including the Handan (Wuhan-Danyang), Xianggui (Hunan-Guizhou), and Ningqi (Nanjing-Nantong) Railways.
