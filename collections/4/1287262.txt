On September 3, 2017, North Korea claimed to have successfully tested a thermonuclear bomb, also known as a hydrogen bomb. Corresponding seismic activity similar to an earthquake of magnitude 6.3 was reported by the USGS making the blast around 10 times more powerful than previous detonations by the country.[69] Later the bomb yield was estimated to be 250 kilotons, based on further study of the seismic data.[70] The test was reported to be "a perfect success".[71]
