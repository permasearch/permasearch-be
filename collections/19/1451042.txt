Known as The Tristan Stone, or The Longstone (Cornish: Menhir, meaning long stone), is a 2.7 m tall granite pillar near Fowey in Cornwall. The stone has a mid-6th century two line inscription which has been interpreted as reading DRVSTANVS HIC IACIT CVNOMORI FILIVS "Drustan lies here, the son of Cunomorus". A now missing third line was described by the 16th century antiquarian John Leland as reading CVM DOMINA OUSILLA "with the lady Ousilla". Ousilla is a Latinisation of the Cornish female name Eselt, otherwise known as Isolde. The disappearance of this third line may be as a result of the stone being moved several times over the past three centuries.[1][better source needed]
