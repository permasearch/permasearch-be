The sea battle was one of the first sequences created for the film,[102] filmed using miniatures in a huge tank on the back lot at the MGM Studios in Culver City, California, in November and December 1957.[58][98] More than 40 miniature ships[83] and two 175-foot (53 m) long Roman galleys, each of them seaworthy, were built for the live-action segment.[46] The ships were constructed based on plans found in Italian museums for actual ancient Roman galleys.[97] An artificial lake with equipment capable of generating sea-sized waves was built at the Cinecittà studios to accommodate the galleys.[49] A massive backdrop, 200 feet (61 m) wide by 50 feet (15 m) high, was painted and erected to hide the city and hills in the background.[49] To make the scene bloodier, Dunning sought out Italian extras who had missing limbs, then had the makeup crews rig them with fake bone and blood to make it appear as if they had lost a hand or leg during the battle.[102] When Dunning edited his own footage later, he made sure that these men were not on screen for long so that audiences would be upset.[102][m] The above-decks footage was integrated with the miniature work using process shots and traveling mattes.[104]
