If the series      ∑  n = 1   ∞    a  n     {\displaystyle \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }a_{n}}   converges but the series      ∑  n = 1   ∞    |  a  n   |    {\displaystyle \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }\left|a_{n}\right\vert }   diverges, then the series      ∑  n = 1   ∞    a  n     {\displaystyle \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }a_{n}}   is conditionally convergent. The path formed by connecting the partial sums of a conditionally convergent series is infinitely long. The power series of the logarithm is conditionally convergent.
