Other operas based on the first play were composed by Giovanni Paisiello (his Il barbiere di Siviglia premiered in 1782), by Nicolas Isouard in 1796, and then by Francesco Morlacchi in 1816. Though the work of Paisiello triumphed for a time, only Rossini's version has stood the test of time and continues to be a mainstay of operatic repertoire. On 11 November 1868, two days before Rossini's death, the composer Costantino Dall'Argine (1842â€“1877) premiered an opera based on the same libretto as Rossini's work,[5] bearing a dedication to Rossini.[6] The premiere was not a failure, but critics condemned the "audacity" of the young composer and the work is now forgotten.[6][7]
