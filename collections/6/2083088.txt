Following 1980's Space Panic, Donkey Kong is one of the earliest examples of the platform game genre[5]:94[6] even prior to the term being coined; the US gaming press used climbing game for titles with platforms and ladders.[7] As the first platform game to feature jumping, Donkey Kong requires the player to jump between gaps and over obstacles or approaching enemies, setting the template for the future of the platform genre.[8] With its four unique stages, Donkey Kong was the most complex arcade game at the time of its release, and one of the first arcade games to feature multiple stages, following 1980's Phoenix and 1981's Gorf and Scramble:66[9]
