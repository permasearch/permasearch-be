The flanking leucine-zipper layers act as a water-tight seal to shield the ionic interactions from the surrounding solvent. Exposure of the zero ionic layer to the water solvent by breaking the flanking leucine zipper leads to instability of the SNARE complex and is the putative mechanism by which     Î±   {\displaystyle \alpha }  -SNAP and NSF recycle the SNARE complexes after the completion of synaptic vesicle exocytosis.
