Pieing has its origins in the "pie in the face" gag from slapstick comedy. It appears on stage in the music hall sketches of the English theatre impresario Fred Karno.[1] It was first seen in film in the 1909 Essanay Studios silent film Mr. Flip starring Ben Turpin.[2] In the story, Turpin has a pie pushed into his face for taking liberties with a woman.
