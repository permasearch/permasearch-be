In the 1970 census, 57 percent of Egypt's population was counted as rural, including those residing in agricultural areas in the Nile Valley and Delta, as well as the much smaller number of persons living in desert areas.  Rural areas differ from the urban in terms of poverty, fertility rates, and other social factors.  Agriculture is a key component of the economy in rural areas, though some people are employed in the tourist industry or other non-farm occupations.  In 1992, the percentage of Egypt's population employed in agriculture was 33 percent.  The agricultural industry is dependent on irrigation from the Nile river.[2]
