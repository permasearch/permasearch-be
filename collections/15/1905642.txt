The Scholastic philosophers and theologians of the Middle Ages such as Aquinas later called Averroes “The Commentator,” and Michael the Scot translated several of Averroes' works within fifty years of the Arab's death. However, Averroes' reception in Western Europe contrasted with his ultimate rejection by Arabs in Spain.[33] Soon after Averroes, Greek ideas in the Arab world were largely opposed by those who disliked anything not “truly Arab.”[34]
