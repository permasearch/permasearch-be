In October 2014, Kreisberg described the episodes as very important to both Barry and Oliver and what they are going thorough, while also promising "one of the biggest surprises for Arrow of all time in The Flash episode".[13] Guggenheim added, "It's like the bomb underneath the table, and I think part of the fun is waiting to see when Oliver is going to learn what the audience learns on Flash."[14] It was later announced that another secret would be revealed in the final moments of The Flash episode that will help "introduce the next phase of The Flash in a big way".[15] In the episode, Oliver runs into an ex-girlfriend, last seen pregnant with his child in season two of Arrow and had been told by Oliver's mother Moira to tell him that she'd lost the baby and disappear. It is revealed to the viewers that she has a child and it's presumed to be Oliver's. After the airing of the episode, Guggenheim confirmed that indeed it was Oliver's child.[16] At the end of the episode, Robbie Amell, who played Ronnie Raymond—Caitlin's former fiancée presumed dead after the particle accelerator explosion—appears as Firestorm using his powers.[6]
