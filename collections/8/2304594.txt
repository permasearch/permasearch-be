Alterations in the autonomic nervous system can lead to orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing), oily skin and excessive sweating, urinary incontinence, and altered sexual function.[29] Constipation and impaired stomach emptying (gastric dysmotility) can be severe enough to cause discomfort and even endanger health.[11] Changes in perception may include an impaired sense of smell, disturbed vision, pain, and paresthesia (tingling and numbness).[29] All of these symptoms can occur years before diagnosis of the disease.[29]
