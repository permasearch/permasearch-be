The westernmost part of Western North Carolina is part of the Tennessee Valley. Asheville is the major hub of far western North Carolina.  In this area, there are a few hydroelectric projects managed by the Tennessee Valley Authority, including Fontana Dam.  Tourism, especially outdoor ventures such as canoeing, whitewater rafting, camping, and fishing are extremely important to local economies in the area.
