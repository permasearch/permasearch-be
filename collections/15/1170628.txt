When the township sought a new post office, another New Jersey municipality in Hunterdon County was using the name Delaware Township. The United States Postal Service insisted on a name change, suggesting "Deltown". Delaware Township mayors Christian Weber and John Gilmour pursued public write-in campaigns to select possible titles, and chose Cherry Hill from suggestions that included Chapel Hill, Cherry Valley and Delaware City.[27] The name "Cherry Hill" was chosen by the township's citizens in a non-binding referendum in 1961, and was officially adopted November 7, 1961.[23]
