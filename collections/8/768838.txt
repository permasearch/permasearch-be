When the tower opened, 3,000 customers took the first rides to the top.[4] Tourists paid sixpence for admission, sixpence more for a ride in the lifts to the top, and a further sixpence for the circus.[7] The first members of the public to ascend the tower had been local journalists in September 1893 using constructors' ladders.[11] In 1897 the top of the tower caught fire, and the platform was seen on fire from up to fifty miles away.[5]
