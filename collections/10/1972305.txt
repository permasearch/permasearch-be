Woodpeckers also drum on various reverberatory structures on buildings such as gutters, downspouts, chimneys, vents and aluminium sheeting.[45] Drumming is a less-forceful type of pecking that serves to establish territory and attract mates.[44] Houses with shingles or wooden boarding are also attractive as possible nesting or roosting sites, especially when close to large trees or woodland. Several exploratory holes may be made, especially at the junctions of vertical boards or at the corners of tongue-and-groove boarding. The birds may also drill holes in houses as they forage for insect larvae and pupae hidden behind the woodwork.[45]
