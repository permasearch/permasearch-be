An Italian friar, Gabriele Maria Berardi, claimed to have performed an exorcism on Dalí while he was in France in 1947.[62] In 2005, a sculpture of Christ on the Cross was discovered in the friar's estate. It had been claimed that Dalí gave this work to his exorcist out of gratitude,[62] and two Spanish art experts confirmed that there were adequate stylistic reasons to believe the sculpture was made by Dalí.[62]
