Twitch is a live streaming platform for video, primarily oriented towards video gaming content. The service was first established as a spin-off of a general-interest streaming service known as Justin.tv. Its prominence was eclipsed by that of Twitch, and Justin.tv was eventually shut down by its parent company in August 2014 in order to focus exclusively on Twitch.[86] Later that month, Twitch was acquired by Amazon for $970 million.[87] Through Twitch, Amazon also owns Curse, Inc., an operator of video gaming communities and a provider of VoIP services for gaming.[88] Since the acquisition, Twitch began to sell games directly through the platform,[89] and began offering special features for Amazon Prime subscribers.[90]
