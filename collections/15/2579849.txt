When the elements     R   {\displaystyle R}   and     G   {\displaystyle G}   are negligibly small the transmission line is considered as a lossless structure. In this hypothetical case, the model depends only on the     L   {\displaystyle L}   and     C   {\displaystyle C}   elements which greatly simplifies the analysis. For a lossless transmission line, the second order steady-state Telegrapher's equations are:
