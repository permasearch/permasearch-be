Members of the government in charge of Department of State are designated "Ministers of Government" (before 1977 a "Minister of State").[9] For distinction, "Ministers of State" (known before 1977 as "Parliamentary Secretaries") — informally called "junior ministers" — are not members of Government. A Government Minister (before 1977 a "Minister of State") is usually in charge of a Department of State and thus technically a "Minister of Government". A minister without portfolio may be appointed to the Government who is not the head of a Department of State; this occurred in 1939 during the period of the Emergency when Frank Aiken served as Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures until 1945.
