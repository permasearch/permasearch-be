In fish, fertilisation of eggs can be either external or internal.  In many species of fish, fins have been modified to allow Internal fertilisation.  Similarly, development of the embryo can be external or internal, although some species show a change between the two at various stages of embryo development. Thierry Lod√©  described reproductive strategies in terms of the development of the zygote and the interrelationship with the parents; there are five classifications - ovuliparity, oviparity, ovo-viviparity, histotrophic viviparity and hemotrophic viviparity.[10]
