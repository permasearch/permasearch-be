The white continuous light generated by the xenon arc is spectrally similar to daylight, but the lamp has a rather low efficacy in terms of lumens of visible light output per watt of input power. Today, almost all movie projectors in theaters employ these lamps, with power ratings ranging from 900 watts up to 12 kW. Omnimax (Imax Dome) projection systems use single xenon lamps with ratings as high as 15 kW.  As of 2016, laser illumination for digital theater projectors is starting to establish a market presence [6] and has been predicted to supersede the xenon arc lamp for this application.[7]
