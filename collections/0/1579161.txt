Bones is regarded as a different sort of radio DJ. “Without that classic, booming radio DJ voice,” as the Washington Post led in a profile.[20] “He wishes he had it - he tried to fake it - but it never quite worked out.” Bones is known for conducting unscripted interviews, and his willingness to discuss any aspect of his life and work on the air.
