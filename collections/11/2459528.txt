The Voxyn are a reptilian species known for their ferocious defense mechanisms. As well as being extremely agile, they bear poisonous spinal bristles, spit a strong acid (brown in color), and have a screech noted to cause bleeding of the ears in some of the hummanoid characters. These vicious creatures were created by the Yuuzhan Vong during the "New Jedi Order" time period to hunt and kill jedi. There is little more known about the creatures due to a limited appearance in the novel "Star by Star" written by Troy Denning[citation needed]
