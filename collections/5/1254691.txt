More generally, newspapers in large cities in the 1890s started using large font multi-column headlines to attract passers-by to buy the paper. Previously headlines seldom were more than one column wide, although multicolumn-width headlines were possible on the presses then in use. The change required typesetters to break with tradition and many small-town papers were reluctant to change.[32]
