Nova Ranger had a blue-and-gold device very similar in appearance to the Omega Ranger's Morpher, which was called the Nova Morpher. Like the Omega Morpher, Nova Ranger's morpher acted as her only weapon in combat and had an Electro-Mode. However, unlike the Omega Morpher, the Nova Morpher appeared to have better time traveling capabilities and the power to restore Omega Ranger to human form.
