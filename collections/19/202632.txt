This inline engine configuration is the most common in cars with a displacement up to 3.0 L. In practice, the displacement of inline-four petrol engines in cars rarely exceeds this figure. For example, the largest engine of this form on the U.S. market in model year 2015 is the Toyota 2TR-FE, which is available in the Toyota Tacoma.[6] However, there are some notable exceptions. Porsche used a 3.0 L four in its 944 S2 and 968 sports cars, the Chevrolet Colorado came with a 2.9 L inline four, the International Harvester Scout was available with a 3.2 L inline four from 1965 until 1980 and Rolls-Royce produced several inline-four engines of 2,838 cc with basic cylinder dimensions of 3.5 in (89 mm) diameter and 4.5 in (110 mm) stroke (Rolls-Royce B40). Early vehicles also tended to have engines with larger displacements to develop horsepower and torque. The Model A Ford was built with a 3.3 L inline-four engine.
