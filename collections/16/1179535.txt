When this calculation is done for objects on the surface of the Earth, or aircraft that rotate with the Earth, one has to account for the fact that the Earth is rotating and the centrifugal acceleration has to be subtracted from this. For example, the equation above gives the acceleration at 9.820 m/s2, when GM = 3.986×1014 m3/s2, and R=6.371×106 m. The centripetal radius is r = R cos(latitude), and the centripetal time unit is approximately (day / 2π), reduces this, for r = 5×106 metres, to 9.79379 m/s2, which is closer to the observed value.
