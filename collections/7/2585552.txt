Written by John Lennon although credited to Lennonâ€“McCartney,  it is noted for its slowed-down rhythm track and backwards vocals, both of which were a hint of things to come on Revolver, released two months later. The single's release marked the first time that reversed sounds had appeared in a pop song, although the Beatles used the same technique on the Revolver track "Tomorrow Never Knows", released in August 1966.[2]
