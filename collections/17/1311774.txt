India had a shaky start to the tournament.[12] In their opening match against the Netherlands, they were bowled out for 204 runs. Although they won the game by 79 runs, the team was criticised for failing to bat out their 50 overs.[21] After they were dismissed for 125 runs against Australia and lost the match by nine wickets, angry fans in India burned effigies of the players; Mohammad Kaif's house and Rahul Dravid's car were vandalised.[22][23] India won all the remaining games of the stageâ€”against Zimbabwe, Pakistan, Namibia and England.[17]
