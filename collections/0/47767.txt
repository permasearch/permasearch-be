Determining costs requires keeping records of goods or materials purchased and any discounts on such purchase. In addition, if the goods are modified,[3] the business must determine the costs incurred in modifying the goods. Such modification costs include labor, supplies or additional material, supervision, quality control and use of equipment. Principles for determining costs may be easily stated, but application in practice is often difficult due to a variety of considerations in the allocation of costs.[4]
