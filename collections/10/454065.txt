Another threat to the productivity and ecosystems of upwelling regions is El Ni単o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system, or more specifically El Ni単o events. During the normal period and La Ni単a events, the easterly trade winds are still strong, which continues to drive the process of upwelling. However, during El Ni単o events, trade winds are weaker, causing decreased upwelling in the equatorial regions as the divergence of water north and south of the equator is not as strong or as prevalent. The coastal upwelling zones diminish as well since they are wind driven systems, and the wind is no longer a very strong driving force in these areas. As a result, global upwelling drastically decreases, causing a decrease in productivity as the waters are no longer receiving nutrient-rich water. Without these nutrients, the rest of the trophic pyramid cannot be sustained, and the rich upwelling ecosystem will collapse.[14]
