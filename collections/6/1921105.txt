The song is about an old man who lives in the famed New Orleans French Quarter.  The man is unfazed when told that a hurricane was about to hit the city; even when "a man from Chicago" claims that the levees need to be raised, he claims that the levees will hold and the man will be "on his way to Illinois".[3]
