Palilalia is defined as the repetition of the speaker's words or phrases, often for a varying number of repeats. Repeated units are generally whole sections of words and are larger than a syllable, with words being repeated the most often, followed by phrases, and then syllables or sounds.[2] [3] Palilalic repetitions are often spoken with decreasing volume and speed up over time.[6]
