Sugden's first regular sitcom role was as Mrs Crispin in the sitcom Hugh and I (1962â€“67). This was written by John T. Chapman, and when he became involved with The Liver Birds series, he suggested Sugden for the role of Sandra's mother, Mrs Hutchinson.[3] She appeared in the bulk of the run, from 1971 to 1979. In 1973, she appeared in Son of the Bride.
