McCormick had a sporadic romance with her Brady Bunch co-star Barry Williams during the original series' run. Following the cancellation of The Brady Bunch, McCormick spent years addicted to cocaine and quaaludes, which harmed her career. McCormick later claimed that she sometimes traded sex for drugs, and also had two abortions during her early twenties. She flubbed an audition with Steven Spielberg for a part in Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), arriving for the audition under the influence of cocaine and having not slept for three days. She lost her reputation for reliability as an actress in Hollywood, and one producer threatened that she would never work as an actress again. She also dealt with bouts of depression and bulimia.[2][16]
