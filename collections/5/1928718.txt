Muslim mass immigration to Britain began after World War II, as a result of the destruction and labour shortages caused by the war.[33][34] Muslim migrants from former British colonies, predominantly India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh,[33] were recruited in large numbers by government and businesses to rebuild the country.[35] Large numbers of doctors recruited from India and Pakistan, encouraged by health minister Enoch Powell in the early 1960s, also played a key role in the establishment of the NHS health service.[36]
