Following the announcement of the remastered Variety Map Pack in March 2017, Activision was condemned for deciding that the downloadable content would not be available for free. The most common complaints were that the publisher had already generated additional revenue for Remastered by bundling it with Infinite Warfare (increasing its cost to more than an individual game) and by including microtransactions; and that as a remaster, which often includes all previously-released DLC, the map pack should have been released alongside it at launch. Many also asserted that selling the DLC for a higher price than its original release was an unprincipled move.[72][73][74] Sterling further slated Activision for charging for the DLC, stating that it was "incomprehensible" and that to increase its cost highlighted "just how far [Activision] can mock its customers and get away with it", labeling it as the latest scam to befall the game.[75] Erik Kain of Forbes similarly argued that the DLC should have been available free of charge, maintaining his belief that charging for map packs "[was] a huge mistake".[72] However, in a follow-up article, he felt he could sympathize with Activision, writing that it was easier for them to set price points for early and late buyers. He also noted that the remaster was cheap in its contribution to the overall price for two bundled games and so further costs for the DLC were justified.[76]
