WMV has been the subject of numerous complaints from users and the press. Users dislike the digital rights management system which is sometimes attached to WMV files.[30] The loss of the ability to restore licenses for WMV files in the Windows Media Player 11 was not positively received.[30] In addition, the Microsoft Zune does not support the standard Windows Media DRM system, rendering protected WMV files unplayable.[31]
