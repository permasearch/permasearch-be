In June 1966 Harrison met Shankar at the home of Mrs Angadi of the Asian Music Circle, asked to be his student, and was accepted.[290] Before this meeting, Harrison had recorded his Revolver track "Love You To", contributing a sitar part that Lavezzoli describes as an "astonishing improvement" over "Norwegian Wood" and "the most accomplished performance on sitar by any rock musician".[291] On 6 July, Harrison travelled to India to buy a sitar from Rikhi Ram & Sons in New Delhi.[290] In September, following the Beatles' final tour, he returned to India to study sitar for six weeks with Shankar.[290] He initially stayed in Bombay until fans learned of his arrival, then moved to a houseboat on a remote lake in Kashmir.[290] During this visit, he also received tutelage from Shambhu Das, Shankar's protégé.[292][293]
