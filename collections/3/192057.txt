In 1963, the teenage Brian May and his father custom-built his signature guitar Red Special, which was purposely designed to feedback.[258][259] Sonic experimentation figured heavily in Queen's songs. A distinctive characteristic of Queen's music are the vocal harmonies which are usually composed of the voices of May, Mercury, and Taylor best heard on the studio albums A Night at the Opera and A Day at the Races. Some of the ground work for the development of this sound can be attributed to the producer Roy Thomas Baker and engineer Mike Stone.[260][261] Besides vocal harmonies, Queen were also known for multi-tracking voices to imitate the sound of a large choir through overdubs. For instance, according to Brian May, there are over 180 vocal overdubs in "Bohemian Rhapsody".[262] The band's vocal structures have been compared with the Beach Boys,[247][263] but May stated they were not "much of an influence".[241]
