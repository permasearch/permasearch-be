When the film premiered on network television, a new milder version was created to conform with network broadcast standards. To maintain runtime, a few deleted scenes were restored (including Tony dancing with Doreen to "Disco Duck", Tony running his finger along the cables of the Verrazanoâ€“Narrows Bridge, and Tony's father getting his job back). The last two deleted scenes were included in the 2017 director's cut.
