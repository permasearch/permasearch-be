A music video for "Nobody Speak" was released on August 24, 2016. The video, which has been described as "brutal [and] politically charged",[6] features political representatives in a meeting. The leaders of the groups begin a rap battle against each other, which after around 90 seconds turns into an all-out brawl involving virtually everyone in the meeting room. The video finishes with one leader preparing to impale his counterpart with an American flag.[6][7]
