Many scientific measurements use the Kelvin temperature scale (unit symbol: K), named in honor of the Scottish physicist who first defined it. It is a thermodynamic or absolute temperature scale. Its zero point, 0K, is defined to coincide with the coldest physically-possible temperature (called absolute zero). Its degrees are defined through thermodynamics. The temperature of absolute zero occurs at 0K = −273.15°C (or −459.67°F), and the freezing point of water at sea-level atmospheric pressure occurs at 273.15K = 0°C.
