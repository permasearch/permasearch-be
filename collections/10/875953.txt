Early Canadian governors and administrators were answerable only to British authorities. Even after the formation of elected legislative assemblies, governors and their executive councils did not require the consent of elected legislators in order to govern. It was only in the decades leading up to Canadian Confederation in 1867 that the governing councils of those British North American colonies that had not joined the American Revolution in 1776 became responsible to the elected representatives of the people.[1]
