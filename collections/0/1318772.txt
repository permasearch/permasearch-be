The German government began a propaganda campaign  during World War I to discredit the United Kingdom's currency in India.[26] The Germans convinced Indian citizens that British banknotes in that country could not be redeemed for silver. This led to a run on the British supply of silver.[26] In response, United States Democratic senator Key Pittman of Nevada introduced legislation in 1918 that was intended to offer financial relief to the British government.[27] The bill, passed on April 22, 1918, stated that "sales of silver bullion under authority of this act may be made for the purpose of conserving the existing stock of gold in the United States, of providing silver for subsidiary coinage and for commercial use, and of assisting foreign governments at war with the enemies of the United States".[27] The Pittman Act authorized the U.S. to melt up to 350,000,000 silver dollars,[27] and this commenced immediately after the Act's passage.[27] The U.S. eventually melted a total of 270,232,722 silver dollars.[27] Of that amount, 259,121,554  were sold to the United Kingdom at the cost of one dollar per troy ounce.[27]
