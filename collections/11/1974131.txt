"We All Stand Together" is from the animated film Rupert and the Frog Song and reached number three in the UK Singles Chart in 1984.[1]  The "Frog Chorus" backing on the song was provided by the King's Singers choral group and the choir of St Paul's Cathedral.[2] The 'flute playing frog' was Elena DurÃ¡n. The B-side of the single contains a "Humming Version" of the song performed by McCartney and the Finchley Frogettes.
