From 1970 to 1980, the two teams reigned exclusively as National League East champions, except in 1973, when the New York Mets won the National League pennant.[5][6] The Phillies success under manager Danny Ozark was attributed to a well-rounded lineup with Greg Luzinski and Mike Schmidt leading the team in homers, Steve Carlton and Tug McGraw leading the pitching, and Larry Bowa and Garry Maddox being the secretaries of Philadelphia's defense. The Pirates, under managers Danny Murtaugh and Chuck Tanner, also had tremendous offense led by Roberto Clemente, Willie Stargell, Dave Parker, and Rennie Stennett, catcher Manny Sanguill√©n, infielders Bill Madlock and Phil Garner being the defensive specialists, and Dock Ellis, John Candelaria, Steve Blass and Bob Moose leading the pitching.
