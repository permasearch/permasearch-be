The Surface-series devices feature a Type Cover accessory, an attachable protective keyboard, which is sold separately, yet has continually appeared in every Surface ad since the launch of the original Surface. The Type Cover for Surface Pro 3 features backlit keys, is thinner and has an improved touchpad over its predecessors. It also has a magnetic strip which binds to the front bezel of the display for additional stability. The magnetic strip can also be used to elevate the position of the keyboard, which can help to comfortably use a Type Cover on a lap.[14][34]
