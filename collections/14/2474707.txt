On receiving news of their army's defeat, Henry fled into exile in Scotland with his wife and son. They were later joined by Somerset, Roos, Exeter, and the few Lancastrian nobles who escaped from the battlefield. The Battle of Towton severely reduced the power of the House of Lancaster in England; the linchpins of their power at court (Northumberland, Clifford, Roos, and Dacre) had died or fled the country, ending the house's domination over the north of England.[73] Edward further exploited the situation, naming 14 Lancastrian peers as traitors.[74] Approximately 96 Lancastrians of the rank of knight and below were also attainted—24 of them members of parliament.[75] The new king preferred winning over his enemies to his cause; the nobles he attainted either died in the battle or had refused to submit to him. The estates of a few of these nobles were confiscated by the crown but the rest were untouched, remaining in the care of their families.[74] Edward also pardoned many of those he attainted after they submitted to his rule.[76]
