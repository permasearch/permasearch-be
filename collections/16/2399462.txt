Jirōbō's zanpakutō is Tsunzakigarasu (劈烏, literally "Rending crow"). The shikai command is "flap away" (羽搏きなさい, habatakinasai; "Spread Your Wings" in the English dub). It consists of countless flying curved blades, which he can control using telekinesis. Although the blades move faster than the eye can see, they can be easily destroyed or dodged using Flash Step or other fast-moving techniques.[33]
