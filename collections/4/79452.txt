Most operators of Chinatown bus lines have traditionally been Fujianese.[14] Often, buses do not follow their scheduled timetables,[7] and many buses are often unreliable, sometimes skipping scheduled stops altogether.[23] In addition, since there are no advertisements and often no websites for these bus lines, knowledge of such bus lines is often spread verbally.[4][23]
