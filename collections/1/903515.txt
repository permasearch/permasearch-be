Several months have passed since the events of the first novel. Gregor is determined to never go back to the Underland, but another prophecy by Bartholomew of Sandwich predicts otherwise, and so the Underlanders bring him and his sister back down through an entrance to their world located in Central Park.[9] Once below, Gregor learns of "The Prophecy of Bane", which the Underlanders interpret to mean that he must kill a white rat (the "Bane") of whom they have just received intelligence.[10][11] Historically, enormous white-coated rats have appeared below every few centuries and caused havoc for the humans, so Gregor sails off on an underground lake to hunt the Bane in the Labyrinth.[4]
