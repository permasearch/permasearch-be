For most enterprises deploying and rolling out operating systems remotely, it is worth noting that Windows PE does not have native support for 802.1X. However, support can be added to WinPE 2.1[19] and WinPE 3.0[20] through hotfixes that are available from Microsoft. Although full documentation is not yet available, preliminary documentation for the use of these hotfixes is available via a Microsoft blog.[21]
