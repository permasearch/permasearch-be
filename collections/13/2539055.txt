Again like other auxiliaries, modal verbs undergo inversion with their subject, in forming questions and in the other cases described in the article on subjectâ€“auxiliary inversion: Could you do this?; On no account may you enter. When there is negation, the contraction with n't may undergo inversion as an auxiliary in its own right: Why can't I come in? (or: Why can I not come in?).
