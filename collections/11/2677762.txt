Braxton took a more hands-on approach, co-writing and co-producing a handful of the tracks. One selection on The Heat, titled "Gimme Some", featured a rap verse from TLC star Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes. The album's second single, "Just Be a Man About It", peaked at number 32 on the Hot 100 and number six on the R&B Charts. The third single, "Spanish Guitar", peaked at number 98 on the Hot 100 and number one on the Hot Dance & Club charts. The fourth single, "Maybe", peaked at 74 on the R&B charts. The Heat was certified double platinum in the U.S. and, by 2002, had sold over 4 million copies worldwide.[24][40]
