At the end of the decade the band appeared on the BBC's review of the sixties music scene Pop Go the Sixties, performing "Gimme Shelter", which was broadcast live on 31 December 1969. That following year, the band wanted out of contracts with both Klein and Decca, but still owed them a Jagger/Richards credited single. To get back at the label, and fulfil their final contractual obligation, the band came up with the track "Schoolboy Blues" – deliberately making it as crude as they could in hopes of forcing Decca to keep it "in the vaults."[141] Amid contractual disputes with Klein, they formed their own record company, Rolling Stones Records. Sticky Fingers (UK No. 1; US No. 1), released in March 1971, the band's first album on their own label, featured an elaborate cover design by Andy Warhol.[142] The cover of the album was an Andy Warhol photograph of a man in tight jeans (from the waist down) featuring a functioning zipper. When unzipped, it revealed the subject's underwear, imprinted with a saying – "This Is Not Etc."[142] In some markets, an alternate cover was released due to the zippered cover's offensive nature at the time.[142][143] The Stones' Decca catalogue is currently owned by Klein's ABKCO label.[144][145][146]
