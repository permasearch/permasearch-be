The 20th century saw an increase in worldwide lead exposure levels due to the increased widespread use of the metal.[217] Beginning in the 1920s, lead was added to gasoline to improve its combustion; lead from this exhaust persists today in soil and dust in buildings.[16] Blood lead levels worldwide have been declining sharply since the 1980s, when leaded gasoline began to be phased out.[16] In those countries that have banned lead in solder for food and drink cans and have banned leaded gasoline additives, blood lead levels have fallen sharply since the mid-1980s.[218]
