Coley is a meth addict who was raised by his mother, who was a speed junkie for much of his childhood. Previous attempts at rehab seemed to have started Coley on the path back to sobriety until his mother was found dead in her home a year ago. Since then, Coley has been on a meth-snorting binge, endangering himself and others because of his occupation – a logger. However, Coley is preoccupied with finding burl—a potentially valuable cancerous type growth found on trees. Despite spending months collecting burl, Coley hasn't managed to sell any of it.
