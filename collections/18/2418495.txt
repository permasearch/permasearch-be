"True to Life" pencils are limited to eight colors (or rather, eight color titles such as "Maui Sunset" and "Amazon Rainforest"), in which each pencil has a single tricolor lead. As the color titles are identical to those of the "True to Life" tricolored crayons, their color range is presumably similar or identical.
