Chromebooks ship with Google Chrome OS, an operating system that uses the Linux kernel and the Google Chrome web-browser with an integrated media-player.[25][26] Enabling developer mode allows the installation of Linux distributions on Chromebooks. Crouton is a script that allows the installation of Linux distributions from Chrome OS, and running both operating systems simultaneously.[27] Some Chromebooks include SeaBIOS, which can be turned on to install and boot Linux distributions directly.[28][29] With limited offline capability and a fast boot-time, Chromebooks are primarily designed for use while connected to the Internet[30] and signed in to a Google account.[31] Instead of installing traditional applications such as word processing and instant messaging, users add web apps from the Chrome Web Store.[32] Google claims that a multi-layer security architecture eliminates the need for anti-virus software.[4]
