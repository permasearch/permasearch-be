The critical reaction to this new version of the character was mixed and the character was killed off in the final issue of the short-lived third volume.[1] It was decided that Wally West should return, and the JLA/JSA story "The Lightning Saga" was used to return the character to Earth along with his wife and children, who appear to have aged several years.
