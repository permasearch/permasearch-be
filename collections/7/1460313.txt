Zoolander was never shown in Malaysia, as the film depicts the country as impoverished and dependent upon sweatshops. Malaysia's censorship board deemed it "definitely unsuitable".[8] The film was also banned in neighboring Singapore[9] due to bilateral sensitivities and the movie's excessive drug use.[citation needed] It was subsequently made available in Singapore in 2006,[10] with an NC-16 rating. In the U.S., the film was originally rated R but was later re-rated PG-13 on appeal for sexual content, profanity, and drug references.
