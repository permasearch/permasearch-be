"Blue Collar Man (Long Nights)" is the first single that Styx released from the Pieces of Eight (1978) album. Released in 1978, the single came in two 7" vinyl formats: one with the b-side "Superstars" (a track from The Grand Illusion) and a second single with the instrumental album track "Aku-Aku" as the b-side. Some printings of the single were also issued in a translucent blue vinyl, which are now highly sought after collectors items. As read in a Circus magazine (or the like) of the time, the song was composed by Tommy Shaw after hearing the sound of his motor boat engine when it failed to start. He said it sounded like a good riff to a song. The song reached No. 21 in the United States, and spent two weeks at No. 9 on the Canada RPM Top 100 Singles chart.[1]
