George Gulliver in 1841 drew pictures of platelets[9] using the twin lens (compound) microscope invented in 1830 by Joseph Jackson Lister.[10] This microscope improved resolution sufficiently to make it possible to see platelets for the first time. William Addison in 1842 drew pictures of a platelet-fibrin clot.[11] Lionel Beale in 1864 was the first to publish a drawing showing platelets.[12] Max Schultze in 1865 described what he called "spherules", which he noted were much smaller than red blood cells, occasionally clumped, and were sometimes found in collections of fibrin material.[13] Giulio Bizzozero in 1882 studied the blood of amphibians microscopically in vivo. He named Schultz's spherules (It.) piastrine: little plates.[14][15] William Osler observed them and, in published lectures in 1886, called them a third corpuscle and a blood plaque and described them as a colorless protoplasmic disc.[16] James Wright examined blood smears using the stain named for him, and used the term plates in his 1906 publication[17] but changed to platelets in his 1910 publication[18] which has become the universally accepted term.
