In Tanzania, about 500 older women are murdered each year following accusations against them of witchcraft/or being a witch.[45] Apart from extrajudicial violence, there is also state-sanctioned violence in some jurisdictions. For instance, in Saudi Arabia practicing 'witchcraft and sorcery' is a crime punishable by death and the country has executed people for this crime in 2011, 2012 and 2014.[46][47][48]
