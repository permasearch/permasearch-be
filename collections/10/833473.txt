Those who favoured withdrawal from the European Union – commonly referred to as Brexit – argued that the EU has a democratic deficit and that being a member undermined national sovereignty, while those who favoured membership argued that in a world with many supranational organisations any loss of sovereignty was compensated by the benefits of EU membership.[citation needed] Those who wanted to leave the EU argued that it would allow the UK to better control immigration, thus reducing pressure on public services, housing and jobs; save billions of pounds in EU membership fees; allow the UK to make its own trade deals; and free the UK from EU regulations and bureaucracy that they saw as needless and costly.[citation needed] Those who wanted to remain argued that leaving the EU would risk the UK's prosperity; diminish its influence over world affairs; jeopardise national security by reducing access to common European criminal databases and result in trade barriers between the UK and the EU.[citation needed] In particular, they argued that it would lead to job losses, delays in investment into the UK and risks to business.[74]
