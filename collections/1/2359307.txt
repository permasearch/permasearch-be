Windsor is a city in Ontario and the southernmost city in Canada. It is on the southern shore of the Detroit River, due south and directly across the river from Detroit, Michigan in the United States. Windsor is a major contributor to Canada's automotive industry and has a storied history and a diverse culture. Known as the "Automotive Capital of Canada", Windsor's industrial and manufacturing heritage is responsible for how the city has developed through the years. After a decline in the automotive industry in the years following the Great Recession, a revitalization of the city has taken place with young artists and creatives flocking to popular areas like Walkerville and Ford City.
