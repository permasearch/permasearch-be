In addition to the St Stephen's retail project, a number of other commercial, office and services developments were planned or took place during the first decade of the 21st century. One high-profile project was the £165 million Humber Quays development, built near to the Humber estuary, which gained World Trade Centre status as the World Trade Centre Hull & Humber.[89] Phase 1 of the project includes two office buildings and 51 new apartments.[90] A second phase is expected to include a new 200-bedroom 4-star hotel, a restaurant, and more high-quality office space.[91] The 50-stall indoor Edwardian Trinity Market, a grade II listed building, and Hepworth's arcade were modernised and renovated in the late 2000s.[92][93] The city centre railway station, and adjacent bus terminal were also redeveloped, and were official opened in 2009, as the Hull Paragon Interchange.
