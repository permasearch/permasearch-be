The first recorded match was played on 1 January 1876, against Cambria, a team based in Swansea. The result was a draw, but Llanelli were declared winners as they had grounded the ball defensively fewer times than their opponents.[4] Their second match was against Swansea on 5 February 1876, another draw, played at Felinfoel.
