On November 8, 2016, the Australian streaming service Stan. announced via Twitter that later in the week all episodes would be available to stream for the first time in Australia.[141] All episodes were available from November 11, 2016 with the remastered versions of all episodes on the service featuring HD and Widescreen enhancements.[142] The widescreen offered was cropped from the original 4:3 format negatives, thus resulting in better visual quality than the previously available DVD version, however the top and bottom portions of the frame were cut out to achieve the widescreen aspect ratio.
