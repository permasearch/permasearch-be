Amyloid imaging is likely to be used in conjunction with other markers rather than as an alternative.[287] Volumetric MRI can detect changes in the size of brain regions. Measuring those regions that atrophy during the progress of Alzheimer's disease is showing promise as a diagnostic indicator. It may prove less expensive than other imaging methods currently under study.[288]
