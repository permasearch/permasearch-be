By the end of the day the ANZAC artillery had expended 1,361 18-pounder rounds, 143 howitzer rounds, 1,410 smaller mountain artillery rounds, and 948,000 rifle and machine-gun rounds.[54] Turkish figures are not known, but the attacking Turkish forces had around ten thousand casualties,[55] including three thousand dead.[35][nb 8] The heaviest casualties were amongst the 5th Division, and the least for the relatively inactive 19th Division, which still had over one thousand casualties.[54] Talking about the failed attack, one Turkish soldier described the scene "[c]ountless dead, countless! It was impossible to count."[57] The ANZACs had only 160 killed and 468 wounded.[35][57] Among the Australian dead was Private John Simpson Kirkpatrick, whose exploits in the campaign earned him a place in Australian folklore as "the Man with the Donkey".[58][59]
