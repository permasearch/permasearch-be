The "War in the North" began in mid-March,[204] with the Biscay Campaign.[205] The Basques suffered most from the lack of a suitable air force.[206] On 26 April, the Condor Legion bombed the town of Guernica, killing 200â€“300 and causing significant damage. The destruction had a significant effect on international opinion.[207] The Basques retreated.[208]
