The Under Armour High School All-America Game is a high school football all-star game typically held in early January in the U.S. state of Florida created to spotlight the nationâ€™s top high school seniors. The game was first played on January 5, 2008, and has been played annually at the Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida. The game is sponsored by Under Armour and enjoys a national audience thanks to broadcast partner ESPN (the first edition was broadcast on ABC opposite the U.S. Army All-American Bowl). The game is co-owned by Chicago-based sports marketing agency Intersport and ESPN.
