The classic tarte tatin was set as the signature challenge. The tarte tatin may be sweet or savoury, and should be finished in two and half hours. Baking a treacle tart was set as the technical challenge by Mary, with the requirement that the pastry lattice on top be woven. The bakers were given two hours for the challenge. For the showstopper, the bakers were required to make in three hours a large designer fruit tart fit for a window display.
