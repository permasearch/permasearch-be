The narrative of Acts begins after Jesusâ€™ crucifixion and resurrection. The resurrected Jesus directed his disciples to wait in Jerusalem for the baptism in the Holy Spirit and promised, "you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth".[22] After his ascension, he was given authority to pour out the Holy Spirit.[12]
