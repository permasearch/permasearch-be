Note: The 500 MB Monthly Plan does not Carry-over the MB on the next month, i.e., if the SafeLink customer does not use all of his/her MB's in first month, in the second month he/she will lose those remaining MB's being renewed by the next 500 MB monthly data . Safe Link does offer optional Tracfone Airtime Card Compatibility and Promotions for Free Bonus Minutes. These options allow Safe Link users to add more minutes anytime and for use after their allotted plan expires for the month.
