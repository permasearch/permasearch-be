The 1980s version premiered on April 8, 2007, replacing the American Top 40 Flashback reruns. The shows are available in either their full original four-hour format, or an abbreviated three-hour version that omits the first hour of the show. To date, the latest program to air as part of the "AT40: The 80s" package has been August 6, 1988 â€“ Kasem's last show with the original program. Due to the rights to Shadoe Stevens-era episodes being held by Cumulus Media, no programs from August 13, 1988 to 1995 have been re-aired as part of this or any similar block.
