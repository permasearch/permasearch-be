Dust is a Chimæra from the planet Lorien. He was captured in Dulce by the Mogadorians using him as a test subject to find a way to get his shapeshifting genes into the Mogs' vatborn. Dust finds Adam and Rex in the desert of Dulce by the watchtower looking over the base. He starts to get friendly with Adam but has a hatred for Rex, keeping an eye on him to protect Adam. He travels with the two to Plum Island and fights the Mogadorians and helps Adam free the other Chimæra. Now he is traveling with Adam to Chicago to help Sam, Malcolm and the Garde in the fight with the Mogadorians. Dust went with Adam, Six, and Marina/Seven to New Mexico, to the Sanctuary and stayed outside to keep any more Mogadorians from interrupting.
