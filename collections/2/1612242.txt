The IAAF considers marks set at high altitude as acceptable for record consideration. However, high altitude can significantly assist sprint performances.[13] One estimate suggests times in the 200m sprint can be assisted by between 0.09 s and 0.14 s with the maximum allowable tailing wind of (2.0Â m/s), and gain 0.3 s at altitudes over 2000 m.[14] For this reason, unofficial low-altitude record lists have been compiled.
