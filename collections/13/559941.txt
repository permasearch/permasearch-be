For the second time in his career, Costa was an unused substitute as Atlético won the UEFA Super Cup on 1 September 2012.[53] That December, Costa was involved in several on-field altercations in two separate matches. The first was in a 0–2 local derby loss against Real Madrid where he avoided disciplinary action after spitting incidents between him and Sergio Ramos.[54] He was sent off in the following game at Viktoria Plzeň in the UEFA Europa League for headbutting opponent David Limberský, and was handed a four-match ban by UEFA.[55][56] This, however, did not deter coach Diego Simeone from continuing to start him, and he responded by netting three goals in two home contests, against Deportivo de La Coruña in the league (6–0)[57] and Getafe in the season's Copa del Rey (3–0).[58]
