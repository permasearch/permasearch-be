The state of Nebraska has at least two lighthouses which were first lit in 1939. There is no evidence though that either were used for navigational purposes as the state has no large bodies of water that would require the need. Linoma Lighthouse is located on a privately owned recreation area which was developed around an artificial lake, while Lake Minatare Lighthouse was "built to simulate a lighthouse". Also of note is a faux lighthouse called Rock Garden Lighthouse (not listed below) which is located in Kearney. [6] [7]
