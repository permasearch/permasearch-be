Probationary drivers must drive with a zero BAC, and are not permitted to drive 'high powered vehicles' (formerly those powered at more than 125Â kW/tonne or 3.5 litres/tonne; now all petrol turbocharged and supercharged cars and any car of more than 6 cylinders, refer below). If the driver was tested in an automatic vehicle, the driver will have an "A" condition applied to their licence and are not permitted to drive a manual transmission vehicle. The "A" condition can be lifted anytime during the probationary period(s) by taking the practical drive test in a manual transmission vehicle.
