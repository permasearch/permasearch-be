The long-term health impacts of e-cigarette use are unknown.[13] The long-term health impacts of the main chemicals nicotine and propylene glycol in the aerosol are not fully understood.[99] There is limited peer-reviewed data about the toxicity of e-cigarettes for a complete toxicological evaluation,[100] and their cytotoxicity is unknown.[15] The chemicals and toxicants included in e-cigarettes have not been completely disclosed and their safety is not guaranteed.[34] They are similar in toxicity to other nicotine replacement products,[101] but e-cigarettes manufacturing standards are variable standards, and many as a result are probably more toxic than nicotine replacement products.[102] The UK National Health Service noted that the toxic chemicals found by the FDA were at levels one-thousandth that of cigarette smoke, and that while there is no certainty that these small traces are harmless, initial test results are reassuring.[103] While there is variability in the ingredients and concentrations of ingredients in e-cigarette liquids, tobacco smoke contains thousands of chemicals, most of which are not understood and many of which are known to be harmful.[36]
