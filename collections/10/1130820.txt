In 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration proposed several simultaneous improvements to nutrition labeling for the first time in over 20 years.[35][36] The proposed changes were based on trends of consumption of nutrients of public health importance.[37] However, studies had shown that the majority of the U.S. population could not understand the information in the then current Nutrition Facts Label.[38] Nutrition label numeracy is particularly low in older individuals, of black and Hispanic race/ethnicity, who are unemployed, born outside of the US, have lower English proficiency, lower education achievement, lower income, or live in the South.[39]
