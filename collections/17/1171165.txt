Kenneth Baker (ケネス・ベイカー) is the president of the arms industry company ArmsTech that takes part in Metal Gear REX's project with the DARPA chief Donald Anderson as part of the United States' black budget. In Metal Gear Solid, he is taken prisoner by FOXHOUND,[80] and tortured by Revolver Ocelot then rescued by Solid Snake. After he gives away his detonation code to Ocelot, Snake is unable to rescue him before as he is killed by the FoxDie virus.[77] He is the first person to realize that FoxDie exists and nearly tells the truth about Snake's mission, but succumbs to the virus before he can finish his sentence. Kenneth Baker is voiced by Yuzuru Fujimoto in the Japanese version. In the English translation, Kenneth Baker is voiced by Allan Lurie (in Metal Gear Solid) and by Peter Renaday (in Metal Gear Solid: Digital Graphic Novel).
