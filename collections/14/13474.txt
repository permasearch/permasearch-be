The Jiuzhang suanshu was perhaps the most groundbreaking of the three surviving Han treatises. It is the first known book to feature negative numbers, along with the Bakhshali manuscript (200 CE? – 600 CE?) of India and the book of the Greek mathematician Diophantus (fl. 3rd century) written in about 275 CE.[87] Negative numbers appeared as black counting rods, while positive numbers appeared as red counting rods.[88] Although the decimal system existed in China since the Shang dynasty (c. 1600 – c. 1050 BCE), the earliest evidence of a decimal fraction (i.e. the denominator is a power of ten) is an inscription on a standard volume-measuring vessel dated 5 CE and used by the mathematician and astronomer Liu Xin (46 BCE – 23 CE).[89] Yet the first book to feature decimal fractions was the Jiuzhang suanshu, as a means to solve equations and represent measurements.[89] Gaussian elimination, an algorithm used to solve linear equations, was known as the Array Rule in the Jiuzhang suanshu.[90] While the book used continued fractions to find the roots of equations, Liu Hui built on this idea in the 3rd century when he increased the decimals to find the cube root of 1,860,867 (yielding the answer 123), the same method used in the Horner scheme named after William George Horner (1786–1837).[91]
