The first Test following World War Two was played at Carisbrook, Dunedin between Australia and New Zealand in 1946, which New Zealand won 31–8. Australia did not win on the three match tour; beaten 20–0 by New Zealand Maori, and then losing 14–10 to the All Blacks the following week. The 1949 tour witnessed an infamous All Blacks record – the loss of two Test matches on the same day. This was made possible because New Zealand's first team (and best 30 players) were touring South Africa at the same time. On the afternoon of 3 September New Zealand captained by J. B. (Johnny) Smith was beaten 11–6 by The Wallabies in Wellington.[7] On 23 September New Zealand also lost their second Test, 16–9, which gave the Wallabies the Bledisloe Cup for the first time.
