UEFA head of communications William Gaillard, when talking about the matter in 2006, said that chants related to the IRA were not sectarian, and was a nationalist issue â€“ similar to fans of other clubs, such as FC Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao, who support nationalist movements in their own countries. He also stated that only in Balkan countries, where some fans show support for organisations that had engaged in ethnic cleansing, was the situation different because these organisations were by their nature discriminatory. He said that this did not apply to the Irish Republican Army (IRA).[8] Former Celtic manager David Hay has called for singing of IRA anthems to be banned,[9] while former Celtic manager Neil Lennon has also said that the chants "embarrass" the club.[10]
