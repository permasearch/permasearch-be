Earning over ₹1.35 billion (equivalent to ₹6.3 billion or US$94 million in 2017) worldwide, Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! became the highest-grossing Bollywood film. It contributed to a change in the Indian film industry, with new methods of distribution and a turn towards less violent stories. It was the first Hindi film to gross over ₹1 billion, and when adjusted for inflation, is the highest grossing Hindi film of the 1990s and also still one of the highest-earning Bollywood films ever. Box Office India described it as "the biggest blockbuster of the modern era."[5] The film was also dubbed into the Telugu language and released with the title Premalayam.[6] The 14-song soundtrack, an unusually large number, is also one of the most popular in Bollywood history, with popular singer Lata Mangeshkar lending her voice for 11 of the 14 songs in the film.
