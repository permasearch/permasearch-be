Prior to development of the series, Seinfeld was told by leading social network advisers, including those at Facebook and Yahoo, that a show length exceeding five minutes had little chance of success on the web.[7] Howard Schultz, coffee magnate and Chairman of Starbucks, turned down the opportunity to sponsor the show.[7] Acura eventually sponsored the show, giving Seinfeld creative license with creating the commercials and product placements.[7]
