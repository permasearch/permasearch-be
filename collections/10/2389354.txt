For JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Araki wanted to use a classical method as a base and then introduce modern elements in the singular. As an example, he often draws in a realistic style but then uses surreal colors. Araki has been aiming to draw real spirits in JoJo resulting in him going to the Kappa River in T≈çno, Iwate, to get a better understanding of the concept.[4] Araki claims getting inspiration from the art of the 1980s, shading techniques in Western art, and classical paintings; the manga coloring is based on calculations rather than consistency, with Araki citing artists like Paul Gauguin as inspiration.[2] He also claims mystery is the central theme of the manga, as he was fascinated by it as a child. Furthermore, Araki wanted to explore superpowers and energy in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure resulting in various concepts such as the Hamon and the Stands.[2] He said that the supernatural basis of the fights in his series evened the battlefield for women and children to match up against strong men.[5] For Stardust Crusaders in particular, Araki was influenced by role-playing games in designing the characters' skills.[2]
