The Applegate-Lassen Cutoff or Applegate Trail (est. 1846–48) left the California Trail near the modern-day Rye Patch Reservoir in what is now called Lassen's meadow on the Humboldt River in Nevada.[120] The trail headed northwest until it could pass north of the worst of the California Sierra Nevada mountains.[121] The trail passed through Rabbithole springs, crossed the Black Rock Desert and High Rock Canyon before finally (after nearly 100 miles (160 km) of desert travel) arriving at Surprise Valley and climbing steeply to go over 6,300 feet (1,900 m) Fandango Pass. From there, travelers faced a descent down a very steep hill to Fandango Valley on the shores of Goose Lake on the Oregon-California border. Just south of Goose Lake the combined Oregon-California trail split at Davis Creek. The Applegate Trail branch proceeded northwest into southeastern Oregon along the Lost River before turning almost due north roughly along the route of today's Interstate 5 to go the Willamette Valley in Oregon.
