The New Zealand Defence Force—staging their largest-ever operation on New Zealand soil[144]— provided logistics, equipment, transport, airbridges, evacuations, supply and equipment shipments, survey of the Port and harbour, and support to the agencies, including meals; they assisted the Police with security, and provided humanitarian aid particularly to Lyttelton, which was isolated from the city in the first days.[145] Over 1400 Army, Navy and Air Force personnel were involved,[146] and Territorials (Army Reserve) were called up.[147] They were supplemented by 116 soldiers from the Singapore Army, in Christchurch for a training exercise at the time of the earthquake, who assisted in the cordon of the city.[135][148]
