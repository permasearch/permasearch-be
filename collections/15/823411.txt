The theme music that accompanies the title sequence was composed by Ramin Djawadi.[17] The production team showed the title sequence they were working on to Djawadi, who was then inspired to create the music for the Game of Thrones Theme, and finished the theme music three days later.[18][7] Djawadi said the show runners Benioff and Weiss wanted the theme music to be about a journey that reflects the variety of locations and characters in the show.[19]
