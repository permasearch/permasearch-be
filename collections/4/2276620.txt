There has been English-speaking settlement or immigration to some degree in almost all areas of Quebec at one time or another. What remains today in many regions is only symbolic as anglophones have moved away or assimilated into the French-speaking community. English-speaking communities in the Gasp√© Peninsula and the Lower North Shore remain, as well as a small community in the Magdalen Islands.
