Malaysia Airlines Flight 370  was a scheduled international passenger flight operated by Malaysia Airlines that disappeared on 8 March 2014 while flying from Kuala Lumpur International Airport, Malaysia, to its destination, Beijing Capital International Airport in China.[1] Commonly referred to as "MH370", "Flight 370" or "Flight MH370", the flight was also marketed as China Southern Airlines Flight 748 (CZ748/CSN748) through a codeshare,[1]  The crew of the Boeing 777-200ER aircraft last made contact with air traffic control (ATC) around 38 minutes after takeoff when the flight was over the South China Sea. The aircraft was lost from ATC radar screens minutes later, but was tracked by military radar for another hour, deviating westwards from its planned flight path, crossing the Malay Peninsula and Andaman Sea. It left radar range 200 nautical miles (370 km) northwest of Penang Island in northwestern Malaysia. With all 227 passengers and 12 crew on board presumed dead, the disappearance of Flight 370 was the deadliest incident involving a Boeing 777 and the deadliest incident in Malaysia Airlines' history, until it was surpassed in both regards by Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 four months later. The combined loss led to significant financial problems for Malaysia Airlines, which was renationalised by the Malaysian government in late 2014.
