To use a bicycle, a user presses the black button near the bottom labeled "Scan & Ride" (扫码开锁), which brings up a QR-code scanning interface, which requires the user to place the QR-code of a bicycle into the scanning area, after which the software will produce a low-toned beep to indicate a success in scanning the code. After a successful scan a progress bar will appear on the screen, indicating the "Progression of unlocking". With a successful unlock, the electronic lock on the bike will produce three short beeps followed by the characteristic "Tuck" sound generated by the lock opening. In the app, the progress bar fills to 100%, and the notice "开锁成功" (Unlock successful) appears for a short period before getting replaced by the rental timing interface. This interface also records the distance traveled, time spent, energy the user spent using the vehicles (in kCals), and an orange banner indicating the number of the bike and the estimated cost of using the bike. The first three stats shown on the interface will be added to the total value on the user page, while the cost will be deducted from the user's account. If several seconds elapse after the bar fills to 98% without starting the trip in the app, an error will be reported to the user asking them to try again or change to another bicycle.
