The character's return for the third season happened in "Blood is the New Black", when the Liars have reason to believe that Jenna is faking her blidness when Toby stumbles upon prescription eye drops dated after Jenna's eye surgery.[16] To test this theory, the Liars planted an earring in the girls' bathroom at school and remained hidden in the stalls. Jenna is proven to be faking her blindness when she picks up and examines the earring.[16] The girls decided to keep quiet about this newfound knowledge so that they could possibly use Jenna's secret against her.[16]
