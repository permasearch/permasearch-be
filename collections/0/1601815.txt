Athens at the beginning of its existence was ruled by a king and a very small group of people called Archons.  They made the decisions and served life.  Slowly things began to change as the group which was in power widened, included more people, and they did not serve for a lifetime.  Things radically changed when Draco implemented his reforms which made it so that any male who could afford full armor could participate in politics.  This greatly changed the court as now “common men” could serve on it and could bring forth a case if their rights had been violated.  Solon also brought about reforms, and he kept the Council the ruling body at the time of politics and judicial matters, with four hundred members, a hundred from each tribe.  The Council was the most powerful organization and would remain so until after the Persian invasion and more reforms did away with most of the power of the Council.  There was further turmoil, however, as people tried to seize power until Cleisthenes made ten tribes where each would send fifty members to the council.  Each tribe had no links to the others.  After the Persian invasion the Council of Areopagus, still composed of the very wealthy, slowly lost power and the law courts were established as they took over many of the jobs the Council had exercised.[7] These law courts consisted of many jurors who were male and over the age of thirty; most of which were farmers.[8]  The amount was different for each trial but was around several hundred to several thousand.[9][10]  This was to prevent corruption as the belief was that no one would be able to bribe several hundred jurors.   They had an odd amount of jurors to prevent a tie and the jurors were picked by lot.[11]
