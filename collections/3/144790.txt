Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, saying: "Dead Men works well enough as a stand-alone, swashbuckling comedic spectacle, thanks to the terrific performances, some ingenious practical effects, impressive CGI and a steady diet of PG-13 dialogue peppered with not particularly sophisticated but (I have to admit) fairly funny sexual innuendo."[197] Pete Hammond of Deadline.com praised the film, calling it "the most entertaining installment," giving credit to Directors RÃ¸nning and Sandberg for creating a "rollicking good time". He praised the visual effects, particularly Salazar and his crew, arguing that it should be in line to receive an Academy Award for Visual Effects. He also gave high praise to Bardem for being able to create such a "fully dimensional villain" under the layers of make-up and CGI, as well as Depp for keeping the film and franchise going.[198] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a 'B', praising the fun nature of the film as well as its visuals, calling it "gorgeously detailed swashbuckling nonsense," but wished that the script had taken more risks instead of following the formula used in previous films.[199] Ashley Esqueda of CNET gave the film a positive review, arguing it brought the franchise back to what made its first two installments so fun, and praised Depp's performance as "delightful as ever."[200] Brian Truitt of USA Today gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, saying "What was once a past-its-prime franchise seems to have found new life."[201] Mark Hughes of Forbes opined "Dead Men Tell No Tales isn't as good as the first three films, but it's better than the fourth film", adding "it has mostly good performances, and a couple of great ones. It has fantastic visual effects, lots of humor that works, a lighthearted feel and sense of fun, and many terrific action set pieces to make your eyeballs pop out."[202]
