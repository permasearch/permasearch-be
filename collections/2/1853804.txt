Total water flow in the Murray–Darling basin 1885 to the present has averaged around 24,000 gigalitres (24,000 hm3; 19,000,000 acre⋅ft) per year. This is the lowest rate of the world's major river systems.[1] About 6.0 percent of Australia's total rainwater falls into the basin.[7] In most years only half of this quantity reaches the sea and in dry years much less. Estimated total annual flows for the basin have ranged from 5,000 gigalitres (5,000 hm3; 4,100,000 acre⋅ft) in 1902 to 57,000 gigalitres (57,000 hm3; 46,000,000 acre⋅ft) in 1956[citation needed]. Despite the magnitude of the basin, the hydrology of the streams within it is quite varied.
