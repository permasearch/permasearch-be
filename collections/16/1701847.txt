Joni is the wife of Robert Preston (Tristan Gemmill). She is furious to discover that he has begun a relationship with his ex-wife Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) behind her back.[35] Harding explained that Joni knew that Robert was not over Tracy, but it still came as a shock to her.[35] She explained, "Joni is a woman on the edge, and she's very vulnerable. While she's angry and feisty, she's also hurting. If you caught your husband cheating, you'd be the same!"[35] Harding added that Joni did not want to be second to Tracy and that there would be "fireworks" between them.[35] Harding's first appearance as Joni received a mixed reaction from viewers.[36]
