Because of the studio attitude toward child actors of the time, Herbert had a keen interest in the child actors of today. "I lost a lot more than the financial things. Financial things are way down the list for me. The way itâ€™s set up in Hollywood is, I did 50 TV shows, the 20 movies, the commercials, all of that stuff... and when I turned 21, zero had been put away in the bank for me. It was not that way for every [kid actor]: If you signed a long-term contract--for instance, if you did Lassie or The Donna Reed Show or something--they put away like 5 percent for you. But if you were not on a long-term contract, ALL of the money you earned for the movies, for ALL the TV things, went to your guardians; and your guardians could do with it whatever they saw fit." The only money put away for Herbert until age 21 from his TV and film earnings was $1,700.[2]
