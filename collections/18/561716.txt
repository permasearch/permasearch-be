De Silva's theory is supported by the legend of Prince Vijaya as told in the Mahavamsa, because if this legend is to be believed, the migration of Indo-Aryan colonists to the Minicoy, Maldives and Sri Lanka from the mainland (India) must have taken place simultaneously. This means that Maldivian and Sinhalese must be "sister languages" that developed from a common Prakrit.[citation needed]
