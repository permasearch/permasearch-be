Anna looks after Miley as Faye ignores her baby daughter. Anna later confronts Faye at school, feeling it is time Faye took responsibility and leaves Miley with Faye after embarrassing her in front of her friends, including Miley's father, Jackson. Faye confronts Tim and Anna about her reasons for not being there for Miley, just as Jackson and his mother, Josie, visit. Josie tells her that Jackson has admitted being Miley's father and they are determined to pull together with Tim and Anna to give Miley a good upbringing. Jackson apologizes to Faye for denying that he got her pregnant and Faye forgives him. Tim later suggests getting Miley christened during a discussion with Anna, Faye and Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor). Faye and Jackson go to the registry office to register Miley's birth legally. The teenage parents argue over Faye naming the baby Miley, as Jackson feels that Miley may be bullied at school for being named after a singer. At Miley's christening, Faye breaks down and tells Tim that she is not ready to be a mother. Seeing that Faye is unable to cope with the responsibility, Greig and Josie suggest that Miley go to live with them. Tim come rounds to the idea, thinking that it would be best for everyone, including Faye but Anna is against the idea. When discussing the idea, Faye admits that she could never hate or blame Miley for recent events but loves her daughter and wants what is best for her. In the end, Miley is collected by Josie, as the Windasses share an emotional farewell. Tim admits to Anna and Faye that they, most likely, will not see Miley again, as the Hodges have emigrated to Canada. Tim and Anna discuss it with Faye and Tim says he will get Miley back, but Faye decides Miley will be better off in Canada.
