Curtis's onstage dancing was often reminiscent of the seizures he experienced,[56] and has been termed by some to be his "epilepsy dance".[57] Throughout Joy Division's live performances in 1979 and 1980, Curtis collapsed several times while performing and had to be carried off stage.[58] To minimise any possibility of Curtis having epileptic seizures,  flashing lights were prohibited at Joy Division gigs; despite these measures, Bernard Sumner later stated that certain percussion effects would cause Curtis to suffer a seizure.[59] In April 1980,[60] Terry Mason was appointed as a minder to ensure Curtis took his prescribed medications, avoided alcohol consumption, and got sufficient sleep.[60]
