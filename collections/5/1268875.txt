Seven also had a constant companion in Isis, who at first appears to be an ordinary cat, but is shown to have great intelligence and in fact turns out to be able to alter its shape to become what appears to be a human female, which Miss Lincoln discovers during one scene as Isis changes shape into a human female and then back into a cat. Though apparently Seven's pet, Isis was more: she communicated with him through a rudimentary telepathy, and understood his spoken words. She accompanied him wherever he went and watched out for him. The one thing that never changed was the collar around her neck. Although Miss Lincoln had earlier tried to foil Seven (thinking him to be a spy), the two begin to work together.
