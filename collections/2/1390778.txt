As Lane Wilcken's Filipino Tattoos Ancient to Modern denotes, there are many similarities between the tattooing traditions of the Philippines and indigenous Polynesian designs â€“ not only with their societal function and similar designs, but in the tools used to hand-tap them on (generally a needle or thorn on a stick, with a hammer to pound it into the skin). While the most common modern term for indigenous tattoos is batok, an ancient Tagalog word for tattoos was tatak, extremely similar to the Samoan word tatau.[citation needed]
