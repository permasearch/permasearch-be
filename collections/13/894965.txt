For certain people taking up an office in their community in the name of the church, a specific "profession of faith" is required, demonstrating that they are in full communion with the Roman Catholic Church, even if they have been members of a separate church whose sacraments the Catholic Church considers to be valid.[17][18] Being "in full communion with the Catholic Church" requires that they "firmly accept" its teaching on faith and morals.[19]
