Tasha defeated Kass in the final round to win immunity for Bayon. Back at Ta Keo, Andrew's alliance confirmed their plan to target Spencer with Ciera as the decoy, but Ciera was frightened that Andrew's true allegiance was with Woo over his original Bayon tribe, and convinced Abi-Maria and Kass to target Woo. Kass decided—though she wanted Spencer gone—that Woo was the more pressing threat, and alerted Spencer to Andrew's plan. At Tribal Council, Abi-Maria, Ciera, and Kass teamed up with Spencer to vote Woo out.
