Many highly ranked Belgian restaurants can be found in the most influential restaurant guides, such as the Michelin Guide.[184] Belgium is famous for beer, chocolate, waffles and french fries with mayonnaise. Contrary to their name, french fries are claimed to have originated in Belgium, although their exact place of origin is uncertain. The national dishes are "steak and fries with salad", and "mussels with fries".[185][186][187][J]
