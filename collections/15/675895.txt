In a format reminiscent of the Amateur Night of the Apollo Theater, New Edition dazzles the crowd. Unfortunately, the judges grant 1st prize to a hip-hop duo, "The Boston Rebels." The crowd booed the decision, chanting for New Edition so loudly that Maurice gives New Edition a studio recording session and a record deal as well. To strengthen the Jackson 5 connection, Maurice encourages making the group a quintet, with Brooke suggesting his nephew Ronnie DeVoe (played as a youth by Myles Truitt) as the fifth member. Ronnie's audition is good enough for the group to accept him, completing the initial five-member formation of New Edition.
