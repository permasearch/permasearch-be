Two pupils at Julian’s and Dick’s school win a scholarship, so that the school gets extra holidays. Because Anne and George have a mid-term break at the same time the Five decide immediately to go for a hike across the countryside. Julian plans to spend their first night at a bed and breakfast called Blue Pond Farm-House, but on the way there Timmy falls into a rabbit burrow and damages his leg. Consequently, Julian goes with George to Mr. Gaston, an expert on horses who also knows about dogs, and Dick and Anne head for Blue Pond Farm-House on their own. Mr and Mrs Gaston insist that Julian and George stay for the work done to Timmy, but the three do eventually reach Blue Pond Farm-House.
