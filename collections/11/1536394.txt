Jupiter has 69 moons with known orbits, of which 60 have confirmed orbits and have thus received permanent designations; of these, 51 have been named. Its eight regular moons are grouped into the planet-sized Galilean moons and the far smaller Amalthea group. They are named after lovers of Zeus, the Greek equivalent of Jupiter. Its 61 known irregular moons are organized into two categories: prograde and retrograde. The prograde satellites consist of the Himalia group and two others in groups of one. The retrograde moons are grouped into the Carme, Ananke and Pasiphae groups, as well as some isolated moons.
