I hope you have not regretted giving me that choice bit of verse for it."[5] Jackson published a review noting that "Success" was "undoubtedly one of the strongest and finest wrought things in the book", but offered that speculation on its authorship would be a wasted effort.[6] Readers believed it was written by Ralph Waldo Emerson.[7]
