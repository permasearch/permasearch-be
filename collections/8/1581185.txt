The song is composed in the key of A minor and has a tempo of 108 beats per minute. The vocal range spans from E3 to E5.[5] Multiple sources have interpreted the song to be about cocaine, including a reference by The Weeknd himself in "Reminder": "I just won a new award for a kids show, Talking 'bout a face numbing off a bag of blow".[6][7][8] Musically, Alice Vincent of The Daily Telegraph characterised as "a synth-laden, upbeat pop song",[7] while Andy Kellman of AllMusic described it as "a sleek slice of retro-modern disco-funk".[9]
