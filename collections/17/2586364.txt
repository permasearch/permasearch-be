The style and nature of the Puja varies from being Vedic, or Puranic, or Tantric, or a combination of these.[102] The Bengali Durga Puja typically combines all three. The non-Bengali Durga Puja tends to be essentially Vedic (srauta) wherein the melodies of Vedic hymns are sung, but it too incorporates esoteric elements making the Puja an example of a Vaidik-Tantric practice.[103]
