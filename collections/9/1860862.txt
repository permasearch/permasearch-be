Shyamalan, who credits the development of the movie to a bedtime story he told his children about what happens in their pool at night,[24] wrote the 72-page children's book Lady in the Water: A Bedtime Story (Little, Brown, New York, ISBNÂ 0-316-01734-5) to coincide with the movie. The book's illustrations were made by Crash McCreery. It was released on the same day as the film, on July 21, 2006.
