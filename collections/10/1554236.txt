The need for building materials and other supplies led Admiral Graves to authorise a loyalist merchant to send his two ships Unity and Polly from Boston to Machias in the District of Maine, escorted by the armed schooner Margaretta under the command of James Moore, a midshipman from Graves' flagship Preston.[12] Moore also carried orders to recover what he could from the wreck of HMSÂ Halifax, which had apparently been run aground in Machias Bay by a patriot pilot in February 1775.[13] After a heated negotiation, the Machias townspeople seized the merchant vessels and the schooner after a short battle in which Moore was killed. Jeremiah O'Brien immediately outfitted one of the three captured vessels[D] with breastwork,[E] armed her with the guns and swivels taken from Margaretta and changed her name to Machias Liberty.[14] In July 1775, Jeremiah O'Brien and Benjamin Foster captured two more British armed schooners, Diligent and Tatamagouche, whose officers had been captured when they came ashore near Bucks Harbour.[15] In August 1775, the Provincial Congress formally recognised their efforts, commissioning both Machias Liberty and Diligent into the Massachusetts Navy, with Jeremiah O'Brien as their commander.[16] The community would be a base for privateering until the war's end.[17]
