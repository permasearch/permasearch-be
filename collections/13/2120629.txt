Coverage – Google Scholar does not publish a list of journals crawled or publishers included, and the frequency of its updates is uncertain. Bibliometric evidence suggests Google Scholar’s coverage of the sciences and social sciences is competitive with other academic databases, however as of 2017 Scholar’s coverage of the arts and humanities has not been investigated empirically and Scholar’s utility for disciplines in these fields remains ambiguous.[28] Especially early on, some publishers did not allow Scholar to crawl their journals. Elsevier journals have been included since mid-2007, when Elsevier began to make most of its ScienceDirect content available to Google Scholar and Google's web search.[29] As of February 2008 the absentees still included the most recent years of the American Chemical Society journals. It is therefore impossible to know how current or exhaustive searches are in Google Scholar, although a recent study[3] estimates that Google Scholar can find almost 90% (approximately 100 million) of all scholarly documents on the Web written in English. Large-scale longitudinal studies have found between 40–60% of scientific articles are available in full text via Google Scholar links.[30]
