In the 1990s, aircraft manufacturers were planning to introduce larger planes than the Boeing 747. In a common effort of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) with manufacturers, airports and its member agencies, the "80-metre box" was created, the airport gates allowing planes up to 80 m (260 ft) wingspan and length to be accommodated.[229] Airbus designed the A380 according to these guidelines,[230][231] and to operate safely on Group V runways and taxiways with a 60 metres (200 ft) loadbearing width.[232] The US FAA initially opposed this,[233][234] then in July 2007, the FAA and EASA agreed to let the A380 operate on 45 m (148 ft) runways without restrictions.[235] The A380-800 is approximately 30% larger in overall size than the 747-400.[236][237] Runway lighting and signage may need changes to provide clearance to the wings and avoid blast damage from the engines. Runways, runway shoulders and taxiway shoulders may be required to be stabilised to reduce the likelihood of foreign object damage caused to (or by) the outboard engines, which are more than 25 m (82 ft) from the centre line of the aircraft,[230][232][238] compared to 21 m (69 ft) for the 747–400,[239] and 747–8.[240]
