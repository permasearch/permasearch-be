Upon loading Photoshop, a sidebar with a variety of tools with multiple image-editing functions appears to the left of the screen. These tools typically fall under the categories of drawing; painting; measuring and navigation; selection; typing; and retouching.[24] Some tools contain a small triangle in the bottom right of the toolbox icon. These can be expanded to reveal similar tools.[25] While newer versions of Photoshop are updated to include new tools and features, several recurring tools that exist in most versions are discussed below.
