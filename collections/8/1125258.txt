The Super Cub has been compared to the Ford Model T, Volkswagen Beetle and the Jeep as an icon of 20th century industry and transport.[14][5][15] The C100 used a pressed steel monocoque chassis, with the horizontal engine placed below the central spine, a configuration now called the 'step through' or 'underbone' motorcycle. By some criteria, the type of motorcycle the Super Cub falls into is difficult to classify, landing somewhere between a scooter and a motorcycle,[11] and sometimes it was called a moped, "step-thru", or scooterette.[6][16][17]
