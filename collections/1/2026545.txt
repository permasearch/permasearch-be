Since September 2011, Frank Maffei and Terranova have presented an hour-long rock'n'roll radio special for London's Covent Garden Radio in the UK. Danny and the Juniors have influenced other groups, including danish punk trio salguod taht ekat ah (usually stylized as salgouD ,taht ekatÂ !AH, and which is "ha take that douglas" backwards), who have cited Danny and the Juniors as an inspiration.
