Holes-in-one ("aces") are also recorded in disc golf. The current world record for disc golf's longest hole in one is held by Brent Bell, who set the record at the 2002 Big Sky State Games at Diamond X Disc Golf Course, revered as one of the most difficult and unique courses in the world, located in Billings, Montana.
