The central belief of classical Pentecostalism is that through the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, sins can be forgiven and humanity reconciled with God.[9] This is the  Gospel or "good news". The fundamental requirement of Pentecostalism is that one be born again.[10] The new birth is received by the grace of God through faith in Christ as Lord and Savior.[11] In being born again, the believer is regenerated, justified, adopted into the family of God, and the Holy Spirit's work of sanctification is initiated.[12]
