Whitney Elizabeth Houston (August 9, 1963 â€“ February 11, 2012) was an American singer, actress, producer, and model. In 2009, Guinness World Records cited her as the most awarded female act of all time.[1] Houston is one of the best-selling music artists of all-time, with 200 million records sold worldwide.[2][3] She released seven studio albums and two soundtrack albums, all of which have diamond, multi-platinum, platinum, or gold certification. Houston's crossover appeal on the popular music charts, as well as her prominence on MTV, starting with her video for "How Will I Know",[4] influenced several African American women artists who follow in her footsteps.[5][6]
