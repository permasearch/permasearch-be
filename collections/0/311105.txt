Goku, Pan, and Majuub enter the 31st World Martial Arts Tournament. Goku is forced to enter the Junior Division, since he is a child again; when he asks Mr. Satan about this, he states it is because of his height, and Pan fights in the Adult Division because she is taller than he is. In reality, he doesn't want Pan to end up fighting Goku, and wants Pan to succeed him as World Champion. Goku makes it to the finals, but is accidentally knocked out of the ring by his opponent after being distracted by Vegeta, and loses. Pan makes it to the semi-finals of the Adult Division, but forfeits because she doesn't want to turn out like her grandpa, Mr. Satan. Majuub makes it to the finals against Mr. Satan, and takes the fight seriously. He is about to win, when Buu, from inside of him, tells him to let Mr. Satan win, as Mr. Satan gives the world hope. He gets knocked out of the ring, and Mr. Satan retains the title of World Champion.
