Caslon 223 and 224 were phototypesetting families designed by Ed Benguiat of Lubalin, Smith, Carnase and then ITC. Like many ITC families, they have an aggressive, advertising-oriented bold structure, not closely related to Caslon's original work.[48] 223 was the first version (named for LSC's street number), a companion version with more body text-oriented proportions followed sequentially numbered 224.[48]
