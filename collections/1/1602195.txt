During Ne Win's isolationist rule (1962â€“88), Yangon's infrastructure deteriorated through poor maintenance and did not keep up with its increasing population. In the 1990s, the current military government's more open market policies attracted domestic and foreign investment, bringing a modicum of modernity to the city's infrastructure. Some inner city residents were forcibly relocated to new satellite towns. Many colonial-period buildings were demolished to make way for high-rise hotels, office buildings, and shopping malls,[17] leading the city government to place about 200 notable colonial-period buildings under the Yangon City Heritage List in 1996.[18] Major building programs have resulted in six new bridges and five new highways linking the city to its industrial back country.[19][20][21] Still, much of Yangon remains without basic municipal services such as 24-hour electricity and regular garbage collection.
