The BIA was implicated in supporting controversial tribal presidents, notably Dick Wilson, who was charged with being authoritarian; using tribal funds for a private paramilitary force, the Guardians of the Oglala Nation (or "GOON squad"), which he employed against opponents; intimidation of voters in the 1974Â election; misappropriation of funds, and other misdeeds.[13] Many native peoples continue to oppose policies of the BIA.  In particular, problems in enforcing treaties, handling records and trust land incomes were disputed.
