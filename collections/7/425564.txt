At the 1987 World Championships in Athletics in Rome, Lewis skipped the 200 m to focus on his strongest event, the long jump, and made sure to take all his attempts. This was not to answer critics from the 1984 long jump controversy; this was because history's second 29 ft long-jumper was in the field: Robert Emmiyan had leaped 8.86 m (29 ft 0​3⁄4 in) at altitude in May, just 4 cm short of Bob Beamon's record.[42] But Emmiyan's best was an 8.53 m (27 ft 11​3⁄4 in) leap that day, second to Lewis's 8.67 m (28 ft 5​1⁄4 in).[43] Lewis cleared 8.60 m (28 ft 2​1⁄2 in) four times. In the 4 × 100 m relay, Lewis anchored the gold-medal team to a time of 37.90 s, the third-fastest of all time.[44]
