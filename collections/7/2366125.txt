Diveroli returned home in March 2001 at the age of sixteen. After an argument with his uncle, he told his father he wanted to open a business specializing in arms, ammunition trading, and defense contracts with the U.S. Government. He convinced his father to sell him a shell company, AEY, Inc., named after the first initials of him and his siblings, which his father had incorporated as a small printing business, but had not done anything with in years.[4] Diveroli showed a penchant for arms dealing and quickly made a name for himself within the industry.[8] His young age and apparent talent led local media outlets to label him as an "arms wunderkind".[12] Diveroli struggled with drug addiction and was also labeled as a "stoner arms dealer" by the media.[8]
