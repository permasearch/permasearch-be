Both Iran and Saudi Arabia have employed different methods to resolve the Israeliâ€“Palestinian conflict. Iran has preferred a confrontational approach, arming and financing proxies such as Hamas and Hezbollah (and lesser proxies such as PIJ and PFLP) to fight Israel. Whereas Saudi Arabia has preferred a diplomatic approach, such as backing Fatah's approach of negotiations with Israel and the Arab Peace Initiative announced in 2002 and re-endorsed in 2007 and 2013 to bring about a comprehensive peace accord with Israel.[96]
