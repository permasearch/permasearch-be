XX Bomber Command was assigned responsibility for Operation Matterhorn, and its ground crew began to leave the United States for India during December 1943.[35][36] The Twentieth Air Force was formed in April 1944 to oversee all B-29 operations. In an unprecedented move, the commander of the USAAF, General Henry H. Arnold, took personal command of this unit and ran it from the Pentagon in Washington, D.C.[37] The 58th Bombardment Wing was XXÂ Bomber Command's main combat unit, and its movement from Kansas to India took place between April and mid-May 1944.[38]
