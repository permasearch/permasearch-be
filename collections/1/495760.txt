Starting in the 1990s, the holiday became increasingly commercialized, with the first Hallmark Card being sold in 1992,[29] and there has been concern about this damaging the holiday's values.[30] The holiday also saw a greater public recognition as the first Kwanzaa stamp, designed by Synthia Saint James, was issued by the United States Post Office in 1997, and in the same year Bill Clinton gave the first presidential declaration marking the holiday.[31][32]
