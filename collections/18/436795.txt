The 1992 NASA-sponsored Near-Earth-Object Interception Workshop hosted by Los Alamos National Laboratory evaluated issues involved in intercepting celestial objects that could hit Earth.[6] In a 1992 report to NASA,[7] a coordinated Spaceguard Survey was recommended to discover, verify and provide follow-up observations for Earth-crossing asteroids. This survey was expected to discover 90% of these objects larger than one kilometer within 25 years. Three years later, another NASA report[8] recommended search surveys that would discover 60â€“70% of short-period, near-Earth objects larger than one kilometer within ten years and obtain 90% completeness within five more years.
