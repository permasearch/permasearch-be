The premiere date for the second half of the fifth series was confirmed on 18 August, with broadcast set for 30 August. This half series is expected to contain eighteen episodes; despite only eight episodes airing initially, and the DCBL twitter page confirming that the series had ended on 17 October, with a new series confirmed for 2018.[citation needed] However, after just two weeks off air, DCBL made the surprise announcement that the series was to return to screens on 8 November, replacing a previously listed episode of Big Family Values in the schedules.[citation needed] New agent Mitchell Starr made his debut during this series[citation needed], with Aron Graves, having previously appeared as a guest in the first half of the series, returning as recurring cast member. Otherwise, the cast remains unchanged from the first half of the series.
