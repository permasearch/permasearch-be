Emily becomes upset when, shortly after moving out, Rory accepts money from her father to pay for Yale. Lorelai forces Emily, Richard, and Rory to attempt to work things out in episode 6.13 "Friday Night's Alright for Fighting". Somewhat comically, one fight between Emily and Rory leads to a snowball effect in which the entire family argues about years of unresolved issues, and as a result, Rory and Lorelai resume Friday night dinners to mend fences. Things remain tense for some time between Emily, Lorelai, and Rory, but they eventually reconcile. When the series ends and Rory goes off to begin a reporting career, Emily believes that their weekly dinners will end since Lorelai and Rory no longer need monetary support. However, much to her surprise, Lorelai agrees to continue going to dinner every Friday night, saying she's gotten used to it.
