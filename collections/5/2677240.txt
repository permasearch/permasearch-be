Stress factors in a cuvette reduces the expected measurement and possibly causes errors. Errors in the spectrophotometer such as light distribution can occur when light hits a scratched cuvette. A rubber or plastic rack protects the cuvette from accidentally hitting and being scratched by the machine casing. The type of solvent used, temperature, and the wavelength of the light affect the measurement at different levels of light transmitted through the cuvette.[17]
