Farren and Paul learned that Andy was released from the hospital the next day. Lauren visited Andy and then ran into Paul at the hospital. Andy was greeted by his friends upon his release. Farren consoled Paul after his unexpected meeting with Shawn Garrett and Lauren. Farren called Paul for help when she was having plumbing problems. Andy confided in Paul that he thought Farren was holding something back. He wondered if another man could be the reason. Farren invited Paul over for dinner with her and Andy. Farren was intrigued when she caught a glimpse of woman posing in a magazine ad. Amy then filled Farren in that the woman was Diane, who asked Farren about her intentions regarding Andy because it seemed she was not entirely over her ex-husband. Andy's love life became far more complicated with Farren being jealous of Diane. While Farren was waiting at home, Andy was at Diane's and they kissed. Meanwhile, Andy assured Farren that he was trying to get information on her past. Lauren shared her doubts about Farren with Andy. She wasn't convinced that Farren really didn't remember her past and thought she might have been faking her amnesia. Diane told Lauren that she was giving in and leaving town because Andy and Farren were rock solid. Lauren said she could convince her otherwise. Later on, Andy asked for Lauren's help to dig into Farren's past. Andy and Lauren arrived in Minneapolis to delve into what little information they had on Farren's past. They questioned a doctor who first treated Farren when she wound up in the city. Andy and Lauren arrived at the police station where Farren had an accident. They learned that Farren's car was burned out completely leaving no traces about its origin or owner. There were also no missing person reports matching Farren's description so the police had to close the unsolved case. The only clue they gained was that Farren did not appear to come from the Minneapolis area.
