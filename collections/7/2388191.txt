The Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes, founded in 2000 and restructured in September 2009, consists of OECD countries and other jurisdictions that agreed to implement tax related transparency and information exchange.[3] It addresses tax evasion, tax havens, offshore financial centres, tax information exchange agreements, double taxation and money laundering. The forum works under the auspices of the OECD and G20. In 2000 it published a blacklist of 35 tax havens, which by 2009 had shrunk to zero. It has since focused on increasing the standard for information exchange. As of January 2018, the Forum had 147 member tax jurisdictions and the European Union.[4]
