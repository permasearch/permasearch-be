Initially, all games in the International Series were held in London. Wembley Stadium was the exclusive home stadium for International Series games from 2007 to 2015 and will continue to host NFL games through at least 2020; beginning in 2016, the series began expanding to more stadiums, first to Twickenham Stadium, London (2016–18) and to Estadio Azteca, Mexico City (2016–) and will eventually expand to the still under construction new stadium at Northumberland Park also in London (2018–27), with possible future plans to expand the series to Germany and/or Canada.[1][2]
