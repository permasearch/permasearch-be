The new Traverse gains some new technology, some of which is currently available on other models such as the Chevrolet Equinox, Chevrolet Tahoe, and Chevrolet Suburban. Some of this technology includes: a hands-free power tailgate, the latest-generation Chevrolet MyLink infotainment systems with standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a power-folding 60/40 split third-row rear bench seat, and standard keyless access with push-button start.
