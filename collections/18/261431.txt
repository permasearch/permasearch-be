Coastal areas of Canada's westernmost province British Columbia was under a tsunami advisory, and this was the most alarming advisory as the earthquake occurred during the same time as the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.[131] No large wave was expected to strike British Columbia, but strong local ocean currents combined with a wave put low-lying coastal regions at risk of flooding.[131] The first wave was expected to reach southern British Columbia at 15:11Â local time.[131] Residents were advised to avoid beaches, harbours and marinas.[132]
