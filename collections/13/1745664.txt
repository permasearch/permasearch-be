The Los Angeles Times said that the "songs and dances are not mere interludes inserted in the action, bringing it to a halt—a Bollywood trademark—but are fully integrated into the plot and marked by expressive, dynamic singing and dancing that infuse a historical drama with energy and immediacy."[2] A review of the tracks suggests that "the music is true to the time period (the British Raj)".[3] Another review said: "A. R. Rahman is again at his prodigious best. His score for Aamir Khan's period drama Lagaan is a delectable blend of Indian classical music, folk melodies and jazzy snazzy tunes."[4] The reviewer of Screen India said, "Great music, heard after a long time, which elevates your senses. That Rahman's among the best is proved here."[5] The soundtrack was ranked No. 44 on Amazon.com's "The 100 Greatest World Music Albums of All Time".[6][7] The soundtrack won 3 National Film Awards in three categories. A. R. Rahman won the award for the best music, Udit Narayan won the Best Male Playback Singer Award for "Mitwa" and Javed Akhtar won the Best Lyrics Award for "Ghanan Ghanan" and "Radha Kaise Na Jale".[8] Lagaan also became the biggest audio hit of the year by topping the music charts and selling 3.5 million records within a year.[9] According to the Indian trade website Box Office India, with around 28,00,000 units sold, this film's soundtrack album was the year's fourth highest-selling.[10]
