Despite the failure of Schock's own single version of "Ain't No Way to Treat a Lady" – and also that of a concurrent cover by a group named LAX – the song gained a reasonably high-profile via its inclusion on the 1974 album One Hell of a Woman by Vikki Carr. In 1975, Helen Reddy recorded "Ain't No Way to Treat a Lady" for an album which was entitled No Way to Treat a Lady. Personnel on Reddy's album included guitarist Lee Ritenour.
