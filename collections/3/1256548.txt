Ethan was Charlie Brown's bunk mate. He first appeared on July 14, 1993. He made an Indian arrow in art class, but it was not a weapon. The next day, he says that when he grows up, he wants to be a newspaper columnist, because he has strong opinions about everything. As an example, he says that the shirt Charlie Brown is wearing is stupid.
