The main location for the Perlmans' residence was an uninhabited 17th-century mansion in Moscazzano.[8] The director initially wanted to buy the house but could not afford it, so he made a film at the place instead.[78][20] Six weeks before production, the crew—including production designer Samuel Dehors and first-time set decorator Violante Visconti di Modrone—gradually decorated the house with furniture, objects, and decoration inspired by the characters.[78][8] Much of the furniture, including the dishes and glassware from the '50s, belonged to Guadagnino and Visconti's parents. "That made it cozy and personal," Visconti said, "I wanted to give it the sense of time passing by."[79]
