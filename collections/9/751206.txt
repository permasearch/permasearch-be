These derivatives are also derived in the section titled "Parameter estimation", "Maximum likelihood", "Two unknown parameters," and plots of the log likelihood function are also shown in that section. The section titled "Geometric variance and covariance" contains plots and further discussion of the Fisher information matrix components: the log geometric variances and log geometric covariance as a function of the shape parameters α and β. The section titled "Other moments", "Moments of transformed random variables", "Moments of logarithmically transformed random variables" contains formulas for moments of logarithmically transformed random variables. Images for the Fisher information components        I    α , α   ,    I    β , β     {\displaystyle {\mathcal {I}}_{\alpha ,\alpha },{\mathcal {I}}_{\beta ,\beta }}   and        I    α , β     {\displaystyle {\mathcal {I}}_{\alpha ,\beta }}   are shown in the section titled "Geometric variance".
