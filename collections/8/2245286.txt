In 2018, Nicholas Parsons was unable to attend the recording of two editions of the programme as he had the flu. This broke his uninterrupted run of fifty years as a performer on the programme. The episodes were recorded with Gyles Brandreth standing in for Parsons and were broadcast on 4 and 11 June 2018.[10]
