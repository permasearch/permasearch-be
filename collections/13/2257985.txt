The American Jewish community includes African American Jews and other American Jews of African descent, a definition which excludes North African Jewish Americans, who are classed as white. Estimates of the number of American Jews of African descent in the United States range from 20,000[90] to 200,000.[91] Jews of African descent belong to all of American Jewish denominations. Like their white Jewish counterparts, some black Jews are atheists.
