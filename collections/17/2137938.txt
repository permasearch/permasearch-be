Estimates of when the peak population of mustangs occurred and total numbers vary widely between sources. No comprehensive census of feral horse numbers was ever performed until the time of the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 and any earlier estimates, particularly prior to the 20th century, are speculative.[63] Some sources simply state that "millions" of mustangs once roamed western North America.[64][65] In 1959, geographer Tom L. McKnight[j] suggested that the population peaked in the late 1700s or early 1800s, and the "best guesses apparently lie between two and five million".[54] Historian J. Frank Dobie hypothesized that the population peaked around the end of the Mexicanâ€“American War in 1848, stating, "My own guess is that at no time were there more than a million mustangs in Texas and no more than a million others scattered over the remainder of the West."[67] J. Edward de Steiguer[k] questioned Dobie's lower guess as still being too high.[69]
