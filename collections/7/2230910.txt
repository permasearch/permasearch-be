The Beatles hated the tour, partly due to the controversy and adverse reaction from Lennon's comments, and were unhappy about Epstein continuing to organise live performances that were increasingly at odds with their studio work.[28] The controversy had also overshadowed the US release of their 1966 album Revolver,[29] which the band considered to be their best and most mature musical statement up to that point.[30] Following the tour, Harrison seriously contemplated leaving the group, but was persuaded to stay on the condition that the Beatles would from now on focus solely on their work as recording artists.[31] After a break, they reconvened in November 1966 to begin recording Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, which was a major critical and commercial success when released in June 1967.[32]
