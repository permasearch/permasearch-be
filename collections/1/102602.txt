The office of sheriff (historically, sheriff-substitute or sheriff depute) evolved as a legally qualified person appointed by the hereditary sheriff principal (historically, sheriff). The hereditary office was abolished by the Heritable Jurisdictions (Scotland) Act 1746.[6] The offices were officially renamed by section 4 of the Sheriff Courts (Scotland) Act 1971.[53]
