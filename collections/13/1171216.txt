Drebin (ドレビン) is a weapons launderer that's usually accompanied by his pet monkey Little Gray. In Metal Gear Solid 4, he assists Old Snake by disabling ID-tagged weapons taken from PMC troops. He also provides exposition on the origins of each of the Beauty and the Beast members.[157] Drebin is actually a spy for the Patriots assigned to help Snake defeat Liquid Ocelot.[158] He injects Snake with a syringe with nanomachines that allow Snake to use Drebin's weapons; in addition to secretly containing a new strain of FOXDIE programmed to kill EVA, Ocelot and Big Boss. Drebin is voiced by Keiji Fujiwara in the Japanese version and by Khary Payton in the English translation.
