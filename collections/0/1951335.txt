A Swedish (partly motorway) route (rather than road) that also has a significant portion of the Swedish motorway network, is European route E4, which runs from the border city of Tornio in Finland to Helsingborg in Scania. E4 is the main route that connects the capital Stockholm with Scania and the rest of the European continent, via E20 over the Öresund bridge. All of E4 south of the city Gävle is of motorway standard, with only the part passing Ljungby (32 km) left, currently in expressway standard. Upgrade to motorway standard will start in 2017.[126] The part of E4 that runs through western Stockholm is called Essingeleden and is the busiest road in Sweden.
