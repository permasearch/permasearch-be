The system of ancient Egyptian numerals was used in Ancient Egypt from around 3000 BC[1] until the early first millennium AD. It was a system of numeration based on multiples of ten, often rounded off to the higher power, written in hieroglyphs. The Egyptians had no concept of a place-valued system such as the decimal system.[2] The hieratic form of numerals stressed an exact finite series notation, ciphered one to one onto the Egyptian alphabet.
