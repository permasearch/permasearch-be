Human form: In the first film, Jacob has a very skinny physique that undergoes major physical changes by the second film. Being a werewolf, Jacob develops a massive physique. He is able to lift heavy objects that no human is capable of picking up. For example, a dirt bike he easily picked up from his father's truck. After becoming a wolf, he cuts off his long hair and gets the Quileute tattoo on his upper right arm.
