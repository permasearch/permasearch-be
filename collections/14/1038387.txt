A study in the journal Nature said that in 2005, Wikipedia's scientific articles came close to the level of accuracy in Encyclopædia Britannica and had a similar rate of "serious errors".[4] Encyclopædia Britannica disputed the Nature study,[5] and Nature replied with a formal response and point-by-point rebuttal of Britannica's main objections.[6] Between 2008 and 2012, Wikipedia articles on medical and scientific fields such as pathology,[7] toxicology,[8] oncology,[9] pharmaceuticals,[10][11] and psychiatry[12] were compared to professional and peer-reviewed sources and it was found that Wikipedia's depth and coverage were of a high standard[when defined as?]. Concerns regarding readability were raised in a study published by the American Society of Clinical Oncology[13] and a study published in Psychological Medicine (2012),[12] while a study published in the European Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology raised concerns about reliability.[14]
