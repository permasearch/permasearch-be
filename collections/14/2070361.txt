His first, brief introduction to tennis came at age six or seven with a week-long tennis camp at the Bramalea Tennis Club in Brampton, followed by weekly hour-long group sessions led by tennis coach Steve Gibson, who recognized his potential.[2] He moved to nearby Thornhill, Ontario soon after, and one or two years passed before he asked his parents if he could play again.[2][14] His father sought out coach Casey Curtis at the Blackmore Tennis Club in Richmond Hill, Ontario.[10] Curtis was at first reluctant to take on Raonic, but was convinced after Raonic demonstrated his commitment by working with his father and a ball machine daily for two months.[2][14][26] Years later, Raonic said he chose tennis because of its "individuality and [because he] felt [he] could train more alone and on a ball machine with [his] dad".[26]
