A variety of different offenses, such as "indecent exposure", "public lewdness", "public indecency", "disorderly conduct" and so on, may involve exposure of a specific body part (genitals, buttocks, anus, nipples on women), a specific intention or effect (being sexually suggestive, offending or annoying observers).  In some cases, a member of the opposite sex must be present.  In Florida, designated nudity areas are given an explicit exception.  There are also some specific prohibitions against sexual acts, such as having sexual intercourse in public, or publicly caressing someone in a sexual way.  In Indiana and Tennessee, there are specific prohibitions against showing a noticeably erect penis through clothing, or other sensitive areas through semi-transparent clothing.  In some states, indecent conduct can also occur on private property, depending on the intent or effect of the act.  In some cases there are exceptions for spouses, breastfeeding, and in New York, theatre performances. In most states, there is a governing state statute which defines the offense; in Maryland and Massachusetts, indecency is defined by case law.[20]  Some local (county and municipal) governments also regulate personal exposure, as well as commercial activities such as strip clubs.
