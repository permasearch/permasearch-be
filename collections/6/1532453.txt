Anthropology has been used in Britain to provide an alternative explanation for the Financial crisis of 2007â€“2010 to the technical explanations rooted in economic and political theory. Dr. Gillian Tett, a Cambridge University trained anthropologist who went on to become a senior editor at the Financial Times is one of the leaders in this use of anthropology.
