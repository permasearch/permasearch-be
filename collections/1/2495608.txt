The park was divided by a channel, the entrance to the Russells Point harbor, with a 1920s footbridge connecting the two sides. A lack of maintenance led to the bridge's closing decades later, though it remained standing. Private residential development has taken place on former parkland, and condos and apartments line the water. Local fundraising and grants allowed the bridge to be re-lighted in 2010, and in 2014, the bridge was renovated with brick walkways and reopened to the public in a ceremony on August 23, 2014.[2][3]
