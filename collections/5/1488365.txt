For England the treaty made sure the Protestant reformation there had been protected, and James and his ministers refused the Spanish demand for Catholic toleration in England.[49] After the defeat at Kinsale in 1602, the Treaty of Mellifont was concluded the following year between James I and the Irish rebels. In the subsequent London treaty Spain pledged not to support the rebels.[50] English public opinion however showed that the peace treaty was highly unpopular and many considered it a "humiliating peace".[54][55][56] Many felt that the King had abandoned the Netherlands, their old ally, in order to appease the Spanish Crown and relations with James's subjects were strained in the following years.[57]
