Quaoar's umbra extends 5,180,390 km and at the distance of Weywot's apoapsis it would have a diameter of 1,106.5 km or 15 times Weywot's diameter. In comparison, Earth's umbra at the Moon's position is 2.65 times wider. Weywot's inclination is not determined yet, it's either 14° or 30°, if we assume the smaller value then Weywot's center at apoapsis can be up to 4,121 km above or below Quaoar's equatorial plane, this mean for most of the time Weywot is outside of the umbra completely.
