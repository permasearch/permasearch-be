Mrs. Hayfer (Julia Duffy) is the boys' English teacher who adores Josh due to his hard-working personality, but hates Drake because of his consistently poor performance in school; likewise, as noted by his doodles of her in his notebook, as seen in "Honor Council", Drake hates her in return. In the episode "Mean Teacher", Mrs. Hayfer is shown to hate Drake for no apparent reason as it is shown that when he answered a question correctly, she dubbed it incorrect and appointed the same question correct to another student right next to him as well as grading a flawless report he did with a "D-" again for no logical reason.[2] In fact, her catchphrase is "I hate you, Drake", with Drake responding, "I know". She also always says "To the nurse!", which is her own way of telling people to leave her classroom. In "Little Sibling", Mrs. Hayfer says it to Josh when she wanted to have a private talk with Drake. Mrs. Hayfer has a daughter named Kelly, who Drake briefly dates, much to her discontent. In "Honor Council", she comes into the classroom to find her car parked where the boys' seats are originally and accuses Drake of putting the car there, but her star student, Mindy, is the real culprit. Drake apparently hates Mrs. Hayfer so much that he wishes she would die, as seen in the episode, "Megan's First Kiss", in which Josh says "You're not gonna believe this!" and Drake asks in an anxious and excited tone, "Mrs. Hayfer died?!"
