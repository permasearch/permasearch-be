The eighth season was speculated about being the final season of Castle. After the seventh season, both Nathan Fillion's and Stana Katic's contracts expired, and new contract negotiations began before the seventh season ended. It was reported on April 16, 2015, that Fillion renewed his contract for an eighth season,[53] while Katic renewed hers on May 12, 2015.[54] However, in January 2016, speculation began that the series might move on without Fillion and Katic as their contracts were due to expire again after the eighth season.[55] After March 3, 2016, when ABC renewed most of their shows, Castle was one of the few shows excluded, adding to the rumors.[56][57] TVLine reported on April 5, 2016, that the producers were filming multiple endings for the season in case the show was cancelled.[58] Co-showrunner Alexi Hawley commented on the report saying "There’s stuff up in the air, so we are trying to leave it in a very dynamic way which leaves open the possibility that maybe the show won’t come back in the same form next season — although, again, we really hope that it does."[59]
