In 2011, Whirlpool announced the closure of the Fort Smith, Arkansas plant.[25] The following year, Whirlpool opened a new manufacturing plant in Cleveland, Tennessee replacing a 123-year-old facility. The $200 million project added about 130 jobs to an established workforce of 1,500. The 1-million-square-foot (93,000Â m2) facility manufactures premium cooking appliances for Whirlpool's portfolio of brands. The project also includes a distribution center.[26]
