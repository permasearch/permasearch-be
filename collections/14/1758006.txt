A 1905 law instituted the separation of Church and State and prohibited the government from recognising, salarying, or subsidising any religion. However the Briand-Ceretti Agreement subsequently restored for a while a formal role for the state in the appointment of Catholic bishops (though evidence for its exercise is not easily obtained). In the preceding situation, established 1801â€“1808 by the Concordat, the State supported the Catholic Church, the Lutheran Church, the Calvinist Church, and the Jewish religion, and provided for public religious education in those established religions.
