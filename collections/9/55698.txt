Interest in Darwin's writings continues, and scholars have generated an extensive literature, the Darwin Industry, about his life and work. The text of Origin itself has been subject to much analysis including a variorum, detailing the changes made in every edition, first published in 1959,[254] and a concordance, an exhaustive external index published in 1981.[255] Worldwide commemorations of the 150th anniversary of the publication of On the Origin of Species and the bicentenary of Darwin's birth were scheduled for 2009.[256] They celebrated the ideas which "over the last 150 years have revolutionised our understanding of nature and our place within it".[257]
