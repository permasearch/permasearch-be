In the early 2000s, the Washington D.C. public schools (DCPS) faced an organizational crisis. D.C. mayor Adrian Fenty sought advice to determine what was the best way to effectively improve the Washington D.C. public schools. Fenty employed Michelle Rhee as the DCPS superintendent. Rhee initiated her job by analyzing all the factors that affected the DCPS. After evaluating all the factors Rhee decided to restructure the DCPS. Rhee set defined metrics in order to hold teachers accountable and measure whether they were reaching goals. Rhee wanted to eliminate tenure for teachers in order to increase teacher accountability. Rhee wanted to increase the DCPS efficiency, and believed that restructuring the teachers would achieve this.The process and results were controversial but illustrate an organizational approach to overcoming a policy crisis.[15]
