Skunky (voiced by Rob Paulsen) is Pig's pet skunk who is considered as the latter's best friend, much to Otis' chagrin, as seen in "Pig Amok". In "Doggleganger", it is revealed he hates Duke. He appeared in "Snotty's New Pet", where Pig threw him through the window to skunk Snotty. He appeared in later episodes.
