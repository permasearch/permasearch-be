About 400 million years ago, iodine, T4 (and PUFAs) stimulated the evolution of the nervous system in amphibians transforming the aquatic, vegetarian tadpole into the terrestrial, carnivorous frog with better neurological abilities for hunting. Contrary, hypothyroidism in mammals causes cretinism and in adults a neurological regression, as a general slowdown of nervous reflexes with lethargic cerebration, metabolism, digestion, heart rate, hypothermia.[3] [4]
