The crease is a special area of the ice designed to allow the goaltender to perform without interference. It is the only large area of the ice painted blue to establish its presence. In most leagues, goals are disallowed if an attacking player enters the goal crease with a stick, skate, or any body part before the puck enters the crease. Goals are also disallowed if an attacking player obstructs the goalie from attempting to make a save. For the purposes of this rule, the crease extends vertically from the painted lines to the top of the goal frame. The rule preventing goals while an attacking player is in the crease was eliminated from the NHL and other North American professional leagues beginning in the 1999–2000 season — however, an NHL skater physically obstructing a goalie's movements within the crease can be called for a "goaltender interference" penalty for such a potential infraction in NHL play.
