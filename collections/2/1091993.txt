Zane is intelligent and calculating, often providing intel to the other ninja as it applies to their situation. Initially, he lacked normal social skills. It was later revealed that this was due to Zane secretly being a robot, a fact unknown to both the Ninja and Zane himself. Though he is still logical and matter-of-fact, his brotherhood with the other Ninja have enabled him to pick up more human characteristics such as humor.
