Motor neurons begin to develop early in embryonic development, and motor function continues to develop well into childhood.[5] In the neural tube cells are specified to either the rostral-caudal axis or ventral-dorsal axis. The axons of motor neurons begin to appear in the fourth week of development from the ventral region of the ventral-dorsal axis (the basal plate).[6] This homeodomain is known as the motor neural progenitor domain (pMN). Transcription factors genes here include the Pax6, OLIG2, Nkx6.1, and Nkx6.2 factors, which are regulated by sonic hedgehog (Shh). The OLIG2 gene being the most important due to its role in promoting Ngn2 expression, a gene that causes cell cycle exiting as well as promoting further transcription factors associated with motor neuron development.[7]
