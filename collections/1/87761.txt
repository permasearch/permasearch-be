On April 28, 1984, a remarkable outburst of the normally placid Alpha Bootids was observed by visual observer Frank Witte from 00:00 to 2:30 UTC. In a 6 cm telescope, he observed 433 meteors in a field of view near Arcturus with a diameter of less than 1°. Peter Jenniskens comments that this outburst resembled a "typical dust trail crossing".[88] The Alpha Bootids normally begin on April 14, peaking on April 27 and 28, and finishing on May 12.[89] Its meteors are slow-moving, with a velocity of 20.9 kilometers per second.[90] They may be related to Comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3, but this connection is only theorized.[89]
