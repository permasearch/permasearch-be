Emily lives in Jefferson, Mississippi. Her home "was a big, squarish frame house", and she did not have to pay taxes on it. Colonel Sartoris' decided to allow her to be waived from taxes after the death of her father.[1] The home was described as one "that had once been white, decorated with cupolas and spires and scrolled balconies in the heavily lightsome style of the seventies.”[1] As the town began to modernize, “only Miss Emily’s house was left, lifting its stubborn and coquettish decay above the cotton wagons and the gasoline pumps- an eyesore among eyesores.”[1] The house “smelled of dust and disuse—a close, dank smell,”[1] and “was furnished in heavy, leather-covered furniture.”[1] As the people in the community move around her house, “a faint dust rose sluggishly about their thighs, spinning with slow motes in the single sun-ray.”[1]
