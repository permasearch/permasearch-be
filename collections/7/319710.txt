In 1932, Forrest Mars, Sr., moved to the United Kingdom with the goal of growing the Mars food company internationally.[5] While in the United Kingdom, Mars learned of Erich Huzenlaub's work with rice. Huzenlaub's London based company was Rice Conversion, Ltd.[6] The two eventually formed Mars and Huzenlaub[7] in Houston, Texas, which gave Forrest Mars partial ownership of the Huzenlaub Process rice conversion patent. In 1942, through Mars's guidance and sponsorship, Huzenlaub created, together with Houston food broker Gordon L. Harwell, the company Converted Rice, Inc., which sold its entire output to the U.S. and British Armed Forces. The advantage of this product was that it could be air-dropped to troops in the field without risk of weevil infestation, and it could be cooked more quickly than other rice products. Additionally, the converted rice product would retain more nutritional value.[8] In 1944, with additional financing from the Defense Plant Corporation and an investment by Forrest Mars, it built a second large plant.[9] In 1959, Forrest Mars purchased Erich Huzenlaub's interest in the company and merged it into his Food Manufacturers, Inc..[10]
