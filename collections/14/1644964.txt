Increasingly, the Governor-General is regarded as a de facto head of state. Political commentator Colin James has expressed this view,[4] along with historian Gavin McLean[3] and former Prime Minister Helen Clark.[5] The Governor-General has been performing more and more of the functions of a head of state, such as representing New Zealand overseas (a duty Governors-General have carried out since Sir Denis Blundell was in office).[78] For example, at the 2007 commemorations of the Battle of Passchendaele, the Governor-General Anand Satyanand represented New Zealand[81] on behalf of the Queen, while the Queen represented the United Kingdom.[82]
