Around 2011, Bill Belichick increasingly adopted an up-tempo, no-huddle offense for his team.[11] The idea behind this strategy is for the offense to call plays rapidly without pause and without a huddle. The intention was to tire the defensive side of the ball out more quickly, prevent them from changing their personnel on the field, and limit the complexity of their plays.
