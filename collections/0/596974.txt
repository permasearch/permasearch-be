There were delays in the release of Margot's second full length, due to disagreements between the band and Epic Records regarding the song selection of the album. Animal! is Margot's preferred version of their second full-length, while Not Animal was Epic's. Five songs appear on both releases (there were 12 tracks on each album). On their MySpace page, the band has said they would like fans to listen to Animal! first. The band was a featured musical guest on Late Night with Conan O'Brien in November 2008. They played their new song "As Tall As Cliffs", one of only four songs to appear on both Animal! and Not Animal.
