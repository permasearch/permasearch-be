Zack Handlen reviewed the episode for The A.V. Club, saying that while it was an improvement on earlier episodes he had reservations about the use of Wesley Crusher. He called the "thoughts made flesh concept" a "cliche", but was "gratified to see the series actually trying for something a little beyond their reach, this early in the game".[19] As for Wesley, Handlen thought that it was imposing a "Chosen One narrative" that brought "an unlikable character even further to the forefront of the action simply because some writer didn't get enough pats on the head growing up"[19] and gave the episode a B-minus.[19] Jamahl Epsicokhan, on his website Jammer's Reviews, said that it was the first time in the series that space itself generated "awe and wonder";[20] however, he thought the "fresh and intriguing" nature of the episode faded as it went along.[20] He criticized Wesley Crusher, describing him as a "cloying geek" and "you just want to strangle him".[20] He gave the episode a score of 2.5 (out of 4).[20]
