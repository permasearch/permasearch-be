Information is scarce (Dodgson's diaries for the years 1858â€“1862 are missing), but it seems clear that his friendship with the Liddell family was an important part of his life in the late 1850s, and he grew into the habit of taking the children on rowing trips (first the boy Harry, and later the three girls) accompanied by an adult friend[40] to nearby Nuneham Courtenay or Godstow.[41]
