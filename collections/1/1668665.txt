While at university, he became involved with the Cambridge Footlights, where he met Hugh Laurie, who would become his long-time collaborator. As half of the comic double act Fry and Laurie, he co-wrote and co-starred in A Bit of Fry & Laurie and also took the role of Jeeves (with Laurie playing Wooster) in Jeeves and Wooster.
