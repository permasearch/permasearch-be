Japanese neo-nationalists argue that Allied war crimes and the shortcomings of the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal were equivalent to the war crimes committed by Japanese forces during the war.[citation needed] American historian John W. Dower has written that this position is "a kind of historiographic cancellation of immoralityâ€”as if the transgressions of others exonerate one's own crimes".[117] While right-wing forces in Japan have tried to push for their perspective on war-time history, they have been unsuccessful due to opposition from both within and outside Japan.[118]
