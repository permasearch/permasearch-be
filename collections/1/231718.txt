Lodging rates are subject to a 6% rate at the state level, with local entities being allowed to charge additional amounts. For example, the city of Austin levies a 9% hotel/motel tax, bringing the total to 15%, trailing only Houston for the highest total lodging tax statewide, at 17%.[166] Lodging for travelers on official government business is specifically exempt from tax but the traveler must submit an exemption form to the hotel/motel and provide proof of official status.[167]
