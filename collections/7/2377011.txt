In 1915 several agencies and commissions responsible for the stateâ€™s wildlife and natural resources were consolidated under the Department of Game and Fish, and in 1919 the agency was renamed the Alabama Department of Conservation. The Department would undergo many name changes as the focus and overall scope of operations evolved until settling on its current name, the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, in 1971.
