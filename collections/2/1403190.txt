McPherson, Kearney, and Plax examined teacher anger in college classrooms through the lens of norm violations.[53][54] Naturally, teachers will become frustrated and angry with students in classrooms from time to time. How teachers express themselves and convey those emotions will determine how students respond and interpret those emotional demonstrations. The students judged the appropriateness of teachers' anger in classrooms in the modal expressions of distributive aggression, passive aggression, integrative assertion, and nonassertive denial.[54] Students rated the aggressive expressions as highly intense, destructive, and inappropriate (or non-normative), including such behaviors as sarcasm or putdowns (most frequently cited), verbal abuse, rude and condescending behaviors toward students, and acts intended to demoralize students.[54][55][56][57] The students described assertive displays as appropriate and less intense.[54] Although anger is often considered to be a negative emotion, teacher anger is not necessarily a violation of classroom norms.[54] Based on the study, intense and aggressive displays of teacher anger are considered socially inappropriate by students.[54] These perceived norm violations result in negative evaluations of the teacher and the course.[54] Because only integrative-assertive expressions of teacher anger were positively related to students' perceptions of appropriateness, the study concluded that teachers should avoid intense, aggressive anger displays and should rather assertively and directly discuss the problem with students.[54]
