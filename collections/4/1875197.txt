In 2016, a kickstarter campaign raised funds for a board game centered on the Mistborn series called Mistborn: House War.[32] Developed by Crafty Games and designed by Kevin Wilson,[33] House War is the first board game set in the Mistborn world and takes players on an adventure to play the role of leaders of the great noble Houses, struggling to weather the cataclysmic events of the first novel of the series. The game started shipping to backers in late August 2017.[34]
