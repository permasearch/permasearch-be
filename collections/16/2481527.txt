At the Taft Campus, the LRC is divided into two areas: the LRC-Main occupying the second floor of the St. Mutien-Marie Hall, up the stairway from the main entrance, and the LRC-Extension located underneath the Plaza Villarosa, which was formerly used as parking space. The LRC-Main holds the audio-visual equipment and multimedia resource collections, periodicals, as well as the memorabilia and thesis collections of the college. It has an audio-video listening and viewing area for the LRC's VHS collection. The LRC-Extension is an additional reading area where students can browse, borrow, and bring home books from the LRC's general book collections except for the Lasalliana collection which is for room use only.
