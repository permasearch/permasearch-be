Opened in 1998, the Stade de France was built for that year's FIFA World Cup. It hosted nine matches, including the opening match and the final. Serving as the national stadium, the Stade de France hosts numerous domestic cup finals, including the Coupe de France, Coupe de la Ligue, Coupe de France Féminine, and Coupe Gambardella finals in football, along with the Top 14 final in rugby union. The stadium has no permanent tenants, but serves as a secondary home facility of Parisian rugby clubs Stade Français and Racing 92, hosting a few of their regular-season fixtures. It also hosts some matches of the French national football and rugby teams.
