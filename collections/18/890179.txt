There were varying types of land ownership and tenure depending on the topography and climate of one's locality. In hilly, peripheral areas far from trade routes, most peasant farmers owned and cultivated their own fields.[35] In frontier regions such as Hunan and Sichuan, owners of wealthy estates gathered serfs to till their lands.[35] The most advanced areas had few estates with serfs tilling the fields; these regions had long fostered wet-rice cultivation, which did not require centralized management of farming.[35] Landlords set fixed rents for tenant farmers in these regions, while independent small farming families also owned their own lots.[35]
