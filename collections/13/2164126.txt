Charbroilers are not generally known for consistent cooking surface temperatures, which can vary by up to 400 °F (204 °C) between maximum and minimum. This large temperature differential is driven by the tendency of the burner array to create a heat plume which draws convective heat toward the center of the broiler and tends to leave the outer perimeter cooler than the interior. The elevated heat pattern from this plume effect is generally predictable and visible on the grates themselves – temperatures well above 700 °F (371 °C) will incinerate the oils left on the grates by normal cooking processes, leaving a discernible white ash that tends to define the hottest areas.
