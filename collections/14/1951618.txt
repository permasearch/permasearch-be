At some point, Colonel James Fannin became the commander of the troops at La Bahia. He renamed the presidio Fort Defiance.[44] In February 1836, President Antonio LÃ³pez de Santa Anna led a large force of Mexican Army troops into Texas to quell the revolution. Santa Anna and part of his force entered Bexar on February 23 and initiated a siege of the Alamo. Alamo commander William B. Travis immediately sent a courier to Fannin, asking him to provide reinforcements to the Alamo.[45] At first unable to make up his mind, Fannin finally decided to ride to the relief of the Alamo.[46] Historian Robert Scott suggests that the trip was initiated after Fannin's objections were overridden by his officers.[47]
