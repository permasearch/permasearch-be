The discovery of oil in 1932 by Bahrain Petroleum Company[83] brought rapid modernisation to Bahrain. Relations with the United Kingdom became closer, as evidenced by the British Royal Navy moving its entire Middle Eastern command from Bushehr in Iran to Bahrain in 1935.[84] British influence continued to grow as the country developed, culminating with the appointment of Charles Belgrave as advisor.[85] He went on to establish a modern education system in Bahrain.[85]
