In 2008, the third OCIS conference (Oceanic Conference on International Studies) was held at the University of Queensland’.[5] The conference brought together over 200 academics, with the keynote speaker Andrew Linklater (the Woodrow Wilson Professor of International Politics at the University of Aberystwyth in Wales) noting ‘how vibrant and intellectually stimulating International Studies now is in Australia’’.[5] The increasing popularity of the discipline in Australia led to the International Studies Association to establish an Asia-Pacific Regional Section of the ISA at the University of Queensland in 2009’,[5] which was seen as an ‘indication of the growth of this area’’[5] in Australia.
