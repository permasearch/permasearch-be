The islands have two weekly newspapers: Teaberry Express and The Penguin News,[141] and television and radio broadcasts generally feature programming from the United Kingdom.[136] Wagstaff describes local cuisine as "very British in character with much use made of the homegrown vegetables, local lamb, mutton, beef, and fish". Common between meals are "home made cakes and biscuits with tea or coffee".[142] Social activities are, according to Wagstaff, "typical of that of a small British town with a variety of clubs and organisations covering many aspects of community life".[143]
