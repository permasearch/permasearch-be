Michigan State would receive the second half kickoff and was able to tie the game on a Michael Geiger 31 yard field goal after a Bennie Fowler catch and run of 60 yards on the second play of the half put MSU in field goal position. With the game tied 17-17, Stanford received the ball. After an 11-yard completion to Ryan Hewitt, in a fashion similar to how the game started, Kevin Hogan went deep to Michael Rector again on 1st and 10, however, this time the ball was intercepted as Michigan State cornerback Trae Waynes took the ball away from Rector while the both of them were falling to the ground. On the ensuing Michigan State possession, the Cardinal defense stood tall, forcing a punt and giving their offense a second chance. Backed up at their own 7 yard line, the Stanford offense did not start off their drive as planned, as a botched handoff between Kevin Hogan and Tyler Gaffney almost resulted in what would have been a disastrous turnover. On 2nd down, Gaffney was tackled for a 1-yard loss. On 3rd and 11 with the ball at the Stanford 6 yard line, Kevin Hogan threw deep over the middle to tight end Devon Cajuste, which was caught for a 51-yard gain and put Stanford in Michigan State territory. A holding penalty called against Stanford (only the 3rd holding penalty called against the Cardinal offensive line all season) the next play made it 1st and 20. On 3rd and 17, Kevin Hogan took off on a 14-yard scramble to make a 4th down conversion seem manageable. On 4th and 3, Stanford turned the ball over on downs after Tyler Gaffney was tackled in the backfield for a 3-yard loss by senior Spartan linebacker Denicos Allen.
