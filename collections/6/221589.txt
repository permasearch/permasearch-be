The murder of Leigh's character in the shower is the film's pivotal scene and one of the best-known in all of cinema. As such, it spawned numerous myths and legends. It was shot from December 17â€“23, 1959, after Leigh had twice postponed the filming, firstly for a cold and then her period.[61] Seventy-seven different camera angles were used.[62] The finished scene runs three minutes and includes 50 cuts.[63] Most of the shots are extreme close-ups, except for medium shots in the shower directly before and directly after the murder. The combination of the close shots with their short duration makes the sequence feel more subjective than it would have been if the images were presented alone or in a wider angle, an example of the technique Hitchcock described as "transferring the menace from the screen into the mind of the audience".[64]
