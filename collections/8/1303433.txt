In their reunion show transmitted on 26 May 2014, the cast of Goodness Gracious Me Special 2014 performed a parody of the song and video entitled "No Blurred Lines". The video begins with the three male leads being shown under on-screen labels of "#Thicke", "#Thicker" and "#Thickest" ('thick' being British slang for 'stupid'). The lyrics make fun of the stereotype of the rowdy male Asian-Indian teenage boy. As pointed to by its title, the lyrics also mock and refute the sexist attitudes of the original song.
