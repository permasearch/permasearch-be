In some episodes, George aligns with both Kramer and Elaine, against whom he is also frequently pitted. With Elaine, while he gets into arguments with her, they also work together, most notably in "The Cadillac", although George states in "The Dinner Party" that he is frightened of Elaine. George and Kramer usually feel awkward around one another but find themselves working together (and against one another) in "The Busboy", "The Stall" and "The Slicer". "The Susie" is the only episode where their relationship is as prominent as the relationships between the other characters. Some episodes, like "The Raincoats", "The Money", "The Doorman" and "The Fusilli Jerry", would suggest that Kramer has a more comfortable rapport with George's parents than George.
