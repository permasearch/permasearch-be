The next day, Emily flies Leo and Vincent to Mexico and the two find their way to Harvey's mansion. After a firefight with Harvey's guards and Harvey himself, the two overpower Harvey, force him to return the Black Orlov, and kill him. Escaping with the Black Orlov, Vincent and Leo return to the United States on Emily's plane, but are immediately surrounded by police upon landing. The police takes the Black Orlov and hands Vincent a gun, revealing that Vincent and Emily are both undercover police officers. Leo and Harvey's Black Orlov deal was actually arranged by the police, and the dealer killed by Harvey was Vincent's brother Gary. Devastated by his brother's death, Vincent volunteered to go to jail and gain Leo's trust so they can reach Harvey.
