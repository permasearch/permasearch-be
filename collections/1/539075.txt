The 2018 model year Suburban will also have a few upgrades and deletions. The LED daytime running lights became standard on all trims, along with a new color, havana brown and satin steel metallic. The cocoa/mahogany interior that was combined with the pepperdust metallic exterior is dropped along with the wireless/inductive phone charging that was part of the Luxury and Texas Edition LT level trims. The fleet/commercial level trim, which had fewer features, is upgraded to include MyLink, HD Radio, multi-color driver information center, LED daytime running lights, and an optional driver alert package.[103]
