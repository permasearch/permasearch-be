The early success of Buick is attributed mainly to what they called the valve-in-head engine, now known as the overhead valve (OHV), engine[14] patented by Eugene Richard and developed by Richard, Buick, and Marr. The Model F had a two-cylinder engine, an 87-inch wheelbase and weighed 1,800Â lbs.[15] The creation of General Motors is attributed in part to the success of Buick,[16] so it can be said Marr and Richard's designs directly led to GM.[17] The power train and chassis architecture introduced on the Model B was continued through the 1909 Model F.[18]
