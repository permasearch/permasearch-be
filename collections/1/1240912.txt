Several critiques have been proposed against TMT from evolutionary psychologists – for reasons including that fear is an adaptive response in individuals' that has come about as a result of natural selection; without these adaptations human beings would have never been able to avoid maladaptive situations.[12] Thus, it is unlikely that people would have psychological ways of slowing-down anxiety.[12] In response, TMT theorists argue that this critique is mixing up fear related to immediate danger with anxiety related to thoughts of threats that will or may occur eventually.[12] TMT is talking about the protection that self-esteem and cultural worldviews offer against the threat of unavoidable death in the future. While anxiety may be adaptive in avoiding entering a dangerous place (e.g. because a predator may be waiting), this doesn't mean that anxiety must be adaptive in all cases.[12] For a more comprehensive review of TMT and evolutionary psychology, see Landau et al., 2007.[12] Similar evolutionary critiques have been raised by researchers exploring uncertainty and unknowns (see for reviews,[49][50]).
