Across the Rue de la Loi from the Berlayont is the Europa building, which the Council of the European Union and the European Council have used as their headquarters since the beginning of 2017.[47] Their former home in the adjacent Justus Lipsius building is still used for low-level meetings and to house the Council secretariat, which has been located in Brussels' city centre and the Charlemagne building during the course of its history.[18][19][47] The renovation and construction of the new Council building was intended to change the image the European quarter, and was designed by the architect Philippe Samyn to be a "feminine" and "jazzy" building to contrast with the hard, more "masculine" architecture of other EU buildings.[46] The building features a "lantern shaped" structure surrounded by a glass atrium made up of recycled windows from across Europe, intended to appear "united from afar but showing their diversity up close."[46]
