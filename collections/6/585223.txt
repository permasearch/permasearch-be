In January 2017, the Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages had received 14 complaints related to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's use of English and French during public town hall meetings.[12] Eleven of the reports came following a session in Sherbrooke, Quebec, where Trudeau, whose father had enacted the Official Languages Act fifty years prior, answered in French when was asked in English to address a lack of government-provided mental health services for English-speaking persons.[13] The remaining three were attributed to Trudeau answering in English to a question asked in French while in Peterborough, Ontario.
