The final round occurred on August 22. In this relay, Aleen Bailey and Sheri-Ann Brooks were replaced by two athletes who had previously competed in individual events (Kerron Stewart, who medaled silver in the women's 100 meters, and medaled bronze in the women's 200 meters,[43] and Sherone Simpson, who also medaled silver in the women's 100 meters[42]). Veronica Campbell-Brown and Shelly-Ann Fraser remained in the relay.[40][49] However, the Jamaican relay was one of the three relays in the final round that did not finish the race (the others being the British and Polish relays).[73]
