In a retrospective review, AllMusic noted that The Head on the Door marked a new musical direction for the Cure, with Smith managing to make the band's trademark "gloom and doom" style both "danceable and popular", while also noting that its inventive arrangements "give the album a musical depth previous efforts lacked".[9] Tom Doyle of Q wrote that the album found Smith "bridging the brooding of yore with their recent pop highs".[15] Pitchfork said: it is the band's "most focused pop album" and "a tight, terrific package."[14] Writing for PopMatters, Gregg Lipkin said, "Alternative music might have sounded like U2, INXS and Depeche Mode but it looked like Robert Smith. With the release of The Head on the Door, the Cure became Masters of the Form whose music had finally caught up to its image".[3]
