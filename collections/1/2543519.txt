Initial reactions to Gaye's death were shock on the part of many of his peers. Otis Williams, of the Motown group The Temptations, recalled receiving the news while touring with the Four Tops in Australia and said, "It was a very dark day that I will never forget as the day I lost a friend."[44] Former Motown staffer Janie Bradford and her husband were driving home after listening to radio all day when the announcer announced Gaye's death.[45] CBS Urban president Larkin Arnold was also reportedly stunned with the news as he had tried to get Gaye in the studio for his follow-up to Midnight Love.[45] Smokey Robinson heard the news of Gaye's death on the radio. Feeling that his "inners wouldn't accept" the news, he called Gaye's ex-wife Anna to find out whether it was true, and she confirmed it before he could ask her, leaving Robinson in shock.[46][47]
