The triggers for precipitation of uric acid are not well understood. While it may crystallize at normal levels, it is more likely to do so as levels increase.[13][34] Other triggers believed to be important in acute episodes of arthritis include cool temperatures, rapid changes in uric acid levels, acidosis,[35][36] articular hydration and extracellular matrix proteins, such as proteoglycans, collagens, and chondroitin sulfate.[4] The increased precipitation at low temperatures partly explains why the joints in the feet are most commonly affected.[3] Rapid changes in uric acid may occur due to factors including trauma, surgery, chemotherapy, diuretics, and stopping or starting allopurinol.[12] Calcium channel blockers and losartan are associated with a lower risk of gout compared to other medications for hypertension.[37]
