In season three of Legends, Sara continues to lead the Waverider crew as they track down and repair anachronisms throughout time, working in an antagonistic partnership with Rip Hunter's new bureaucratic organization, the Time Bureau. In the four-part crossover "Crisis on Earth-X," Sara travels to 2017 to attend the wedding of Barry Allen (Grant Gustin) and Iris West (Candice Patton), where she has a one-night stand with Supergirl's adoptive sister Alex Danvers (Chyler Leigh). The assembled heroes work together to repel an invading Nazi army from the alternate world of Earth-X. While confronting the demonic entity Mallus (John Noble) alongside her old friend John Constantine, Sara and Constantine hook up, despite her ongoing romantic tension with Time Bureau agent Ava Sharpe (Jes Macallan). Ava and Sara become girlfriends in subsequent episodes, but break up after Sara is temporarily possessed by Mallus through the death totem and reasons that, given her history with death and destruction, she poses a danger to Ava.
