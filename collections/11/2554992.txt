After being released from the hospital, Sarah leaves with Tom; Axel, convinced Tom is the killer, calls to warn Sarah, telling him Tom has been institutionalized for the last seven years. Alarmed, Sarah attempts to have Tom drive her home, but he refuses. She grabs the steering column, crashing the car. Sarah flees into the woods, and calls Axel from her cell phone. She goes to hide in Axel's father's abandoned house. Inside, she discovers empty heart-shaped boxes, and a high school photo of her with Tom. The killer enters the house, and Sarah flees, running into a mine entrance. While hiding in the mine, she is confronted by Axel, and manages to wrest his gun from him. Tom arrives, and Sarah holds them both at gunpoint. Tom makes mention of Megan's death, confirming to Sarah that he is the killer, as he would not have known she was dead otherwise. In the midst of a hallucination, Tom—who has developed an alternate personality as Harry Warden—sees Warden appear behind Sarah, and begs her to shoot him. Axel grabs the pick-axe and attacks Tom, but is injured in the scuffle.
