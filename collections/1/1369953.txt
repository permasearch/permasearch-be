Shetty responded to these protests by saying, "I understand this (kissing) is his (Gere's) culture, not ours. But this was not a big thing or so obscene for people to overreact in such a manner. I struggle to understand these people's sentiments, but mainly I do not want a foreigner to take bad memories from here."[60] On 26 April 2007, an Indian court in Rajasthan issued a warrant for Shetty and Gere's arrest.[63] A two-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by the Chief Justice of India subsequently dismissed the suit and suspended the arrest warrants.[64] Gere has since expressed regret for causing any offence and Shetty has said: "so much has been blown out of proportion".[65]
