The National Basketball Association (NBA) All-Star Game is an annual exhibition basketball game played between the Eastern-Conference and the Western-Conference All-Stars. It is the main event of the NBA All-Star Weekend. Twelve players—five starters and seven reserves—from each conference are chosen from a pool of 120 players—60 players from each conference with 24 guards and 24 frontcourts (forwards and centers)—listed on the ballots by a panel of sport writers and broadcasters. The starters are chosen by a combination of fans, media, and current players. Fans may vote using a variety of online platforms, and account for 50% of the vote, with the media and current players each accounting for 25%.[1] The reserves are chosen by voting among the head coaches of each team's particular conference. Coaches are not allowed to vote for their own players, and can select two guards, three big men, and two players regardless of positions.[2] If a player is unable to participate due to injury, the NBA commissioner will select a replacement.[3] The 1999 All-Star Game was canceled due to the league's lockout.[4]
