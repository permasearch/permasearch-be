During the first half of the 19th century, Cape Breton Island experienced an influx of Highland Scots numbering approximately 50,000 as a result of the Highland Clearances.[20] [21] Today, the descendants of the Highland Scots dominate Cape Breton Island's culture, particularly in rural communities.  To this day, Gaelic is still the first language of a number of elderly Cape Bretoners.[22] The growing influence of English-dominated media from outside the Scottish communities saw the use of this language erode quickly during the 20th century. Many of the Scots who immigrated there were either Roman Catholics or Presbyterians, which can be seen in a number of island landmarks and place names.
