The 5.9 liters (360.0 cu in) 6BT, aka the Cummins "12-valve" was the first member of the "B" engine family to be used in a light truck vehicle. The 6BT used Robert Bosch GmbH fuel systems, injector, and VE rotary pump and P7100 inline injection pumps. Some early 6BTs were supplied with CAV rotary pumps instead, before the Bosch system became the sole standard. This engine started life in 1984 designed as an agricultural engine, for use in Case agricultural equipment.[3][full citation needed] After 1989, the 6BT engine was used in light duty, medium duty and select heavy duty trucks and buses.[citation needed]
