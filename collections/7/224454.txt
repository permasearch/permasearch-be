Also in 1893 he married his distant cousin Marianne Schnitger, later a feminist activist and author in her own right,[5][31] who was instrumental in collecting and publishing Weber's journal articles as books after his death, while her biography of him is an important source for understanding Weber's life.[32][33] They would have no children and it is usually acknowledged that their marriage was never consummated.[21] The marriage granted long-awaited financial independence to Weber, allowing him to finally leave his parents' household.[19] The couple moved to Freiburg in 1894, where Weber was appointed professor of economics at the university,[24][25] before accepting the same position at the University of Heidelberg in 1896.[24][25] There Weber became a central figure in the so-called "Weber Circle", composed of other intellectuals such as his wife Marianne, Georg Jellinek, Ernst Troeltsch, Werner Sombart and Robert Michels.[5] Weber also remained active in the Verein and the Evangelical Social Congress.[5] His research in that period was focused on economics and legal history.[34]
