"Young Blood" is a synthpop and electro song,[3] and features a buzz-guitar riff.[4] Kevin Harley of BBC Music compared the song to the work of MGMT.[3] According to Godfrey de Grut of NZ Musician, "Young Blood" is set in the key of F#, and follows the chord progression of B–F♯–B–F♯–C♯–B–F♯–B–D♯min–C♯.[5] The theme of "Young Blood" is that of "spirit of youth" and its loss,[5][6] and contains a "yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah" hook.[5][7]
