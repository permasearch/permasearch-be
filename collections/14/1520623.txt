To avoid disputes, each hunter used arrows marked in a personal way.[26][27][28] Lakota hunter Bear Face recognized his arrows by the one of three "arrow wings" made of a pelican feather.[29] Castaneda wrote how it was possible to shoot an arrow right through a buffalo.[30] The Pawnees had contests as to how many bison it was possible to kill with just one bowshot. The best result was three.[31] An arrow stuck in the animal was preferred as the most lethal. It would inflict more damage with each jump and move.[32] A white traveler credited the hunters with cutting up a bison and packing the meat on a horse in less than 15 minutes.[33]
