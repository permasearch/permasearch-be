The next day, Cash copies the code he saw in the equisapiens video to break into Lift's home before heading to the picket line where the callers and police get into a riot. He is knocked out by an officer just after he blows a whistle into a phone. Later that night, he wakes up in a police wagon and witnesses the equisapiens that he called with the whistle fighting back against the police, who they easily overpower with their superior strength. They then free him, Squeeze, Sal, and Detroit, and run off to keep fighting.
