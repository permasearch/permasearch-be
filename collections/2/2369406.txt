The Dhyanalinga premises are also the location of the 112-foot Adiyogi statue, which was inaugurated by the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, on Maha Shivaratri, 2017.[17] The statue represents Shiva as the Adiyogi or first yogi, and the Adi Guru or first Guru, who offered yoga to humanity. It is the tallest bust of Shiva in the world.[18][19] The height of the statue - 112 feet - represents the 112 ways Adiyogi is said to have offered, in which a human being can attain mukti.
