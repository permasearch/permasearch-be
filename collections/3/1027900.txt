Toyota is working on perfecting technology that will monitor driver's eyelids to make sure they are looking at the road. Other carmakers are also working on similar technology. For example, General Motors has a pilot program using it to monitor distraction, and Jaguar Land Rover monitors the driver's eyes to create the 3D image for its "Virtual Windscreen".[50]
