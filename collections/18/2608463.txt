In December 2008, NS&I dropped the interest rate (and therefore the odds of winning) due to the drop in the Bank of England base rate during the credit crunch, leading to criticism from members of Parliament, financial experts and holders of bonds; many claimed Premium Bonds were now "worthless", and somebody with Â£30,000 invested and "average luck" would win only 10 prizes a year compared to 15 the previous year.[10][11] Investors with smaller although significant amounts would possibly win nothing.
