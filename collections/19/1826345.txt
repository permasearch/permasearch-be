In R v Jogee [2016] UKSC 8, the Supreme Court decided that intent, not mere foresight, must be proved in order to convict an accomplice of a crime of specific intent, such as murder. The court said "foresight of what might happen is ordinarily no more than evidence from which a jury can infer the presence of a requisite intention. It may be strong evidence, but its adoption as a test for the mental element for murder in the case of a secondary party is a serious and anomalous departure from the basic rule, which results in over-extension of the law of murder."[6] He summarised the law as: "If the crime requires a particular intent, D2 must intend ... to assist D1 to act with such intent."[7] (This appeal was heard jointly with an appeal from Jamaica to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, with the same judges, Ruddock v The Queen [2016] UKPC 7.)
