The field of oxidative phosphorylation began with the report in 1906 by Arthur Harden of a vital role for phosphate in cellular fermentation, but initially only sugar phosphates were known to be involved.[93] However, in the early 1940s, the link between the oxidation of sugars and the generation of ATP was firmly established by Herman Kalckar,[94] confirming the central role of ATP in energy transfer that had been proposed by Fritz Albert Lipmann in 1941.[95] Later, in 1949, Morris Friedkin and Albert L. Lehninger proved that the coenzyme NADH linked metabolic pathways such as the citric acid cycle and the synthesis of ATP.[96] The term oxidative phosphorylation was coined by Volodymyr BelitserÂ (uk) in 1939.[97][98]
