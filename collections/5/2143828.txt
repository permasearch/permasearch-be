In an interview for a Billboard podcast, Nile Rodgers spoke about the song's recording sessions and working with Gaga and Warren. He had met Gaga at a party and she invited him to join them in the studio. During recording, Gaga was singing in a D note, over the F note of the music that was being played. Rodgers suggested to Warren that since the D vocals made the song sound like a country track, they could instead inverse the chords into thirteenth (an octave plus a sixth), thus serving a dominant function. Warren accepted the suggestion and the song was re-recorded.[9] Gaga reportedly struggled while recording the song, since it caused her to recall her own trauma. Warren explained that it was: "very emotional for her. She couldn't even talk through it at times".[10] Gaga told an interviewer with Variety that Warren had helped her feel comfortable about the song and its subject matter, allowing her to transcend the singing and put the correct emotional depth in her performance.
