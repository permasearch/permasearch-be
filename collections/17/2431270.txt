Today, it appears that a couple of editors have completely gutted the criticism section. There were plenty of well-sourced legitimate criticisms that have been removed with no discussion. I will assume that the editors who made these changes do not understand that there are a large number of editors on this article who demand a democratic process before major changes take place to the article. So I will first ask that the editors who are responsible for these major changes to revert their edits and discuss their proposed changes on this talk page. EzraPoundem (talk) 22:43, 23 May 2009 (UTC)
