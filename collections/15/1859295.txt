The Company seems to have an interest in Whistler, and this is apparently the reason Michael's incarceration in Sona was arranged in the first place. Due to the political spotlight on him, The Company were unable to get him out. Initially, Whistler is seemingly unaware of why The Company wants him. One of The Company's operatives, Elliott Pike, approached Michael and offered their support if he breaks Whistler out. When he refused, another operative, who called herself only by the obviously false name Susan B. Anthony, approached Michael's brother Lincoln Burrows and informed them that Lincoln's son L.J. Burrows and Michael's girlfriend Sara Tancredi were being held hostage by The Company and would be killed if Michael didn't break Whistler out within a week.
