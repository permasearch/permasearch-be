Melbourne-based artist Kristin McFarlane designed the current Australian of the Year trophy in 2004.[32] Like Langley, McFarlane works with glass, but she is also trained as a graphic designer; she combines both text and images and sets them in kilned glass to produce striking works of art. The task of designing a new trophy prompted McFarlane to think more deeply about national identity than she had before: 'It made me look at Australian identity and think about what was an Australian? Who is the archetypal Australian?' She quickly realised that an image of one person, or even a group of people, would not work, and that her images needed to be generic. She decided to use a map of Australia: 'It is one of the oldest continents in the world and it is a very recognisable form for anyone who lives here.'[33] McFarlane also chose to use the text of the Australian national anthem "Advance Australia Fair", but gave particularly prominence to the lesser-known second verse.
