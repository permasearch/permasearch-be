By October, Jackson’s closest associates, especially his Secretary of State Martin Van Buren of New York, were developing plans to summarily end the BUS, without proposing any substitutes for the Bank’s fiscal functions. This was a plan anticipated to bring financial success, among other places, to New York. Meetings of Democrats in Richmond, Virginia in October 1829 helped develop an anti-Bank course.[58] Nicholas Biddle carefully explored his options in winning over the president to supporting recharter.[59] His methods included convincing pro-Jackson officials in the Bank's branches to intervene on the institution's behalf.[60] Biddle approached William Lewis in November 1829 with a proposal to facilitate paying down the national debt.[61] Jackson welcomed the offer and personally promised Biddle he would recommend the plan to Congress in his upcoming annual address, adding emphatically that he still held personal doubts as to the Bank’s constitutionality.[61] Jackson’s finance advisors urged him not to act too drastically, pointing out the need to find some alternative to the Bank that would restrain speculation and stabilized the currency. Jackson heeded the warnings."[62]
