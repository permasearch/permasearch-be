According to Forbes, in 2017, all five of the most valuable teams were "Original Six" teams: the New York Rangers at approximately $1.5 billion, the Toronto Maple Leafs at $1.4 billion, the Montreal Canadiens at $1.25 billion, the Chicago Blackhawks at $1 billion, and the Boston Bruins at $890 million.[72] At least eight NHL clubs operate at a loss. NHL teams are susceptible to the Canadian–U.S. exchange rate: revenue from tickets, local and national advertising in Canada, and local and national Canadian media rights are collected in Canadian dollars, but all players' salaries are paid in U.S. dollars regardless of whether a team is located in Canada or the U.S.[72]
