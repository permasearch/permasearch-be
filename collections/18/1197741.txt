Relationships among lemur families have also proven to be problematic and have yet to be definitively resolved.[23] To further complicate the issue, several Paleogene fossil primates from outside Madagascar, such as Bugtilemur, have been classified as lemurs.[56] However, scientific consensus does not accept these assignments based on genetic evidence,[23][55] and therefore it is generally accepted that the Malagasy primates are monophyletic.[23][30][57] Another area of contention is the relationship between the sportive lemurs and the extinct koala lemurs (Megaladapidae). Formerly grouped in the same family due to similarities in dentition,[58] they are no longer considered to be closely related due to genetic studies.[57][59]
