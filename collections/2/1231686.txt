Although the Air Force had been an independent service since 1947, the rank of chief master Sergeant did not come into being until the authorization of the Military Pay Act of 1958.  This act established the pay grades of E-8 and E-9, but without specifying titles for those pay grades.  It wasn't until late 1958 that the title chief master sergeant (and the accompanying rank insignia) was decided upon.
