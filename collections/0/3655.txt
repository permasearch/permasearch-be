Protestantism, which was suppressed under the Spanish Catholic regime, has slightly reemerged under United States rule, making contemporary Puerto Rico more interconfessional than in previous centuries, although Catholicism continues to be the dominant religion. The first Protestant church, Iglesia de la Sant√≠sima Trinidad, was established in Ponce by the Anglican Diocese of Antigua in 1872.[224] It was the first non-Roman Catholic Church in the entire Spanish Empire in the Americas.[225][226]
