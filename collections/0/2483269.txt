In modern Greece, ouzeries (the suffix -erie is imported from French) can be found in nearly all cities, towns, and villages.  These cafe-like establishments serve ouzo with mezedesâ€”appetizers such as octopus, salad, sardines, calamari, fried zucchini, and clams, among others.  It is traditionally slowly sipped (usually mixed with water or ice) together with mezedes shared with others over a period of several hours in the early evening.
