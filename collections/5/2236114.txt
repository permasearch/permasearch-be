In the second episode, Boorman travels up to Lae from Port Moresby and then catches a truck to Goroka. In Goroka he views the work done by the VSOS and a Dutchman at Goroka General Hospital, views local customs in which they would coat themselves in clays to appear white to play a ghost which traditionally was used to ward off unwanted visitors and Boorman was taken around a coffee and given an explanation of coffee production in Papua New Guinea. He then travelled up to Betty's Lodge where they switched to dirt bikes to travel up to Madang past places like Mount Wilhelm, Brahman and Usino. The route had never been ridden on motorbike before and the roads were heavily flooded and treacherous, and at one point some ruthless locals placed a blockade across the road and demanded money. Nevertheless, masses of people viewed their progress up to Madang. From Madang, Boorman rode in a minibus to Boroi and then a speedboat to Gapun. There he met with an anthropologist and discussed local village life with the natives. He then rode in a canoe boat along the broad Sepik River to Angoram where he inquired at the local police station and joined a truck up to Wewak and then to Aitape.
