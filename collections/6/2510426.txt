India has a comprehensive system of product certifications governed by laws made by the Parliament of India at various times. These certifications are managed by various agencies, and hold various statuses before the law. Some of these marks are mandatory for such products to be manufactured or to be placed in the Indian market while some of the marks hold only an advisory status. All the industrial standardization and industrial product certifications are governed by the Bureau of Indian Standards, the national standards organization of India, while standards for other areas (like agricultural products) are developed and managed by other governmental agencies.
