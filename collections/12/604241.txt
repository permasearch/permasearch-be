Annalise continues collecting cases for her class action suit, as she has to get the necessary forty clients. Bonnie sends Nate to investigate her, in which Nate actually warns Annalise. From Bonnie's perspective, flashbacks reveal that Bonnie and Annalise met in 2002, when Bonnie accused a councilman of rape, while Annalise was his defence lawyer. After winning the case, guilty for her actions against Bonnie, Annalise resigned from the law firm she worked at and looked for Bonnie to help her. In the present, Michaela, with Oliver's aid, digs into classified files on the Antares on Tegan's computer, only to find a cease and desist letter the firm sent Trent, the Antares employee who was murdered. With all this secrecy, Asher doubts Michaela, probably suspecting she has a lover. Frank asks Laurel if the baby she is expecting is really Wes'; distraught over cheating on Wes, she demands he leave. Annalise succeeds in getting the forty clients for her class action suit, but Bonnie lures nearly all of them into a plea deal. Dr. Isaac Roa discovers that his patient Julie is actually Bonnie and the "Mae" she has been referring all along is actually Annalise, his other patient.
