After Victoria, in Season 8 episode "P.S. I Love You", Ted meets Jeanette Peterson, his final girlfriend before meeting The Mother. Ted and Jeanette meet on the subway after Ted notices they read the same book. Jeanette turns out to be obsessed with him: he finds out that she had been stalking him for a year and half (since his appearance on Time Magazine), bought the same book as him 10 minutes after him (the book they were both reading on the subway), and started a fire outside his lecture hall to meet him. while his friends are horrified, Ted finds this romantic and ignores the warning signs. In "Weekend at Barney's", Jeanette breaks up with Ted; she takes virtually everything he says and does as proof that he is cheating on her. Barney tries to set up Ted with other women to get his mind off Jeanette, although Jeanette finds him at the bar and they get back together. However, this does not last long: Jeanette finds Barney’s playbook in Ted’s apartment and destroys the place, locking Ted out and throwing his things out the window to the street below. At this moment, Ted decides he is done with the single life and ready to settle down.
