A female alien named Xylene locates the Omnitrix and attacks Ben, under the impression that he had stolen it but when Max comes to defend, the two recognize each other as old comrades and sweethearts. Xylene and Max reminisce later that night, which indicates they had been in quite a romantic relationship during Max's early Plumber days. Xylene reveals that she was the commander of the ship bringing the Omnitrix to Earth when Vilgax attacked it, and that she had intended to send it to Max; Ben received the Omnitrix by accident. One of Vilgax's remaining drones attacks and captures Max, so Ben and Xylene reluctantly team up to save him and Xylene unlocks Upchuck to defeat the drone.
