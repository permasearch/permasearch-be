At around 5:30 p.m. (EDT) on April 7, 2018, a 4-alarm fire broke out in a condominium in the tower's 50th floor, killing a resident and injuring six firefighters; the apartment was almost entirely engulfed in flames by the time the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) arrived.[126] In a Twitter post, Trump attributed the fire's limited damage to the building's design.[127][128] The sole fatality was 67-year-old Todd Brassner, an art dealer known for his association with Andy Warhol, who had endured debilitating medical problems for several years.[129][130] Brassner's apartment, as well as the rest of the residential units in Trump Tower, did not contain sprinklers because the structure had been built before 1999, when the city passed a law requiring sprinklers in residential units;[130] Trump had lobbied against the proposal.[131] The FDNY later announced that the fire had been accidentally caused by power wires that had overheated.[132] The April 2018 fire followed a minor electrical fire at the tower earlier that year, which had injured three people.[133]
