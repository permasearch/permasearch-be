There is also a type of calico cat referred to as a Dilute Calico. Dilute Calicos are not necessarily rare. They are recognized by their grey, silver, and gold colors instead of the traditional white, black, brown or red patched coat of a calico. Dilute calicos are also called light calicos, because they usually have no dark colored fur.
