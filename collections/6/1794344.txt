The polyatomic nonmetals are distinguished from the diatomic nonmetals by virtue of having higher coordination numbers, higher melting points (in their thermodynamically most stable forms), and higher boiling points; and having wider liquid ranges and lower room temperature volatility.[56] More generally they show a marked tendency to exist in allotropic forms, and a stronger inclination to catenate;[57] and have a weaker ability to form hydrogen bonds.[58] The ability of carbon to catenate, in particular, is fundamental to the field of organic chemistry and life on Earth.[59][n 6] All of the polyatomic nonmetals are solids, and all are known in either malleable, pliable or ductile forms; most also have lower ionisation energies and electronegativities than those of the diatomic nonmetals.
