Arthur Guinness started brewing ales in Leixlip, County Kildare, and then from 1759 at the St. James's Gate Brewery in Dublin. On 31 December he signed a 9,000-year lease at Â£45 per annum for the unused brewery.[6][7] However, the lease is no longer in effect because the brewery property has been bought out when it expanded beyond the original 4-acre site.[2]
