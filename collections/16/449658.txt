Principal photography lasted 28 days, and, according to director David Wain, it rained on every day of shooting.[1] Exterior shots were filmed when possible, sometimes under covers or umbrellas, but some scenes were moved indoors instead. In many interior scenes, rain seen outside turns into sun as soon as characters step outside. Due to the cold, the actors' breath can be seen in some outdoor scenes.[1] The film was shot at Camp Towanda in Honesdale, Pennsylvania.[8]
