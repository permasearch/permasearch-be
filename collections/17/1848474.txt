The soundtrack for Halo 3 was released on November 20, 2007. O'Donnell noted he wanted to bring back the themes from the original game to help tie together the end of the trilogy.[118] The tracks are presented, similarly to the previous soundtrack for Halo 2,[116] in a suite form. Unlike previous soundtracks, where much of the music had been synthesized on computer, the soundtrack for Halo 3 was recorded using a 60-piece orchestra, along with a 24-voice chorus.[119] The final soundtrack was recorded by the Northwest Sinfonia at Studio X in Seattle, Washington.[120] The soundtracks were bundled and released as a box set in December 2008.[121] A soundtrack for Halo 3: ODST was released alongside the game and included many of the tracks from the game.[122]
