The family Polydnaviridae may have evolved from the Ascoviridae.[90] Molecular evidence suggests that the Phycodnaviridae may have evolved from the family Iridoviridae.[91] These four families (Ascoviridae, Iridoviridae, Phycodnaviridae and Polydnaviridae) may form a clade but more work is needed to confirm this.
