The Geneva Accords promised elections in 1956 to determine a national government for a united Vietnam. Neither the United States government nor Ngô Đình Diệm’s State of Vietnam signed anything at the 1954 Geneva Conference. With respect to the question of reunification, the non-communist Vietnamese delegation objected strenuously to any division of Vietnam, but lost out when the French accepted the proposal of Việt Minh delegate Phạm Văn Đồng,[4] who proposed that Vietnam eventually be united by elections under the supervision of “local commissions”.[5]  The United States countered with what became known as the “American Plan”, with the support of South Vietnam and the United Kingdom.[6] It provided for unification elections under the supervision of the United Nations, but was rejected by the Soviet delegation.[6] From his home in France, Vietnamese Emperor Bảo Đại appointed Ngô Đình Diệm as Prime Minister of South Vietnam. With American support, in 1955 Diệm used a referendum to remove the former Emperor and declare himself the president of the Republic of Vietnam.
