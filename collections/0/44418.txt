The album is best known for the title track and its classic video, which would go on to win the CMA Award for Video of the Year. In the song, Jones sings of the irreplaceability of country music legends, including Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard, Conway Twitty, Carl Perkins, Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Charlie Rich, Marty Robbins, Hank Williams and Lefty Frizzell. The music video, which was directed by Marc Ball, takes place at a roadside gas station, where the owner shares with Jones his extensive collection of albums and memorabilia from classic country music artists. It was the singer's first music video and featured him looking healthier than he'd had in years. Jones producer Billy Sherrill appears at the beginning of the video playing the bus driver. At the end of the video, future country star Marty Stuart is one of the two young men in the convertible that pulls up at the gas station as the Jones tour bus pulls away. As Bob Allen writes in his book George Jones: The Life and Times of a Honky Tonk Legend, the song "struck a strong enough chord of empathy with old-time country music lovers to end up number three in Billboard.
