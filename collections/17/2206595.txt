This method of intake decreases or eliminates certain of the risks of heroin use while increasing others, as the transmission of HIV, hepatitis, and other diseases through needle sharing, the introduction of skin bacteria to the blood stream due to non-sterile injection, and the stress that injection puts on veins cannot occur. Additionally, a small puff can be inhaled as a method of gauging the strength of the heroin. This may be protective from the risk of overdose. Finally, the lungs can act to filter out adulterants that otherwise would pass directly into the bloodstream. One of the most common of these adulterants, talc, has an apparently greater potential to damage the lungs (as well as other organs, such as the kidneys) when present in the bloodstream, than when inhaled [2]. However, in any case, it is always harmful to expose the lungs to any kind of smoke or heated vapor, and inhaling heroin itself is more likely to lead to toxic leukoencephalopathy than is injecting.[3][4]
