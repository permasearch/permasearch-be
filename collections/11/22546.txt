A particularly violent explosive (Plinian) summit eruption occurred in 122Â BC, and caused heavy tephra falls to the southeast, including the town of Catania, where many roofs collapsed.[18] To help with reconstruction after the devastating effects of the eruption, the Roman government exempted the population of Catania from paying taxes for ten years.[citation needed]
