In 1940, true to its form as the "first of first", Alpha Phi Alpha sought to end racial discrimination within its membership. The use of the word "Negro" in the membership clause of the constitution which referred to "any Negro male student" would be changed to read "any male student." The unanimous decision to change the constitution happened in 1945 and was the first official action by a BGLO to allow the admission of all colors and races.[54] Bernard Levin became the first non-black member in 1946,[55] and Roger Youmans became the first non-black member to address the fraternity at the 1954 general convention.[56][unreliable source?][57]
