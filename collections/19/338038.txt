Stingrays employ a wide range of feeding strategies. Some have specialized jaws that allow them to crush hard mollusk shells,[22] whereas others use external mouth structures called cephalic lobes to guide plankton into their oral cavity.[23] Benthic stingrays (those that reside on the sea flooor) are ambush hunters.[24] They wait until prey comes near, then use a strategy called "tenting".[25] With pectoral fins pressed against the substrate, the ray will raise its head, generating a suction force that pulls the prey underneath the body. This form of whole-body suction is analogous to the buccal suction feeding performed by ray-finned fish. Stingrays exhibit a wide range of colors and patterns on their dorsal surface that to help them camouflage with the sandy bottom. Some stingrays can even change color over the course of several days to adjust to new habitats.
