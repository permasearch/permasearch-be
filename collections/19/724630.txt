Opal was riding her bike while Winn-Dixie pulled ahead and they meet a woman named Gloria Dump. They become good friends. Opal and recovering alcoholic Gloria Dump decide to host a small party, inspired by the party in Gone With the Wind, inviting everyone they know. In the process, Opal becomes a friend to her former enemies, the brothers, Stevie and Dunlap Dewberry. She also invites Amanda Wilkinson and Sweetie Pie Thomas, a girl who has no pet, and so had fallen in love with Winn-Dixie. Otis and Miss Franny Block are also invited.
