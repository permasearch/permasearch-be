It was opened on 23 July 1979 as Anzalone's final act as president.[71] The complex had its first expansion in 1984 when the club was handled by Dino Viola and another in 1998 under the chairmanship of Franco Sensi.[72] The centre's official name is the Fulvio Bernardini di Trigoria, named after club icon Fulvio Bernardini.
