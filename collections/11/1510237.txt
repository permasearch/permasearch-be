Some areas of the park were formerly part of the princely state of Tehri Garhwal.[8] The forests were cleared to make the area less vulnerable to Rohilla invaders.[8] The Raja of Tehri formally ceded a part of his princely state to the East India Company in return for their assistance in ousting the Gurkhas from his domain.[8] The Boksas—a tribe from the Terai—settled on the land and began growing crops, but in the early 1860s they were evicted with the advent of British rule.[8]
