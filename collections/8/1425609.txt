There are 972 half-hour episodes, but during the series' original run in Australia, later episodes were shown in an hour-long format. The pilot episode was shown in Australia and some UK ITV regions as a 90-minute special, although subsequent screenings have seen that episode split into three half-hours. The program has been broadcast internationally, and has been particularly popular in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Belgium.
