The band released its first post-reunion album in 1991, entitled Lynyrd Skynyrd 1991. By that time, the band had added a second drummer, Kurt Custer. Artimus Pyle left the band during the same year, with Custer becoming the band's sole drummer. That lineup released a second post-reunion album, entitled The Last Rebel in 1993. Later that year, Randall Hall was replaced by Mike Estes. The band's third post-reunion album, Endangered Species, featured mostly acoustic instrumentation and remakes of many of the band's classic 1970's songs. On the album, Kurt Custer was replaced by Owen Hale on drums.
