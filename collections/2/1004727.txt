Deborah Evans Price, of Billboard magazine reviewed the song favorably calling it one of the best ballads of the year. She also says that McGraw's voice "oozes hurt and disillusionment."[1] Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe gave the song an A- grade, saying that the song beings "with the sound of hushed acoustic strumming, the arrangement picks up force as the song progresses, but the focus of attention remains the story of a marriage gradually unraveling. He goes on to say that the song "all comes through in McGraw’s evocative performance, showcasing the layers of subtlety his voice had picked up in the years since his 'Indian Outlaw' days, while wife Faith Hill’s plaintive background vocals add a further layer of pathos."[2]
