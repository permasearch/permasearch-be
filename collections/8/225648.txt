For example, in the United States, suspicious transaction reports[1] must be reported to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), an agency of the United States Department of the Treasury. In Australia the SAR must be reported to Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), an Australian government agency.  Most countries have laws that require financial institutions to report transactions and will have a designated agency to receive these. The agency to which a report is required to be filed for a given country is typically part of the law enforcement or financial regulatory department of that country.
