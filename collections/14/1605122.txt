When first introduced he is overweight and wears gloves, boots, a vest and a cape. He is very naive and childlike, taking joy in fighting and scaring people. Throughout the series, he is always referred to by either Majin Buu or simply Buu, no matter what form he is in. However, each form has been given their own names in guidebooks, video games or by fans, in order to distinguish between them. When Buu expels the evil inside him, it takes on a taller and much skinnier, frail form referred to as "Pure Evil Majin Buu" (魔人ブウ 純粋悪, Majin Bū Junsui Aku).[11]:61 When this Buu absorbs the fat one, he transforms in a muscular version of himself referred to as "Evil Majin Buu" (魔人ブウ 悪, Majin Bū Aku).[11]:61 Personality-wise, Evil Buu is more intelligent than Buu and is described as "pure rage".[12]
