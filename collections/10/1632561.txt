Manifest functions are the consequences that people observe or expect. It is explicitly stated and understood by the participants in the relevant action. The manifest function of a rain dance, used as an example by Merton in his 1967  Social Theory and Social Structure, is to produce rain, and this outcome is intended and desired by people participating in the ritual.[4][5]
