On Burton's hiring, he and Logan reworked the screenplay;[9] Logan felt they agreed over the film's tone due to "share[d] stunted childhoods watching Amicus movies".[3] Turning a three-hour stage musical into a two-hour film required some changes. Some songs were shortened, while others were completely removed.[11] Burton said "In terms of the show, it was three hours long, but we weren't out to film the Broadway show, we were out to make a movie, so we tried to keep the pace like those old melodramas. Sondheim himself is not a real big fan of movie musicals, so he was really open to honing it down to a more pacey shape."[5] Burton and Logan also reduced the prominence of other secondary elements, such as the romance between Todd's daughter Johanna and Anthony, to allow them to focus on the triangular relationship between Todd, Mrs. Lovett, and Toby.[11][12]
