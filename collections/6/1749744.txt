The series ran from 1957-66. Burr received three consecutive Emmy Award nominations and won the award in 1959 and 1961[52] for his performance as Perry Mason. The series has been rerun in syndication ever since, and was released on DVD between 2006 and 2013. Though Burr's character is often said never to have lost a case, he did lose two murder cases in early episodes of the series.[53]
