Celtic qualified for the Europa League group stages in 2011–12 in bizarre circumstances. Swiss side Sion defeated Celtic 3–1 on aggregate in the qualifying tie.[167] Sion, however, were thrown out of the tournament by UEFA due to them fielding ineligible players in the two games against Celtic.[168] Celtic were thus reinstated, eventually finishing third in Group I, behind Atlético Madrid and Udinese and ahead of Rennes.[169]
