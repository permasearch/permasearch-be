The term "lower of cost or market" is now obsolete and is officially replaced by "lower of cost and net realizable value." According to the FASB Accounting Standards Update, "An entity should measure inventory within the scope of this Update at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation." This FASB update makes usage consistent with the IFRS wording and removes the use of "or" in a context where "and" was always the correct one.[4] However, the update does not apply to all companies. Companies that use the FIFO (first-in, first-out) and average-cost methods of inventory valuation are required to implement the changes, whereas companies that use the LIFO (last-in, first-out) and retail inventory methods are not affected by the update.[3]
