In the final game of the annual rivalry, Georgia running backs Lars Tate and Rodney Hampton had quite impressive performances against Clemson on this day in Death Valley. But in the end, it was Clemson's defense that was the story. Trailing 20–16 with five minutes left, a trio of Clemson defenders sacked Georgia quarterback James Jackson in the end zone for a safety to cut it to 20–18. Clemson took the free kick and immediately faced a third and seven. Clemson tailback Terry Allen took a pitch and picked up 16 yards for the first down to keep the drive alive.
