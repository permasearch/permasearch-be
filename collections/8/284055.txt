He is depicted as the Mrs. Potts' husband and Chip's father where he lost the memory of it when the Enchantress' spell is cast. Jean is first seen greeting Belle and comments the book she described as boring. Jean Potts is later seen in the tavern where Le Fou is trying to cheer up Gaston and when Maurice later came in accusing Gaston of leaving him for dead. Jean is among the villagers who assist Gaston in the attack on the Beast's castle. During the fight between the servants and the villagers, Mrs. Potts recognized her husband. When the spell is broken, Jean is reunited with his wife and son and later dances with his wife at the ball.
