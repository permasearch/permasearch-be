Within the ONA was a group of longstanding initiates known as the "Old Guard" or "Inner ONA",[33][145] whose experience with the tradition led to them becoming influential over newer members who often sought their advice.[33] Members of this Old Guard included Christos Beest, Sinister Moon, Dark Logos, and Pointy Hat,[33] although in 2011 they stated that they would withdraw from the public sphere.[48]
