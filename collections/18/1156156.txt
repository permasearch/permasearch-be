Andrew Lycett, an Ian Fleming biographer, believed that Fleming liked his martinis shaken, not stirred, because Fleming thought that stirring a drink diminished its flavour. Lycett also noted that Fleming preferred gin and vermouth for his martini.[7] It has also been said that Fleming was a fan of martinis shaken by Hans SchrÃ¶der, a German bartender.[8][9][10][11]
