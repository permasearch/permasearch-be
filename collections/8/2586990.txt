The Centre for Health and the Public Interest estimated in 2015 that there were about 53,000 contracts between the NHS in England and the private sector, including contracts for primary care services of which the 211 CCGs currently hold 15,000 with an annual value of about Â£9.3bn in 2013-14.[20] They sent Freedom of Information requests to all 211 CCGs, seeking information about how they monitor contracts with private providers and concluded that CCGs failed to manage contracts with private providers effectively.[21]
