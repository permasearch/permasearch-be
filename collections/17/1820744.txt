For many years the Whitehead claims were ignored or dismissed by mainstream aviation historians. In March 2013, Jane's All the World's Aircraft published an editorial which accepted Whitehead's flight as the first manned, powered, controlled flight of a heavier-than-air craft.[88] The Smithsonian Institution is among those who do not accept that Whitehead flew as reported.[89]
