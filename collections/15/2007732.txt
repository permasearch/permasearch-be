I think we whould make the character section it's own page, so that we can expand further upon it, including the clients and classic characters from Birdman and other Hanna Barbera properties.  Actually, with all the information held in Harvey Birdman, I think it deserves it's own wiki, moreso than Robot Chicken, which has one.  I don't know how that whole thing works, though.  I'm kind of new to the whole wiki editing scene.
