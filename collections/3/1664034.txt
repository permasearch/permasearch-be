On June 20, 2014, Deadline announced the cast of the eight lead characters, along with Freema Agyeman, Naveen Andrews, Daryl Hannah, Alfonso Herrera and ErÃ©ndira Ibarra.[76] For the roles of those characters living outside of America, the filmmakers wanted to assemble a cast of international actors that matched the nationality of their respective characters, if possible. For example, Doona Bae, Tina Desai, and Max Riemelt are from Seoul, Mumbai, and Berlin like their respective characters.[49] Because the eight leads share the same birthday, the actors selected were all somewhere between mid-20s and mid-30s.[47] The filmmakers wanted to write a Chinese, Japanese or Korean character and since the Wachowskis had worked with Bae on Cloud Atlas and Jupiter Ascending before, they decided on creating a Korean character for her.[49] Bae expressed worry to them on signing on Sense8 because the proposed five-season plan could mean she would have to be able to film action scenes for the next 10 years, which would be difficult if she ever decided to get married and got pregnant. She joined the cast after the showrunners told her not to worry as they would kill off her character for her if that ever happened.[77] Jamie Clayton is a trans woman like the character she plays. She was attracted to Sense8 because of the opportunity to play a transgender character that was written and directed by a transgender filmmaker, and because she was a fan of science fiction and Straczynski.[12] Tuppence Middleton knew the Wachowskis were writing Sense8 while working with them on Jupiter Ascending but she did not think they would ask her to play a role.[16] Max Riemelt was cast at the recommendation of director Tom Tykwer, who had been wanting to work with the actor for a long time.[78] Daryl Hannah was brought in to read for Whispers, because they were thinking of making him an androgynous character at the time, but when she arrived she was told they'd like her to read for the role of Angelica.[79] In November, Deadline wrote than Christian Oliver had joined the cast as a recurring villain.[80] Oliver said he was excited to play a villain for the Wachowskis for a second time, after Speed Racer.[81] Joe Pantoliano, who previously played in the Wachowskis' Bound and The Matrix, was cast in a small uncredited role as Will's father.[82]
