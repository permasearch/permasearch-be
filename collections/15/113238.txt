On March 17, 2014, Microsoft released OneNote for Mac. It is compatible with Mac OS X 10.9 and above and can be downloaded for free from the Mac App Store.[20] Microsoft also made OneNote 2013 for Windows desktop available for free. OneNote for Windows and Mac are both based on a freemium model. Premium features such as SharePoint support, version history and Outlook integration were previously available only to Office 365 and Office 2013 customers,[5][21] but on February 13, 2015, Microsoft removed all feature restrictions, except creation of local notebooks -- the free edition only stores notebooks on OneDrive -- from the programs, essentially making the program completely free to use.[22]
