The vehicles in the movie were provided by the General Motors Corporation, as notable examples included several Chevrolet Malibus and Caprices that were used as police cars, and a red late 1970s Oldsmobile Delta 88 seen at the lake where the supposed monster was residing. As a result, all three Detroit automakers were represented in one capacity or another, as The Andy Griffith Show used Ford Motor Company products, and its spinoffs Gomer Pyle, USMC and Mayberry RFD had those from the Chrysler Corporation. However, Griffith, who was also portraying the namesake attorney on Matlock at the time, had gone back to driving Ford cars, as he would go through several iterations of the Ford Crown Victoria throughout the series.
