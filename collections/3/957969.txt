Burton began riding fatbikes, which are fortified bikes with wide tires that are intended for sand, ice and snow. He became interested in Eric Larsen's attempt to travel to the bottom of the world in 2012. Larsen made it a quarter of the way before turning around.[6] Training for a year, Burton set off on his expedition December 2, 2013. He started at Hercules Inlet and rode 775 miles[7] on a Borealis Yampa fatbike[4] until he reached the Geographic South Pole.
