In one year the band went from opening for such powerhouse local bands as Dead Hot Workshop and the Gin Blossoms to headlining and packing venues five nights a week. The Refreshments applied for entry to South By Southwest in Austin, TX and were not only received, but learned that the band's demo tape had been played for an A&R rep for Mercury Records; as a result of their performance at the music festival, the band was signed by the label as well as signing with manager, Michael Lustig. In 1995, original drummer Dustin "Dusty" Denham departed, and was replaced by Paul "P.H." Naffah who had played in a local band called Rain Convention.
