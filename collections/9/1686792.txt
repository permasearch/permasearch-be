In "Breakup in Paris", Marcus gets a surprise by a boy named Dante who is posing as him at a CD signing. Marcus and Dante argue over who's the real Lil' Little, but the crowd believes Dante because of a nearby lifesize cut-out. Later Marcus and Dante both sing at a Lil' Little concert. Mr. Moseby recognizes Marcus as the real Lil' Little and gets recognized himself, ending up with the crowd beating him with a bicycle, as pointed out by London afterwards. Marcus tells Dante they should work together someday. Later in "My, Oh Maya", Dante comes back pointing out he is a stowaway that got on the boat with a rope.
