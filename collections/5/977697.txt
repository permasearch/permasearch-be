Few instances in international cricket has been witnessed the sharing of awards. This sharing sometimes awarded to two players of the same side or players with the two sides, who had better clinical performances towards the opponent. In these occasions, the commentators and other awards given authorities held on to share the awards, without giving the award to the player of the winning team.[13] Test cricket has witnessed rare instances when a joint award for man of the match or man of the series has been announced. However, in ODIs and Twenty20 this phenomenon is usually seen when the member of the losing team is the highest scorer, such as when Charles Coventry (194) and Tamim Iqbal (154) shared the award when Zimbabwe lost the match. In another interesting match held on 3 April 1996, the whole team from New Zealand was awarded the Men of the Match award by adjudicator Basil Butcher who pronounced it a team performance.[14] It was the first instance when a whole team was awarded it.[15]
