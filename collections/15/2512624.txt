Lauren Shiba is Jayden's older sister and the true 18th leader of the Samurai Power Rangers. As the head of the Shiba House, Lauren is the actual Ranger who can master the special Sealing Symbol, passed down from previous generations and thus has a much stronger fire power. Because of this, she stayed in hiding while Jayden took her place to draw the Nighloks attention away from her. When she finally masters the Sealing Symbol that can defeat Master Xandred, she returns to the team. However, she did not appear with the team when they joined the veteran Ranger army in Super Megaforce.
