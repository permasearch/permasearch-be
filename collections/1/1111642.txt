By the late 1980s, several Illinois municipalities had banned the possession of handguns. Chicago required the registration of all firearms but did not allow handguns to be registered, which had the effect of outlawing their possession, unless they were grandfathered in by being registered before April 16, 1982.[84][85] Additionally, several Chicago suburbs had enacted outright prohibitions on handgun possession.[86]
