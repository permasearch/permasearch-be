Plant chemical defenses can be used by herbivores, by storing eaten plant chemicals, and using them in defense against predators. To be effective defensive agents, the sequestered chemicals cannot be metabolized into inactive products.  Using plant chemicals can be costly to herbivores because it often requires specialized handling, storage, and modification.[32] This cost can be seen when plants that use chemical defenses are compared to those plants that do not, in situations when herbivores are excluded.  Several species of insects sequester and deploy plant chemicals for their own defense.[33] Caterpillar and adult monarch butterflies store cardiac glycosides from milkweed, making these organisms distasteful.  After eating a monarch caterpillar or butterfly, the bird predator will usually vomit, leading the bird to avoid eating similar looking butterflies in the future.[34] Two different species of milkweed bug in the family Hemiptera, Lygaeus kalmii and large milkweed bug (Oncopeltus fasciatus), are colored with bright orange and black, and are said to be aposematically colored, in that they "advertise" their distastefulness by being brightly colored.[35]
