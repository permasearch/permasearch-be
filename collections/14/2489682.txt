Through a special habilitation law, the Government may be enabled to issue ordinances (ordonanțe), which have the same legal force as ordinary laws. Ordinances are a form of legislative delegation, and may require approval in Parliament if the habilitation law states so. In extraordinary situations, in which regulation cannot be postponed, the Government may issue emergency ordinances (ordonanțe de urgență), which do not require habilitation laws but must be subjected to approval in Parliament before coming into force.[12]
