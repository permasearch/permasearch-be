Problems can occur when there is a need to determine whether a person involved in the creation of a piece of work may have joint ownership. When this is the case, there is a test that can be applied, similar to the one which is used to determine originality. This test is used in order to show that the labor, skill and judgement exercised by the author are unique and are that of which are protected by copyright. For example, in this case it was stated that there can be no finding of joint authorship in a copyright work in the absence of a common intention to that effect. T is implicit in the concept of ‘collaboration’ that there must be “joint laboring in the furtherance of a common design.” This means that it is necessary for both authors to make a significant contribution and that they must have had a similar plan. Furthermore, in the case of Godfrey v Lees, as mentioned above, it is clear to conclude that joint authorship does not require that the respective contribution be equal. The Claimant was a classically trained pianist invited by a pop group to reside with them and act as orchestra arranger of a number of their songs. He never became a member of the Group. The issue in this case was whether the Claimant was the joint owner of copyright in six musical works for which he had made orchestral arrangements of contributed to their composition. It was held that he has made a significant and original contribution to the creation of the work and must be regarded as joint author.
