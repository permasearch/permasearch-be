The esophagus also has an upper sphincter, that is the cricopharingeal sphincter. That is exactly where I feel the vibration. I would modify the article myself to reflect that, but I'm waiting for someone with actual medical experience to reply, since I cannot prove it nor deny it (I'd have to perform an endoscopy on myself while I'm burping to do that) and I may be wrong.
