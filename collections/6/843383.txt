The title of Oba was used after the Ogiso title and was created by Oranmiyan, Benin Empire's first "Oba". Oba Eweka I, Oranmiyan's son, is said to have ascended to power at some time between 1280 and 1300. The Oba of Benin was the Head of State (Emperor) of the Benin Empire until the Empire's annexation by the British, in 1897.
