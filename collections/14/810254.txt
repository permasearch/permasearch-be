Ireland's value added tax (VAT) is part of the European Union Value Added Tax system.[41] It is collected by VAT-registered traders on almost all goods and services they supply. Each trader in the chain of supply, from manufacturer to retailer, charges VAT on his sales and pays it to Revenue, deducting from the payment the VAT paid on his purchases.[42]
