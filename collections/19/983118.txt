Kuchipudi classical dance originated in a village of Krishna district in modern era Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.[62][63][64] It has roots in antiquity and developed as a religious art linked to traveling bards, temples and spiritual beliefs, like all major classical dances of India.[65][66][67] In its history, the Kuchipudi dancers were all males, typically Brahmins, who would play the roles of men and women in the story after dressing appropriately.[68]
