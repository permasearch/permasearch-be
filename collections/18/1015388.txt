Many crops which are critical for the market, like vegetables, are row crops (that is, grown in tight rows).[5] While often the most profitable for farmers, these crops are more taxing on the soil[5] Row crops typically have low biomass and shallow roots: this means the plant contributes low residue to the surrounding soil and has limited effects on structure.[7] With much of the soil around the plant exposed to disruption by rainfall and traffic, fields with row crops experience faster break down of organic matter by microbes, leaving fewer nutrients for future plants.[7]
