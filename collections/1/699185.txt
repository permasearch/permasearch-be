Zinc is a bluish-white, lustrous, diamagnetic metal,[12] though most common commercial grades of the metal have a dull finish.[13] It is somewhat less dense than iron and has a hexagonal crystal structure, with a distorted form of hexagonal close packing, in which each atom has six nearest neighbors (at 265.9 pm) in its own plane and six others at a greater distance of 290.6 pm.[14] The metal is hard and brittle at most temperatures but becomes malleable between 100 and 150 °C.[12][13] Above 210 °C, the metal becomes brittle again and can be pulverized by beating.[15] Zinc is a fair conductor of electricity.[12] For a metal, zinc has relatively low melting (419.5 °C) and boiling points (907 °C).[16] The melting point is the lowest of all the d-block metals aside from mercury and cadmium; for this, among other reasons, zinc, cadmium, and mercury are often not considered to be transition metals like the rest of the d-block metals are.[16]
