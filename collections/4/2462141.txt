The Volkswagen VR6 was originally designed as a 2.8 litre engine, but some versions have been built as large as 3.6 litres in size. In addition to Volkswagen, VR6 engines have also been used by Audi and Porsche, although Audi also uses its own designs of wider-angle V6s. Some other manufacturers have also used VR6 engines in their vehicles.
