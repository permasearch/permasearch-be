The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia—People's Army (Spanish: Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia—Ejército del Pueblo, FARC–EP and FARC) was a guerrilla movement[11] involved in the continuing Colombian armed conflict from 1964 to 2017. It was known to employ a variety of military tactics[12] in addition to more unconventional methods, including terrorism.[13][14][15][16] The FARC–EP was formed during the Cold War period as a Marxist–Leninist peasant force promoting a political line of agrarianism and anti-imperialism. The operations of the FARC–EP were funded by kidnap and ransom; illegal mining;[17] extortion or taxation of various forms of economic activity and the taxation, production and distribution of illegal drugs.[18][19] The United Nations has estimated that 12% of all killings of civilians in Colombian conflict were committed by FARC and National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrillas, with 80% committed by right-wing paramilitaries, and the remaining 8% committed by Colombian security forces.[20]
