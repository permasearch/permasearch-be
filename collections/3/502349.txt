Cider was once very popular in Northern Portugal[87] where its production was larger than wine production until the 11th century,[87] but nowadays, its popularity has decreased and it is only consumed in the coasts of Minho, Ã‚ncora e Lima, where it is used as a refreshment for thirst. In some festivities, it is still used rather than wine. There's also a traditional production of the drink in Madeira.
