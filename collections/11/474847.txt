Stunned and exhausted, Colorado and MacKenna face each other. Colorado tells MacKenna to stay away from him. MacKenna tells Colorado to go far away and hide, that he will be coming after him. MacKenna and Inga ride off together. The camera tilts down to the left side of McKenna’s mount, which happens to be Sgt. Tibbs’ horse, its saddle bags stuffed with gold nuggets.
