The Isle of Man Government Notes Act revoked the banks' licences to issue banknotes as of 31 July 1961.[8] The Isle of Man Government started to issue its own notes, in denominations of 10 shillings, £1 and £5, on 3 July 1961. In 1969, the 10 s. note was replaced by a 50 pence note in the build-up to decimalisation. £20 notes were introduced in 1979. A polymer £1 note was introduced in 1983 but discontinued in 1988. A £50 note was also introduced in 1983. The 50 pence banknote was withdrawn in 1989. Legal tender status (the IOM's definition of which is akin to the UK) of the 10 shilling, 50p and £1 polymer notes continued until 31 October 2013, and these notes remained in circulation (albeit rarely seen) until this date, after which they remain exchangeable at branches of the Isle of Man Bank.[9]
