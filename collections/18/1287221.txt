During the summer of 2006, Paramore played a portion of Warped Tour, primarily on the Volcom and Hurley Stages, and their first night on the Main Stage was at a date in their hometown of Nashville. During the band's time at Warped Tour, they released The Summer Tic EP, which was sold exclusively during the tour.[23][24] Paramore's first US headlining tour began on August 2, 2006 to a sold-out audience[25] with support from This Providence, Cute Is What We Aim For, and Hit the Lights with the final show in Nashville. That year they were voted "Best New Band", and Hayley Williams was voted as No.Â 2 "Sexiest Female", by readers of the British magazine Kerrang!.[26]
