Five countries are observer statesâ€”a status that entitles them to express their opinion and give advice but denies them voting rights.[9] These are Eritrea, where Arabic is one of the official languages, as well as Brazil and Venezuela, which have large and influential Arab communities.[10] India is another observer to the Arab League, with a sizable amount of people claiming Arab descent.[9] Armenia was granted observer status in 2004.[11]
