In the decades since its release, modern film scholars have noted the possible queer reading of the film. Director James Whale was openly gay, and some of the actors in the cast, including Ernest Thesiger and Colin Clive, were believed to be gay or bisexual.[52] Although James Curtis, Whale's biographer, rejects the notion that Whale would have identified with the Monster from a homosexual perspective,[53] scholars have perceived a gay subtext suffused through the film, especially a camp sensibility,[54] particularly embodied in the character of Pretorius and his relationship with Henry.
