There are several theories about how and when gender identity forms, and studying the subject is difficult because children's lack of language requires researchers to make assumptions from indirect evidence.[9] John Money suggested children might have awareness of, and attach some significance to gender, as early as 18 months to two years; Lawrence Kohlberg argues that gender identity does not form until age three.[9] It is widely agreed that core gender identity is firmly formed by age three.[7][8][9][10] At this point, children can make firm statements about their gender[9][11] and tend to choose activities and toys which are considered appropriate for their gender[9] (such as dolls and painting for girls, and tools and rough-housing for boys),[12] although they do not yet fully understand the implications of gender.[11] After age three, core gender identity is extremely difficult to change,[7][13] and attempts to reassign it can result in gender dysphoria.[9][14] Gender identity refinement extends into the fourth[13] to sixth years of age,[9][15] and continues into young adulthood.[13]
