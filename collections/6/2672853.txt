The first Indigenous Games (or "NAIG") were held in 1990 in Edmonton, Alberta, followed by Games in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan in 1993, Blaine, Minnesota in 1995, Victoria, British Columbia in 1997, and Winnipeg, Manitoba in 2002. Denver, Colorado in 2006 and Cowichan, British Columbia in 2008. The 2011 games were to be held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, but about a year before the games were to be held, Milwaukee withdrew its host application due to lack of financial backers. Other arrangements have, however, been made and games were indeed held in Milwaukee, July 2011 on a smaller scale (Dubbed United States Indigenous Games). The 2014 Games took place in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada.
