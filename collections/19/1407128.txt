The 35 divisions listed below include the "traditional" counties of Ireland as well as those created or re-created after the 19th century. Twenty four counties still delimit the remit of local government divisions in the Republic of Ireland (in some cases with slightly redrawn boundaries). In Northern Ireland, the counties listed no longer serve this purpose. The Irish-language names of counties in the Republic of Ireland are prescribed by ministerial order, which in the case of three newer counties, omits the word contae (county).[18] Irish names form the basis for all English-language county names except Waterford, Wexford, and Wicklow, which are of Norse origin.
