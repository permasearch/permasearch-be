The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the world's oceans, extending from the Arctic in the north to Antarctica in the south. Covering 169.2 million square kilometers, it is larger than all of the Earth's land area combined.[9] The Pacific contains 25,000 islands (over half the islands in the world), most of which are south of the equator.
