On September 6, 2018, during the first game of the 2018 season, the Eagles ran a similar trick play against the Atlanta Falcons successfully, gaining a first down. Despite the Philly Special being occasionally called "Philly Philly" due to the conversation Foles and Pederson had regarding calling that play, Pederson indicated the play in the Falcons-Eagles game is called "Philly Philly." It is notable that in Super Bowl LII, the Patriots ran a play that was essentially identical, albeit not successful, to the Philly Philly play the Eagles ran against the Falcons.[41]
