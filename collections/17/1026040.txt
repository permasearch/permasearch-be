In the history of the House, censure has been used 23 times, and most of the cases arose during the 19th century.[23][24]  In the modern history of the United States House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct (since 1966), censure has been used five times,[23] most recently in December 2010 against Charles B. Rangel (who earlier that year lost his chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee).[27]
