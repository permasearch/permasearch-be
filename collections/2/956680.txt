Normally, after their Passing Out Parade, OPs will get their class ring (or also known as OP ring) as a sign that they have graduated from the college and to commemorate their time in the college. The tradition was influenced by the similar tradition practiced by Royal Military Academy Sandhurst which was introduced by British administrators during the college's early days.
