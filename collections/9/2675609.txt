Bone involvement in sarcoidosis has been reported in 1â€“13% of cases.[50] The most frequent sites of involvement are the hands and feet, whereas the spine is less commonly affected.[67] Half of the patients with bony lesions experience pain and stiffness, whereas the other half remain asymptomatic.[67] Periostitis is rarely seen in Sarcoidosis and has been found to present itself at the femoral bone.[68][69]
