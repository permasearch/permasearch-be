Even though 35,000 French Canadians served overseas throughout the war, the conscription question resulted in French Canadians feeling more isolated than ever from the rest of Canada. They never fully supported the war effort, which resulted in the Federal government expressing deep concern over French Canada’s nationalist and anti-war stance.[7] For the first time in Canada’s brief fifty-year history, there were substantial arguments being made in favour of revoking the Constitutional Act of 1867.[8] The nation was divided between English-speaking imperialists who supported the overseas war effort and French-speaking nationalists who believed that conscription was a second attempt to impose the Conquest, therefore it needed to be resisted at all costs. The Federal Conservatives had stated on numerous occasions that conscription would not be imposed.[9] However, upon his return from London in May 1917, Borden met with his cabinet and announced that he would be imposing conscription. While in London, Borden had received a lot of pressure to send more troops to fully support the allied forces. He was convinced that Canada’s war effort was weak and only conscription could make it respectable.[10] All of his English-speaking ministers supported the idea. However his two French-Canadian ministers were hesitant. They fully understood the negative reactions that French-Canadians would have.[11] The French-Canadian nationalists who opposed conscription viewed it as neither necessary nor successful. They argued that it caused an avoidable rift between English and French-Canada.[12] The debate surrounding conscription would be one that would have a significant impact on both Federal and provincial politics for many years following World War I.
