Series 10 was the last series produced by Paul Knight, who left to produce episodes of The Knock. Although it had the most episodes—eighteen—the series focused on more of the crew's domestic lives than firefighting work. Budget cuts led to scenes being done with computer-generated imagery. Notable 'shouts' included ones at a paint factory and another at a bus depot.
