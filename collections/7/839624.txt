In 2010, enteric fermentation accounted for 43% of the total greenhouse gas emissions from all agricultural activity in the world,[34] 26% of the total greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural activity in the U.S., and 22% of the total U.S. methane emissions.[35] The meat from domestically-raised ruminants has a higher carbon equivalent footprint than other meats or vegetarian sources of protein based on a global meta-analysis of lifecycle assessment studies.[36] Methane production by animals, principally ruminants, is estimated 15â€“20% global production of methane, unless the animals were hunted in the wild.[37][38]
