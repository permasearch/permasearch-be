The vampires of House Raith feed off people's emotional energy in the form of lust, usually through sex, and this act can result in death of the hapless mortal. However, if he chooses, Thomas can also feed lightly from many individuals through intimate, personal contact. At the end of the novel White Night, it is revealed that Thomas has learned to "sip" and satiate his hunger without harming his female hairstyling clients (although he notes that they may be slightly addicted to the experience). He possesses a sort of glamor that creates a strong sexual attraction to him in both men and women, and even led to him being attacked by a Jehovah's Witness. He is unable to turn it off, which can make it difficult to hold a "normal" job.
