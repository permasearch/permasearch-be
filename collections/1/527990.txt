After Piney Winston's daughter-in-law, Donna, is killed by the One-Niners (or so it seemed), Piney travels to Oakland to get revenge. Jax sends Half-Sack to follow him and to stop him from doing anything unnecessary. However, when they get to Oakland, Half-Sack is unable to stop Piney from starting a fight in a Niners bar. It ends in a hostage situation, with Piney holding a Niner at gunpoint. When Jax and Chibs arrive and try to stop Piney from causing further trouble, Half-Sack helps Jax disarm him. They hold a meeting with Laroy, the Niners leader, who tells them that it is not he or his gang who killed Donna. The season ends with Half-Sack and the rest of SAMCRO attending Donna's funeral.[7]
