An individual with RBD may not be aware that they act out their dreams; a sleeping partner may be the only person who knows of these behaviors.[23] RBD behaviors may include yelling, screaming, laughing, crying, unintelligible talking, non-violent flailing, or more violent punching, kicking, choking, or scratching.[6][11] The reported dream enactment behaviors are frequently violent,[4] and involve a theme of being chased or attacked.[16] People with RBD may fall out of bed or injure themselves or their bed partner.[1][6][16] There may be resulting bruises, fractures, or subdural hematomas.[9] However, because people are more likely to remember or report violent dreams and behaviors—and to be referred to a specialist when injury occurs—recall or selection bias may explain the prevalence of violence reported in RBD.[6]
