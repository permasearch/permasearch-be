"USS Callister" features references to previous episodes of Black Mirror. In addition to Brooker's remark that the episode is in some ways a successor to the third-series episode "San Junipero,"[15] the neural implant used in this episode to transport users into the Infinity game bears the logo "TCKR," the company that developed the technology featured in that episode, the implication being that Callister uses the same software for their own games.[16] A reference to the second-series episode "White Bear" is found in the names of two planets visited by the crew of Daly's virtual spaceship; the planets Skillane IV and Rannoch have been named for the criminal couple of Victoria Skillane and Iain Rannoch.[17]
