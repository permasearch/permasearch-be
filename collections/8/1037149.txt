A first edition copy also exists in Yale University's Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library. It was originally purchased by Harvey Cushing in 1905, making it the first anatomical text he used to start his large collection. The library is also in possession of many reprints and forgeries of the Fabrica. [6]
