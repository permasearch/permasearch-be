Both templates where intentionally designed to allow both options, to hide the summary box, or to show it. Forcing the option never made any sense and defeated a primary objective for these episode templates back when myself and others originally designed them: to encourage people to fill out areas that were missing. In cases where this was not desired, we specifically added the flexibility to remove the box by excluding the parameter in the template. -- Ned Scott 04:07, 8 August 2013 (UTC)
