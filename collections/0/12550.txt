"The commanding heights" included foreign trade, heavy industry, communication and transport among others.[33] In practice this limited the private sector to artisan and agricultural production/trade.[35] The NEP encountered strong resistance within the Bolshevik party. Lenin had to persuade communist skeptics that "state capitalism" was a necessary step in achieving communism, while he himself harbored suspicions that the policy could be abused by private businessmen ("NEPmen").[36]
