Prior to the start of the season, Taran Killam, Jay Pharoah and Jon Rudnitsky were let go from the cast.[5][6] Killam, despite having signed a seven-year contract that would have taken him to the end of season 42, was dropped from the cast due in part to issues concerning his work directing the film Killing Gunther, which would have limited his time on the show.[7]
