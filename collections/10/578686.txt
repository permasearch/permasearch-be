where     (  ω  Q  |  P   A   ,  ω  Q  |  ¬ P   A   )   {\displaystyle (\omega _{Q|P}^{A},\omega _{Q|\lnot P}^{A})}   denotes a pair of binomial conditional opinions, as expressed by source     A   {\displaystyle A}  . The parameter      a  P     {\displaystyle a_{P}}   denotes the base rate (aka. the prior probability) of     P   {\displaystyle P}  . The pair of inverted conditional opinions is denoted     (  ω  P     |  ~    Q   A   ,  ω  P     |  ~    ¬ Q   A   )   {\displaystyle (\omega _{P{\tilde {|}}Q}^{A},\omega _{P{\tilde {|}}\lnot Q}^{A})}  . The conditional opinion      ω  Q  |  P   A     {\displaystyle \omega _{Q|P}^{A}}   generalizes the logical statement     P → Q   {\displaystyle P\to Q}  , i.e. in addition to assigning TRUE or FALSE the source     A   {\displaystyle A}   can assign any subjective opinion to the statement. The case where      ω  Q ∣ P   A     {\displaystyle \omega _{Q\mid P}^{A}}   is an absolute TRUE opinion is equivalent to source     A   {\displaystyle A}   saying that     P → Q   {\displaystyle P\to Q}   is TRUE, and the case where      ω  Q ∣ P   A     {\displaystyle \omega _{Q\mid P}^{A}}   is an absolute FALSE opinion is equivalent to source     A   {\displaystyle A}   saying that     P → Q   {\displaystyle P\to Q}   is FALSE. In the case when the conditional opinion      ω  Q  |  P   A     {\displaystyle \omega _{Q|P}^{A}}   is absolute TRUE the subjective Bayes' theorem operator         ϕ   ~      {\displaystyle {\widetilde {\phi \,}}}   of subjective logic produces an absolute FALSE conditional opinion      ω  P     |  ~    ¬ Q   A     {\displaystyle \omega _{P{\widetilde {|}}\lnot Q}^{A}}   and thereby an absolute TRUE conditional opinion      ω  ¬ P     |  ~    ¬ Q   A     {\displaystyle \omega _{\lnot P{\widetilde {|}}\lnot Q}^{A}}   which is equivalent to     ¬ Q → ¬ P   {\displaystyle \lnot Q\to \lnot P}   being TRUE. Hence, the subjective Bayes' theorem represents a generalization of both contraposition and Bayes' theorem [3].
