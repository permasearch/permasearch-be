Specifically, gene expression data demonstrated increased activity of HAT and decreased level of HDAC activity in patients with Asthma.[26] Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease showed there is an overall decrease in HDAC activity with unchanged levels of HAT activity.[27] Results have shown that there is an important role for HAT/HDAC activity balance in inflammatory lung diseases and provided insights on possible therapeutic targets.[28]
