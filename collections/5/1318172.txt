The National Trust and the National Council existed side by side for several years until the need to merge resources compelled the Executive Committee to integrate the two entities. In 1952, the boards of both organizations approved a merger of the Council into the National Trust.[13] The merger was effective the following year and was completed by 1956.[12] The National Trust became a membership organization and assumed all other functions of the National Council.
