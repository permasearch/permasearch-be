The Ford E-Series (also known as the Ford Econoline and Ford Club Wagon throughout various stages of its production) is a range of full-size vans produced by the American automaker Ford. Introduced for the 1961 model year as the replacement for the Ford F-Series panel van, four generations of the model line have been produced. In addition to cargo van and passenger van body styles, the Ford E-Series has been produced as a cutaway van chassis and stripped chassis (a chassis without bodywork).
