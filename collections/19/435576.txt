Master Elephant appears in person in the episode "The First Five" where Po organizes a reunion of the original Furious Five as part of a party that Po throws for Master Shifu. During a mission where Po teams up with the original five (minus Master Shifu who had refused to take part in the mission) to retrieve the Sword of Xi'an, a demon that had been beaten by the original five in the past, Master Elephant is possessed by Xi'an. He is eventually freed by both the current and past incarnations of the Furious Five and the sword is destroyed by Fenghuang.
