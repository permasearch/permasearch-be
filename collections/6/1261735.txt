There are two major classes of membrane lipids: glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids. Although many different membrane lipids are synthesized in our body, pathways share the same pattern. The first step is synthesizing the backbone (sphingosine or glycerol), the second step is addition of fatty acids to the back bone to make phosphatidic acid. Phosphatidic acid is further modified with the attachment of different hydrophilic head groups to the back bone. Membrane lipid biosynthesis occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.[17]
