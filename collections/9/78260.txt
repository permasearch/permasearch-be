Cytochrome c is also released from mitochondria due to formation of a channel, the mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channel (MAC), in the outer mitochondrial membrane,[29] and serves a regulatory function as it precedes morphological change associated with apoptosis.[19] Once cytochrome c is released it binds with Apoptotic protease activating factor â€“ 1 (Apaf-1) and ATP, which then bind to pro-caspase-9 to create a protein complex known as an apoptosome. The apoptosome cleaves the pro-caspase to its active form of caspase-9, which in turn activates the effector caspase-3.
