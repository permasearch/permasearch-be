Initially each cohort included, as for a Roman legion, a cavalry detachment; this should not be confused with the Equites singulares Augusti who appeared under the emperor Trajan. The Praetorian could become a cavalryman (Eques) after almost five years service in the infantry. These Praetorians remained listed in their Centuries of origin, but operated in a turma of 30 men each commanded by an Optioequitum.
