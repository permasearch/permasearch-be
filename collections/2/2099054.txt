The poem's most prevalent literary technique is imagery; it is difficult to find even one line that does not contain a vivid image. The first, and one of the most important, examples occurs on the first line: “A noiseless patient spider.” This visual image brings pictures of a small, perfectly still, spider sitting in its web. The image of the motionless spider, completely alone and isolated, as painted in the first three lines of the poem introduces the idea that the speaker feels alone in the world.
