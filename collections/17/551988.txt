Staten Island  /ˌstætən ˈaɪlənd/ is the southernmost and westernmost of the five boroughs of New York City in the U.S. state of New York. Located in the southwest portion of the city, Staten Island is the southernmost part of both the city and state of New York, with Conference House Park located at the southern tip of the island.[2] The borough is separated from New Jersey by the Arthur Kill and the Kill Van Kull, and from the rest of New York by New York Bay. With a 2017 Census–estimated population of 479,458[1] Staten Island is the least populated of the boroughs but is the third-largest in land area at 58.5 sq mi (152 km2).  The borough is coextensive with Richmond County and until 1975 was referred to as the Borough of Richmond.[3] Its flag was later changed to reflect this. Staten Island has sometimes been called "the forgotten borough" by inhabitants who feel neglected by the city government.[4][5]
