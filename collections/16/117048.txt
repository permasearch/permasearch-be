Purcell fathered six children by his wife Frances, four of whom died in infancy. His wife, as well as his son Edward (1689â€“1740) and daughter Frances, survived him.[10] Frances the elder died in 1706, having published a number of her husband's works, including the now famous collection called Orpheus Britannicus, in two volumes, printed in 1698 and 1702, respectively. Edward was appointed organist of St Clement Eastcheap, London, in 1711 and was succeeded by his son Edward Henry Purcell (d. 1765). Both men were buried in St Clement's near the organ gallery.
