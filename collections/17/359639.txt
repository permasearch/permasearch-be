Server Manager has been redesigned with an emphasis on easing management of multiple servers.[18] The operating system, like Windows 8, uses the Metro-based user interface unless installed in Server Core mode.[19] Windows Store is available in this version of Windows but is not installed by default.[20] Windows PowerShell in this version has over 2300 commandlets, compared to around 200 in Windows Server 2008 R2.[21]
