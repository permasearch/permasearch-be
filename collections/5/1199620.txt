It is important[opinion] to note that Native Americans with diabetes have a death rate three times higher than those in the non-Native population. Diabetes can shorten a person's life by approximately 15 years.[50] As of 2012, diabetes was not the leading cause of death for Native Americans itself but contributed significantly to the top leading causes of death.[36]
