Plans and studies have been in the works for high-speed rail (HSR) in Indonesia since before 2010. A new plan to build a HSR was announced by Indonesian Government in July 2015.[1] Indonesia's first – and possibly also Southeast Asia's first – high-speed rail project was expected to connect the national capital Jakarta with Bandung in neighboring West Java province, covering a distance of around 140 kilometres. Plans were also mentioned for a possible later extension of the HSR to Indonesia's second largest city, Surabaya in East Java.[2]
