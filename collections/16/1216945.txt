Ice King's crown, the source of his powers, is revealed in the episode "Evergreen" to have been created in the prehistoric past by an ice elemental named Urgence Evergreen to avert a meteor from hitting the planet. After finishing the crown, arranging it to imprint its original bearer's mind while granting the user their deepest desire, Evergreen ends up being incapacitated and is forced to entrust his apprentice Gunther to wear the crown to have him destroy the meteor in his place. But having never been taught magic by Evergreen while being treated poorly, Gunther ended up wishing to be more like his mentor from his perspective and is unable to stop the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event. The crown survived the event and would continue its first owner's wish to turn future users into insane parodies of Evergreen.
