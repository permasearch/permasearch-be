Giratina's design change was one of the first things revealed about Platinum.[3] In designing the new form, they paid attention to details; the designer redrew Giratina several times, attempting to make it look different from its form in Diamond and Pearl. They finalized its design as an "antimatter Pok√©mon". Masuda explained antimatter as well as E=MC2 to the developers. He also explained the "Reversed Mt. Fuji", which is what they call the reflection of Mt. Fuji. While Kawachimaru didn't understand it at first, he later incorporated them into the game. The Distortion World was based on these ideas, described as the "core concept" of the game. They also added the Wi-Fi Plaza and Battle Frontier modes to improve players' ability to share information with other players. An idea that the developers wanted to include was to allow players to communicate with family and friends more easily; the developers felt that the Battle Frontier realized this idea.[4]
