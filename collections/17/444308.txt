Ringer began practicing Taekwondo – the martial art and national sport of Korea – at the age of 10.[29] His skills later garnered accolades, including the title of American Taekwondo Association Texas State Champion.[29] He began shaving his head during his martial arts training to help cool off, which gave him the nickname "Avatar" due to his resemblance to Aang from the animated series.[29] When he heard about the film adaptation, he made an audition tape with his instructor and sent it to the filmmakers. He hadn't worked on a film before, but his resemblance to Aang – enhanced by painting a blue arrow on his already shaved head, swung him the role.[29] Having not acted before, Ringer was required to attend acting school a month before filming commenced.[29] Peltz was familiar with the character before submitting for the part of Katara, having faithfully watched Avatar: The Last Airbender, the animated series on which the film is based, with her younger twin brothers.[29] She describes her character as being a big role model with young girls and women, "She's really mentally and physically strong, strong-willed and -minded, but she's also caring and compassionate... The movie has a lot of values, but it's also fun. It's fantasy, but it's also a really cool battle between good and evil."[29] She explained that she initially didn't know about Rathbone starring in the Twilight films until after she met him and said that working with Shyamalan was an amazing experience.[29] Rathbone, who originally auditioned for the role of Zuko, was approached by Shyamalan to audition for the film.[30] After waiting for six months, he received a call informing him that he was cast as Sokka.[30] Rathbone stated that his favorite scenes were the fight sequences, which he prepared for by stickfighting.[30]
