Under its five-cycle testing, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rated the 2014 through 2016 model year all-electric BMW i3 (60 A·h) energy consumption at 27 kWh/100 mi (16.9 kWh/ 100 km) with a combined fuel economy at 124  miles per gallon gasoline equivalent – MPGe – (1.90 L/100 km; 149 mpg imp) with an all-electric range of 130 km (81 mi).[9][58] With these ratings the all-electric BMW i3 was the most fuel efficient EPA-certified vehicle sold in the United States of all years regardless of fuel type until November 2016, when it was surpassed by the Hyundai Ioniq Electric, rated at 136 MPGe (25 kWh/100 mi).[59][60][61] The range-extended model has lower ratings than the all-electric i3 due to the extra weight of the twin-cylinder gasoline engine used in the i3 REx.[10] Nevertheless, the i3 REx in 2014 replaced the Chevrolet Volt as the most efficient EPA-certified current year vehicle with a gasoline engine.[59][62]
