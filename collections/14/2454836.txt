During his campaign, Trump frequently gave voice to fringe or conspiracy theories.[690][691][692][693] Professor Joseph Uscinski, the co-author of American Conspiracy Theories, writes that Trump made "unabashed" and "deft and almost daily use of â€¦ conspiracy narratives" on the campaign trail.[691] According to political writer Steve Benen, unlike past political leaders, Trump did not keep fringe theories and their supporters at arm's length.[694][695][696]
