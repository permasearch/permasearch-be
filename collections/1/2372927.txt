Miller said that he became addicted to a combination of promethazine and codeine, known as "purple drank" or "lean", which he began taking to manage the stress he was enduring during his Macadelic Tour in 2012. In January 2013, Miller told Complex: "I love lean; it's great. I was not happy and I was on lean very heavy. I was so fucked up all the time it was bad. My friends couldn't even look at me the same. I was lost."[23] At the time of Miller's addiction, his childhood friend, Jimmy Murton, said: "I saw him in that mentality I remember being inâ€”you're getting fucked up because you feel like you need to. You're trying to get away from everything. For how much he was drinking, it's unbelievable that he stopped. It's definitely one of the most impressive things he's ever done." Miller quit taking promethazine in November 2012, before he started the shooting of his reality show Mac Miller and the Most Dope Family.[23]
