In 2011 Dodge introduced the Dodge Charger R/T Mopar 11 Edition. In the Mopar Edition, there are several appearance and performance changes to set it apart from the rest of the production models that year. The Mopar edition came only in the ”Pitch Black“ exterior color with a Mopar blue driver side stripe and a Mopar grille badge instead of an "R/T" badge. The interior is finished in the same black as seen on the outside except for a splash of chrome and carbon fiber dash and center console, along with a pistol grip shifter.  The Mopar blue stripe is carried to the interior as a part of the driver's front seat and the left side rear passenger seat.  The performance of the Mopar edition Charger is improved with the Super Track Pack, a 3.91 final drive gear ratio, a 3 mode traction control, heavy duty brakes, larger stability bars, front and rear strut tower bars, and a sport tuned steering rack.
