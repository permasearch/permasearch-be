Shesha and Yamini learn that Shivangi is a Naagin, and that she killed all of Shivanya's murderers. Shivangi turns Shesha into a statue and kills Yamini. Shivangi finds that Yamini, Mahendra (Rocky's father), and Rocky's friend Tanya's family included Manjusha (Tanya's mother) and Ranveer (Tanya's father) killed Ritik; additionally, they want the Naagmani. Rocky turns into an Icchadhari Naag (a male version of what Shivangi is) on his 27th birthday. Rocky helps Shivangi in killing all the murderers of Ritik. Later, Rocky inexplicably stabs Shivangi.
