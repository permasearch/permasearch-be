The remaining seven contestants were divided into teams for a roller derby challenge at the Roller Dome Emporium, where Adela, Beauty, Dana, and Jachin were chosen as the winners. On set, the models had to perform in a supermarket editorial pop-up photo shoot alongside their model mentors, Monika, Shikin, and Tu. At elimination, Beauty received the highest overall score. Jachin and Vy landed in the bottom two, and Jachin was eliminated from the competition, much to the surprise of the other contestants.
