In 1975, Ali began an affair with Veronica Porché, an actress and model. While Ali was in the Philippines for the "Thrilla in Manila" bout vs. Joe Frazier, Belinda was enraged when she saw Ali on television introducing Veronica to Ferdinand Marcos. She flew out to Manila to confront Ali and scratched his face when they argued. Belinda later said that her marriage to Ali was a "rollercoaster ride—it had its ups and its downs but it was fun". Referring to his infidelities, she said: "Tiger Woods and Arnold Schwarzenegger didn't have nothing on Muhammad Ali". She believed he had "many more" illegitimate children.[98]
