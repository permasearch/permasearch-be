Heinz introduced its octagonal glass bottle for the first time in 1889; the bottle was patented in 1890. While other glass bottle designs have existed, the octagonal glass bottle is still in use and is considered an "iconic" example of package design.[11] In the United States, the glass bottle commonly used by restaurants holds 14 ounces (400 g) of ketchup. A small bottle containing about 2.25 ounces (64 g) of ketchup also exists for hotel room service and other situations where it is desirable to serve individual meals with a more personal or luxurious presentation than might be perceived with the foil or plastic packets associated with fast food dining.
