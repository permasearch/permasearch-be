Few of the lyrics can actually be understood, as they are sung in the scat manner. The scat is interrupted every few bars for short one-liners, most of which are implicit references to the singer's poverty and the low-grade food he eats: a "wish sandwich" (where one has two slices of bread and wishes for meat in between the slices of bread), a "ricochet biscuit" (which is supposed to bounce off the wall and into one's mouth, and when it does not, "you go hungry"), a "cold-water sandwich" (or a "cool-water sandwich") which refers to consuming watermelon, and a "Sunday-go-to-meeting-bun," which is a reference to taking a little lady to church as Elwood explains in a live version of the performance. The song closes with the question, "What do you want for nothing--a rubber biscuit?"
