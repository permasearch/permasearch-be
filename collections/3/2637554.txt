Historians are divided as to how much to credit Lagrange and others for the development of Fourier theory: Daniel Bernoulli and Leonhard Euler had introduced trigonometric representations of functions,[9] and Lagrange had given the Fourier series solution to the wave equation,[9] so Fourier's contribution was mainly the bold claim that an arbitrary function could be represented by a Fourier series.[9]
