A Question of Sport is a British sports quiz show created by Nick Hunter for the BBC. The show centres on a light-hearted contest involving two teams of three sports stars, each with a regular resident team captain, competing for points by answering questions on their own and other sports over several sports-themed quiz rounds. Captains have also been playing sports-themed games alongside the quizzes in later series.
