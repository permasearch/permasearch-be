The song is translated to Finnish by Vexi Salmi and used prior to kick-off in all the home fixtures of Helsinki-based Helsingin Jalkapalloklubi. It was recorded 1973 by the first squad of the team. The title in Finnish is HOO-JII-KOO, but is better known as 'Taas kansa täyttää', as the first verse begins with these words. Direct translation to English would be 'Again Terraces Are Filled'.
