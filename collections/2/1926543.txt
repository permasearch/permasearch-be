Another effective predator is the cougar. It does not bother with quill avoidance, but tolerates them. Some individuals have been found with dozens of quills embedded in their gums to no ill effect. It can climb trees, so its favorite method is to position itself below the porcupine and knock it to the ground, where it is quickly dispatched. Other predators can attack, such as canids, but do not pose much of a threat.[23][25] In some parts of the Great Basin, cougars have greatly decreased numbers of porcupines in mountainous forests through predation.[22][32] However, in some cases porcupine quills have indeed killed cougars, although usually this is after the cougar has already consumed the porcupine.[33][34]
