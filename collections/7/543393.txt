The Roman author Vitruvius reported the health dangers of lead[121] and modern writers have suggested that lead poisoning played a major role in the decline of the Roman Empire.[122][123][l] Other researchers have criticized such claims, pointing out, for instance, that not all abdominal pain is caused by lead poisoning.[125][126] According to archaeological research, Roman lead pipes increased lead levels in tap water but such an effect was "unlikely to have been truly harmful".[127][128] When lead poisoning did occur, victims were called "saturnine", dark and cynical, after the ghoulish father of the gods, Saturn. By association, lead was considered the father of all metals.[129] Its status in Roman society was low as it was readily available[130] and cheap.[131]
