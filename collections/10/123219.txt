Edd (Samuel Vincent) is the smartest of the Eds and the most polite, mature, and considerate of the three. As a result, he is more socially accepted by the rest of the kids than Ed and Eddy, usually acting as a peacemaker or offering the rest of the kids advice. To differentiate his homophonic name from Ed and Eddy, he is referred to as Double-D. Edd has a high IQ and is top of the class in most subjects at school, though he is the physically weakest of the Eds and despises P.E. and other sporting activities. As the most creative of the trio, he is able to construct things like planes, rocket cars, and roller coasters with junk he comes across and enjoys doing so. He also is able to play pedal steel guitar, but does not like to do so often. He often speaks using complex words and struggles to speak normally in high anxiety situations. His clothing usually consists of an red/orange shirt, purple shorts, red socks, cyan shoes, and a black ski hat with two white lines on it. He sleeps in a footed onesie, and in the later seasons and the movie, he wears a tie when going to school. Double D never willingly removes his hat (except while bathing), so it is unknown what lies under it; Ed and Eddy see him twice without it. Whatever his hat hides, Edd is self-conscious about it. He is also self-conscious about a gap in his front teeth thanks to Eddy poking fun at it. He is the only one of the trio to be an only child, and his parents leave sticky notes around his house as a means of communicating with him.
