Although public attention shifted to rock music from the mid 1960s, folk singers such as Joan Baez and Tom Paxton continued to address political concerns in their music and activism. Baez's 1974 Gracias a la Vida[33] album was a response to events in Chile and included versions of songs by Nueva Canci√≥n Chilena singer-songwriters Violeta Parra and Victor Jara. Paxton albums such as Outward Bound[34] and Morning Again[35] continued to highlight political issues. They were joined by other activist musicians such as Holly Near,[36] Ray Korona, Charlie King, Anne Feeney, Jim Page, Utah Phillips and more recently David Rovics.
