For anisotropic media, the stiffness tensor      C  i j k l       {\displaystyle C_{ijkl}\,\!}   is more complicated. The symmetry of the stress tensor      σ  i j       {\displaystyle \sigma _{ij}\,\!}   means that there are at most 6 different elements of stress. Similarly, there are at most 6 different elements of the strain tensor      ε  i j       {\displaystyle \varepsilon _{ij}\,\!}   . Hence the fourth-order stiffness tensor      C  i j k l       {\displaystyle C_{ijkl}\,\!}   may be written as a matrix      C  α β       {\displaystyle C_{\alpha \beta }\,\!}   (a tensor of second order). Voigt notation is the standard mapping for tensor indices,
