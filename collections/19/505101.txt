The system includes several reagents      A  1   ,  A  2   , … ,  A  m     {\displaystyle A_{1},A_{2},\ldots ,A_{m}}   on the surface. Their surface concentrations are      c  1   ,  c  2   , … ,  c  m   .   {\displaystyle c_{1},c_{2},\ldots ,c_{m}.}   The surface is a lattice of the adsorption places. Each reagent molecule fills a place on the surface. Some of the places are free. The concentration of the free places is     z =  c  0     {\displaystyle z=c_{0}}  . The sum of all      c  i     {\displaystyle c_{i}}   (including free places) is constant, the density of adsorption places b.
