P>Barney has a toothache, so in order to have enough money for a boxing match featuring Heavyweight Champion of the World Floyd Patterstone (Floyd Patterson), Fred takes Barney to a veterinary dentist instead of one for humans. Due to the dentist's long telephone call from his wife and Barney's continued exposure to anesthetic gases during the phone call, Barney floats out of the dentist's office. A panicked Fred tries to follow Barney to bring him down, but soon both are flying high above Bedrock.
