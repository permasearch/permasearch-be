Queensland has allowed industrial production under licence since 2002,[91] where the issuance is controlled under the Drugs Misuse Act 1986.[92] Most recently, New South Wales now issues licences[93] under a law, the Hemp Industry Regulations Act 2008 (No 58), that came into effect as of 6 November 2008.[94]
