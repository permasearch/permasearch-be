On July 20, 2016, Musk detailed his new master plan for Tesla. It includes more affordable cars produced in higher volume, solar-power roofs, mid-size vehicles, SUVs and pickup trucks, as well as the refinement of autonomous vehicles and the creation of a sharing economy, in which cars can be active while the owner is not using them.[264] A Tesla Minibus would be built on the Model X platform.[265] In May 2017, Musk indicated that he might favor a 10â€“12-passenger version of the Model X over a dedicated minibus design.[266]
