The Coat of Arms granted to Sir Thomas Musgrave in the reign of Edward 111 (1327 - 1377) depicts six gold annulets, three, two and one, on a red shield. The first recorded spelling of the family name is believed to be that of Alan de Musegrave, which was dated 1228, in the "Curia Rolls of Northumberland". A branch of the family lived in the mansion of Edenhall mythology probably on Tennyson's Poem the Luck of Eden Hall based on whose fortune was assured by a lucky glass beaker which has survived from the 14th century â€” the Luck of Edenhall.[3][4]
