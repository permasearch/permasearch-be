A new crosshatch grille and revised taillight lenses were the only appearance changes made to the 1979 Grand Prix. The same models, base, LJ and SJ continued as before as did the basic engine lineup including the 231 cu in (3.8 L) Buick V6 standard on base and LJ models, the 135 hp (101 kW) 301 cu in (4.9 L) Pontiac V8 with two-barrel carburetor that was optional on both of those models, and the 150 hp (112 kW) 301 V8 with four-barrel carburetion that was standard on the SJ and optional on the other models. Transmissions remained the same as before with the three-speed manual standard with the V6 engine on the base model and automatic transmission optional. The automatic transmission was standard on LJ and SJ models and all models when a V8 engine was ordered. Again, the Pontiac V8s were not available in California, where they were replaced by Chevy 305 cu in (5.0 L) rated at 140 and 160 hp (120 kW). A new and one-year-only option this year was a four-speed manual transmission available with the 301 cu in (4.9 L) four-barrel or two-barrel V8 on all models. Only 232 4-speed/301 V8 cars were built.
