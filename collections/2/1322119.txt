The AT&T Byron Nelson is a golf tournament on the PGA Tour. It is hosted by the Salesmanship Club of 600-member civic organization, and has benefited the Club's nonprofit Momentous Institute since its inception.[citation needed] The tournament is held in May at the Four Seasons Resort and Club Dallas at Las Colinas in Irving, Texas, U.S. It is one of two PGA tournaments held in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex â€“ the only metropolitan area to host two PGA tournaments. The tournament is the leading fundraiser for charity on the PGA Tour and has raised more than $143 million.[citation needed] For much of its history, it was the only PGA Tour stop named after a professional golfer; it remains one of only two such events, along with the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Nelson commonly made an appearance during the tournament. It is organized by the Salesmanship Club of Dallas.[3]
