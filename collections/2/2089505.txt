In his The Forethought, Du Bois states, "Leaving, then, the world of the white man, I have stepped within the Veil, raising it that you may view faintly its deeper recesses, - the meaning of its religion, the passion of its human sorrow, and the struggle of its greater souls."  He concludes with, "need I add that I who speak here am bone of the bone and flesh of the flesh of them that live within the Veil?"[3]
