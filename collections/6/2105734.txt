Archaeological sites in Tasmania and on the Bass Strait Islands have been dated to between 20,000 â€“ 35,000 years ago, when sea levels were 130 metres below present level allowing Aborigines to move across the region of southern Victoria and on to the land bridge of the Bassian plain to Tasmania by at least 35,000 years ago.[6][7]
