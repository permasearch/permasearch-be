The PT Cruiser was originally conceived as a Plymouth model, before Chrysler's merger with Daimler-Benz.[citation needed] At the time, Chrysler had planned a new look for Plymouth, previewed by the Plymouth Prowler "hot rod". Styling cues from the Prowler, particularly the grille, were used to create the Plymouth Pronto concept car in 1997. The look was refined, and in 1998, another Plymouth concept called the Pronto Cruizer directly previewed the styling of the PT Cruiser. The Pronto Cruizer was designed as a modern interpretation of the Chrysler Airflow with Dodge Neon components, but the final design used a separate platform. After the new DaimlerChrysler discontinued the Plymouth marque, the PT Cruiser launched as a Chrysler model.
