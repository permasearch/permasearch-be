The Borden Twins (born May 29, 1932), Rosalyn Borden and Marilyn Borden, were twin sisters who acted together in numerous television programs from the 1950s until the 1980s.[1] They were best remembered as "Teensy" and "Weensy" in an episode of I Love Lucy entitled "Tennessee Bound". They never rose above supporting players, but the duo performed in many venues, including gigs on the nightclub circuit, as well as larger events including the Rose Bowl.  The twins also performed at numerous USO shows at home and overseas.  The sisters worked with notable performers such as Lucille Ball, Dean Martin, and Jerry Lewis, Andy Williams, Sammy Davis, Jr., Jimmy Durante, Bea Arthur, Bob Newhart and The Ritz Brothers.
