Weston-super-Mare has a small number of live music venues of note. "Scally's" hosts more established touring rock bands,[103] while the "Back Bar", "The London", and "The Imperial" hold regular open mic nights which attract a wide array of local musicians, as well as artists from further afield.[104][105] The T4 on the Beach concert had been hosted annually since 2006, up until 2012,[106] by Channel 4 youth programme T4. Well known bands and singers perform four or fewer of their hits. However, the vocals are mimed as the event is being produced for live TV broadcast.[107] Each summer the beach is also used as the venue for the Weston-super-Mare Sand Sculpture Festival.[108]
