William the Conqueror invaded England in 1066, defeating the Anglo-Saxon King Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings and placing the country under Norman rule. This campaign was followed by fierce military operations known as the Harrying of the North between 1069â€“70, extending Norman authority across the north of England. William's system of government was broadly feudal in that the right to possess land was linked to service to the king, but in many other ways the invasion did little to alter the nature of the English economy.[1] Most of the damage done in the invasion was in the north and the west of England, some of it still recorded as "wasteland" in 1086.[2] Many of the key features of the English trading and financial system remained in place in the decades immediately after the conquest.[2]
