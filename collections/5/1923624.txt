The first season begins with Alex being brought to Division from Death row after a deliberately botched robbery attempt. While inside Division, Alex forges a friendship with Thom, a recruit who has nearly achieved agent-status. Jaden, another recruit, immediately becomes antagonistic towards Alex. Alex also meets Percy, Division's leader, and Michael, Nikita's former mentor and romantic interest, who trains the recruits.
