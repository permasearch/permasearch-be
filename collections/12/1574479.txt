Alexander argues that the War on Drugs has a devastating impact on inner city Black American communities, on a scale entirely out of proportion to the actual dimensions of criminal activity taking place within these communities. During the past three decades, the US prison population has exploded from 300,000 to more than two million, with the majority of the increase due to drug convictions.[9] This has led to the US having the world's highest incarceration rate. The US incarceration rate is eight times that of Germany, a comparatively developed large democracy.[10] Alexander claims that the US is unparalleled in the world in focusing enforcement of federal drug laws on racial and ethnic minorities. In the capital city of Washington, D.C. three out of four young African American males are expected to serve time in prison.[11] While studies show that quantitatively Americans of different races consume illegal drugs at similar rates,[12][verification needed] in some states black men have been sent to prison on drug charges at rates twenty to fifty times those of white men.[13] The proportion of Black American men with some sort of criminal record approaches 80% in some major US cities, and they become marginalized, part of what Alexander calls "a growing and permanent undercaste".[14][15]
