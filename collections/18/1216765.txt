The next morning Justine quickly packs a suitcase. While waiting at the light to turn toward either the hotel or the Retail Rodeo store, she assess her future if she stays versus if she runs away and becomes a fugitive with Holden. She decides to stay.  She arrives at Retail Rodeo and goes to the manager's office, telling him where Holden is hiding and how long he will be there. After arriving home, she watches a news report saying that the police have surrounded the hotel where Holden is staying and that Holden shot and killed himself. The next day, Bubba shows up at Retail Rodeo and tells Justine that Phil opened a statement from the credit card company, which listed the motel that Justine paid for with the card. Bubba then begs Justine not to tell Phil about their sexual encounter.  When Justine arrives home, Phil is looking at the credit card statement and tearfully asks Justine if she has been having an affair.  After she says, "yes",  Phil strikes her. Later, Phil expresses remorse at hitting his wife and asked her if the baby is his. Wanting to spare Phil any more pain and protect herself, she tells him that he is the father. Phil insists on knowing who she had an affair with.  When Justine says it doesn't matter, Phil concludes it's Corny, the security guard who invited them to Bible study.  When Justine arrives at work the next morning, Cheryl attempts to cover up her facial bruises with make-up just as Corny walks by.  His arm is in a cast and his face beat up.  Cheryl informs Justine two "beefy guys" with baseball bats and face masks beat him up.
