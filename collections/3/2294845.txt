Earth is threatened by an enormously powerful octopus-like monster who destroyed 70% of the Moon, permanently rending it into the shape of a crescent. The monster claims that within a year he will destroy the Earth, but he offers mankind a chance to avert this fate. In class 3-E; the End Class of Kunugigaoka Junior High School, he starts working as a homeroom teacher where he teaches his students regular subjects, as well as the ways of assassination. The Japanese government promises a reward of ¥10 billion (i.e. 100 million USD) to whoever among the students succeeds in killing the monster, whom they have named "Koro-sensei" (殺せんせー, Korosensē, a pun on korosenai (殺せない, unkillable) and sensei (先生, teacher)). However, this proves to be an almost impossible task, as not only does he have several superpowers at his disposal, including the capacity of moving at Mach 20, but he is also the best teacher they've ever had, helping them to improve their grades, individual skills, and perspectives for the future.
