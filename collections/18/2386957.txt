In conclusion, Judge Manton stated that masterpieces are not the product of "men given to obscenty or lustful thoughtsâ€” men who have no Master". He instead appealed to higher purposes for good literature; to serve the need of the people for "a moral standard", to be "noble and lasting", and to "cheer, console, purify, or enoble the life of people".[28]
