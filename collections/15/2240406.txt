In August 2009, New York Governor David Paterson proposed the Child Passenger Protection Act, which would make it a felony to drive while intoxicated if a passenger under the age of 16 is in a vehicle.[30] The proposal became known as Leandra's Law, following the October 2009 death of 11-year-old Leandra Rosado, a passenger in a vehicle whose driver was drunk.[52] The Child Passenger Protection Act was signed into New York law on November 18, 2009.[53]
