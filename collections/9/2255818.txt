From the commercial perspective, the most important phosphine is triphenylphosphine, several million kilograms being produced annually. It is prepared from the reaction of chlorobenzene, PCl3, and sodium.[6] Phosphines of a more specialized nature are usually prepared by other routes.[8] Phosphorus halides undergo Nucleophilic displacement by organometallic reagents such as Grignard reagents. Conversely, some syntheses entail nucleophilic displacement of phosphide anion equivalents ("R2Pâˆ’") by aryl- and alkyl halides. Primary (RPH2) and secondary phosphines (RRPH and R2PH) add to alkenes in presence of a strong base (e.g., KOH in DMSO). Markovnikov's rules apply. Similar reactions occur involving alkynes.[9] Base is not required for electron-deficient alkenes (e.g., derivatives of acrylonitrile) and alkynes.
