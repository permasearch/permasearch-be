During the 2018 Game Developers Conference, Atari announced that the unit would be called the Atari VCS.[12] Pre-orders for the console and controllers started on May 30, 2018 exclusively via Indiegogo, with shipping expected in quarter 2 of 2019; the configurations included the wood-veneer front panel “Collector’s Edition” model, and an all-black with red-orange highlights “Onyx” console model. A base system, consisting of a console and joystick controller ran from $279 to $299.[13][14] Within the first day, the Atari VCS saw more than US$2.25 million in pre-orders, far exceeding the anticipated US$100 thousand they were seeking to start production.[15]
