On July 25, 2017, Chicago Cubs infielder Javier Baez went 0 for 5, recording a platinum sombrero. On the same day, Seattle Mariners designated hitter Nelson Cruz went 0 for 6 with five strikeouts, also recording a platinum sombrero. This marked the first time in Major League history in which two players from two different games achieved platinum sombreros in the same day (although due to extra innings, Cruz's fifth strikeout technically occurred on July 26).
