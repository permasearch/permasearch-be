In Ahmadiyya theology, the terms "Messiah" and "Mahdi" are synonymous terms for one and the same person.[15] The term "Mahdi" means guided by God, thus implying a direct ordainment by God of a divinely chosen individual.[57] According to Ahmadiyya thought, Messiahship is a phenomenon through which a special emphasis is given on the transformation of a people by way of offering suffering for the sake of God instead of giving suffering (i.e. refraining from revenge).[citation needed] Ahmadis believe that this special emphasis was given through the person of Jesus and Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835â€“1908)[14] among others.
