With the publication of The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660â€“1783 in 1890, Navy Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan was immediately hailed as the world's outstanding naval theorist by the leaders of Europe. Roosevelt paid very close attention to Mahan's emphasis that only a nation with the world's most powerful fleet could dominate the world's oceans, exert its diplomacy to the fullest, and defend its own borders.[29][30] He incorporated Mahan's ideas into his views on naval strategy for the remainder of his career.[31][32]
