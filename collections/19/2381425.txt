On September 21, 1989, Mount Pleasant was hit by Hurricane Hugo, a Category Four hurricane. While the city was spared from the worst of the storm (Category 4 conditions were suffered by areas further north of the city), the city and its neighboring barrier islands were still hard-hit. Children who lived through the storm were featured in an early episode of Nickelodeon's Nick News, along with children from Hurricane Andrew. The city experienced its largest growth spurt a year after the storm as more people moved to the area, increasing in a decade from a population of roughly 23,000 in 1990 to one of roughly 47,000 in 2000.
