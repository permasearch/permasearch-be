Greno and Howard were not particularly interested in casting solely A-list actors as the voices of main characters Flynn and Rapunzel.[16] Instead, the directors simply searched for actors who had "the right voice" for these characters.[17] Writing for ReelViews, film critic James Berardinelli felt that the directors' decision mirrored "Disney's approach during the late 1980s and early 1990s, when big name stars were often bypassed in favor of lesser known talents".[18] Hundreds of actors and singers auditioned and were considered for the role of Rapunzel's love interest,[19] among them comedian Dan Fogler and American Idol alum Clay Aiken.[11][20][21] However, the role of Flynn Rider was ultimately won by American actor Zachary Levi because he, according to Greno, "nailed" his audition.[1] Levi auditioned for the role after he first received a telephone call from his agent informing him about the film. Identifying himself as "a huge Disney nut", Levi was immediately "sold" on the project.[22] His interest was further cemented by the fact that he would also be providing the character's singing voice.[23] Additionally, Levi appears to have a history playing male "characters who are surrounded by tough, strong women".[24] Required to audition a song in the style of a singer-songwriter, Levi decided to perform James Taylor's "Sweet Baby James" for the directors.[25]
