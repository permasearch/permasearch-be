Legacy mode is the mode used by 16-bit ("protected mode" or "real mode") and 32-bit operating systems. In this mode, the processor acts like a 32-bit x86 processor, and only 16-bit and 32-bit code can be executed. Legacy mode allows for a maximum of 32 bit virtual addressing which limits the virtual address space to 4 GB.[11](p14)(p24)(p118) 64-bit programs cannot be run from legacy mode.
