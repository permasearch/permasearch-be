Despite mounting pressure to resign, Toshack remained in charge for the start of the next qualifying campaign. However, on 5 September 2010, he offered his resignation from the Wales job following a 1â€“0 away defeat to Montenegro in their first Euro 2012 qualifying match.[70] He left the job by mutual consent on 9 September 2010,[71] although he had stated his desire to remain in the job for the two following qualifying matches.[72] During his six year tenure with Wales, a total of 18 players retired from international duty but he also handed debuts to numerous players, including many of the side that would go on to reach the semi-final of UEFA Euro 2016.[73]
