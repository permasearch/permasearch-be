The album's production is attributed to Q-Tip, with longtime hip-hop engineer Blair Wells given co-producer credit.[1][13] The group's DJ, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, was unable to co-produce the album with Q-Tip, as he was producing the Luke Cage soundtrack with Adrian Younge at the time;[14] therefore, his name does not appear in the album's credits.[1] Scratching credits on the album are instead attributed to DJ Scratch.[1]
