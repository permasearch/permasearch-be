In the meanwhile, Darius began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his Egyptian subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition.[17] Darius then died whilst preparing to march on Egypt, and the throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes I.[101] Xerxes crushed the Egyptian revolt, and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of Greece.[102] The epic second Persian invasion of Greece finally began in 480 BC, and the Persians met with initial success at the battles of Thermopylae and Artemisium.[103] However, defeat at the Battle of Salamis would be the turning point in the campaign,[104] and the next year the expedition was ended by the decisive Greek victory at the Battle of Plataea.[105]
