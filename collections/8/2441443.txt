The Buccaneers' only Super Bowl championship was won in Super Bowl XXXVII, at the conclusion of the 2002 season. This was the teams' only Super Bowl appearance, having reached the NFC conference championship on two other occasions. The Buccaneers have been divisional champions six times, three of them in the NFC Central and the other three in NFC South. They were the first team to win the NFC South after the NFL restructure in 2002. In their 41-year history, the Buccaneers have played over 500 regular and post-season games and have appeared in the post-season ten times.
