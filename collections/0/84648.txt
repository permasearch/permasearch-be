Amorphous calcium phosphate in combination with casein phosphopeptide has been used as a dental treatment to treat incipient dental decay. ACP sees its main use as an occluding agent which aids in reducing sensitivity. Studies have shown that it does form a remineralized phase of hydroxyapatite consistent with the natural enamel. In addition, clinical studies have shown that patients who whiten their teeth have reduced sensitivity after treatment.[8] It is believed that ACP hydrolyzes under physiological temperatures and pH to form octacalcium phosphate as an intermediate, and then surface apatite.
