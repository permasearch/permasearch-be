The song is based around an electric guitar riff that Leng describes as "snarling".[68] Written in the key of E, the tune incorporates chord changes that musicologist Wilfrid Mellers once admired as "audacious";[69] musically, Harrison biographer Elliot Huntley suggests, the composition mirrors the "intense atmosphere" at Twickenham in January 1969.[70] Referring to the released recording, author Ian Inglis views "Wah-Wah" as a hard rock song where the "forceful rhythm" conveys "the momentum of [Harrison's] anger".[71]
