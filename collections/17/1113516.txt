Entering 2013, Bradley ranked 32nd overall on the MLB.com Top 100 Prospects list.[3] After an outstanding spring training, on March 31, manager John Farrell announced that Bradley would be the Opening Day left fielder on April 1 at Yankee Stadium.[4] Although he went hitless in two at-bats, Bradley had three walks, scored two runs, drove in one run, and made a couple of hustle plays on the basepath and in the field in the Red Sox' 8â€“2 win over the Yankees.[5]
