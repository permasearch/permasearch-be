Scriptwriting an episode consumes three weeks of the production schedule.[39][40] As the comedy's sole writer, Reed creates the first draft during pre-production, which he submits to his team of producers and art directors. From there, they analyze the script for each character, cast guest stars, and create basic concept designs, before Reed develops a final script to submit to FXX.[39][40] A typical Archer episode goes through a page of dialogue per minute.[41]
