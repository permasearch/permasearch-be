African American soldiers and sailors were banned from fighting on the front lines, and were assigned menial tasks in place of positions in combat. However, some African Americans escaped this fate. In some cases of emergency or shortage, African Americans were brought to the front lines like during the Invasion of Normandy and the Battle of the Bulge. One mess-attendant Dorie Miller during the Attack on Pearl Harbor left his assigned station to fire at the attacking planes. Some special African American units, such as the Tuskegee Airmen, also fought in combat.
