Although the Yosemite-size walls offer a host of challenging lines, technical climbing activity was not recorded before 1968. The first modern routes, climbed in the early 1970s, are described in several books.[12][13] The rock is Aztec Sandstone, a relatively solid variety with a hard surface varnish. Many climbs involve ascents of single crack systems hundreds of feet long.
