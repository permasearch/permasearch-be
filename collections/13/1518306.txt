Under a supervision requirement the offender is place under the supervision of a probation office for a period of up to three years. During this supervision period the offender must attend appointments with the officer or with any other person as directed by the supervising officer. By the Criminal Justice Act 2003,[1] such a requirement may be imposed for the purpose of 'promoting the offender's rehabilitation'.[23]
