Concerned largely with administrative and sociopolitical innovation, Shang Yang (390â€“338 BC) was a leading reformer of his time.[16][17] His numerous reforms transformed the peripheral Qin state into a militarily powerful and strongly centralized kingdom. Much of Legalism was "principally the development of certain ideas" that lay behind his reforms, and it was these that helped lead to Qin's ultimate conquest of the other states of China in 221 BC.[18][19]
