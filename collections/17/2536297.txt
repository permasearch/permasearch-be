Another monk named Yuusei comes and tells them to go back to customers or they yell on them. Yuusei tells Ema that family love is true love and that will keep them together in conflict. During dinner, Ema admits to all she wants to be more like family at which all agree or rather so. That night, Kaname thanks Ema for coming.
