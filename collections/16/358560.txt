The British explorers David Livingstone and William Oswell, setting out from a mission station in the northern Cape Colony, are believed to have been the first white men to cross the Kalahari desert in 1849.[27] The Royal Geographical Society later awarded Livingstone a gold medal for his discovery of Lake Ngami in the desert.[28]
