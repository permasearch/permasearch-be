Israel limits the amount of load the trucks may carry, ostensibly for security reasons. In the past, the total height of goods stacked on trucks was not allowed to exceed 1.2 meters. The Israeli authorities did, however, not explain why they did not use to its full potential the scanner, donated by the Dutch government and calibrated according to the militaryâ€™s specifications, which can scan at a height of 2 meters. In February 2016, the allowed height was increased to 1.5 meters.[51]
