The NYC also carried a substantial tax burden from governments that saw rail infrastructure as a source of property tax revenues: taxes that were not imposed upon interstate highways. To make matters worse, most railroads, including the NYC, were saddled with a World War IIâ€“era tax of 15% on passenger fares, which remained until 1962, 17 years after the end of the war.[6]
