A total of 30 research institutions have now carried out parallel censuses of large forest plots. There are four such large-scale census projects in Africa, nine in Latin America, and 25 in Asia. Moreover, the census program has been expanded to include temperate and subtropical forests in China. Approximately 4.5 million individual trees of 8500 species are being monitored.[1] Numerous scientific research reports on tree species diversity, distribution, life span, and growth rates have been published based on these plots.
