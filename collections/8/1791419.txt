Dreadnought was the first battleship to use steam turbines in place of the older reciprocating triple-expansion steam engines. She had two paired sets of Parsons direct-drive turbines, each of which was housed in a separate engine-room and drove two shafts. The wing shafts were coupled to the high-pressure ahead and astern turbines and the low-pressure turbines to the inner shafts. A cruising turbine was also coupled to each inner shaft, although these were not used often and were eventually disconnected.[23] Each of the four main turbines drove a 8-foot, 10-inches (2.69 m) diameter three-bladed propeller with 8.37Â ft pitch, 33 sq ft for 5750 shp at 320 rpm.[24]
