The olive ridley is classified as vulnerable according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), and is listed in Appendix I of CITES. These listings were largely responsible for halting the large scale commercial exploitation and trade of olive ridley skins.[1] The Convention on Migratory Species and the Inter-American Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea Turtles have also provided olive ridleys with protection, leading to increased conservation and management for this marine turtle. National listings for this species range from Endangered to Threatened, yet enforcing these sanctions on a global scale has been unsuccessful for the most part. Conservation successes for the olive ridley have relied on well-coordinated national programs in combination with local communities and nongovernment organizations, which focused primarily on public outreach and education. Arribada management has also played a critical role in conserving olive ridleys.[15] Lastly, enforcing the use of turtle excluder devices in the shrimp trawling industry has also proved effective in some areas.[1] Globally, the olive ridley continues to receive less conservation attention than its close relative, the Kemp's ridley (L. kempii). Also, many schools arrange trips for students to carry out the conservation project, especially in India.
