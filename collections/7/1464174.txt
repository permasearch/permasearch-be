For example, when Warren County High School re-opened, it became an all-black school, since no white students enrolled. Their parents had opted instead to send their children to the John S. Mosby Academy (named after a Confederate cavalry leader), one of many "segregation academies", which were private schools opened throughout the state as part of the massive resistance plan. Over the course of the 1960s, white students gradually returned to Warren County High School. The Mosby Academy closed eventually, becoming the county's middle school.
