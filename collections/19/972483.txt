Roth Cornet of IGN awarded the episode an 8.5 out of 10, denoting a "great" episode. She praised the final scene, and said that Pam's decision was "a gorgeously simple emotional shift". She was complimentary towards the balance between characters and felt that "the rest of the episode was entertaining and well constructed, if not earth shatteringly hilarious."[12] Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode four out of five stars, summarizing that "An otherwise funny episode of The Office, highlighted by Toby's awkwardness, Dwight's craziness and Kevin's pride, was held back by yet another trip down Pam and Jim's boring avenue of problems."[13]
