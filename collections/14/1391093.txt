Some accounts suggest that Indian emperor Akbar's cooks would flavor yogurt with mustard seeds and cinnamon.[19] Another early account of a European encounter with yogurt occurs in French clinical history: Francis I suffered from a severe diarrhea which no French doctor could cure. His ally Suleiman the Magnificent sent a doctor, who allegedly cured the patient with yogurt.[19][20] Being grateful, the French king spread around the information about the food which had cured him.
