From 1951â€“54 Bannister trained at the track at Paddington Recreation Ground in Maida Vale while he was a medical student at nearby St Mary's Hospital. There are two Bannister plaques at the pavilion, both unveiled by him on 10 September 2000; a circular blue plaque and a rectangular historic plaque containing additional information.[11] According to the latter, Bannister was able to train for just an hour each day due to his medical studies.
