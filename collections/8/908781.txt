Service: In tonight's service, Wendy Williams, Shaunie O'Neal and Elizabeth Rohm were special guests. A tableside appetizer of coffee-crusted filet mignon was served by Fernando and Roe. Both teams flew through appetizers without any trouble thanks to vocal leadership from JR and Sade (though Katie was getting annoyed with her whilst she did well on appetizers), only to get stalled immediately on the entrees. In the blue kitchen, Bryant served mushy, overcooked fish on the first table, and Frank burnt the garnishes, leading Chef Ramsay to order the team into the pantry for a meeting. However, Bryant undercooked his next order of fish, causing Ramsay to throw him and his partner on the fish station, Sterling (who was angered, as he felt he had done nothing wrong), out of service. The team started getting the entrees out after Steve took over the fish, but Frank was also thrown out for not only burning another set of garnishes, but bringing it up three minutes early. Despite this, the team was able to successfully complete the service. For the women, Kalen kept undercooking the meat, in large part because she constantly opened the oven door to check on it, which sous chef Andi rebuked her for. The team eventually got their first entrees out, but on Wendy Williams' table Kalen overcooked the meat and La Tasha also served up raw salmon. This was the last straw for Ramsay, who threw the entire team out. Despite having three chefs ejected, the men were named the winners for finishing their first service and Ramsay, further disappointed that the women had not been able to repeat their performance in the first service, told the women to nominate two chefs for elimination.
