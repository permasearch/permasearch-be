Aristotle described three "modes of persuasion," or "appeals."[6] The first dealt with the matter of the case (logos), the second dealt with the character of the speaker (ethos), and the third dealt with the emotions of the audience (pathos).[7] Each mode of persuasion can be inventional, helping an orator create an effective argument.
