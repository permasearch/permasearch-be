The first National Debt Clock was installed on February 20, 1989.[4] The national debt stood at US$2.7 trillion that year. The original 11-by-26-foot (3.4 m × 7.9 m) clock was constructed at a cost of $100,000.[5] It cost $500 per month[5] to maintain the display's 305 lightbulbs.[3] It was mounted on a now-demolished Durst building at Sixth Avenue near 42nd Street (a block from Times Square), facing the north side of 42nd Street and Bryant Park.[6] Built by the New York sign company Artkraft Strauss, the clock featured a dot-based segment display emulating the then-typical character resolution of 5-by-7. Similar to the second clock, the updating mechanism was such that the display was set to the estimated speed of debt growth (odometer-style) and adjusted weekly according to the latest numbers published by the United States Treasury.[5][7][8] Seymour Durst vowed that the clock would "be up as long as the debt or the city lasts," and that "if it bothers people, then it's working."[9]
