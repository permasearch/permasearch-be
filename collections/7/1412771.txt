The coconut palm, Cocos nucifera, is not native to Florida (nor anywhere else in the United States). Its presence in what is today Palm Beach County is due to the shipwreck of the Spanish ship Providencia in 1878, near today's Mar-a-Lago. It was traveling from Havana  to Cádiz, Spain with a cargo of coconuts.[40] The shipwreck was within walking distance of the shore—the Florida State Archives conserves a picture[41]—and a deliberate grounding so as to obtain an insurance payout has been proposed.[42] The coconuts were salvaged, too many to be eaten, and thousands were planted.[43][44][45]  A lush grove of palm trees soon grew on what was later named Palm Beach.[46]
