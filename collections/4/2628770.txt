The song is partly inspired by West's relationship with model Amber Rose.[11][12] West originally met Rose in 2008, and they subsequently developed a romantic relationship,[13] before having a dramatic break-up in 2010; Rose cited allegations of adultery.[14] Rose also said that West had written the song about their relationship, commenting that West "talked reckless about me on his album".[12][14]
