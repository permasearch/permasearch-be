Tao (Chinese: 道; pinyin: dào) literally means "way", but can also be interpreted as road, channel, path, doctrine, or line.[50] In Taoism, it is "the One, which is natural, spontaneous, eternal, nameless, and indescribable. It is at once the beginning of all things and the way in which all things pursue their course."[51] It has variously been denoted as the "flow of the universe",[52] a "conceptually necessary ontological ground",[53] or a demonstration of nature.[54] The Tao also is something that individuals can find immanent in themselves.[55]
