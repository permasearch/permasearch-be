Some bacteria utilize thiosulfate anion as a terminal electron acceptor, reducing it to sulfide. If this occurs, the newly formed hydrogen sulfide (H 2S) reacts with ferrous sulfate in the medium to form ferrous sulfide, which is visible as a black precipitate. Examples of sulfide-producing bacteria include Salmonella, Proteus, Citrobacter and Edwardsiella species. The blackening of the medium is almost always observed in the butt (bottom) of the medium.
