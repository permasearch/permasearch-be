The agents of the Catholic Church wrote detailed accounts of the Maya, in support of their efforts at evangelization, and absorption of the Maya into the Spanish Empire.[101] This was followed by various Spanish priests and colonial officials who left descriptions of ruins they visited in YucatÃ¡n and Central America.[102] In 1839, American traveller and writer John Lloyd Stephens set out to visit a number of Maya sites with English architect and draftsman Frederick Catherwood.[103] Their illustrated accounts of the ruins sparked strong popular interest, and brought the Maya to the attention of the world.[101] The later 19th century saw the recording and recovery of ethnohistoric accounts of the Maya, and the first steps in deciphering Maya hieroglyphs.[104]
