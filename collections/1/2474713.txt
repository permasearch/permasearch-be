In 1483 Richard III, younger brother of Edward IV, started to build a chapel to commemorate the battle.[98] Richard died at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485 and the building was never completed. It eventually fell into disrepair and collapsed.[99] The ruins of the structure were evident five centuries later.[23] In 1929, a stone cross supposedly from the chapel was used to create the Towton Cross (also known as Lord Dacre's Cross) to commemorate those who died in the battle.[100] Several mounds on the battlefield were thought to contain casualties of the battle, although historians believe these to be tumuli of much earlier origin.[101][102] More burial sites related to the battle are found on Chapel Hill and around Saxton.[23] Lord Dacre was buried at the Church of All Saints in Saxton and his tomb was reported in the late 19th century to be well maintained, although several of its panels had been weathered away.[103] The bur tree from which Dacre's killer shot his arrow was cut down by the late 19th century,[104] leaving its stump on the battlefield. Centuries after the battle, relics that have been found in the area include rings, arrowheads and coins.[23]
