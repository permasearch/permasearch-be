Trainor recorded a demo of the song and later met Paul Pontius—the A&R for Epic Records chairman L.A. Reid—and sang the track for him. Even though admittedly nervous, she next sang it for Reid while accompanying herself on the ukulele.[6] After signing Trainor to Epic, Reid made a decision the final cut would be the same version as the demo but with additional mastering.[6][19][21]
