The Trotters return to the mansion a week later to clean the chandeliers, though the Lord and Lady are away on holiday. Grandad goes upstairs to unscrew the holding bolt for one of the chandeliers while Del and Rodney climb up on step ladders with a blanket ready to catch it. However, unbeknown to Del and Rodney (and the audience), Grandad is actually loosening the bolt for the adjacent chandelier. He knocks the bolt out, and as Del and Rodney are ready to catch their chandelier, the second chandelier plummets to the ground and smashes to pieces. After verifying with the butler that they never gave any of their contact details to the Ridgemeres, the Trotters run away as fast as they can and escape from the mansion in their van (although by law, the chandeliers will be covered by home insurance).
