DIA's intelligence operations extend beyond the zones of combat, and approximately half of its employees serve overseas at hundreds of locations and U.S. Embassies in 140 countries.[6] The agency specializes in collection and analysis of human-source intelligence (HUMINT), both overt and clandestine, while also handling U.S. military-diplomatic relations abroad.[7] DIA concurrently serves as the national manager for the highly technical measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT) and the Defense Department manager for counterintelligence programs. The agency has no law enforcement authority, but it is sometimes portrayed so in American popular culture.
