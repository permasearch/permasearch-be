Murray Langston was born in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada and left home at the age of 15 because his parents—disabled and financially strapped—could not afford to raise him and his younger siblings. He emigrated to the United States by joining the U.S. Navy, serving as a sailor during the Vietnam War but never saw any actual combat.
