"Chaiyya Chaiyya" (English: [walk] in shade) is an Indian song from the 1998 Hindi film Dil Se.. directed by Mani Ratnam. The song was composed by A.R. Rahman, written by Gulzar, and sung by Sukhwinder Singh and Sapna Awasthi. It quickly became popular upon the release and its music video gained cult status, partly because it was filmed on a moving train. The song is based on Sufi music and Urdu poetry.[1] The Tamil version is called "Thaiyya Thaiyya", which was also popular among Tamils.
