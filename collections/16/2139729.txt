The first Norwich Airport was set up on a former First World War aerodrome on Mousehold Heath under what is now the Heartsease housing estate. It opened in 1933, and was used by Boulton & Paul for aircraft test flying and other recreational activities. This fell into disuse in the early part of the Second World War, and by the end of it had been too built upon to be used again.
