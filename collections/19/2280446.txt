Paracelsus' mother probably died in 1502,[17] after which Paracelsus' father moved to Villach, Carinthia where he worked as a physician, attending to the medical needs of the pilgrims and inhabitants of the cloister.[17] Paracelsus was educated by his father in botany, medicine, mineralogy, mining, and natural philosophy.[15] He also received a profound humanistic and theological education from local clerics and the convent school of St. Paul's Abbey in the Lavanttal.[17] He specifically accounts for being tutored by Johannes Trithemius, abbot of Sponheim.[citation needed] At the age of 16 he started studying medicine at the University of Basel, later moving to Vienna. He gained his doctorate degree from the University of Ferrara in 1515 or 1516.[17][18]
