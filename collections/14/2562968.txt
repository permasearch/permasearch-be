In response to a given problem situation (      P S   1     {\displaystyle \mathrm {PS} _{1}}  ), a number of competing conjectures, or tentative theories (     T T    {\displaystyle \mathrm {TT} }  ), are systematically subjected to the most rigorous attempts at falsification possible. This process, error elimination (     E E    {\displaystyle \mathrm {EE} }  ), performs a similar function for science that natural selection performs for biological evolution. Theories that better survive the process of refutation are not more true, but rather, more "fit"â€”in other words, more applicable to the problem situation at hand (      P S   1     {\displaystyle \mathrm {PS} _{1}}  ). Consequently, just as a species' biological fitness does not ensure continued survival, neither does rigorous testing protect a scientific theory from refutation in the future. Yet, as it appears that the engine of biological evolution has, over many generations, produced adaptive traits equipped to deal with more and more complex problems of survival, likewise, the evolution of theories through the scientific method may, in Popper's view, reflect a certain type of progress: toward more and more interesting problems (      P S   2     {\displaystyle \mathrm {PS} _{2}}  ). For Popper, it is in the interplay between the tentative theories (conjectures) and error elimination (refutation) that scientific knowledge advances toward greater and greater problems; in a process very much akin to the interplay between genetic variation and natural selection.
