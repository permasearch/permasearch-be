Mali's military forces consist of an army, which includes land forces and air force,[69] as well as the paramilitary Gendarmerie and Republican Guard, all of which are under the control of Mali's Ministry of Defense and Veterans, headed by a civilian.[70] The military is underpaid, poorly equipped, and in need of rationalization.[70]
