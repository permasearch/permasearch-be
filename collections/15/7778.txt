The Accord played very little role in the 1988 Federal election, as all three parties supported the Accord and the Canadaâ€“United States Free Trade Agreement was the dominant issue. Bourassa's Liberals, who supported free trade, lent tacit support to the federal Progressive Conservatives and their campaign in favour of the agreement. This support was later speculated to have been a cause of a disconnect between left wing intellectuals and support for the Accord,[33] and was cited by the Manitoba NDP for their more lukewarm attitude toward the amendments after Pawley's retirement.[30]
