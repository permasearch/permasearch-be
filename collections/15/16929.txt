The Republican government then launched an all-out campaign to reconnect their territory in the Battle of the Ebro, from 24 July until 26 November, where Franco personally took command.[221] The campaign was unsuccessful, and was undermined by the Franco-British appeasement of Hitler in Munich. The agreement with Britain effectively destroyed Republican morale by ending hope of an anti-fascist alliance with Western powers.[222] The retreat from the Ebro all but determined the final outcome of the war.[221] Eight days before the new year, Franco threw massive forces into an invasion of Catalonia.[223]
