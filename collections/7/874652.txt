A speed table (or flat top hump or raised pedestrian crossing) is designed as a long speed hump with a flat section in the middle. Speed tables are generally long enough for the entire wheelbase of a passenger car to rest on top.[23] The long, flat design allows cars to pass without slowing as significantly as with speed humps or cushions.[24] Because they slow cars less than similar devices, speed tables are often used on roads with typical residential speed limits.
