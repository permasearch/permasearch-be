In the season 11 finale, "Shattered", Marlowe is taken hostage, along with Detective Benson and Dr. Warner, in the morgue by a distraught mother of a dead boy. The mother shoots Dr. Warner and Benson and Marlowe must take action to save her life. In talking the mother down, Marlowe says she knows what it is like to be in pain as she reveals that she was diagnosed with an "aggressive" type of cancer and had a bilateral radical mastectomy a year before taking the job at SVU. Marlowe makes the mother drop the gun by picking up the dead boy and saying that he needs his mother and handing him to her. Marlowe is last seen looking increasingly upset. ADA Gillian Hardwicke replaces Marlowe as SVU's permanent ADA at the beginning of season 12.
