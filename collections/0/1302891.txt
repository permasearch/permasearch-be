During the final court date, which took place on April 17, 1980, Vaughan was sentenced with two years of probation and was prohibited from leaving Texas.[66] Along with a stipulation of entering treatment for drug abuse, he was required to "avoid persons or places of known disreputable or harmful character"; he refused to comply with both of these orders.[67] After a lawyer was hired, his probation officer had the sentence revised to allow him to work outside of the state.[66] The incident later caused him to refuse maid service while staying in hotels during concert tours.[68]
