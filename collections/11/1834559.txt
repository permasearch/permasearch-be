In a 2009 article for TV Squad, Mike Moody said the episode's "sweetest moment" is at the end when Kompowsky and Bart perform the birthday song for Lisa.[31] Likewise, writer Al Jean listed that scene as one of his five favorite moments from The Simpsons in 2003.[43] The reaction to the song "Happy Birthday Lisa" was mixed. Ben Rayner called it a "crap tune",[42] and Chris Selley of Maclean's magazine wrote that "Stark Raving Dad" is "an unbearably sappy episode, and that birthday song for Lisa is just... bad."[44] Dave Walker of The Times-Picayune, however, listed the episode as one of Jackson's "many memorable TV moments" and called the song "unforgettable".[45]
