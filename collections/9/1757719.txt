The DSM algorithms are used for reordering the matrix elements subject to some criteria. Static DSMs are usually analyzed with clustering algorithms (i.e., reordering the matrix elements in order to group together related elements). Clustering results would typically show groups (clusters) of tightly related elements, and elements that are either not connected or are connected to many other elements and therefore are not part of a group.[1]
