A fifth movie was written, and may have been produced, but it was never released. Frankie Thomas believes that he and Granville made five films, not four,[106] and in August 1939 Harriet Adams wrote to Mildred Benson, "three have been shown in this area, and I have just heard that a fifth is in production."[107] The cancellation of the series was a result of Bonita Granville and Glenda Farrell both leaving the studio (Granville going to MGM and Farrell returning to the stage), Warner Bros. deciding to discontinue both series after the final Torchy Blane film (with Jane Wyman replacing Farrell) flopped, and the onset of World War II.
