Annika was placed into a Borg maturation chamber for the next few years, during which time she joined the collective.[26] Following this, she was a Borg drone and assimilated individuals from a number of species, including a crew-member from the USS Melbourne at the Battle of Wolf 359 on Stardate 43989.1.[27][28] Two years later, Seven of Nine, along with three other drones, crashed on a planet and they were separated from the Borg Collective. This caused their individualities to resurface over time, which caused Seven to panic due to her relative inexperience with individuality, and created a temporary hive mind between the four of them until they were retrieved by the Borg.[29]
