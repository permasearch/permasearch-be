Habitat destruction and fragmentation are major drivers of biodiversity loss in the United Kingdom,[8] however landowners that participate in field sports, particularly hunting and shooting, are more likely to conserve and reinstate woodlands[9] and hedgerows[10] because they are utilized by quarry species. A study in 2003 showed that they are around 2.5-times more likely to plant new woodlands than landowners without game or hunting interests, and also conserve a far greater woodland area.[9] These habitats are essential for the persistence of a wide range of other British wildlife, and consequently it has been suggested that field sports can provide valuable tools for wildlife conservation in the UK, without the need for governmental subsidies or protective legislation.
