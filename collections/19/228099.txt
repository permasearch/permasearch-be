It created a common market that by 2014 was worth $19 trillion, encompassed 470 million people, and had created millions of jobs.[86] Wilson says, "Few dispute that NAFTA has produced large and measurable gains for Canadian consumers, workers, and businesses." However, he adds, "NAFTA has fallen well short of expectations."[87]
