Multivariate normality tests check a given set of data for similarity to the multivariate normal distribution. The null hypothesis is that the data set is similar to the normal distribution, therefore a sufficiently small p-value indicates non-normal data. Multivariate normality tests include the Cox–Small test[19] and Smith and Jain's adaptation[20] of the Friedman–Rafsky test created by Larry Rafsky and Jerome Friedman.[21]
