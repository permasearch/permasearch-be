The male dromedary camel has an organ called a dulla in its throat, a large, inflatable sac he extrudes from his mouth when in rut to assert dominance and attract females. It resembles a long, swollen, pink tongue hanging out of the side of its mouth.[13] Camels mate by having both male and female sitting on the ground, with the male mounting from behind.[14] The male usually ejaculates three or four times within a single mating session.[15] Camelids are the only ungulates to mate in a sitting position.[16]
