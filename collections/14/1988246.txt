The album's lead single "Used to Love You" was released on October 20, 2015, three days after its live premiere.[108][109] It was sent for radio airplay in the US on October 27.[110] The song was critically acclaimed, with USA Today awarding it "Song of the Week" in late October, calling it the "spiritual sibling" of No Doubt's 1996 single "Don't Speak".[111] An accompanying music video was released on the same day as the song. It consists in a single shot of Stefani in a white tank top, blue brassiere and gold necklace on a black background, emoting, and occasionally mouthing some of the song's words.[112] The song performed moderately on the charts, peaking at number 52 on the Billboard Hot 100,[113] and number 10 on the Adult Pop Songs, where it became Stefani's second highest entry on the chart.[114] Elsewhere, it reached the lower regions of charts in Australia,[115] Canada,[116] and Scotland.[117] Coinciding with her New Year's Eve performance, a MAIZE remix of the single was released on December 31.[118] On March 11, 2016, "Used to Love You" was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), signifying sales of 500,000 copies.[119]
