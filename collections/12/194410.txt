In the pro-business environment of the 1920s, business launched a large-scale offensive on behalf of the so-called "open shop", which meant that a person did not have to be a union member to be hired. AFL unions lost membership steadily until 1933.[30] In 1924, following the death of Samuel Gompers, UMWA member and AFL vice president William Green became the president of the labor federation.[31]
