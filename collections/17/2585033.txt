The final Detour of the Race at General Aviation Terminal was a choice between Wing It or Wander It. In Wing It, teams had to skydive 10,000 feet (3,000Â m) in tandem with an instructor to reach their next clue in the skydive landing zone. In Wander It, teams first drove to a mangrove forest to find a boat, which they used to navigate out the forest and reach a designated landing zone in order to receive their next clue.
