The 24 December 1975 gig at the Hammersmith Odeon was the final date of Queen's UK tour in support of the album A Night At The Opera, which had been released a few weeks previously, and had already gone platinum.[1] The single "Bohemian Rhapsody" was in the middle of its 9-week run at number one in the UK charts at the time of the gig, which was one of the first times the song was played live.[2] Queen had already played four shows at the Odeon earlier during the tour and received positive reviews in the press, with Sounds saying "everything about them says that they are more important than any other band you've heard".[3]
