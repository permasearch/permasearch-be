From the time Libby's changed the formula, the company received many complaints. This resulted in their deciding to bring back the original Um Bongo formula in 2009. "Classic" Um Bongo was originally renamed "Um Bongo Tropical" and was also repackaged in new plastic 500ml bottles and placed in the chilled section of supermarkets/consumer shops. Libby's set up a website along with Facebook and YouTube accounts, to help gather additional support.
