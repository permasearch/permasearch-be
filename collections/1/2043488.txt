In February 2010 Canadian air forces and ground troops from 3 PPCLI took part in the highly publicized Marja offensive.[21] In late June 2010 control of the Zhari and Arghandab districts were transferred to the United States 101st Airborne Division.[22] Two weeks later Canadian Forces transferred Kandahar city to the Americans. As of this point most of Canada's forces were in the Panjwaii district as well as Dand and Daman.[23] On 27 November 2010, in the tenth and final troop rotation, the 1st Battalion of the Royal 22e RÃ©giment took over, marking the final rotation before Canada's withdrawal from Afghanistan.[24]
