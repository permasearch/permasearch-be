As in the novel, Carrie already shows some signs of rebelling against her mother's fanatical religious beliefs.  She has a cross necklace, but only wears it at home. She also hides teen magazines in her "prayer closet", and secretly reads them when her mother locks her in there. After gaining confidence from accepting Tommy's invitation to the prom, Carrie retorts to her mother that she often believes her mother makes up the Bible quotes she constantly preaches at her.
