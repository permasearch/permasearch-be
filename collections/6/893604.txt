The Diesel cycle is assumed to have constant pressure during the initial part of the combustion phase (     V  2     {\displaystyle V_{2}}   to      V  3     {\displaystyle V_{3}}   in the diagram, below). This is an idealized mathematical model: real physical diesels do have an increase in pressure during this period, but it is less pronounced than in the Otto cycle. In contrast, the idealized Otto cycle of a gasoline engine approximates a constant volume process during that phase.
