House then does his clinic duty, where he meets a man who wakes with a pain in his arm every time he sleeps on it. After asking him to alter his sleep behavior, which the patient refuses to do, House sarcastically offers to have his arm removed. The patient then storms out of the examination room. House also leaves the room and is confronted by Detective Tritter where they have another verbal altercation.
