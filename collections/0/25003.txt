In the first year of his second stint as general manager, Imlach became embroiled in a dispute with Leafs' captain Darryl Sittler over his attempt to take part in the Showdown series for Hockey Night in Canada.[60][68] In a move to undermine Sittler's influence on the team, Imlach traded McDonald, who was Sittler's friend.[69] By the end of the 1979â€“80 season, Imlach had traded away nearly half of the roster he had at the beginning of his tenure as general manager.[70] With the situation between Ballard and Sittler worsening, Sittler asked to be traded.[71] Forcing the Leafs' hand, the club's new general manager, Gerry McNamara, traded Sittler to the Flyers on January 20, 1982.[72] Rick Vaive was named the team's captain shortly after Sittler's departure.[70]
