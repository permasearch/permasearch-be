"The McNuggets were so well received that every franchise wanted them," said Arend in a 2009 interview. "There wasnâ€™t a system to supply enough chicken. We had to come up with something to give the other franchises as a new product. So the McRib came about because of the shortage of chickens." It was his inspiration to shape the McRib patty "like a slab of ribs," despite the fact that a round patty would have been cheaper to manufacture and serve on standard hamburger buns.[5]
