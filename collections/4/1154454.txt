The game has 43 playable fighters (including palette swaps), 20 of whom make up the default cast on launch; other characters are to be added over time. Eight make their debut in this version, along with a new form of Jack, and four guest characters from Capcom's Street Fighter, SNK's fighting game franchises, Square Enix's Final Fantasy, and Image Comics' The Walking Dead.[9][10][11]
