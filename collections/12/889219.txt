Ibn Hazm reported that there was scholarly consensus that it is an obligation to trim the moustache and let the beard grow. He quoted a number of ahaadeeth as evidence, including the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar quoted above, and the hadeeth of Zayd ibn Arqam in which Mohammed said:  “Whoever does not remove any of his moustache is not one of us.”[64] Ibn Hazm said in al-Furoo’: “This is the way of our colleagues [i.e., group of scholars].”
