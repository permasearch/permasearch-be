In June 2011, NY Waterway started service to points along the East River.[42] On May 1, 2017, that route became part of the NYC Ferry's East River route, which runs between Pier 11/Wall Street in Manhattan's Financial District and the East 34th Street Ferry Landing in Murray Hill, Manhattan, with five intermediate stops in Brooklyn and Queens.[43][44] During summer weekends, Governors Island is an intermediate stop on the route between Pier 11 and Fulton Ferry.[45]
