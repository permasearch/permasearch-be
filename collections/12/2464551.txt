The Belsnickel character originated in the Palatinate. When people immigrated to Pennsylvania, they brought their German traditions with them.[6] Belsnickel was known in Pennsylvania in the early 1800s.[3] Amongst the Pennsylvania Germans, Belsnickel is the character who visits homes prior to Christmas to check up on the behavior of the children. The traditional Belsnickel showed up at houses 1â€“2 weeks before Christmas and often created fright because he always knew exactly which of the children misbehaved.[7] He would rap on the door or window with his stick and often the children would have to answer a question for him or sing some type of song. In exchange he would toss candies onto the floor. If the children jumped too quick for the treats, they may end up getting struck with Belsnickel's switch.
