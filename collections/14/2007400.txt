In addition to its association with executive branch reform, the NPR's reinvention movement is tightly bound to the idea of national service. In the words of President Bill Clinton, "National Service is nothing less than the American way to change America. It is rooted in the concept of community: the simple idea that every one of us, no matter how many privileges with which we are born, can still be enriched by the contributions of the least of us.[14] Because National Service is so closely tied to the American citizens, Clinton and Gore recognized its role in government reinvention since a main purpose of the NPR is to respond to the needs of the people. In 1993, the Corporation for National Service (CNS) was created to further "develop and expand the President's reinvention themes."[14] Like the ideals of the National Performance Review, the main goal of the CNS was to yield fast results. Likewise, the CNS was dedicated to producing "well-informed decisions without delay, keep[ing] staffing lean and flexible, multiply[ing] resources, and delegat[ing] authority and responsibility in-house and in the field."[14]
