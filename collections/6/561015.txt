The current most widespread African American family structure consisting of a single parent has historical roots dating back to 1880.[26] Data from U.S. Census reports reveal that between 1880 and 1960, married households consisting of two-parent homes were the most widespread form of African American family structures.[26] Although the most popular, married households decreased over this time period. Single-parent homes, on the other hand, remained relatively stable until 1960 when they rose dramatically.[26] A study of 1880 family structures in Philadelphia showed that three-fourths of black families were nuclear families, composed of two parents and children.[27]
