After the war, the Manipur Constitution Act, 1947, established a democratic form of government with the Maharaja as the Executive Head and an elected legislature. In 1949, Maharaja Budhachandra was summoned to Shillong, capital of the Indian province of Meghalaya where he signed a Treaty of Accession merging the kingdom into India. Thereafter the legislative assembly was dissolved and Manipur became part of the Republic of India in October, 1949.[1] It was made a union territory in 1956[2] and a full-fledged state in 1972.[3] Mohammed Alimuddin became the first Chief Minister in 1972 of the State of Manipur.[4]
