Stewart's own female pet dog served as inspiration for the animators on the character of Mr. Pickles.[4][a] Animation director Mike L. Mayfield recorded Stewart's dog playing around on video, with animators using the resulting footage as a basis for the character's movements;[5] the series is animated using Adobe Flash.[6][b] Its setting is roughly based on Richmond, Virginia, where the creators started out in entertainment before moving to Los Angeles.[3] The creators are given creative freedom by the network, with Stewart explaining the notes received by them as "minimal", much to their surprise.[3] The creators observed some inconsistencies as to what is considered unacceptable, but try not to question it and compromise instead.[4]
