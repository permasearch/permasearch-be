The GRO indexes are major tool for persons tracing their family history as well as those needing duplicate copies of their own birth or marriage certificates. The indexes can be viewed on microfiche at the National Archives, major libraries, county record officers, LDS Family History Centres and can also be searched on a pay-per-view basis on several family history websites. A free, searchable index, can be consulted online on the FreeBMD website (see External links). This is an ongoing project to transcribe the whole GRO Index.
