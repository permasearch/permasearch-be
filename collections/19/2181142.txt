No they werent can you blame them? Tariffs imposed upon them by the federal government, now a war? Now in regards to other tariffs, yes the south wanted them reduced, the north wanted to keep them to protect industries. During and following the Civil War, there was a rapid expansion of centralized power to the federal government that really wanst matched until FDR. At any rate I think its a very tenuous arguement to make that this war was about slavery.(Gibby 15:50, 7 January 2006 (UTC))
