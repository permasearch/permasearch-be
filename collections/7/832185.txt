Italian historian Tripodi pinpointed that some of the roots of the rise of Fascism in Italy went back to this defeat and to the need to "avenge" the defeat that started to be present in the military and nationalistic groups of the Kingdom of Italy. The same Mussolini literally declared when Italian troops occupied Addis Abeba in May 1936: Adua e' vendicata (Adwa has been avenged).
