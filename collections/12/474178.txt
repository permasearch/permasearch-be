The sorority's first nationwide effort to provide library services in the rural South was the National Library Project, which it authorized in 1937.[30] The program was implemented in 1945, with the goal to establish a traveling library in the South, where library services were not generally available for blacks, both because of segregation and because so many blacks lived in rural areas, which had fewer services.[30] The project arose from concerns that few adequate resources were available, outside of those provided by segregated school systems.[30] In 1939, only 94 out of 774 public libraries in the South served blacks.[30] Additionally, only 5% of rural blacks had access to any public institution at all.[30] The first traveling library was based in Franklin County, South Carolina, where 23 book baskets, with 33 books, were circulated.[30]
