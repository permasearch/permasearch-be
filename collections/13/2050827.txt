Although the three vampires spend many years in happiness, luxury and comfort, Claudia slowly but surely begins to grow more and more detached, insisting on self-sufficiency and even gaining her own miniature coffin so that she does not have to sleep with either Lestat or Louis during the daylight hours. Claudia becomes highly self-educated and philosophical under Louis's tutelage. She also becomes an indiscriminate murderer under Lestat's guidance. She would "appear to her victims as a little angel" and lure them to their deaths.
