AllMusic stated that Talking Heads, one of the most celebrated bands of the 1970s and 1980s,[3] by their breakup "had recorded everything from art-funk to polyrhythmic worldbeat explorations and simple, melodic guitar pop".[3] Talking Heads' art pop innovations have had a long-lasting impact.[60] Along with other groups such as Devo, the Ramones and Blondie, they helped define the new wave genre in the United States.[61] Meanwhile, the more worldly popularities like 1980's Remain in Light helped bring African rock to the western world.[62]
