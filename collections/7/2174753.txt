Ma Mati Manush (Bengali: মা মাটি মানুষ) was primarily a slogan, coined by All India Trinamool Congress chief and current chief minister Mamata Banerjee. The term is literally translated as "Mother, Motherland and People". The slogan became very popular in West Bengal at the time of the 2011 assembly election. Later, Mamata Banerjee wrote a Bengali book with the same title.[16] A song was also recorded with the same title to glorify the theme. According to a report published in June 2011, it was one of the six most popular political slogans in India at that time.[17]
