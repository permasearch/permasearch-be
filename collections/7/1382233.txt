Ball State University's campus spans 731 acres (296 ha) and includes 109 buildings at 7,203,801 square feet (669,255.0 m2)[16] centered mostly on two main quadrangles. (The university also has just over 400 additional acres of research property.) The original quadrangle, "Old Quad," anchors the south end of campus and includes most of the university's earliest academic buildings, Christy Woods, and the Wheeler-Thanhauser Orchid Collection and Species Bank. The focal points of the Old Quad are Beneficence and the Fine Arts Building, home to the David Owsley Museum of Art since 1935. The museum contains some 11,000 works valued at more than $40 million.[17] The museum expanded its total exhibition space in 2013 from 17,846-to-26,514-square-foot (1,657.9 to 2,463.2 m2).[18] The Fine Arts Terrace, overlooking the Old Quad, hosts the annual spring commencement ceremonies.[19]
