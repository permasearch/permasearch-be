Collider.com's Kayti Burt felt the episode of Arrow "gets enough nostalgic hits in to make it work, while also giving us an exciting (batshit crazy) final act to launch us into the final part of the superhero crossover... Though the shared hallucination gimmick might lack long-term narrative consequence and feel like a bit of a 'Look, It's The 100th Episode!' plot device, it works because of the performance of all of the actors (including many returning ones) and the sentiment that this show has genuinely inspired in people." Conversely, Burt "was a bit sad that Arrow was robbed the opportunity of having a 100th episode outside of the already considerable demands of the crossover event, which were sometimes at odds with what this episode was trying to do... This episode was trying to do far too much and was therefore a bit of a mess, but it's hard to dislike an hour of TV that is earnestly trying to please its fans in so many different ways." She gave the episode 3 stars out of 5.[59] Sara Netzley, for Entertainment Weekly praised the episode, awarding it an "A", saying "Lots of Arrow action here, and not as much for The Flash/Supergirl folks to do. Still, it all worked beautifully. We get enough cross-team action to make it a treat for viewers of the Berlanti-verse while still forwarding the invasion story line â€“ and honoring the characters, plots, and themes that have made Arrow such a satisfying show over the last four and a half seasons. It was a tall order, but the episode pulled it off."[60]
