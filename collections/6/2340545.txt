Several members of the international community have expressed grave concerns over the Russian intervention in Ukraine and criticized Russia for its actions in post-revolutionary Ukraine, including the United States,[538] the United Kingdom,[539] France,[540] Germany,[541] Italy,[542] Poland,[543] Canada,[544] Japan,[545] the Netherlands,[546] Norway,[547] South Korea,[548] Georgia,[549] Moldova,[550] Turkey,[551] Australia[552] and the European Union as a whole, which condemned Russia, accusing it of breaking international law and violating Ukrainian sovereignty.[553] Many of these countries implemented economic sanctions against Russia or Russian individuals or companies, to which Russia responded in kind. Amnesty International has expressed its belief that Russia is fuelling the conflict.[554] The UN Security Council held a special meeting at the weekend[when?] on the crisis.[555] The G7 countries condemned the violation of Ukraine's sovereignty, and urged Russia to withdraw.[556][557] All G7 leaders are refusing to participate in it due to assumed violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, in contravention of Russia's obligations under the UN Charter and its 1997 basing agreement with Ukraine.[558]
