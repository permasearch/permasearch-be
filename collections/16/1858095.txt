In 2011, construction was started to widen I-94/I-69 approaching the Blue Water Bridge and to allow for dedicated local traffic and bridge traffic lanes.[80] The lane configuration changes confused drivers in the area, especially motorists with outdated GPS devices;[81] because of this, MDOT installed updated signs complete with American and Canadian flags to help prevent drivers from heading to Canada by mistake.[82]
