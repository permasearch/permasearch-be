Indigenous communities provide more opportunities to incorporate children in everyday life.[32] This can be seen in some Mayan communities where children are given full access to community events, which allows observational learning to occur more often.[32] Other children in Mazahua, Mexico are known to intensely observe ongoing activities.[32] In native northern Canadian and indigenous Mayan communities, children often learn as third-party observers from stories and conversations by others.[33] Most young Mayan children are carried on their mother's back, allowing them to observe their mother's work and see the world as their mother sees it.[34] Often, children in Indigenous American communities assume the majority of the responsibility for their learning. Additionally, children find their own approaches to learning.[35] Children are often allowed to learn without restrictions and with minimal guidance. They are encouraged to participate in the community even if they do not how to do the work. They are self-motivated to learn and finish their chores.[36] These children act as a second set of eyes and ears for their parents updating them about the community.[37]
