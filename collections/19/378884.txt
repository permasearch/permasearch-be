The factorial function n! is the product of all of the positive integers through n. The gamma function extends the concept of factorial (normally defined only for non-negative integers) to all complex numbers, except the negative real integers. When the gamma function is evaluated at half-integers, the result contains π; for example     Γ ( 1  /  2 ) =   π     {\displaystyle \Gamma (1/2)={\sqrt {\pi }}}   and     Γ ( 5  /  2 ) =    3   π    4     {\displaystyle \Gamma (5/2)={\frac {3{\sqrt {\pi }}}{4}}}  .[169]
