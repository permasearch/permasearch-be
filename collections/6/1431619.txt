Although in 2018 most cobalt in batteries was used in a mobile device,[77] a more recent application for cobalt is rechargeable batteries for electric cars. This industry has increased five-fold in its demand for cobalt, which makes it urgent to find new raw materials in more stable areas of the world.[78] Demand is expected to continue or increase as the prevalence of electric vehicles increases.[79] Exploration in 2016â€“2017 included the area around Cobalt, Ontario, an area where many silver mines ceased operation decades ago.[78]
