In the book Primetime Propaganda, conservative author Ben Shapiro said that Diane often plays and wins morality games with bar patrons.[37][41] Shapiro said further than she is an "elitist liberal [of a] high culture [and] the conscience of the show [...] and solid feminist," who outsmarts Sam over morality.[42] Diane's taunting toward Sam and his class "[presents] the first inkling of the yuppie conundrum that would haunt liberals throughout the 1980s."[43] Shapiro considered Diane becoming "sexualized" and "liberated" when, in the season one episode, "No Contest" (1983),  when she accepts prizes that she won, including two tickets to Bermuda.[44] Jennifer Michael Hecht in her book, The Happiness Myth, depicted Diane as herself too "unhappy" to be taken seriously as an adviser and her psychoanalysis on Sam's promiscuous behavior as "unreliable".[45]
