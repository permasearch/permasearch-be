The horizontal stripes on the flag represent the nine original departments of Uruguay, based on the U.S flag, where the stripes represent the original 13 colonies. The first flag designed in 1828 had 9 light blue stripes; this number was reduced to 4 in 1830 due to visibility problems from distance. The Sun of May represents the May Revolution of 1810; according to the historian Diego Abad de Santill√°n, the Sun of May is a figurative sun that represents Inti, the sun god of the Inca religion. It also appears in the Flag of Argentina and the Coat of Arms of Bolivia.
