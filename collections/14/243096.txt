For these reasons, the Haudenosaunee engaged in tactics that the French, the British and later on the Americans all considered to be cowardly.[164] The Haudenosaunee preferred ambushes and surprise attacks, would almost never attack a fortified place or attack frontally, or would retreat if outnumbered.[165] If Kanienkeh was invaded, the Haudenosaunee would attempt to ambush the enemy, or alternatively they would retreat behind the wooden walls of their villages to endure a siege.[166] If the enemy appeared too powerful as when the French invaded Kanienkeh in 1693, the Haudenosaunee burned their villages and their crops and the entire population retreated into the woods to wait for the French to depart.[167]
