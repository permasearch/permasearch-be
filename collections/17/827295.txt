In general, the speed of a hunting cheetah averages 64 km/h (40 mph) during a chase,[52] interspersed with a few short bursts when the speed may vary between 104 and 120 km/h (65 and 75 mph); the most reliable measurement of the typical speed during a short chase is 112 km/h (70 mph).[14][73][111][112] However, this value of the maximum speed is disputed,[14] with more recent measurements using solar-powered GPS collars in 367 hunts showing a maximum speed of 93 km/h (58 mph).[113][114] The speeds attained by the cheetah may be only slightly greater than those achieved by the pronghorn 88.5 km/h (55.0 mph)[115] and the springbok 88 km/h (55 mph).[116] Yet the cheetah has a greater probability of succeeding in the chase due to its exceptional acceleration – it can attain a speed of 75 km/h (47 mph) in just two seconds.[14] One stride or jump of a galloping cheetah averages 6.7 metres (22 ft).[117] Similarly, the ability to change direction rapidly is pivotal in ensuring hunting success.[105][118][119] Cheetahs typically walk at 3–4 kilometres per hour (1.9–2.5 mph).[73]
