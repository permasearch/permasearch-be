American television animation of the 1950s featured quite limited animation styles, highlighted by the work of Jay Ward on Crusader Rabbit.[16] Chuck Jones coined the term "illustrated radio" to refer to the shoddy style of most television cartoons that depended more on their soundtracks than visuals.[17] Other notable 1950s programs include UPA's Gerald McBoing Boing,[18] Hanna-Barbera's Huckleberry Hound and Quick Draw McGraw,[16] and rebroadcast of many classic theatrical cartoons from Universal's Walter Lantz, Warner Bros., MGM, and Disney.
