The red and white variety of toy spaniel was first seen in paintings by Titian,[4] including the Venus of Urbino (1538), where a small dog is used as a symbol of female seductiveness.[5] Further paintings featuring these toy spaniels were created by Palma Vecchio and Paolo Veronese during the 16th century. These dogs already had high domed heads with short noses, although the muzzles were more pointed than they are today. These Italian toy spaniels may have been crossed with local small dogs such as the Maltese and also with imported Chinese dogs.[4] The Papillon is the continental descendant of similar toy-sized spaniels.[6]
