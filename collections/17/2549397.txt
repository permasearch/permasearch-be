One Angel Square is one of the most sustainable large buildings in Europe and is built to a BREEAM 'Outstanding' rating.[12] It is powered by a biodiesel cogeneration plant using rapeseed oil to provide electricity and heat.[10] The structure makes use of natural resources, maximising passive solar gain for heat and using natural ventilation through its double-skin facade, adiabatic cooling, rainwater harvesting, greywater recycling and waste heat recycling.[15]
