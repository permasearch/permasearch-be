The development of the new car led Holden to redesign the Elizabeth plant in South Australia so that entire sections of the car can be assembled off the foremost production line. This new production method allows for complete sub-sections like the engine and transmissions to be constructed seamlessly together on rigs that simplify production.[19] This process is applied to the front-end module of the VE Commodore, consisting of the headlights, bumpers, airbag sensors and other accessory components. It can be easily removed as one-piece leading to lower repair costs and easier access to the engine bay.[20] This design represents the first time such a method has been used within GM, and garnered the SAE Australasia's 2006 Automotive Engineering Excellence Award.[21] A modular design structure known within Holden as "Flex Vision" has been applied to the interior where fundamentally different components such as audio units and instrument clusters can be swapped out for the different Commodore variants, creating radically varied interior look and feel without much higher costs.[22] The upshot of this is much greater differentiation between the variants than the outgoing model creating three distinct interior looks, dubbed: Functional, Performance and Luxury. The closely related long-wheelbase WM Statesman/Caprice derivatives feature a fourth interior type referred to as Prestige.[23]
