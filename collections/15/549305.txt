One of Rupp's early successful teams, he would give the '44 team the nickname "the Beardless Wonders" and "Wildkittens" because according to Rupp, "It was like running a Kindergarten." Of the young players, Kentucky's best player was freshman Bob Brannum, who at the age of 17, would be named consensus All-American, making him the youngest player to ever earn the title. The Beardless Wonders would win nineteen of their twenty-one games, enough to be invited into the NIT. There they would be matched up with an equally young and talented Utah team nicknamed the "Blitz Kids." The game made for an exciting outing with both teams going into the half tied at 24, but with the help of Brannum Kentucky would pull away to win 46â€“38. Kentucky would lose the next game to home town Saint John's.
