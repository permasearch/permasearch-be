In 1994, Malone signed with the Spurs, where he was used as a back-up center to superstar David Robinson.[1][69] The 1994â€“95 NBA season was his last in the NBA, and at that time, he was the only remaining active former ABA player. During the final game of his NBA career, against the Charlotte Hornets, he hit a buzzer-beating three-point shot from the opposing free throw line, eighty feet away from the goal. It was only the eighth three-pointer of his career. He played 17 games for the Spurs.[70]
