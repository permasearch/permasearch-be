Tipping is not expected or required in Australia. This is because the federal government protects the rights of workers, by providing them with a minimum wage. In Australia this is reviewed yearly, and as of 2017 it was set at A$17.70 per hour (A$22.125 for casual employees)[90] and this is fairly standard across all types of venues. Tipping at cafÃ©s and restaurants (especially for a large party), and tipping of taxi drivers and home food deliverers is again, not required or expected. However many people tend to round up the amount owed while indicating that they are happy to let the worker "keep the change".
