Sexual assault victims experience stigmatization based on rape myths.[citation needed] A female rape victim is especially stigmatized in patrilineal cultures with strong customs and taboos regarding sex and sexuality. For example, a society may view a female rape victim (especially one who was previously a virgin) as "damaged". Victims in these cultures may suffer isolation, physical and psychological abuse, slut-shaming, public humiliation rituals, be disowned by friends and family, be prohibited from marrying, be divorced if already married, or even be killed.[18] However, even in many developed countries, including some sectors of United States society, misogyny remains culturally ingrained.[19][20][21]
