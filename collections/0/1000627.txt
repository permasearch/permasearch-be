After six seasons, Ball decided to end the series, feeling that the show had enough episodes for syndication. Ball opted to continue on television under the provision that her two children, Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz Jr., agreed to appear alongside her.[10] Thus, in the fall of 1968, an entirely new series, Here's Lucy, debuted. This series featured her and her children, as well as Gordon, Croft, and Vance in occasional guest appearances as new characters which were similar to their characters on the former series. Like I Love Lucy and The Lucy Show, Here's Lucy ran on CBS for six seasons.
