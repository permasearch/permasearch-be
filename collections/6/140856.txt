While many agreements can be certain, it is by no means certain that in the case of social and domestic affairs people want their agreements to be legally binding. In Balfour v Balfour[83] Atkin LJ held that Mr Balfour's agreement to pay his wife Â£30 a month while he worked in Ceylon should be presumed unenforceable, because people do not generally intend such promises in the social sphere to create legal consequences. Similarly, an agreement between friends at a pub, or a daughter and her mother will fall into this sphere,[84] but not a couple who are on the verge of separation,[85] and not friends engaged in big transactions, particularly where one side relies heavily to their detriment on the assurances of the other.[86] This presumption of unenforceability can always be rebutted by express agreement otherwise, for instance by writing the deal down. By contrast, agreements made among businesses are almost conclusively presumed to be enforceable.[87] But again, express words, such as "This arrangement... shall not be subject to legal jurisdiction in the law courts" will be respected.[88] In one situation, statute presumes that collective agreements between a trade union and an employer are not intended to create legal relations, ostensibly to keep excessive litigation away from UK labour law.[89]
