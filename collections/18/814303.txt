Similar to the releases of older Hollywood musicals such as The Sound of Music, My Fair Lady, and West Side Story, Dreamgirls debuted with three special ten-day roadshow engagements beginning on December 15, 2006 at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City, the Cinerama Dome in Los Angeles, and the AMC Metreon 15 in San Francisco.[7] Tickets for the reserved seats were $25 each; the premium price included a forty-eight page full-color program and a limited-print lithograph.[7] This release made Dreamgirls the first American feature film to have a roadshow release since Man of La Mancha in 1972.[7] Dreamgirls earned a total of $851,664 from the roadshow engagements, playing to sold-out houses on the weekends.[4][47][48] The film's national release, at regular prices, began on December 25. Outside of the U.S., Dreamgirls opened in Australia on January 18, and in the United Kingdom on February 2. Releases in other countries began on various dates between January and early March. Dreamgirls eventually grossed $103 million in North America, and almost $155 million worldwide.[4]
