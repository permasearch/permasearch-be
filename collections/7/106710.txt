"All These Things That I've Done" was the only song performed by The Killers at Live 8. Robbie Williams incorporated the "I got soul, but I'm not a soldier" refrain into his own performance.[5] Coldplay and U2 followed suit and, at their separate concerts played in Las Vegas, with The Killers in the crowd, incorporated the line into their songs "God Put a Smile upon Your Face" and "Beautiful Day", respectively.
