In February 2009, Leibovitz borrowed US$15.5 million, after having experienced financial challenges,[54] putting up several houses as well as the rights to all of her photographs as collateral.[55][56] The New York Times noted that "one of the world's most successful photographers essentially pawned every snap of the shutter she had made or will make until the loans are paid off,"[54] and that, despite a US$50 million archive, Leibovitz had a "long history of less than careful financial dealings" and "a recent series of personal issues" including the loss of her parents and the 2004 death of Sontag, as well as the addition of two children to her family, and controversial renovation of three Greenwich Village properties.[51]
