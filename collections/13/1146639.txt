Some experts believe that students have grown up with technology and thus can use it creatively if properly facilitated by teachers.[177] Many educators argue that students will abuse technology if allowed to use it in class; however, banning it may lead to more abuse as Johnson states in his article "Taming the Chaos" about handling technology in the classroom. He explains that allowing its use will help those students that want to learn, while those who don't want to learn will continue to abuse its use â€“ this is a different issue about motivation.[178]
