Now that Ezra is no longer Aria's teacher, they are legally allowed to date, but this doesn't mean it starts to become any easier for the two of them. They struggle to find the right place and time to tell everyone (excluding Spencer, Hanna, and Emily who already know) about their relationship. When Ali's older brother, Jason comes back to Rosewood, the girls' believe he's up to no good. But soon, Aria finds herself talking to Jason more after he promises not to tell the police about Aria's brother, Mike, breaking into his house. Her brother continues to break into houses and ends up in the hands of the police, but is let go when Byron and Ella come to pick him up at the station. Mike is now depressed and stays cooped up in his room doing mysterious and unknown things. Aria tries to help Mike out, but there is nothing she or her family can do to get him to listen. Aria continues to think about Jason more and more and has a few inappropriate dreams about him. In the end, she admits to Emily about her dreams and Emily simply says, "When you dream about someone, it isn't because they want something from you, it's because you want something from them."
