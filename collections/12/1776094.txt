The Namdang Stone Bridge (Assamese: নামদাং শিলৰ সাকো) is historic bridge located a few kilometers away from Sibsagar town in Assam, India. It was constructed in 1703 by craftmen brought from Bengal during the reign of Ahom king Rudra Singha. The bridge is 60 m (200 ft) long, 6.5 m (21 ft) wide and 1.7 m (5.6 ft) high. It runs over the Namdang river, a tributary of the Dikhou river. The present National Highway 37 is passing over it. The unique characteristic of the bridge is that it was cut out from a single solid piece of rock hundred years of age.
