It is difficult to categorise Hume's political affiliations. His writings contain elements that are, in modern terms, both conservative and liberal,[179] although these terms are anachronistic. Thomas Jefferson banned the History from University of Virginia, feeling that it had "spread universal toryism over the land".[180] By comparison, Samuel Johnson thought Hume "a Tory by chanceÂ ... for he has no principle. If he is anything, he is a Hobbist", a follower of Thomas Hobbes.[181] A major concern of Hume's political philosophy is the importance of the rule of law. He also stresses throughout his political essays the importance of moderation in politics: public spirit and regard to the community.[182]
