Before the lift, guests watch a 4-D film about Blackpool and the local area. The film shows a young boy who is inspired with the tower and goes to the ballroom and circus of the tower. Then, with his goggles he is wearing, makes the tower blast off like a rocket. The film also shows the history of the tower. The film is accompanied by the song "All the Lovers" by Kylie Minogue, a song commonly used to promote Blackpool. The visitors then go into the refurbished waiting area, where memorabilia and newspaper pages about Blackpool Tower are on display, before being taken to the Eye itself.
