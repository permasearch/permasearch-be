Across from the Ocean City Airport is the Howard Stainton Wildlife Refuge, a 16 acres (6.5 ha) area of wetlands established in 1997. There are no trails, but there is a viewing platform accessible from Bay Avenue.[82] Adjacent to the airport is the Ocean City Municipal Golf Course, a 12–hole course run by the city and open to the public.[83]
