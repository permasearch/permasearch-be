In 1956, Charles recruited a young all-female singing group, the Cookies, and reshaped them as the Raelettes. Until then, he had used his wife and other musicians to back him on recordings such as "This Little Girl of Mine" and "Drown in My Own Tears". The Raelettes' first recording session with Charles was on the bluesy gospel-inflected "Leave My Woman Alone".[citation needed]
