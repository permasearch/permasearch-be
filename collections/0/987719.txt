Molly Collins[58] (voiced by Jessica McDonald) is a shy sauropod who is a member of the cheerleading team and, as shown in "The Pressure", the owner of a treehouse where she and the other girls hang out in.[59] She made several appearances in the show's first season, but was absent for the entire second season; no reason was given for her disappearance until the third-season episode "The Void", where Gumball, Darwin, and Mr. Small realize that all traces of Molly have vanished and nobody else seems to have any memory of her. Investigating further, they eventually open up a portal at the former location of Molly's home and are sucked into a void containing "all the mistakes the world has ever made", where they find and rescue her.[60]
