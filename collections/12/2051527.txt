HDMI 1.0 and 1.1 are restricted to transmitting only certain video formats,[92](ยง6.1) defined in EIA/CEA-861-B and in the HDMI Specification itself.[92](ยง6.3) HDMI 1.2 and all later versions allow any arbitrary resolution and frame rate (within the bandwidth limit); any formats that are not supported by the HDMI Specification (i.e. no standardized timings defined) may be implemented as a vendor-specific format. Although successive versions of the HDMI Specification continue to add support for additional formats (such as 4K resolutions), the added support is to establish standardized timings to ensure interoperability between products, not to establish what formats are and aren't permitted, and video formats do not require explicit support from the HDMI Specification in order to be displayed.[93](ยง6.1)
