Penny encounters an android named Raddion and its creator, Sesmar, who is intrigued with her feelings for beauty and compassion and wishes to instill such qualities upon his machine. Sesmar tests the Robinsons' feelings with a special camera he gives Dr. Smith, and then tricks the family into entering his lab where he drains the emotions from their minds and leaves them irritable and lazy people. Major West, who refused to participate in the experiment, has to team up with his nemesis Dr. Smith to stop the mad scientist and return the Robinsons to normal.
