The Lions opened the regular season on the road against the Indianapolis Colts, and came away with a close victory. The Lions jumped out to a 14–0 lead before Indianapolis got on the board. Theo Riddick had a 21-yard touchdown run on the Lions' opening drive, and rookie running back Dwayne Washington scored on a 1-yard run early in the second quarter. The Colts got on the board with a 50-yard Adam Vinatieri field goal, but the Lions went up 21–3 on its next possession when Matthew Stafford hit Eric Ebron for a six-yard touchdown pass. Indianapolis closed to 21–10 near the end of the first half after Andrew Luck tossed a two-yard touchdown pass to Donte Moncrief. The Colts got within a field goal early in the third quarter with a 19-yard scoring strike from Luck to Dwayne Allen and a successful 2-point conversion. On Detroit's next drive, Stafford connected with Ameer Abdullah on an 11-yard touchdown pass to put his team back up, 28–18. The Colts scored the next ten points early in the fourth quarter on a 40-yard Vinatieri field goal and a 16-yard scoring pass from Luck to Jack Doyle, knotting the game at 28. The Lions regained the lead on a 13-yard touchdown pass from Stafford to Riddick, but Matt Prater missed the extra point. That allowed Indianapolis to take a 35–34 lead on its next possession, when Luck again connected with Doyle, this time on a six-yard touchdown pass. Detroit got the ball back with 37 seconds left in the game, and on three plays moved into range for Matt Prater's go-ahead 43-yard field goal with four seconds on the clock. The Lions earned a safety on the final play of the game when the Colts were called for an illegal forward pass in the end zone, making the final score 39–35. This was the first time the Lions defeated the Colts since 1997.
