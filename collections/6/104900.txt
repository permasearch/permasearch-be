Upon Agamemnon's return from Troy, he was murdered (according to the oldest surviving account, Odyssey 11.409â€“11) by Aegisthus, the lover of his wife, Clytemnestra. In old versions of the story, the scene of the murder, when it is specified, is usually the house of Aegisthus, who has not taken up residence in Agamemnon's palace, and it involves an ambush and the deaths of Agamemnon's followers as well.[3] In some later versions Clytemnestra herself does the killing, or they act together as accomplices, killing Agamemnon in his own home.
