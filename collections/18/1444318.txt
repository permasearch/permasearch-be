Addams kept up her heavy schedule of public lectures around the country, especially at college campuses.[53] In addition, she offered college courses through the Extension Division of the University of Chicago.[54] She declined offers from the university to become directly affiliated with it, including an offer from Albion Small, chair of the Department of Sociology, of a graduate faculty position. She declined in order to maintain her independent role outside of academia. Her goal was to teach adults not enrolled in formal academic institutions, because of their poverty and/or lack of credentials. Furthermore, she wanted no university controls over her political activism.[55]
