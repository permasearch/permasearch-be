The antivenom manufacturer's product information recommends one vial, although more has been used.[111] Past guidelines indicated two vials, with a further two vials recommended if symptoms did not resolve within two hours, however recent guidelines state "antivenom is sometimes given if there is a history, symptoms and signs consistent with systemic envenoming, and severe pain unresponsive to oral analgesics ... however recent trials show antivenom has a low response rate little better than placebo, and any effect is less than might be achieved with optimal use of standard analgesics.[129][6] The antivenom can be given by injection intramuscularly (IM) or intravenously (IV). The manufacturer recommends IM use, with IV administration reserved for life-threatening cases.[132] In January 2008 toxicologist Geoffrey Isbister suggested IM antivenom was not as effective as IV antivenom,[81][133] after proposing that IM antivenom took longer to reach the blood serum.[134] Isbister subsequently found the difference between IV and IM routes of administration was, at best, small and did not justify routinely choosing one route over the other.[135]
