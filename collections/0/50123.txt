The retina is stratified into distinct layers, each containing specific cell types or cellular compartments[28] that have metabolisms with different nutritional requirements.[29] To satisfy these requirements, the ophthalmic artery bifurcates and supplies the retina via two distinct vascular networks: the choroidal network, which supplies the choroid and the outer retina, and the retinal network, which supplies the retina's inner layer.[30]
