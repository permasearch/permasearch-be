A.J. Cooper (Tom Selleck) is the new owner of the Montecito as of 2007. He is a former Marine and cattle rancher from Wyoming who stirs things up at the casino. His net worth is about $2 billion. On his first day, he allows an oncologist to avoid jail for cheating the Montecito by making him lose his winnings and promise not to return to Las Vegas again. In "Run Cooper Run", Cooper was revealed as a black ops Marine in the Vietnam War and awarded the Bronze Star for his work. He was a Marine who served in the Battle of Khe Sanh, a 77-day siege in which outnumbered Marines fought off and killed between 10 and 15 thousand NVA regulars as told by Danny in the episode. In "Sex, Lies and Lamaze", Cooper admits that he was best friends with Piper's father, a fellow Marine. Before Piper's father died, Cooper promised he would watch over Piper. Cooper also owns condominiums in Florida, the largest paper mill in Wisconsin, the largest cattle ranch in Wyoming, and a high-tech company in California. In the season-five finale, Cooper tells the Montecito workers he must go to New York and take care of some lawsuits filed against him by Vic Manning. Later, Mitch alerts Danny that the Montecito's jet has crashed in Colorado. The news reports say only one of the pilots survived. In lieu of the planned triple wedding, Danny and Mike set up a memorial service for Cooper's presumed death. At the last moments of the show, Cooper arrives at the service and appears to be fine.
