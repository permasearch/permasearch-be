Film has been the most influential medium in the presentation of the history of slavery to the general public around the world.[352] The American film industry has had a complex relationship with slavery and until recent decades often avoided the topic. Films such as Birth of a Nation (1915)[353] and Gone with the Wind (1939) became controversial because they gave a favourable depiction. The last favourable treatment was Song of the South from Disney in 1946. In 1940 The Santa Fe Trail gave a liberal but ambiguous interpretation of John Brown's attacks on slaveryâ€”the film does not know what to do with slavery.[354] The Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s made defiant slaves into heroes.[355] The question of slavery in American memory necessarily involves its depictions in feature films.[356]
