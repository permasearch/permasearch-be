Ted tells the gang that he found his destined love on the subway—they were both reading One Hundred Years of Solitude—but lost her at the next stop. Ted hopes to find her again, but Marshall and Lily are unsure of this; especially when he reveals he has written details he remembered about her. However, Ted indeed reunites with the woman, Jeanette, after a fire alarm at his Columbia building. He believes that it was destiny, since Jeanette had written down details she remembered about him; but couldn't figure out which class he was at until the fire alarm rang.
