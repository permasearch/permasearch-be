Hughie Jennings left the Tigers after the 1920 season, having accumulated 1,131 wins as a manager.[52] This stood as a Tiger record until 1992, when it was broken by Sparky Anderson.[53] Cobb himself took over managerial duties in 1921, but during his six years at the helm, the Tigers topped out at 86 wins and never won a pennant.[54][55][56]
