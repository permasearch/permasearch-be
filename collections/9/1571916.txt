After the first season concluded with the Discovery receiving a distress call from the Enterprise, specifically from Pike, Harberts expressed interest in exploring that character in the second season, feeling that he had not been seen much in Star Trek previously and so "thereâ€™s an interesting opportunity that we might have to delve into and flesh out a character who I think is a pretty darn heroic and selfless captain."[38] In April 2018, Mount was cast as Pike, which was described as a "key role" for the season.[39] He revealed in July that he was contracted as a main cast member for the full season.[40]
