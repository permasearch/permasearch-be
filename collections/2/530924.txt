What this collection attempts to do is rectify the errors, in production and song selection, made when the albums were first released. In the case of Self Portrait, overdubs added after the fact in '70 have been eliminated, removing the filter between the listener and Dylan's raw, affecting performances of "Copper Kettle" and "Days Of '49."[14]
