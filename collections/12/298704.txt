Many human diseases are not static phenomena, but capable of evolution. Viruses, bacteria, fungi and cancers evolve to be resistant to host immune defences, as well as pharmaceutical drugs.[321][322][323] These same problems occur in agriculture with pesticide[324] and herbicide[325] resistance. It is possible that we are facing the end of the effective life of most of available antibiotics[326] and predicting the evolution and evolvability[327] of our pathogens and devising strategies to slow or circumvent it is requiring deeper knowledge of the complex forces driving evolution at the molecular level.[328]
