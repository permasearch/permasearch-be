By 1984, Ken was the only character from the original cast who remained in the serial.[16] He became the only original character to remain with the show continuously into 2010, its 50th year.[7] Roache has revealed that Ken's role in the serial was threatened in 1964, when producer Tim Aspinall, who was dubbed the "mad axe-man", took the helm of Coronation Street. Aspinall culled a variety of characters from the serial, including fan favourite Martha Longhurst (Lynne Carol), and Ken was one of the characters he wished to axe: "He had a kind of hit list of characters. He decided who he wanted out, while others including myself were put on warning that we were likely to be given the chop at a later date. It was appalling," recalls Roache.[7] A potential storyline was devised in which Ken and his then wife Valerie would move to Australia.[17] However, Ken was given a reprieve, as before he could be axed, Aspinall was removed from his position.[7]
