Frank Zhang is a 16-year-old demigod, son of Mars and Emily Zhang, a  Chinese-Canadian "legacy" (descendant of a demigod) who dies during military service in Afghanistan. He is taken care of by his grandmother after his mother's death, and makes his way to Camp Jupiter upon her insistence. Frank's family descends from Periclymenus, a grandson of Poseidon, who had the power to shapeshift. Periclymenus's descendants were sold into slavery in China, and migrated to Canada many years later. While battling Alcyoneus (who is invincible within Alaska), Frank taps into his ancestral power and transforms into an elephant. However, his combined power of being a son of Mars and having the ability to shapeshift makes his life very fragile. The Fates tied his life force to a piece of firewood when he was a baby, so if the wood burns up, he will die (as in the ancient Greek legend of Meleager). The goddess Juno appears to his mother and grandmother while he is a baby to warn them of this fact, as he would be crucial to defeating the Giants. In all his life, Frank has ignited the wood twice, which he can do simply by thinking about it; the first time is while he is finding his way to Camp Jupiter, in bitter cold. The second time is when he, Percy, and Hazel travel to Alaska to free Thanatos. Eventually, Frank entrusts the firewood to Hazel, and in The House of Hades, Calypso creates a fireproof pouch to contain it (Leo delivers the pouch to Frank).
