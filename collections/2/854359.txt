The Bulls, led by first-year head coach Phil Jackson, later filed an official protest with the NBA about the play.  By their estimate, the play took closer to 0.4 seconds.  However, timekeeper Bob Billings and referee Ronnie Nunn, who were working that game, claimed everything went perfectly fine.  The protest was disallowed.
