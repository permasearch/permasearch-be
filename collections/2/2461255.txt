The National Park was selected as main motif for two high value euro collectors' coins: the â‚¬10 Greek Birds and Flowers and Black Pine Trees commemorative coins, minted in 2007. On the obverse of one of the coins there is a panoramic view of the common black pine trees that are prevalent in the park.
