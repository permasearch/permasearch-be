In Cinderella, the plot stayed true to the original tale until one of the ugly sisters switches her shoe with the one Cinderella left behind at the ball. However, when the prince sees that the shoe fits one of the sisters, he decides not to marry her, and instead has his men cut off her head on the spot while she is standing. When the prince removes the head of the second sister and makes to do the same to Cindy, she wishes to be married instead to a decent man. Her fairy godmother grants this wish and marries her to a simple jam-maker.
