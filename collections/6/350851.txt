Indianapolis was at the center of the Golden Age of Indiana Literature from 1870 to 1920.[181] Several notable poets and writers based in the city achieved national prominence and critical acclaim during this period, including James Whitcomb Riley, Booth Tarkington and Meredith Nicholson.[15] In A History of Indiana Literature, Arthur W. Shumaker remarked on the era's influence: "It was the age of famous men and their famous books. In it Indiana, and particularly Indianapolis, became a literary center which in many ways rivaled the East."[182] A 1947 study found that Indiana authors ranked second to New York in the number of bestsellers produced in the previous 40 years.[181] Located in Lockerbie Square, the James Whitcomb Riley Museum Home has been a National Historic Landmark since 1962.
