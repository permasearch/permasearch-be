After previously dry conditions, severe flooding also occurred in West Virginia, amplified by the mountainous terrain.[17] Record discharge rates were observed at 25 gauging stations, and 27 stations along rivers were at least 100 year events,[1] setting records along the Potomac and Monongahela rivers, among several others.[7] While washing away large rocks, some streams changed their channels due to the high volume of water.[17] Near Petersburg, the South Branch Potomac River crested at 25.4 ft (7.7 m) and produced a record discharge of 130,000 cu ft (3,700 m3),[17] and the peak discharge at Franklin was nearly three times the previous record. At five of the six gauging stations along the Potomac, there were new records for discharge rates.[1] Along the Potomac, the floodwaters collected behind dams, causing 21 to exceed the capacity designed to withstand a 100-year flood.[17] All five stations along the Greenbrier River recorded a new record discharge rate, as did all five along the Tygart Valley River.[1] The flash flooding caused the Bloomington Reservoir to rise 80 ft (24 m) in 30 hours.[5] Several caves were flooded, causing high amounts of erosion and damaging some speleothems. After the flooding, Mystic Cave in Pendleton County had tree branches wedged into the ceiling and a layer of sand on the floor.[18]
