The natural hosts of influenza viruses are pigs and birds, although it has probably infected humans since antiquity.[238] The virus can cause mild to severe epizootics in wild and domesticated animals.[239] Many species of wild birds migrate and this has spread influenza across the continents throughout the ages. The virus has evolved into numerous strains and continues to do so, posing an ever-present threat.[240]
