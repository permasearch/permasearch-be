AN has the highest mortality rate of any psychological disorder.[8] The mortality rate is 11 to 12 times greater than in the general population, and the suicide risk is 56 times higher.[19] Half of women with AN achieve a full recovery, while an additional 20â€“30% may partially recover.[8][19] Not all people with anorexia recover completely: about 20% develop anorexia nervosa as a chronic disorder.[96] If anorexia nervosa is not treated, serious complications such as heart conditions[17] and kidney failure can arise and eventually lead to death.[116] The average number of years from onset to remission of AN is seven for women and three for men. After ten to fifteen years, 70% of people no longer meet the diagnostic criteria, but many still continue to have eating-related problems.[117]
