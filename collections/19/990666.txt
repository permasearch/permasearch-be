In March 2013, Spielberg said, "Don't hold me to it, but we're hoping the film will come out around Christmas-time in 2015. We know which books we're making, we can't share that now but we're combining two books which were always intended to be combined by HergÃ©." He refused to confirm the names of the books, but said The Blue Lotus would probably be the third Tintin film.[133] In December 2014, when asked if the Tintin sequel would be his next project after The Hobbit trilogy, Jackson said that it would be made "at some point soon". However, he added that he wanted to direct two New Zealand films before that.[134]
