In the 21st century, several sources have claimed as many as 60,000 fundamentalist Latter-day Saints in the United States,[62][63] with fewer than half of them living in polygamous households.[64] Others have suggested that there may be as few as 20,000 Mormon fundamentalists[65][66] with only 8,000 to 15,000 practicing polygamy.[67] The largest Mormon fundamentalist groups are the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS Church) and the Apostolic United Brethren (AUB). The FLDS Church is estimated to have 10,000 members residing in the sister cities of Hildale, Utah and Colorado City, Arizona; Eldorado, Texas; Westcliffe, Colorado; Mancos, Colorado; Creston and Bountiful, British Columbia; and Pringle, South Dakota.[68]
