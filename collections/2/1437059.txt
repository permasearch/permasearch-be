To determine the Cournotâ€“Nash equilibrium you can solve the equations simultaneously. The equilibrium quantities can also be determined graphically. The equilibrium solution would be at the intersection of the two reaction functions. Note that if you graph the functions the axes represent quantities.[12] The reaction functions are not necessarily symmetric.[13] The firms may face differing cost functions in which case the reaction functions would not be identical nor would the equilibrium quantities.
