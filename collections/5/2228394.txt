The status of the Crimea and of the city of Sevastopol is currently under dispute between Russia and Ukraine; Ukraine and the majority of the international community consider the Crimea to be an autonomous republic of Ukraine and Sevastopol to be one of Ukraine's cities with special status, while Russia, on the other hand, considers the Crimea to be a federal subject of Russia and Sevastopol to be one of Russia's three federal cities since the March 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia.[3][4] Since 1991 Russia also leases Sevastopol Naval Base with current lease extending to 2040s with an option for another extension, but the State Duma approved the denunciation of this lease agreements unanimously by 433 members of parliament on 31 March 2014.[5]
