For the program's entire run as a nightly series, Gosden and Correll provided over 170 male voice characterizations in the show's first decade. With the episodic drama and suspense heightened by cliffhanger endings, Amos 'n' Andy reached an ever-expanding radio audience. It was the first radio program to be distributed by syndication in the United States, and, by the end of the syndicated run in August 1929, at least 70 stations besides WMAQ carried recorded episodes.[8]
