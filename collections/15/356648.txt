The Berber languages form a branch of the Afro-Asiatic family. They thus descend from the proto-Afroasiatic language. It is still disputed which branches of Afroasiatic diverged most recently from Berber, but most linguists accept either Egyptian[251][dubious  â€“ discuss] or Chadic (see Afro-Asiatic languages.)
