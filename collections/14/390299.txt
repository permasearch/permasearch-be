FC Cincinnati's stadium will be designed by MEIS Architects and Elevar Design Group. Turner Construction was hired as the general contractor, working alongside Jostin Construction, and will require 200 to 400 workers during the duration of construction.[3] Machete Group will provide oversight on the project as the owner's representative.[39] The project is scheduled to begin major construction in 2019, after the replacement for Stargel Stadium is completed at a nearby location.[35][40]
