David had big plans for them to move to Cheshire and Irma's parents, Stan (Bernard Youens) and Hilda Ogden (Jean Alexander), were keen for her to have a well-off lifestyle as the Ogdens had always struggled with money. Irma's parents were an old-fashioned couple and Stan hit Irma when he found David in Irma's bedroom. David convinced Irma they should marry quietly and without telling their families, but everybody found out anyway and surprised them by showing up for a reception.
