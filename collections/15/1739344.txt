During the Ming dynasty, chaste widows were elevated to the role of cultural heroes.[83]  Widow chastity became increasingly common, and chastity also became associated with suicide, with suicide by widows increasing dramatically during the Ming era.[93][88]   "Chaste widow" (Chinese: 節妇; pinyin: jiéfù) were commemorated by the construction of memorial chastity arches (Chinese: 貞節牌坊; pinyin: zhēnjiépáifāng) and shrines, and honoured with commemorative writings.[88][94] The Ming authority began to reward widow chastity, and widows who remarried would have their dowry and their husbands' property forfeited.[93] The state also awarded 'testimonial of merit' (Chinese: 旌表; pinyin: jīngbiǎo) to chaste women, giving approval of local chastity cults whereby commemorative arches and shrines were erected to honour the women by members of their families or communities.[95]  "Chaste women" were contrasted with "licentious women" (Chinese: 淫妇; pinyin: yínfù), and Ming popular literature of the time produced numerous stories about such wanton women, the most notorious being the fictional Pan Jinlian from the novel Jin Ping Mei.[94]
