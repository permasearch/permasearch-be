Prest-O-Lite's CD-65, which relied on capacitance discharge (CD), appeared in 1965, and had "an unprecedented 50,000 mile warranty."[4] (This differs from the non-CD Prest-O-Lite system introduced on AMC products in 1972, and made standard equipment for the 1975 model year.)[4] A similar CD unit was available from Delco in 1966,[3] which was optional on Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and GMC vehicles in the 1967 model year.[4] Also in 1967, Motorola debuted their breakerless CD system.[4] The most famous aftermarket electronic ignition which debuted in 1965, was the Delta Mark 10 capacitive discharge ignition, which was sold assembled or as a kit.
