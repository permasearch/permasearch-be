The Prescription Act counters slow or busy courts with a provision to the effect that ‘the running of prescription shall be interrupted by the service on the debtor of any process whereby the creditor claims payment on the debt’,[220] on the grounds that it would be unfair to penalise someone for the tardiness of the administrative process. As soon as one serves a summons, therefore, prescription is interrupted.
