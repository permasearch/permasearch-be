Curling was included in the program of the inaugural Winter Olympic Games in 1924 in Chamonix[1] although the results of that competition were not considered official by the International Olympic Committee until 2006. Curling was a demonstration sport at the 1932 Games, and then again after a lengthy absence in 1988 and 1992. The sport was finally added to the official program for the 1998 Nagano Games.
