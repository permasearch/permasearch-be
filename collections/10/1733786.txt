Faye becomes pregnant with Joseph's child but has a breakdown and refuses to leave the psychiatric unit she has admitted herself to when she goes into labour. Jac convinces her to receive proper medical care, saving Joseph's son. Grateful for her intervention, Joseph shares a kiss with Jac and they resume their relationship.[34] Jac intercedes upon discovering that Faye is planning to leave the country with the baby, named Harry and takes them back to the hospital, where Joseph convinces her to leave Harry with him.[35] He decides to move to the countryside and become a general practitioner, so he will have more time to spend with Harry. Jac declines to accompany him, valuing her career over a quiet family life, but is devastated by Joseph's departure.[36] She briefly resigns when her locum consultancy is rescinded,[37] but upon failing to find work elsewhere as a result of her reputation, returns once more as a cardiothoracic registrar. She begins a rivalry for a cardiothoracic consultant position with new registrar Sahira Shah (Laila Rouass).[38] A position that she later wins, Jac receives a box containing fancy stilettos and a bottle of champagne from Connie Beauchamp, with a note about the shoes saying "Fill them! x".
