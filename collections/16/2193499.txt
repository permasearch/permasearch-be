Interferon-gamma—which was once called macrophage activating factor—stimulates macrophages to produce nitric oxide. The source of interferon-gamma can be CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, natural killer cells, B cells, natural killer T cells, monocytes, macrophages, or dendritic cells.[35] Nitric oxide is then released from the macrophage and, because of its toxicity, kills  microbes near the macrophage.[2] Activated macrophages produce and secrete tumor necrosis factor. This cytokine—a class of signaling molecule[36]—kills cancer cells and cells infected by viruses, and helps to activate the other cells of the immune system.[37]
