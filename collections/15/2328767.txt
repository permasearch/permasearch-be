The eighteenth cycle of America's Next Top Model was subtitled "British Invasion", and featured seven contestants from previous cycles of Britain's Next Top Model for a second chance to win the title.[9] Cycles 1 and 7 were unrepresented, cycles 2, 3, 4 and 6 were each represented by one contestant, and Cycle 5 was represented by three contestants. This was the second cross-over in the Top Model franchise, after Austria's Next Topmodel winner Larissa Marolt received a place on the fourth cycle of Germany's Next Topmodel as one of her prizes.
