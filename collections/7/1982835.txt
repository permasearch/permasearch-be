Plankton is the nemesis and the former best friend of Mr. Krabs.[3] He operates the Chum Bucket, located directly across the street from Krabs' restaurant, the Krusty Krab.[4] The Chum Bucket primarily sells chum (bait consisting of fish parts), which is considered mostly inedible by the other characters. As a result, his restaurant is a commercial failure. Plankton's primary goal in the series is to put Krabs out of business and secure a monopoly on the fast food industry. His villainous efforts to do this are widely known within the show; fellow character Squidward Tentacles refers to Plankton as "the most hated thing in Bikini Bottom".[5]
