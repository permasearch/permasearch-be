One of the biggest problems in a revenue centre is that costs are mostly ignored. If costs are not monitored by another division of the business, profits can be hindered. Furthermore, the manager of a revenue centre does not have the insight required for marketing decisions, consequently responsibility for a marketing decision cannot be given to a revenue centre manager. Setting prices on products or services is an example of revenue centre managers being unable to undertake marketing decisions.[4]
