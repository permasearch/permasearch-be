First baseman Ryan Zimmerman, second baseman Daniel Murphy, and right fielder Bryce Harper were voted onto the National League All-Star roster as starting position players, while starting pitchers Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg were also selected to the team. For Zimmerman and Murphy, it was their first time being voted in as starters, while it was Harper's fourth start and fifth overall selection. Murphy was also an All-Star in 2016, although he was not a starter, and Zimmerman was an All-Star in 2009. Scherzer was named an All-Star for the fifth consecutive year. Strasburg was named to the All-Star team for the third overall time. Harper was the top overall vote-getter from the National League.[318] Future National Brandon Kintzler, closer for the Minnesota Twins before being traded to Washington at the end of July, was also selected to the American League All-Star team.[319]
