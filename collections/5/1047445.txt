The law experts, constitutional analysts, and country's reputed clergymen worked on formulating the constitution that represents the will and desire of people.[21] Unlike earlier attempts, the convention was not meant for new laws or piecemeal alterations, but for the "sole and express purpose of revising the 1956 articles."[21] Also, the convention was not limited to the religion, exigencies of government and the preservation of the State; rather it was intended to maintain delicacy in commerce, finances, issue of loans to federation, and Separation of powers.[21] Several key ideas of the philosophy of John Locke and Islamic provisions on civil rights were interchanged in the Constitution.[22][23]
