The fluorine–fluorine bond of the difluorine molecule is relatively weak when compared to the bonds of heavier dihalogen molecules. The bond energy is significantly weaker than those of Cl2 or Br2 molecules and similar to the easily cleaved oxygen–oxygen bonds of peroxides or nitrogen–nitrogen bonds of hydrazines.[8] The covalent radius of fluorine of about 71 picometers found in F2 molecules is significantly larger than that in other compounds because of this weak bonding between the two fluorine atoms.[9] This is a result of the relatively large electron and internuclear repulsions, combined with a relatively small overlap of bonding orbitals arising due to the small size of the atoms.[10]
