Much speculation had surrounded how long the campaign for the 39th federal election would be in 2006, especially as it became certain the election would be called in the weeks preceding Christmas 2005.  The government of Joe Clark, which fell on December 12, 1979, recommended a campaign of 66 days for the resulting election, and nothing legal barred a similarly lengthened campaign.  In the end, the 2006 election was called on November 29, 2005, for January 23, 2006 â€” making a 55-day-long campaign.[18]
