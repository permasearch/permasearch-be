Bristol Charity Auction In Oct 2013, Scarfe donated his time to decorate one of the large Wallace & Gromit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_and_Gromit statues to be auctioned for the Bristol hospital charity http://www.bbc.com/news/av/entertainment-arts-24394027/gromit-statue-auction-raises-23m-for-bristol-hospita that was featured live on the BBC. His contribution finally ending up being sold to an internet bidder from Miami Florida where the statue was exported into a private collection, ultimately topping all estimates on value with a bid second highest only to the Pixar statue contribution.
