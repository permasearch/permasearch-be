Carmela receives a phone call from Livia, who is being detained in the Newark Airport for possessing stolen airline tickets. Within minutes, FBI agents arrive at the Soprano home with a search warrant. Tony is handcuffed in front of Meadow. He becomes unbalanced at one point and almost falls, appearing weak in front of the FBI agents. The agent in charge, Chief Frank Cubitoso, notes that Tony is "weak in the knees," but Tony angrily responds that he's got food poisoning and is led into a holding cell. Soon after, Neil has him released on bail, in time to attend Meadow's graduation the next day. Later, at Dr. Melfi's, Tony goes off on a rant about Indian people, because of his food poisoning, and even more against his mother. Melfi challenges him to confront the recent sorrow which she suspects he may be harboring underneath his pose. Tony stubbornly refuses to delve into his state of mind, and continues with distractions by bluntly talking about his sex dream with her, before smugly leaving the session.
