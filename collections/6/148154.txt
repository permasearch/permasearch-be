In 1990, the song was included on Lekakis' first album, Tattoo It, which was released on Sire Records. "Boom Boom" has since been re-released and remixed on multiple occasions, most recently in 2007 for the 20th anniversary of the song. This time, the song had a music video (since there was none when the single was originally released), and it features Lekakis hosting a party with some guests invited into his mansion. In the video, Lekakis is surrounded by scantily clad girls who are clearly the objects of his affection and presented in various sexual scenarios with him.
