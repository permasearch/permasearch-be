The word "loom" is derived from the Old English "geloma" formed from ge-(perfective prefix) and "loma", a root of unknown origin; this meant utensil or tool or machine of any kind. In 1404 it was used to mean a machine to enable weaving thread into cloth.[1] By 1838 it had gained the meaning of a machine for interlacing thread.
