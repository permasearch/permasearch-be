Neodymium magnets, invented in the 1980s, are the strongest and most affordable type of rare-earth magnet.  They are made of an alloy of neodymium, iron, and boron (Nd2Fe14B), sometimes abbreviated as NIB.   Neodymium magnets are used in numerous applications requiring strong, compact permanent magnets, such as electric motors for cordless tools, hard disk drives, magnetic holddowns, and jewelry clasps. They have the highest magnetic field strength and have a higher coercivity (which makes them magnetically stable), but they have a lower Curie temperature and are more vulnerable to oxidation than samariumâ€“cobalt magnets.  Corrosion can cause unprotected magnets to spall off a surface layer or to crumble into a powder.  Use of protective surface treatments such as gold, nickel, zinc, and tin plating and epoxy-resin coating can provide corrosion protection.
