Once England had been conquered, the Normans faced many challenges in maintaining control.[88] They were few in number compared to the native English population; including those from other parts of France, historians estimate the number of Norman landholders at around 8000.[89] William's followers expected and received lands and titles in return for their service in the invasion,[90] but William claimed ultimate possession of the land in England over which his armies had given him de facto control, and asserted the right to dispose of it as he saw fit.[91] Henceforth, all land was "held" directly from the king in feudal tenure in return for military service.[91] A Norman lord typically had properties located in a piecemeal fashion throughout England and Normandy, and not in a single geographic block.[92]
