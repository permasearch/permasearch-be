Lichtenstein returned home to visit his dying father and was discharged from the Army with eligibility for the G.I. Bill.[13] He returned to studies in Ohio under the supervision of one of his teachers, Hoyt L. Sherman, who is widely regarded to have had a significant impact on his future work (Lichtenstein would later name a new studio he funded at OSU as the Hoyt L. Sherman Studio Art Center).[15]
