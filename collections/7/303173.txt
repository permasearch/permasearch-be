On the first play of the next drive, Ed Reed intercepted a pass by Kaepernick and returned the ball 6 yards to the 49ers' 38-yard line.[86] This was the first interception thrown by San Francisco in any of their six Super Bowl appearances.[87] Unnecessary roughness charges were called after the play on players from both teams so the charges offset.[86] Baltimore reached the red zone on their next drive, but was unable to score. Following a one-yard run by Bernard Pierce and two incomplete passes, rookie kicker Justin Tucker was tackled 1 yard short of a first down while running the ball on a fake field goal play.[86]
