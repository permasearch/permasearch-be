Governor Stirling's intention was that the name 'Swan River' refer only to the watercourse upstream of the Heirisson Islands.[7] All of the rest, including Perth Water, he considered estuarine and which he referred to as 'Melville Water'. The Government notice dated 27 July 1829 stated ... the first stone will be laid of a new town to be called 'Perth', near the entrance to the estuary of the Swan River.
