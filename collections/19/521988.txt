Beejoli Shah of The Guardian stated the song has "instantly-memorable" lyrics and "addictive" bass line, but opined that "All About That Bass" was a novelty song.[57] Jon Carmanica of The New York Times echoed Shah's view and called "All About That Bass" a "cheeky novelty hit," and quipped, "'I'm bringing booty back,' she sings, though there's probably already a line forming to assure her it never went anywhere".[58] In a mixed review, Slate journalist Chris Molanphy commended the tempo and melody used in the lyric, "Every inch of you is perfect / From the bottom to the top," which he felt was "effortlessly memorable".[28] He went on to compliment Kadish's production on the song and felt that he created a "wispy tune in vintage white-girl, Italo-Latin soul, expertly aping the sound of peak Rosemary Clooney and Eydie Gorm√©".[28] However, Molanphy was critical of the track's use of the word "treble" as a metaphor and quipped, "Let's just hope Trainor's gross misuse of 'treble' as a metaphor doesn't wreck the word's definition for a generation".[28] In a negative review, Time named "All About That Bass" as the fifth worst song of 2014.[59]
