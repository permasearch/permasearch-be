Part 2: Desperate to stop the Superior Sinister Six and getting a pep talk from Aunt May, Spider-Man gets his original web shooters back from Aunt May and heads to Oscorp. With the help of Norman Osborn, Spider-Man is able to regain his powers with the radioactive spider in Doctor Octopus' hidden lab and confront the Superior Sinister Six when they arrive at Oscorp upon noticing that Norman Osborn wasn't there. As Doctor Octopus terrorizes the city, Spider-Man uses the same serum on Vulture, Crossbones, and Rhino to depower them while also defeating Kraven the Hunter and Scorpion. Doctor Octopus then uses an octopus formula that turns himself into a mindless giant octopus-like creature. Using the serum, Spider-Man turns Doctor Octopus back to normal who tells Spider-Man that even he doesn't know how to get rid of the contracting forcefield. Doctor Octopus cooperates with Spider-Man to deactivate the contracting forcefield. Afterwards, Doctor Octopus is taken away by Iron Man. Following the graduation ceremony, Agent Venom and Scarlet Spider become S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy teachers, Alex O'Hirn, Adrian Toomes, and Frances Beck enroll as students, and Nick Fury tells Spider-Man that he has become the Ultimate Spider-Man after he stops Trapster. Peter Parker reminisces on his more inexperienced days as Spider-Man and how far he has come as Spider-Man and goes out to stop a robbery in the East Village, incited by his Aunt May when moving in an apartment, saying this is not the end, only the beginning.
