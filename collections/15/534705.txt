Ice hockey has a storied history and large following in the New York metropolitan area, which is unique in being the only metropolitan area and media market in the United States and Canada to feature three major league professional teams participating in the same sport. New York City is currently home to the New York Rangers, playing in Madison Square Garden in Manhattan, and the New York Islanders, playing in Barclays Center in Brooklyn. The New Jersey Devils play in Prudential Center in nearby Newark, New Jersey.
