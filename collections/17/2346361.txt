The Ainu have developed antibodies to HTLV-1, indicating its endemicity to the Ainu and its antiquity in Japan.[54] A subtype "A" has been defined and identified among the Japanese (including Ainu), and among Caribbean and South American isolates.[55] A subtype "B" has been identified in Japan and India.[55] In 1995, Native Americans in coastal British Columbia were found to have both subtypes A and B.[56] Bone marrow specimens from an Andean mummy about 1500 years old were reported to have shown the presence of the A subtype.[57] The finding ignited controversy, with contention that the sample DNA was insufficiently complete for the conclusion and that the result reflected modern contamination.[58] However, a re-analysis indicated that the DNA sequences were consistent with, but not definitely from, the "cosmopolitan clade" (subtype A).[58]
