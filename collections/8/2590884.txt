Franklin was first attracted to the study of electricity when he saw the showman Archibald Spencer do magic demonstrations in Boston (1743) and in Philadelphia (1744).[1] He purchased Spencer's equipment and used it for his electricity experiments after these demonstrations were completed.[2] He referred to Spencer as Dr. Spence from Scotland.[3] In 1746, at the age of forty years, Franklin began turning over the affairs of his printing company to his business partner David Hall, and went into semi-retirement so he could carry out research on electricity; initially using Spencer's equipment.[4]
