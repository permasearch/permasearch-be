The reception-ready phase of the endometrium of the uterus is usually termed the "implantation window" and lasts about 4 days. The implantation window occurs around 6 days after the peak in luteinizing hormone levels. With some disparity between sources, it has been stated to occur from 7 days after ovulation until 9 days after ovulation,[2] or days 6-10 postovulation.[3] On average, it occurs during the 20th to the 23rd day after the last menstrual period.[4]
