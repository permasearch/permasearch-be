Vaikom had been chosen as a place for Satyagraha organized by the heads of the Congress Party. E. V. Ramasami, who was touring Madurai district, received "a private letter" asking him to join in the Satyagraha. He immediately proceeded to Vaikom where he violated the order not to address public meetings and was imprisoned for one month, a light punishment on order of the Raja. Gandhi became more and more troubled as the Satyagraha took a turn of communal riot because of conversions to Islam taking place. Vain efforts were made to return E. V. Ramasami to Madras state. After his first release from prison E. V. Ramasami was advised to stay away from Vaikom which he did not do. His second imprisonment was more severe, six months in the Central Jail Trivandrum. Meanwhile, Nagamma, E. V. Ramasami's first wife, organized women's campaigning.[1]
