In 1594, John Davis published an 80-page pamphlet called The Seaman's Secrets which, among other things describes great circle sailing.[28] It's said that the explorer Sebastian Cabot had used great circle methods in a crossing of the North Atlantic in 1495.[28] Davis also gave the world a version of the backstaff, the Davis quadrant, which became one of the dominant instruments from the 17th century until the adoption of the sextant in the 19th century.
