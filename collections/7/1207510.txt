The divisive issue of whether the terms "club" or "fraternity" should be used was still debated.[12] A vote again confirmed the name Alpha Phi Alpha with the colors of old gold and black.[11] The initiation of new members Eugene Kinckle Jones, Lemuel Graves and Gordon Jones took place on October 30, 1906 at a Masonic Hall including [11] James Morton was considered and selected, but at the time he was not registered at the university.[6] Two founding members learned about fraternity rituals from other fraternal organizations: Henry A. Callis worked in the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity House, and Kelly worked at Beta Theta Pi fraternity house.[5] Coincidentally, an article about a Negro fraternity Pi Gamma Omicron had initial desires to become a national fraternity was noted by a Beta Theta Pi correspondent at Ohio State University.[13] Callis stated that these fraternities, SAE and BTP, were the original source of the fraternity rituals.[5] The other members of the group felt that Poindexter, as a graduate student, dominated the meetings of Alpha Phi Alpha.[14] In his absence in the meeting on November 1905, the fraternity idea was pushed for a vote by Murray and was seconded by Robert H Ogle.[6] In December 1905, Thompson's resignation was accepted. Seven of the original 12 men from the initial meeting in December 1905 would continue on as members of the fraternity.[6]
