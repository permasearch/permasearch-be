In early June 1930, the then Visp–Zermatt Bahn was extended to Brig by the opening of a metre gauge line along the Rhone Valley between Visp and Brig.  For the first time, it was feasible to operate through coaches all the way from Zermatt to St. Moritz and return.  On 25 June 1930 (1930-06-25), the first train of such coaches set out from Zermatt to St. Moritz, under the name Glacier Express.[2]  The new train's name honoured the Rhone Glacier, which is near Gletsch, on the Furka Pass.[1]
