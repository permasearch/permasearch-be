International development is related to the concept of international aid, but is distinct from, disaster relief and humanitarian aid.[citation needed]  While these two forms of international support seek to alleviate some of the problems associated with a lack of development, they are most often short term fixes â€“ they are not necessarily long-term solutions.  International development, on the other hand, seeks to implement long-term solutions to problems by helping developing countries create the necessary capacity needed to provide such sustainable solutions to their problems. A truly sustainable development project is one which will be able to carry on indefinitely with no further international involvement or support, whether it be financial or otherwise.
