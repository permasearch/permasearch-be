Despite the setbacks of the Thirty Years' War, Austria was able to recover economically and demographically, and to consolidate the new hegemony, often referred to as Austrian Baroque.[42] By 1714 Austria had become a great power again.

Nevertheless, in the arts and architecture the baroque flourished in Austria. In peacetime Ferdinand IV (1637â€“1657) proved to be a great patron of the arts and a musician.
