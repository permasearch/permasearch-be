Jaq and Gus also appeared in the Grandma Duck comics in Walt Disney's Comics and Stories where they live with Grandma Duck and her grandnephew Gus Goose. At some time before then, they crossed paths with Donald Duck and Daisy Duck. They appeared in one Mickey Mouse comic strip adventure titled Mousepotamia where they appear to be the same size as Mickey rather than standard mouse size.
