Director J. J. Abrams added numerous lens flares to the 2009 film Star Trek by aiming powerful off-camera light sources at the lens. He explained: "I wanted a visual system that felt unique. I know there are certain shots where even I watch and think, 'Oh that's ridiculous, that was too many.' But I love the idea that the future was so bright it couldn't be contained in the frame." Many complained of the frequent use; Abrams admitted it was "overdone, in some places."[7]
