Having won the war, al-Mansur no longer needed his Berber ally Ibn Hamdun, who instead became a threat due to his substantial army. Ibn Hamdun was murdered in 983, having been made drunk at a feast held in his honor, then murdered as he departed.[200] According to Ibn Idhari, his head and one hand were then presented in secret to al-Mansur.[201]
