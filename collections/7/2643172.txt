The cost of the egg freezing procedure (without embryo transfer) in the United States, the United Kingdom and other European countries varies in between $5,000 and $12,000. This does not include the fertility medications involved in the procedure which can cost between $4,000 and $5,000. The cost of egg storage can vary from $100 to more than $1,000. It is important for women to be aware that provisional health programs do not cover social egg freezing. Furthermore, no provinces provide funding for IVF after social egg freezing.[12]
