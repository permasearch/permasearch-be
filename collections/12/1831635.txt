The Himyarite annexed Sana'a from Hamdan circa AD 100.[26] Hashdi tribesmen rebelled against them, however, and regained Sana'a in around 180.[27] It was not until 275 that Shammar Yahri'sh conquered Hadramout and Najran and Tihama, thus unifying Yemen and consolidating Himyarite rule.[28][29] The Himyarites rejected polytheism and adhered to a consensual form of monotheism called Rahmanism.[30] In 354, Roman Emperor Constantius II sent an embassy headed by Theophilos the Indian to convert the Himyarites to Christianity.[31] According to Philostorgius, the mission was resisted by local Jews.[32] Several inscriptions have been found in Hebrew and Sabaean praising the ruling house in Jewish terms for helping and empowering the People of Israel.[33]
