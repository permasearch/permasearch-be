On August 17, 2007, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve announced[4] a temporary change to primary credit lending terms. The discount rate was cut by 50 bp—to 5.75% from 6.25%—and the term of loans was extended from overnight to up to thirty days. This reduced the spread of the primary credit rate over the fed funds rate from 100 basis points to 50 basis points.
