Jonny is portrayed as being funny and "a bit of a lad". He also has a confident and charming persona. Thomson liked playing Jonny because he was a good guy, who was flawed. He also praised the writers for way his character was written, while Katy Moon from Inside Soap was convinced that Jonny would become popular with viewers. Jonny's storylines have often developed through his close friendship with Mo Effanga (Chizzy Akudolu) and his on-off relationship with Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel). Jonny later became a father when Jac gave birth to their daughter Emma, he was engaged to fellow nurse Bonnie Wallis (Carlyss Peer) until her death on their wedding day and was sent to prison after being accused of causing a patient's death. Jonny later reunited with Jac and they left Holby together.
