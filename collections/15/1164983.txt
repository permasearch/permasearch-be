In season seven, Mrs. Davis says that she is recently divorced because her husband cheated on her, and Raj attempts to strike up a conversation with her at a university mixer. After offending her, Raj apologizes, and the two talk about their troubles. Following the mixer, while Raj is insistent that Mrs. Davis and he had a "moment", Howard disagrees. Mrs. Davis makes another appearance in season 8, where she informs Sheldon that he has to teach a class as a junior professor, and in season 11, has to deal with Leonard after he gives an embarrassing interview on the radio about the university.
