Like the UK original, the U.S. version of Whose Line Is It Anyway? features four performers, two of whom, Colin Mochrie and Ryan Stiles, were regular, permanent performers throughout the original format, having featured prominently in the UK original; Stiles since his first appearance in its second season in 1989, while Mochrie since his first appearance in the following season in 1991, with both making regular appearances in the UK version from 1995 until its end in 1999. Another performer who made frequent, recurring appearances was Wayne Brady, who appeared in the majority of episodes of the original format. During his tenure as host, Drew Carey also took part, though only in one game, after one of the performers was declared the "winner" and allowed to take his place at his desk in the studio; host Aisha Tyler did not take part in games when the show was revived, but has occasionally joined in for a quick scene during the Scenes from a Hat game. As of 2017, Mochrie is the only performer to have appeared on every single episode of the American version.
