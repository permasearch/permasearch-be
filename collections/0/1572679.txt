CDKs are considered a potential target for anti-cancer medication. If it is possible to selectively interrupt the cell cycle regulation in cancer cells by interfering with CDK action, the cell will die. At present, some CDK inhibitors such as seliciclib are undergoing clinical trials. Although it was originally developed as a potential anti-cancer drug, seliciclib has also proven to induce apoptosis in neutrophil granulocytes, which mediate inflammation.[8] This means that novel drugs for treatment of chronic inflammation diseases such as arthritis and cystic fibrosis could be developed.
