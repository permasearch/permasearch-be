Superman's first mission interferes with the illegal dealings of Lex Luthor (John Shea), a Metropolis business giant and benefactor. After Luthor's plot was stopped, Superman let Luthor know he is watching him and the two become arch-enemies. However, Clark respects Luthor's life, even surreptitiously using his superpowers to save Lex from bleeding to death. Luthor sees Superman as a worthy opponent; he ultimately discovers his weakness to kryptonite and realizes he has a secret identity, vowing to learn it in hopes of making the hero's life difficult.
