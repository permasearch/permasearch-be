Tyler Crowley is one of Bella's classmates. In Twilight he nearly hits Bella with his van, but she is saved by Edward. Afterward, Tyler is desperate to make it up to her, bombarding her with constant apologies and asking her to a school dance, to which she refuses. He mistakenly assumes she will go to their prom with him and tells the rest of the school, only to hear from Edward that Bella will be unavailable to anyone but himself. His constant attention toward Bella causes Lauren, who is interested in him, to resent Bella.
