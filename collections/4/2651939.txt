Oakland's black population decreased by nearly 25 percent between 2000 and 2010.[87] The city's demographics have changed due to a combination of rising housing prices associated with gentrification and with blacks relocating to better housing in Bay Area suburbs or moving to the Southern United States in a reverse migration, where conditions are considered to have improved.[88][89][90] Blacks have formed a plurality in Oakland for many years, peaking in 1980 at about 47% of the population.
