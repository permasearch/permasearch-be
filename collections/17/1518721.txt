It is believed that Pierrepoint executed at least 433 men and 17 women, including six US soldiers at Shepton Mallet and some 200 Nazi war criminals after the Second World War. In his autobiography, he wrote that he specified the number of his executions in evidence to the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment of 1949, but requested that it should appear in the printed report only as "some hundreds." A figure of 608 people was given in the credits at the end of the film Pierrepoint (2005), without reference.[5]
