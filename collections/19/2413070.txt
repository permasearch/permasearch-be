During the first half of the twentieth century, a clear majority of the black population in major urban areas lived in hostels or servantsâ€™ accommodations provided by employers and were mostly single men. In the period during and following World War II urban areas of South Africa experienced a rapid period of urbanisation as the colour bar was relaxed due to the war.  Neither employers nor the government built new accommodation or homes for the influx of new residents.  This led to overcrowding, poor living conditions, and the absence of amenities thereby contributing to high levels of crime and violence. High rents and overcrowding led to land invasions and the growth of shack settlements which were largely ignored by government.[3]
