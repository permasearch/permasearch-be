This is a list of the tallest dams in the United States. The main list includes all U.S. dams over 300 feet (91Â m) high, and a second list gives the highest dams in each state. Dimensions given are for foundation height, not hydraulic height or head. Structures such as levees, dikes and tailings dams are not included in the lists. Decommissioned or failed dams, such as Teton Dam in Idaho, are included. Both lists are works in progress and will be updated periodically with new information. There are currently 75 entries on the main list.
