Malware exploits security defects (security bugs or vulnerabilities) in the design of the operating system, in applications (such as browsers, e.g. older versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer supported by Windows XP[41]), or in vulnerable versions of browser plugins such as Adobe Flash Player, Adobe Acrobat or Reader, or Java SE.[42][43] Sometimes even installing new versions of such plugins does not automatically uninstall old versions. Security advisories from plug-in providers announce security-related updates.[44] Common vulnerabilities are assigned CVE IDs and listed in the US National Vulnerability Database. Secunia PSI[45] is an example of software, free for personal use, that will check a PC for vulnerable out-of-date software, and attempt to update it.
