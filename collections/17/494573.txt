There was speculation for many years that Eden's biological father was the politician and man of letters George Wyndham, but this is considered impossible as Wyndham was in South Africa at the time of Eden's conception.[17] His mother was rumoured to have had an affair with Wyndham.[9] Eden had an elder brother, John, who was killed in action in 1914,[18] and a younger brother, Nicholas, who was killed when the battlecruiser HMS Indefatigable blew up and sank at the Battle of Jutland in 1916.[19]
