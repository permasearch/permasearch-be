It is essentially the opposite of a "dry cappuccino", which has dry frothy foam but no liquid milk. A flat white has milk (or microfoam) but no froth. The ‘milk should be velvety rather than fluffy ... therefore "stronger", which requires a shorter, "ristretto" [espresso shot] run to avoid harsh flavours’.[9] The flat white is similar to an original Italian cappuccino, which is a single espresso with microfoam served in a 150–160 mL (5.3–5.6 imp fl oz) cup.[10]
