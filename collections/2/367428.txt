Several federal agencies have adopted Jencks Act rules. Although the Jencks Act applies only to government agents or employees who testify in criminal cases, making these witnesses and relevant documents available for cross-examination after testimony, it has been applied in administrative law cases in the interests of justice and fair play.[63] The party of record must make an official request to the hearing officer to have Jencks rules followed.[64] Some agency rules, such as National Labor Relations Board automatically follow Jencks Act requirements.[65]
