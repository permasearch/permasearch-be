Holt is a surname and placename, of Proto-Germanic origin and meaning a small wood or grove of trees.[1] It derives from the Old English word holt and is a near-synonym of "wold" (from Old Englishwald), originally denoting a forested upland. Those words are cognates of the modern German words "Holz" and "Wald" respectively.
