From 73â€“71 BC, the praetor of the province was Gaius Verres, who was denounced by the Sicilians for extortion, theft, and robbery and was prosecuted at Rome by Cicero, whose speeches against him, known as the Verrines, still survive. Since these prosecution speeches are the main evidence for Verres' actions, it is hard to get an objective idea of the impact of his activities on Sicily. Cicero emphasises a very harsh implementation of the grain tax (for his personal profit rather than that of the Republic) and the theft of artworks, including sacred votive offerings. Verres had expected the power of his friends and the deft manipulation of legal procedure to ensure his acquittal, but after a blisteringly effective first speech from Sicily, he fled into exile.
