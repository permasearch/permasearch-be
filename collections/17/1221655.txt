iPhone 8 and 8 Plus retain the Retina HD Display found in iPhone 7,[11] but they now feature True Tone technology, allowing for automatic screen adjustments based on surrounding ambient lighting.[9] They can play HDR10 and Dolby Vision content despite not having an HDR-ready display, done by down-converting the HDR content to fit the display while still having some enhancements to dynamic range, contrast, and wide color gamut compared to standard content.[12]
