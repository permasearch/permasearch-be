Lilly committed himself to producing high-quality prescription drugs, in contrast to the common and often ineffective patent medicines. From its facilities in Indianapolis the company manufactured and sold "ethical drugs" for use by the medical profession. Lilly's medicines included labels that disclosed product ingredients.[8] Lilly's first innovation was gelatin-coating for pills and capsules. The companyâ€™s other early innovations included fruit flavorings and sugarcoated pills, which made the medicines easier to swallow.[15]
