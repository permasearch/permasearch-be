In 1960, Grant appeared opposite Robert Mitchum, Jean Simmons and Deborah Kerr in The Grass Is Greener, which was shot in England at Osterley Park and Shepperton Studios.[229] McCann notes that Grant took great relish in "mocking his aristocratic character's over-refined tastes and mannerisms",[230] though the film was panned and was seen as his worst since Dream Wife.[231] In 1962, Grant starred in the romantic comedy That Touch of Mink, playing suave, wealthy businessman Philip Shayne romantically involved with an office worker, played by Doris Day. He invites her to his apartment in Bermuda, but her guilty conscience begins to take hold.[232] The picture was praised by critics, and it received three Academy Award nominations, and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Comedy Picture,[233] in addition to another Golden Globe Award for Best Actor nomination.[234] Deschner ranked the film as the second highest grossing of Grant's career.[228]
