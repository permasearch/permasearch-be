In a later episode, Ellie runs for town council and faces stiff resistance from the menfolk of Mayberry who cannot abide the idea of a woman holding a man's position. With a good word or two from Andy however, the men change their minds and Ellie is elected. In another episode, Ellie introduces a muddy looking farmer's daughter to makeup, perfume, hairdos, and attractive dresses. In the only Christmas episode in the show's run, Ellie and Andy sing "Away in a Manger" with guitar accompaniment.
