Arabic names are Jawlān[14] and Djolan (Arabic: جولان‎).[15] In the Bible, Golan is mentioned as a city of refuge located in Bashan: Deuteronomy 4:43, Joshua 20:8, 1 Chronicles 6:71.[16] Nineteenth-century authors interpreted the word "Golan" (Hebrew: גולן‎) as meaning "something surrounded, hence a district".[17][18]
