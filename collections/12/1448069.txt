The Boston Marathon was first run in April 1897, having been inspired by the revival of the marathon for the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. It is the oldest continuously running marathon,[6] and the second longest continuously running footrace in North America, having debuted five months after the Buffalo Turkey Trot.[7]
