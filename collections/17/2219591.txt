Rishon LeZion was founded on 31 July 1882 by a group of ten members of Hovevei Zion from Kharkov (today's Ukraine). Zikhron Ya'akov was founded in December 1882 by Hovevei Zion pioneers from Romania.[25] In 1887 Neve Tzedek was built just outside Jaffa. Over 50 Jewish settlements were established in this period.
