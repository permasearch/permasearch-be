In Season 5, Godric's spirit again appears to his progeny Eric Northman, as Eric is feeding on humans under the influence of Lilith's blood. His last appearance is to his two progeny, Eric Northman and Norah Gainsborough, as Norah attempts to convert Eric to the religion of Lilith by forcing him to drink her blood. Instead of the expected Lilith appearing, Godric's spirit appears and attempts to reconcile Norah to his peaceful ways. Lilith appears in this vision and before a horrified Eric and Norah, rips Godric to shreds, thus ending his spirit visitations.
