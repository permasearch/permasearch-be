Under the Canadian Firearms Program, Airsoft guns resembling with near precision an existing make and model of an arm, other than an antique arm, are considered replica arms and therefore are prohibited devices. Models resembling antique arms may be allowed. Generally, antique arms are those manufactured before 1898.[10] Individuals may keep replica guns they owned on 1 December 1998 and no license is required, however the import or acquisition of replica firearms is prohibited.[11] If the replica firearm is taken out of Canada it will not be allowed back in.[11]
