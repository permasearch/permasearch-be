It has been reported[by whom?] that in modern vehicles there is a chance for setting off the side airbag deployment system of the vehicle, possibly causing injury to a person attempting to use a slim jim. However, according to research by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, this has not been verified and manufacturers state it is impossible.[2] An episode of MythBusters showed experimenters that were also unable to deploy an airbag with a slim jim.[3]
