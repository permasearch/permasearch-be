In 2007, Time magazine put The Mary Tyler Moore Show on its list of "17 Shows That Changed TV". Time stated that the series "liberated TV for adultsâ€”of both sexes" by being "a sophisticated show about grownups among other grownups, having grownup conversations".[14] The Associated Press said that the show "took 20 years of pointless, insipid situation comedy and spun it on its heels. [It did this by] pioneer[ing] reality comedy and the establishment of clearly defined and motivated secondary characters."[15]
