Through the first five seasons, there was no limit on the number of Roadblocks that a single team member could perform throughout the race. This often led to one team member performing the majority of Roadblocks during the race. On one occasion in season five, it may have led to the elimination of a fan-favorite underdog team, the Bowling Moms, against several younger male/female couples in the penultimate leg of season five.[6] In season six, a rule (often referred to by fans as the Bowling Moms Rule in reference to season 5) was introduced that limited a team member to a maximum number of Roadblocks he or she could complete (typically six, about half the number of Roadblocks on the race), effectively making both racers share an equal number of Roadblocks.[7] In season nine, the Roadblock limit was increased to a maximum of seven for a twelve-leg race.[8] In season 18, the rule was further modified to state that team members could not complete more than five Roadblocks prior to the final leg. Since at least season 24, a further modification was changed, limiting racers to a maximum of six Roadblocks through Leg 10 of a given race, with no Roadblock restrictions for all remaining legs.[9]
