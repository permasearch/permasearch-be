Alternative Press called Pretty. Odd. ambitious, while Blender called several songs on the record a "brush with greatness."[61][62] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone agreed with the latter statement, calling the songs "often beautiful," rounding out a less-than-impressed review with "Even when it's over the top, which is basically always, Pretty. Odd. sounds cheerful."[55] Entertainment Weekly's Leah Greenblatt called it "more pretty than odd," calling it a "headphones album, a dense, largely enjoyable layer cake of ideas and instrumentation that might actually alienate its teenage fans."[52] The A.V. Club's Aaron Burgess stated that Pretty. Odd. deserves "far more than a casual listen," praising the baroque orchestration and multilayered harmonies.[51] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called the album "a deliriously jumbled, left field delight."[50] Paul Schrodt of the online Slant Magazine dismissed the record as generic, but commended the "exuberant delivery" of the pop hooks.[63]
