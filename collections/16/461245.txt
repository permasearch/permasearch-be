In 1951, Swedish revue group Flickery Flies with Brita Borg recorded a Swedish version.[32][33] This was during a time of collaboration with showbiz impresario and songwriter Povel Ramel[34] who in a revue paraphrased it as Högt uppe på berget, jag har till en vän, förlorat en femma, jag lär nog aldrig se den utigen (High up on the mountain, I have to a friend, lost a 5 kronor bill, I doubt I'll see it again)[citation needed].
