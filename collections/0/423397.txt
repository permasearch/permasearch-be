As of 1892, Cleveland was one of only two people (the other being Andrew Jackson) to win the popular vote in three U.S. presidential elections. In the 20th century Franklin D. Roosevelt eventually exceeded this distinction by winning the popular vote in four consecutive elections. Cleveland also became the first Democrat to be nominated by his party three times, a distinction matched later only by William Jennings Bryan and exceeded by Franklin D. Roosevelt.
