Much of the world was introduced to the platypus in 1939 when National Geographic Magazine published an article on the platypus and the efforts to study and raise it in captivity. The latter is a difficult task, and only a few young have been successfully raised since, notably at Healesville Sanctuary in Victoria. The leading figure in these efforts was David Fleay, who established a platypusary—a simulated stream in a tank—at the Healesville Sanctuary, where breeding was successful in 1943.[81] In 1972, he found a dead baby of about 50 days old, which had presumably been born in captivity, at his wildlife park at Burleigh Heads on the Gold Coast, Queensland.[82] Healesville repeated its success in 1998 and again in 2000 with a similar stream tank.[83] Since 2008, platypus has bred regularly at Healesville,[84] including second-generation (captive born themselves breeding in captivity).[85] Taronga Zoo in Sydney bred twins in 2003, and breeding was again successful there in 2006.[83]
