The original iteration that appeared in the original Metal Gear game is located 200 kilometers north of the fictional region of Garzburg, South Africa. A legendary mercenary financed the nation's establishment to attract disillusioned soldiers, with a massive fortress as its centerpiece. Its potential threat to world affairs is boosted with the deployment of the TX-55 Metal Gear, a bipedal tank capable of launching a nuclear strike from anywhere on the planet. In the game, FOXHOUND commander Big Boss ordered rookie agent Solid Snake to infiltrate the mercenary state and destroy Metal Gear. After Snake successfully defies expectations and destroys Metal Gear, Big Boss reveals himself as the nation's benefactor and confronts Snake but Big Boss is ultimately defeated with Outer Heaven destroyed as well.
