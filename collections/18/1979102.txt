With Rick Dufay taking Whitford's place, Rock in a Hard Place was released on August 1, 1982. The album reached number 32 on the Billboard 200 album chart.[41] Only one single charted, the aforementioned "Lightning Strikes", which peaked at number 21 on the Billboard Top Tracks chart.[52] As with the tour for Night in the Ruts, Aerosmith was unable to book larger venues and instead had to rely on filling clubs and theaters, which they struggled to do. At a show in Worcester, Massachusetts, Tyler and Perry reunited and got high backstage before the show. Tyler was so intoxicated that he collapsed on stage again and, like before, could not get up.[63]
