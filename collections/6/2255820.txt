The main reaction types of phosphines are as nucleophiles and bases. Their nucleophilicity is evidence by their reactions with alkyl halides to phosphonium salts. Phosphines are nucleophilic catalysts in the dimerization of enones in various reactions in organic synthesis, e.g. the Rauhutâ€“Currier reaction.
