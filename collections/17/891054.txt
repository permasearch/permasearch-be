In Sweet Smell of Success, J.J. Hunsecker and his sister Susie live on one of the upper floors of the Brill Building. The title of the 2014 New Pornographers power pop album Brill Bruisers is a reference to the 60's-era Brill Building studio sound.[13] In the HBO series Vinyl, the fictitious record label American Century is headquartered in the Brill Building.
