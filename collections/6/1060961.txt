With the eliminations of Sasha Allen and Amber Carrington, Adam Levine and Shakira no longer have any remaining artists on their teams. It marked the first time that a new coach has coached an artist competing in the finale on his first attempt, as Usher still has Michelle Chamuel available on his team. Note: Coincidentally, Sasha and Amber were put against each other in the battles, and the two were later eliminated together in the Top 5. Amber Carrington was the first contestant to reach the Top 10 of iTunes and to be eliminated in the same week.
