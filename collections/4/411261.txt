In 2017, it is revealed that Will (Chandler Massey) did not die when he was strangled. When Will had entered Ben’s apartment, he was being followed by Susan Banks, who was planning to abduct Will in an act of revenge against Sami, whom she blamed for her son EJ’s death. When Ben slipped out after strangling Will, Susan and her associate Dr Wilhelm Rolf (who had revived Sami’s step-dad John back when he was thought to be dead) secretly entered, and Dr Rolf found Will to be unconscious but breathing. He then injected Will with something that would make him appear to be dead. After Lucas and Sami had viewed Will in the morgue, Dr Rolf revived Will. It turns out that Will’s family unwittingly buried an empty coffin at his funeral, and Will, who had lost all his memories, was taken by Susan, who took care of him, but made him believe that he was her son EJ.
