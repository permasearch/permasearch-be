According to Kreps of Rolling Stone, "The Herb Ritts-esque black-and-white clip finds Rihanna and West just singing their collaborative track while McCartney strums the riff on an acoustic guitar, with the real highlight coming when the three musical titans share the same frame."[86] Steven Gottlieb of VideoStatic described it as, "vertically constrained to just the center third of the screen, the focus of this silvery black-and-white clip is Rihanna's emotional performance", while McCartney and West supported her role.[81] According to Erin Strecker of Billboard the video allows "each of the three superstars their moment in the spotlight. The camera mostly switches between tight individual shots of each denim-clad, passionate performer, although there are also a few scenes of all three together".[87] Jessica Goodman of The Huffington Post described the video as "simple and clean, much like the song".[88] Similarly, Nolan Feeney of Time called the video simple, but also "surprisingly intimate" like the single.[89] He also described Rihanna's eye-roll in the video as "epic".[89] Additionally, Feeney noted that the video is shot in a square aspect ratio and compared it to the works of French-Canadian filmmaker Xavier Dolan.[89]
