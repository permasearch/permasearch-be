As the state capital, Springfield, is home to the three branches of Illinois government. Much like the United States federal government, Illinois government has an executive branch, occupied by the state governor, a legislative branch, which consists of the state senate and house, and a judicial branch, which is topped by the Illinois Supreme Court.[95] The Illinois legislative branch is collectively known as the Illinois General Assembly.[96] Many State of Illinois bureaucrats work in offices in Springfield, and it is the regular meeting place of the Illinois General Assembly.[97] All persons elected in a statewide manner in Illinois are required to have at least one residence in Springfield, and the state government funds these residents.[98]
