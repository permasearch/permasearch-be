In April 2013, J. August Richards, one of the stars of the earlier Joss Whedon series Angel, was cast in the pilot in an unspecified role,[50] later revealed to be Mike Peterson,[49] the first live-action portrayal of Deathlok and a recurring character throughout the season.[51] Nicholas Brendon, another Whedon collaborator, was also reportedly considered for Richards' role.[52] In December, two recurring characters were set to be added to the series with the episode "T.A.H.I.T.I." They were described as "an African-American agent who specializes in combat/weapons, and a high-level S.H.I.E.L.D. agent/munitions expert who has past ties to both Coulson and Ward."[53] In January 2014, Bill Paxton was cast as Agent John Garrett, "a rough-and-tumble former cohort of Agent Coulson with a little bit of attitude and cigar-smoking swagger", for at least four episodes of the season.[54] Jed Whedon said that "We actually discussed Bill Paxton in the room, when we were talking about the character ... Then when he came up as an actual possibility, we couldn't believe it."[55] The next month, B.J. Britt was cast as Agent Triplett, an associate of Garrett.[34] Other recurring guests in the season include Saffron Burrows as Victoria Hand,[56] David Conrad as Ian Quinn,[57] and Ruth Negga as Raina.[31][58]
