Mauer underwent arthroscopic knee surgery after the 2010 season, and missed most of spring training due to a difficult recovery from the operation.[44] After further difficulties during the first days of the season, he was placed on the disabled list immediately after the Twins' game on April 15.[45] Team doctors believed his problem, termed a "bilateral leg weakness", was due to too light a workload during spring training.[46] Mauer returned to game action as a designated hitter in extended spring training on May 25,[47] and made his first post-DL appearance as a catcher in another extended spring training game on June 2.[44] The following week, he went on a further rehabilitation assignment to the Twins' Class A affiliate, the Fort Myers Miracle, a team managed by his older brother Jake.[47] After Mauer caught several games with the Miracle, it was speculated he could return to the Twins as early as June 16 or 17, but Twins manager Ron Gardenhire did not commit to a return date.[48] Joe Mauer returned to play with the Minnesota Twins on June 17, 2011 and received a standing ovation from the fans.[49]
