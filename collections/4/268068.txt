Khan's first starring role was in Lekh Tandon's television series Dil Dariya, which began shooting in 1988, but production delays led to the 1989 series Fauji becoming his television debut instead.[41] In the series, which depicted a realistic look at the training of army cadets, he played the leading role of Abhimanyu Rai.[42][43] This led to further appearances in Aziz Mirza's television series Circus (1989–90) and Mani Kaul's miniseries Idiot (1991).[44] Khan also played minor parts in the serials Umeed (1989) and Wagle Ki Duniya (1988–90),[44] and in the English-language television film In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones (1989).[45] His appearances in these serials led critics to compare his look and acting style with those of the film actor Dilip Kumar,[46] but Khan was not interested in film acting at the time, thinking that he was not good enough.[44][47]
