About 2 miles (3Â km) outside the town, the main columns reunited with the advance parties.[40]  They were startled by the sudden appearance of 50 armed men, but they were American.  Led by Adam Stephen, they had not known about the plan to attack Trenton, and had attacked a Hessian outpost.[41]  Washington feared the Hessians would have been put on guard, and shouted at Stephen, "You sir! You Sir, may have ruined all my plans by having them put on their guard."[41] Despite this, Washington ordered the advance continue to Trenton. In the event, Rall thought the first raid was the attack which Grant had warned him about, and that there would be no further action that day.[42]
