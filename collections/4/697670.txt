The men also fished in large groups. Fishing expeditions included men in canoes using weirs and nets to cover entire streams and harvest large amounts of fish, sometimes a thousand in half of a day.[14] A hunting or fishing party's takings were considered common property; they were divided among the party by the leader or taken to the village for a feast.[15] Hunting and fishing were not always cooperative efforts, but the Iroquois generally did better in parties than as individuals.[16]
