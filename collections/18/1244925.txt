Cryopreservation of people or large animals is not reversible with current technology. The stated rationale for cryonics is that people who are considered dead by current legal or medical definitions may not necessarily be dead according to the more stringent information-theoretic definition of death.[21][37] It is proposed that cryopreserved people might someday be recovered by using highly advanced technology.[38][39]
