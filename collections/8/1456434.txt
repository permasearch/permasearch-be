Let     X   {\displaystyle X}   be a random variable with a finite number of finite outcomes      x  1     {\displaystyle x_{1}}  ,      x  2     {\displaystyle x_{2}}  , ...,      x  k     {\displaystyle x_{k}}   occurring with probabilities      p  1     {\displaystyle p_{1}}  ,      p  2     {\displaystyle p_{2}}  , ...,      p  k     {\displaystyle p_{k}}  , respectively. The expectation of     X   {\displaystyle X}   is defined as
