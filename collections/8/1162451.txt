While mice are by far the most widely used animals in biomedical research, recent studies have highlighted their limitations.[36] For example, the utility of rodents in testing for sepsis,[37] burns,[37] inflammation,[37] stroke,[38][39] ALS,[40][41][42] Alzheimer’s,[43] diabetes,[44][45] cancer,[46][47][48][49][50] multiple sclerosis,[51] Parkinson’s disease[51] and other illnesses has been called into question by a number of researchers. Regarding experiments on mice, some researchers have complained that “years and billions of dollars have been wasted following false leads” as a result of a preoccupation with the use of these animals in studies.[36]
