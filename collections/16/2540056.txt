On August 6, 2010, Prince Albert II, the Principality of Monaco's Head of State, and his fiancÃ©e Charlene Wittstock, on a vacation tour of the United States, also toured Graceland.[38] Albert explained: "If you're on a summer holiday, you've got to come at this time of year. I've always wanted to come to Graceland. Charlene and my friends wanted to be here today for this visit, Elvis touched our lives as well and the lives of so many people. We wanted to pay our respects and see what this place was all about."[38]
