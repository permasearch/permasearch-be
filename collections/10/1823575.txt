Drying Racks can be used for various purposes, including drying and holding chromatography plates, as well as drying test tubes by placing them in an inverted position in the pegs. Placing the test tubes in an inverted position not only aids in drying, but it also minimizes the accumulation of airborne contaminants and other substances. Additionally, the drying racks are usually made of polypropylene and can be placed in the autoclave.[4]
