After-hours trading is the name for buying and selling of securities when the major markets are closed. [1] Since 1985, the regular trading hours for major exchanges in the United States, such as the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market, have been from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time (ET).[2] Pre-market trading occurs from 4:00 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. ET, although the majority of the volume and liquidity come to the pre-market at 8:00AM ET.[3][4] After-hours trading on a day with a normal session occurs from 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET.[4] Market makers and specialists generally do not participate in after hours trading, which can limit liquidity.[5]
