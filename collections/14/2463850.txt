Efforts to clean up the river and restore it to a state where swimming and fishing would be acceptable began as early as the 1960s, and the program to clean up the Charles for good took shape in 1965 with the creation of the Charles River Watershed Association.[12]  In 1978, a new Charles River Dam was constructed downstream from the Science Museum site to keep salt water out of the basin.
