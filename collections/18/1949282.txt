Newman and Copland led the charge from the old town across a bridge raked by machine gun fire and advanced into the new town. The Commandos attempted to get through the narrow streets of the town and into the surrounding countryside, but were eventually surrounded. When their ammunition was expended their only option was to surrender.[44][46][48] Not all the Commandos were captured; five men reached neutral Spain, from where they eventually returned to England.[49]
