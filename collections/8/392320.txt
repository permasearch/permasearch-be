New York invites the remaining six guys' exes to the house and this time, there's a special twist involved. She's bringing two of her exes, Chance and Real, to help dig up some dirt on her guys. The only problem is that feelings resurface when the old flame admits he still has serious feelings for New York. When her "new" guys catch wind of this, all hell breaks loose. Later on, Pretty quits the competition because of the interrogating his sister received and New York asking her way too personal questions regarding his sexuality. At eliminations, no one was eliminated as a result of Pretty leaving the mansion.
