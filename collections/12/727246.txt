The extent of her actual military participation and leadership is a subject of debate among historians. On the one hand, Joan stated that she carried her banner in battle and had never killed anyone,[44] preferring her banner "forty times" better than a sword;[45] and the army was always directly commanded by a nobleman, such as the Duke of AlenÃ§on for example. On the other hand, many of these same noblemen stated that Joan had a profound effect on their decisions since they often accepted the advice she gave them, believing her advice was divinely inspired.[46] In either case, historians agree that the army enjoyed remarkable success during her brief time with it.[47]
