Carter opens his clinic for the underprivileged, with Peter Benton (Eriq La Salle) and his son Reese (Matthew Watkins), Kerry Weaver (Laura Innes) and Susan Lewis (Sherry Stringfield) among the guests. He named the facility after his late son, Joshua. After the event, he has an awkward reunion with Joshua's mother Kem (Thandie Newton), who is briefly in town; she isn't particularly happy to see Carter and coldly rebuffs his efforts to re-connect with her, but does reluctantly agree with his plan to join her at the airport for her flight back to Paris. He also has drinks with his old friends plus Elizabeth Corday (Alex Kingston), who brought Rachel to Chicago for her med school interview. Benton and Corday linger together after everyone else go their separate ways.
