A best-of-two playoff is a head-to-head competition between two teams in which one team must win either two games to win the series or win one game and a tie breaker to win the series. Commonly known as the least logical and most comical of the Best-Of options, local lesser known leagues such as the Oak Bay hockey league hang in there with this potentially confusing format that can lead to back to back shootouts to determine both the second game's winner and potentially the series winner too.
