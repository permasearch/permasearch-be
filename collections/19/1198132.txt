Wat Pho is one of Bangkok's oldest temples. It existed before Bangkok was established as the capital by King Rama I. It was originally named Wat Photaram or Podharam, from which the name Wat Pho is derived.[4][9] The name refers the monastery of the Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya, India where Buddha is believed to have attained enlightenment.[6][10] The older temple is thought to have been built or expanded during the reign of King Phetracha (1688â€“1703), but date and founder unknown.[6][11] The southern section of Wat Pho used to be occupied by part of a french Star fort that was demolished by King Phetracha after the 1688 Siege of Bangkok.[12]
