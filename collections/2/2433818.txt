Section 1(1) does not specify voluntary consumption. The Bill drafted by the Law Commission did, however, and therefore would have protected from a liability a person who has his drink “spiked” by another. Under the Act, such a person would escape liability on the basis that he did not know that the substance he was drinking would have the effect it did. The Law Commission’s Bill, however, has “the advantage of also clearly leading to the acquittal of a person who was forced to drink an alcoholic or other concoction, which he knew would have the effect of impairing his faculties, but who had no control over his actions.”[258] Burchell suggests that the courts “interpret the words ‘consumes or uses’ as implying conduct directed by the consumer’s or user’s will and therefore importing voluntary intoxication”.[259]
