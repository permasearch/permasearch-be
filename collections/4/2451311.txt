JBA tickets, which cost $99 for courtside seats, $59 for center court, and $40 for above center court, were criticized as "unreasonably expensive" by the USA Today website For The Win.[30][31] The website also labeled JBA ticket sales as "comically abysmal," with over 90 percent of seats still being available less than three weeks before the season opener.[32] The New York Post wrote, "In what should come a surprise to no one, LaVar Ball is struggling to find an audience with his newly launched Junior Basketball Association."[33]
