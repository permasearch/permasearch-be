In 2013, CSX's "Play It Safe" campaign promoting safety near railroad tracks signed on as a sponsor for the No. 34 driven by David Ragan of Front Row Motorsports in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series. This sponsorship has continued with drivers Brett Moffitt in 2015, Chris Buescher in 2016, and Landon Cassill in 2017.[26]
