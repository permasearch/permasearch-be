Historians generally agree that the first Turkic people lived in a region extending from Central Asia to Siberia. Historically they were established after the 6th century BCE.[23] The earliest separate Turkic peoples appeared on the peripheries of the late Xiongnu confederation about 200 B.C [23] (contemporaneous with the Chinese Han Dynasty).[24]  The first mention of Turks was in a Chinese text that mentioned trade of Turk tribes with the Sogdians along the Silk Road.[25]
