Detective Wilden is on the case. He thinks Hanna is guilty since her blood type matches the blood found on the anklet. Aria makes a trip to Radley to see if she can get Mona to crack about her possible co-conspirators. Shortly after Aria leaves, Hanna decides they should break back in to try to talk to Mona alone without a chaperone around. Mona leads them into the abandoned children's wing of Radley where she hums to herself repeating the same thing over and over again. Hanna realizes later on that Mona was trying to tell them through a code that someone's "NOT SAFE", that "MAYA KNEW", and the address to Maya's website (MAS Sugar) which the girls did not know about. The girls meet a girl named CeCe who reminds them a lot of Ali. It turns out that CeCe and Alison were friends and she used to date Jason. Spencer sees Jason's car crashed into a tree. She drives him home and leaves her car at the scene of the accident. When the cops knock at Spencer's door, she and Toby lie to protect Jason, though Toby does not understand yet. When Spencer explains, Toby becomes frustrated and leaves.
