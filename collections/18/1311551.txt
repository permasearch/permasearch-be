At a country fair near Casterbridge in the fictional county of Wessex Michael Henchard, a 21 year old hay-trusser, argues with his wife Susan. Drunk on rum-laced furmity he auctions her off, along with his baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane, to Richard Newson, a passing sailor, for five guineas. Sober the next day, he is too late to recover his family. When he realises they are gone, he swears never to touch liquor again for as many years as he has lived so far.
