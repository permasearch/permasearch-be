The comic's early success was indirectly responsible for the creation of the Fantastic Four. When Marvel-Timely owner Martin Goodman heard in 1961 how well DC's then-new book Justice League was selling, he told Stan Lee, his comics editor, to come up with a team of superheroes for Marvel.[97] The result was Fantastic Four #1 by Lee and Jack Kirby, which debuted in November 1961.[98]
