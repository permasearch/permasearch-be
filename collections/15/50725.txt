Suddenly the house falls to the ground and all is quiet. As Dorothy opens the door, the film changes to technicolor – she and Toto have arrived in Munchkinland, part of the Land of Oz. Glinda the Good Witch of the North and the munchkins welcome her as their heroine because the house landed on and killed the Wicked Witch of the East. In the middle of the celebration, the Wicked Witch of the West arrives in a ball of smoke and fire to claim her sister's ruby slippers, but Glinda transports them onto Dorothy's feet before the witch can get them. The witch swears revenge on Dorothy for her sister's death. Glinda tells Dorothy to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City where the Wizard of Oz might be able to help her get back home to Kansas.
