Ovance, a Chinese herbal medicine formula has shown success at treating low AMH levels and improving pregnancy outcomes. Studies report increases in serum AMH levels in women with 0.0028 ng/ml or 0.02 pmol/l.[46] Pregnancy was very low at AMH ≤0.04 ng/mL but significantly increased at AMH 0.41–1.05 ng/mL, resulting in similarly low live-birth rates at all AMH levels ≤1.05 ng/mL and significantly improved live-birth rates at AMH ≥1.06 ng/mL.[46]
