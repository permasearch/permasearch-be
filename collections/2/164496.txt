The juxtaglomerular apparatus is a specialized region associated with the nephron, but separate from it. It produces and secretes into the circulation the enzyme renin, which cleaves angiotensin-1 and creates angiotensin-2, a potent vasoconstictor: the renin-angiotensin system. It is located between the thick ascending limb and the afferent arteriole. It contains three components: the macula densa, juxtaglomerular cells, and extraglomerular mesangial cells.[citation needed]
