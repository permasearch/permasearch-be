The sugar industry in the EU came under bureaucratic pressure in 2006 and ultimately resulted in the loss of 20,000 jobs, although many factories, as detailed in a later 2010 EU audit, were found to have been mistakenly shut-down, as they were profitable without government intervention.[33] Western Europe, and Eastern Europe did not produce enough sugar from sugar beets to meet overall demand for sugar in 2010â€“2011, and were net importers of sugar.[4]
