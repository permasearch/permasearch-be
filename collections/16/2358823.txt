Dexter Holland opens the video by flying into a serene suburban setting on a hang glider. A male fast food worker (played by Dor Ashur) has a milkshake dumped on his face by a group of buxom female customers and then throws himself through a window, and a BMX biker falls off a roof shortly thereafter. Toward the end, Holland triggers an explosion that scatters his followers so that only his fellow band members remain.
