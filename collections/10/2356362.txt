The Sync Framework runtime provides synchronization functionality, without being tied to any data store or data transport protocols. By providing data source specific synchronization providers, any data source can be supported. For example, using proper synchronization providers, files can be synchronized across computers, project updates synchronized across project participants, or media synchronized across devices. Sync Framework ships with three providers: Microsoft Sync Services for ADO.NET, Sync Services for File Systems, and Sync Services for SSE. Sync Services can be used to synchronize devices by supplying providers for the device. Similarly, PIM software such as Microsoft Office Outlook and media libraries such as Windows Media Player can also be supported by providing suitable providers.
