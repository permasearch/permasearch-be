In 2015, the Chiefs were in danger of missing the playoffs for a second consecutive year after they lost five straight games and began the season 1-5. Reid accepted the blame for his team's poor start[21] and his future with the Chiefs was called into question.[22] However, the Chiefs rebounded and proceeded to win every remaining regular season game, finishing with an 11-5 record and a Wild Card spot in the AFC playoffs. Reid would go on to lead the Chiefs to their first playoff win since 1994 in a 30-0 shutout of the Houston Texans, but the team would be defeated 27-20 in their subsequent Divisional Round game against the New England Patriots. Prior to the loss, the Chiefs posted an eleven-game winning streak, which is the best in franchise history. Reid was criticized for his clock management near the end of game, calling no timeouts in a late fourth quarter drive that cut the Patriots' 27-13 lead down to a touchdown, but took the Chiefs 5 minutes and 16 seconds to score and left them with only a minute and 13 seconds on the clock to tie the game.[23]
