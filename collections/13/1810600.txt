In 1970, Cole hired 28-year-old Norm DeBriyn after another man took the job but resigned after only one day.  DeBriyn inherited a program that played at a dilapidated stadium at the Washington County Fairgrounds, and whose paperwork was contained in a single manila folder.  He immediately set about upgrading the program.  Within three years, he had the Razorbacks in the NCAA Tournament for the first time in school history.  He then persuaded athletic director Frank Broyles to build a new on-campus stadium, George Cole Field.[6][7]
