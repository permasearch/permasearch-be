"Pour que tu m'aimes encore" was written and produced by Jean-Jacques Goldman and became one of Dion's signature songs. The lyrics are sung from the viewpoint of a woman who is pleading with her ex-lover that she would do anything for him to love her again. The music video was directed by Michel Meyer (1995) and can be found on Dion's DVD On ne change pas (2005).
