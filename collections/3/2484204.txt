Reporting on unnamed sources who attended a 2012 meeting of the NFL's International Committee, CBS stated that while league/owner discussions of a possible London team had previously generally been regarded as a "more a far-off concept than near-term possibility", the mood had now palpably shifted to one of "when, not if", with the NFL planning for a London team within 10 years, earlier than some team owners had anticipated. It was believed that because other issues such as the CBA renegotiation had been resolved, creating a London franchise was now being treated as a focal point of the NFL's desire to expand globally.[2] Speaking in 2015, Mark Waller firmed up this view, explaining "[The NFL] have always said that we felt that we started in 2007 with the [International Series] games and we felt it was a 15 year process so that would give us years ’21, ’22 and that feels sort of right – five or six years."[3] By the start of 2016 he was even more confident, stating "I think we're on track to deliver [a franchise by 2022]. I fundamentally believe we will deliver that".[4] He has also said he would feel he would have personally failed in his role if it does not happen by 2022.[5] Waller is clear however that there is no specific timetable, and it would only happen "when we're ready" and there was real certainty everything needed was in place.[6] In both 2014 and 2015 the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne confirmed he was in talks with the NFL over the arrangements for setting up a London franchise, and that it could be achieved "in the next few years, maybe four or five years time."[3][7] The 2022 timeline was still on target as of September 2017, with the league noting that the groundwork in London was ready for such a team, and that the 2022 date was chosen because it coincided with the league's collective bargaining agreement and television contracts expiring.[8]
