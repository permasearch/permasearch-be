Although the #MeToo movement started out relatively small in Japan, it appears to be picking up steam.[340] There is evidence that just 4% of rape victims in Japan report the crime, and the charges are dropped about half the time.[146] BuzzFeed Japan has started a #MeToo page featuring articles about the movement in Japan.[341] Journalist and author Shiori Ito published an article in Politico about the state of #MeToo in Japan. She has stated, "It's not that victims haven't come forward; Japanese society wants them to stay silent." Two famous authors, Kyoko Nakajima and Mayumi Mori, have written in Asahi newspaper with criticism of Japan's silence on this matter.[146] Takumi Harimaya wrote about the #MeToo movement in BuzzFeed Japan, stating she believes it could make a difference if the idea spreads, and sharing stories of victims, including what happened to popular blogger Hakuo Au (nÃ©e Haruka Ito) at the hands of Mr Kishi Yuki.[342] Other writers such as Kirsten King and Akiko Kobayashi have shared their #MeToo stories to Japanese audiences.[343][344]
