Outside of Las Vegas, Michael Zane, a recent parolee, stops at a run-down desert motel. There, he catches a boy, Jesse, stealing the death's head wheel nuts off his car's wheels and chases him, meeting his mother, Cybil Waingrow, whom he later beds. The following morning four men dressed in Elvis costumes arrive to pick him up: Murphy, Hanson, Gus, and Franklin. Together they set off into Vegas to a casino holding an Elvis convention intent on robbing it â€” dressed as Elvis impersonators. Michael rigs the elevator while the others rob the cages and counting room, and after a grotesquely violent firefight, Franklin is killed during their escape.
