In keeping with Brooks' own tradition, each ticket sold for the tour is the same price, regardless of location in the venue.[44] An issue that arose beginning with the first concerts on the tour has been high ticket resale prices. For example, tickets for the seven-show residency in Dallas were being resold online for an average price 21% higher than face value.[45] Because of Ticketmaster's anti-resale policies, Brooks chose the company to be the official ticket sales company for the tour. Despite the optimism for a lack of extreme resale prices, Ticketmaster's partner resale sites and services began allowing individuals to sell marked up tickets anyway. In the first weeks of the tour, Atlanta tickets were posted for sale on TicketsNow for as much as nearly 470% higher than face value (i.e. a $71.50 ticket being sold for $405).[46] Brooks, a long-time proponent of banning increased price ticket resales, called out those marking up ticket prices, saying his ultimate goal is making concerts affordable regardless of seat location.[47]
