From 1968 to 1999, Tigger was voiced by Paul Winchell. However, Walt Disney initially planned to have the character voiced by Wally Boag, but the role was turned over to Winchell after Disney's death, since Boag's performance of the character was considered to be "too zany for a children's film".[6] Sam Edwards voiced Tigger in a couple of albums for Disneyland Records before Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day was released.[7][8] Will Ryan voiced Tigger only in the Disney Channel program Welcome to Pooh Corner, which ran from 1983 to 1986. Later, Jim Cummings (who is also the new voice of Pooh) provided Tigger's voice, starting with the 2000 film The Tigger Movie.
