Part two of the double header is a spinner bike challenge, in which each team must pedal uphill 24.8 miles, the same distance as the biking portion of an Olympic triathlon. The challenge is tough, but it's worth the reward, as the winning team gets a four-pound advantage on the scale. The Red Team takes an early lead, but soon falls behind the Blue Team. Suddenly, the White Team comes from behind and wins their third challenge in a row! Now Jen's team is the team to beat with a six-pound advantage over the others. But the winners have a difficult choice: If they keep their four pounds, the Red and Blue Teams get letters from home. If they give up the four pounds, they get to read letters from home. The White Team chooses to keep their weight advantage, and the other teams are overjoyed to get some much-needed emotional support from friends and family. Tears are shed, but the letters really help motivate the contestants and give them strength. This is especially true for Lori, who has a breakthrough and gets her spark back.
