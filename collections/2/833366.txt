London is the centre of an extensive radial commuter railway network which, along with Paris, is the busiest and largest in Europe, serving the surrounding metropolitan area. Each terminus is associated with commuter services from a particular segment of this area. The majority of commuters to central London (about 80% of 1.1Â million) arrive by either the Underground (400,000 daily) or by surface railway into these termini (860,000 daily).[13]
