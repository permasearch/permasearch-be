The output for the orientation tensor is in the three orthogonal (perpendicular) axes of space. The three eigenvectors are ordered      v  1   ,  v  2   ,  v  3     {\displaystyle v_{1},v_{2},v_{3}}   by their eigenvalues      E  1   ≥  E  2   ≥  E  3     {\displaystyle E_{1}\geq E_{2}\geq E_{3}}  ;[43]      v  1     {\displaystyle v_{1}}   then is the primary orientation/dip of clast,      v  2     {\displaystyle v_{2}}   is the secondary and      v  3     {\displaystyle v_{3}}   is the tertiary, in terms of strength. The clast orientation is defined as the direction of the eigenvector, on a compass rose of 360°. Dip is measured as the eigenvalue, the modulus of the tensor: this is valued from 0° (no dip) to 90° (vertical). The relative values of      E  1     {\displaystyle E_{1}}  ,      E  2     {\displaystyle E_{2}}  , and      E  3     {\displaystyle E_{3}}   are dictated by the nature of the sediment's fabric. If      E  1   =  E  2   =  E  3     {\displaystyle E_{1}=E_{2}=E_{3}}  , the fabric is said to be isotropic. If      E  1   =  E  2   >  E  3     {\displaystyle E_{1}=E_{2}>E_{3}}  , the fabric is said to be planar. If      E  1   >  E  2   >  E  3     {\displaystyle E_{1}>E_{2}>E_{3}}  , the fabric is said to be linear.[44]
