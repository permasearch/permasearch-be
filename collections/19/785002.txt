With Sister Mary Lazarusâ€™ help, she helps to rearrange the choir and trains them to become better singers. When the choir perform at Mass one Sunday, they sing "Hail Holy Queen" beautifully in a traditional manner, before shifting into a gospel and rock-and-roll-infused interpretation of the hymn. Although the Reverend Mother is infuriated, O'Hara congratulates the choir's unorthodox performance for bringing in people, including teenagers, off the streets and into the church. This leads Mary Clarence to convince him to have the nuns head outside and clean up the neighborhood. The choir continue to amaze parishioners and visitors with their music, including a performance of "My Guy" (appropriately rewritten as "My God"), and soon help to transform the neighborhood. This, however, makes Souther slightly annoyed at Deloris for nearly exposing her location on national television because of the nuns' work.
