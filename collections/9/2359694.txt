Some scholars claim that Fujimori's government became a "dictatorship" after the auto-coup,[81] permeated by a network of corruption organized by his associate Montesinos, who now faces dozens of charges that range from embezzlement to drug trafficking to murder (Montesinos is currently on trial in Lima).[82][83][84] Fujimori's style of government has also been described as "populist authoritarianism". Numerous governments[85] and human rights organizations such as Amnesty International, have welcomed the extradition of Fujimori to face human rights charges.[86] As early as 1991, Fujimori had himself vocally denounced what he called "pseudo-human rights organizations" such as Amnesty International and Americas Watch, for allegedly failing to criticize the insurgencies targeting civilian populations throughout Peru against which his government was struggling.[87]
