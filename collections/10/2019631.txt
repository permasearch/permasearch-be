A passage of the poem often paraphrased as Ang hindì marunong magmahal sa sariling wikà, masahol pa sa hayop at malansang isdâ (English: 'He that knows not to love his own language, is worse than beasts and putrid fish') is widely quoted to promote the use of Tagalog among Filipinos. It is encountered most frequently during the Buwan ng Wika ('Language Month'), a commemoration of the establishment of the Filipino language as the national language of the Philippines.[4][5]
