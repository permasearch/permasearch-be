During the rule of the Chinese Tang dynasty (618–907), Tibet and China were frequently at war with parts of Tibet temporarily captured by the Chinese to become part of their territory.[66] Around 650, the Chinese captured Lhasa.[67][68][69][69] In 763, Tibet very briefly took the Chinese capital of Chang'an during the Tang civil war.[66][better source needed]
