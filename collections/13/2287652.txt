Short-circuiting a battery will cause the cell to overheat and possibly to catch fire. Adjacent cells may then overheat and fail, possibly causing the entire battery to ignite or rupture. In the event of a fire, the device may emit dense irritating smoke.[164] The fire energy content (electrical + chemical) of cobalt-oxide cells is about 100 to 150 kJ/(AÂ·h), most of it chemical.[76][unreliable source?][165]
