Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps called Cane and Lily "one of daytime's most popular couples", and their story with Billy and Chloe "one of soaps all-time best quadrangle story arcs".[35] Mallory Harlen of Soap Opera Digest praised the quadrangle for adding another layer to Lily: "The always prim, always perfect Lily reminded me way too much of Christine Blair...in a bad way. But being a woman scorned really worked for her; her newfound feistiness is completely fitting for Drucilla's daughter."[82] Nelson Branco of TV Guide Canada criticized the couple; he thought they had no chemistry and wanted Cane "in the big leagues and not with little girls", but conceded that they had "a very vocal, and loyal fanbase".[83] Soap Opera Update named Cane and Lily the best couple on The Young and the Restless in 2008,[62] and viewers voted them into top-couple polls in soap-opera magazines.[24][62][63][64][65][66]
