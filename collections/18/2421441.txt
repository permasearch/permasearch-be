Brooks' half-sister Betsy Smittle, who died in 2013, was a well-known musician - releasing her own album Rough Around the Edges as Betsy - and part of Brooks' band for some years; she also worked with the late country star Gus Hardin and other musicians in Tulsa. Smittle was also a lesbian, and Brooks has credited her with some of the inspiration for his support for same-sex marriage.[100][101]
