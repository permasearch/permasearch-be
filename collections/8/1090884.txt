In a more critical review Polygon's Philip Kollar noted that he felt the open-world environment felt empty. He further criticised the game's aggressive and expensive DLC plan. He stated that while the content is not forced on the player "it feels like the game is desperate to squeeze your wallet empty."[33] Kollar said that Forza Horizon "is at its best when it drops the sim pretence and embraces its arcade nature".[33]
