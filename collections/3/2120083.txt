The band's live sound is different to that in the studio. Writing for NME, Hazel Sheffield said that Days Are Gone "may confuse those won over by their raw, rocking live shows."[31] Recordings demonstrate the group's vocal pop style, while the group plays typical rock material such as Fleetwood Mac's "Oh Well" in concert.[14] The group's background in wedding bands from their days as Rockinhaim has led them to cover many different songs live and for radio sessions, including Miley Cyrus' "Wrecking Ball", Sheryl Crow's "Strong Enough" and the Strokes' "I'll Try Anything Once" (an early version of "You Only Live Once").[67][68] Este acts as the group's MC onstage, announcing most of the songs.[14] Many of her on stage antics, such as her blunt and coarse banter with the audience, frequent illeism and her amusing facial expressions (the "bass face") while playing are staples of the band's live shows and to a lesser extent, the band's public image.[9]
