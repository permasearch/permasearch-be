The Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway, was authorised from Charing Cross to Hampstead and Highgate in 1893, but had not found financial backing. Yerkes bought the rights in 1900, and obtained additional approval for a branch from Camden Town to Golders Green.[54] The Baker Street and Waterloo Railway had been authorised to run from Baker Street to Waterloo station.[55] Work began in 1898, and extensions to Paddington station and Elephant & Castle were authorised in 1900, but came to a halt when the collapse of their financial backers in 1901. Yerkes bought the rights to this railway in 1902.[54] The District had permission for a deep-level tube from Earl's Court to Mansion House and in 1898 had bought the Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway that had authority for a tube from South Kensington to Piccadilly Circus. The District's plans were combined by Yerkes with those of the Great Northern and Strand Railway, a tube railway with permission to build a line from Strand to Finsbury Park, to create the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway.[56] In April 1902, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) was established, with Yerkes as chairman, to control these companies and manage the planned works.[54]
