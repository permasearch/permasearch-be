Economics is ultimately a societal system which distinguishes means from ends. Modern economists, such as ecological economists, point out that our ultimate means are not labor or artifacts created through human production, but instead are ecological services provided by nature in the form of energy, low-entropy matter, chemical and biological composition as well as habitat stability.
