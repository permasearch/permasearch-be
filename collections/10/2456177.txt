Reality is altered such that the Justice League and Avengers are now longtime allies, regularly travelling between worlds to fight various threats. In addition, long-dead JLA members Barry Allen (Flash) and Green Lantern Hal Jordan have reappeared. But, the universes are incompatible with one another and begin destroying themselves and each other, with people switching between worlds. One side effect of this is that Superman and Captain America become irritable and short-tempered; their emotions flare to the point where they blame each other for everything that is happening (this is later explained as both heroes being too strongly synchronized to their native universes). The appearance of a spectral Krona helps the heroes remember some of the contest, and they find out what is happening to their worlds. The Phantom Stranger appears to lead the heroes to the Grandmaster.
