Michelle Kwan, two-time Olympic silver medalist and five-time World champion, stated "Under the scoring system, hands down, Adelina won." (However, Kwan added "I personally enjoyed Yuna Kim's performance more".)[21] Three-time world champion and two-time Olympic silver medalist Elvis Stojko responded "It was totally fair, Adelina was ready. Kim didn't have enough technical ammunition."[22] Tara Lipinski, the 1998 Olympic champion, together with Johnny Weir, the 2008 World bronze medalist, have also expressed their agreement with the judges' decision on Sotnikova's performance.[23] Scott Hamilton, the 1984 Olympic champion, said that while Sotnikova's skating is not as aesthetically pleasing as Kim's, her athletic style "checks off every box" and "does everything the judges are looking for."[24] Alexei Mishin, the Russian 1969 world medalist and coach to three Olympic champions, said that "â€¦ Sotnikova's victory is absolutely natural and objective."[25]
