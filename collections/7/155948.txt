The mandore was not a final form, and the design was tinkered with wherever it was built. The Italians, for instance, redesigned their "mandola" and produced the mandolino or Baroque mandolin, a small catgut-strung mandola, strung in 4, 5 or 6 courses tuned in fourths: e′–a′–d″–g″, b–e′–a′–d″–g″ or g–b–e′–a′–d″–g″, and played finger-style.[32]
