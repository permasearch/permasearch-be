In the earliest days of railways, single wagons were manhandled on timber rails, almost always in connection with mineral extraction, within a mine or quarry leading from it.[clarification needed] Guidance[clarification needed] was not at first provided except by human muscle power, but later a number of methods of guiding the wagons were employed. The spacing between the rails had to be compatible with that of the wagon wheels.[1]
