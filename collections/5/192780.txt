After 1907, eight states established deposit insurance funds.[10] Due to the lax regulation of banks and the widespread inability of banks to branch; small, local unit banks—often with poor financial health—grew in numbers, especially in the western and southern states.[11] In 1921, there were about 31,000 banks in the US.[12] The Federal Reserve Act initially included a provision for nationwide deposit insurance, but it was removed from the bill by the House of Representatives. From 1893 to the FDIC's creation in 1933, 150 bills were submitted in Congress proposing deposit insurance.[13]
