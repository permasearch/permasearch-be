England comprises most of the central and southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain, in addition to a number of small islands of which the largest is the Isle of Wight. England is bordered to the north by Scotland and to the west by Wales. It is closer to continental Europe than any other part of mainland Britain, divided from France only by a 33 km (21 mi) sea gap, the English Channel.[2] The 50 km (31 mi) Channel Tunnel,[3] near Folkestone, directly links England to mainland Europe. The English/French border is halfway along the tunnel.[4]
