In 2003, Danny returned to Genoa City to lend moral support to his sister. He helped her get her life back together after the devastating loss of her restaurant by arson. Of course, the first person he visited after his return was Christine, who was once again separated from Paul. Still, Christine still harbored some romantic feelings for him. Soon after, Danny ran into Phyllis. He refused to give her any information on Daniel, who was still in boarding school. It was revealed that while Phyllis spent years pining for the child who was taken from her, Daniel grew up in a Swiss boarding school. Danny seldom saw Daniel, and he never told him that he was not his real father. Whenever Phyllis inquired about Daniel to Gina, she was given the cold shoulder. She was not even allowed to see any pictures of her son.
