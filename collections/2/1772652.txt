South of Guatemala, there are numerous breaks of gauge, such as 1,067 mm (3 ft 6 in) (with Honduras), and El Salvador (which uses the same 914 mm gauge of rail, but is currently closed, with some sections abandoned and unusable). Nicaragua has also closed its rail network in 1996, though the majority of it was 1,067 mm (3 ft 6 in) gauge, with some 1,435 mm (4 ft 8 1⁄2 in) lines along the Atlantic Coast. Costa Rica's railroads are of 1,067 mm (3 ft 6 in) gauge, along with a private 600 mm (1 ft 11 5⁄8 in) gauge railroad at 3.5 km in length. The railroads of Panama are connected to Costa Rica.[citation needed] The country had two gauges: originally broad gauge 1,524 mm (5 ft), which was converted to standard gauge (1,435 mm (4 ft 8 1⁄2 in)) in 2000, and narrow gauge (914 mm). Like the situation with roads, the Darien Gap is a formidable obstacle to railroads, and no railways cross it into South America.
