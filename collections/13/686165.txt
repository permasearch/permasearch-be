In 1999, the HDB started building executive condominiums, also referred to as EC's. These are public housing units and estates aimed at Singaporeans who do not want a HDB flat but might find private property too expensive. The idea to construct such housing was first mooted in 1995 by then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong who wanted to provide public housing that was more up-market than the executive flats.[4]
