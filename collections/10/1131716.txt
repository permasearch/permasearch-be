Development of the NOTAR system dates back to 1975 when engineers at Hughes Helicopters began concept development work.[27] In December 1981, Hughes flew an OH-6A fitted with NOTAR for the first time.[28] A more heavily modified prototype demonstrator first flew in March 1986 and successfully completed an advanced flight-test program, validating the system for future application in helicopter design.[29] There are currently three production helicopters that incorporate the NOTAR design, all produced by MD Helicopters. This antitorque design also improves safety by eliminating the possibility of personnel walking into the tail rotor.
