In the 2000–01 season, the Capitals won a weak Southeast Division once more and earned the third seed in the conference, while the Penguins earned the sixth seed. In the first round, the Caps started the series with a 1–0 win over the Pens, but lost the next two games. Game 4 in Pittsburgh went to overtime and Jeff Halpern scored for Washington to tie the series at two before heading back to D.C. However, Pittsburgh would respond with a 2–1 win in Games 5 and 6 (with Game 6 being ended in overtime by Martin Straka) thus defeating the Capitals once again.[8] The Penguins would go onto the Conference Finals before being defeated in five games by the Devils.
