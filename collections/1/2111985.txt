In 1988 a Parent Teacher Association was established for the first time, and matriculants were encouraged to become paid up members of the Wynberg Old Girls' Union. In 1993, the library was completely refurbished, a mezzanine floor put in and the library administrative area extended. A new tuck shop between the hall and the art room was built.
