A defeated Susan tells her of Kendall's death and how Evie has taken over Neolution. Calling Evie to surrender, all of Neolution's backers support Evie's Maggot-Bots one of which will soon cure Evie's own Shingles. Evie will have all of Project Leda's assets transferred to her, the monitor program discontinued and leave the unaware clones alone to die of the sickness. However, Sarah and the other self-aware clones are still a threat and will be dealt with. Evie dismisses Rachel's offer to help, stating Neolution would have never given any real power to a clone, even Rachel. Rachel later tells Charlotte she is sick and will die and eventually so will Rachel. Rachel falls on her head and sees an image of a swan in her mechanical eye. It continues to haunt her and she also begins seeing an older bearded man, though Ira says her eye is fine. Her determination not to get sick and die makes her speech and walk stronger. She forms a truce with Ira and tells Susan to be honest with Charlotte.
