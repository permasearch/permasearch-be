George's son, the Duke of Cumberland, commanded the king's troops in northern Germany. In 1757, Hanover was invaded and George gave Cumberland full powers to conclude a separate peace.[105] By September, however, he was furious at Cumberland's negotiated settlement, which he felt greatly favoured the French.[106] George said his son had "ruined me and disgraced himself".[107] Cumberland, by his own choice, resigned his military offices,[108] and George revoked the peace deal on the grounds that the French had infringed it by disarming Hessian troops after the ceasefire.[109]
