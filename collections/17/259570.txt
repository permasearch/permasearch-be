Robin Franson Pruter from Forced Viewing rated the episode with 4/4. "Excellent episode features complex plot and emotionally powerful events. [...] This episode had the potential to be a huge failure. [...] The expectations for the return of Katherine, the vampire who turned the Salvatore brothers into vampires and turned them against each other, were high. So, in the face of all that build-up, the opening of the tomb to reveal that Katherine was never in there in the first place could have been a debacle on the level of Geraldo Rivera and Al Capone’s safe. But it wasn’t. The show managed to create the sense that the shock of her not being there outweighed the disappointment of that fact." Franson Pruter also praised Somerhalder for the way he portrayed a heart-wrenching Damon.[5]
