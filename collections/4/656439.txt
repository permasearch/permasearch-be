Interstate 95 first appeared on state maps between 1962-1964, with construction from US 17 north of Hardeeville to Ridgeland.  By 1967, more sections were under construction, including Pocotaligo to Walterboro and Santee to the North Carolina state line.  The first section to officially open happened in 1968, from SC 527, near Gable, to SC 9/SC 57, in Dillon.
