On September 1, 2010, T.I. and his wife Tiny were arrested for drug charges.[241] The arrest for drug charges led to T.I. being sentenced on October 15, 2010 to 11 months in prison for violating the terms of his probation, specifically for possessing ecstasy, testing positive for opiates and associating with a convicted felon, namely his P$C cohort C-Rod.[242] On October 25, the drug charges against T.I. were dropped.[243] On November 1, T.I. reported back to the Forrest City Federal Facility to serve his 11-month sentence.[244] His date of release was set to be September 29, 2011.[49] On August 31, 2011, T.I. was released from Forrest City Correctional Facility in Arkansas at 7:29Â a.m. and was sent to a community living facility to serve out the rest of his 11-month prison sentence. He then released a statement on Twitter saying: "The storm is over & da sun back out. IT'S OUR TIME TO SHINE SHAWTY!!!!! Welcome to the beginning of our Happy Ending!!!!"[245] He was sent back to federal custody on September 1, less than 48 hours after his release due to a dispute involving T.I. taking a luxury bus from a prison in Arkansas to a halfway house facility in Atlanta. T.I.'s attorney, Steve Sadow, told the Associated Press that the Federal Bureau of Prisons has moved T.I. to a different facility and clarified that the dispute was not drug related.[246] T.I. was later released from prison and was sent back to the halfway house, where he was released on September 29, at midnight.[247]
