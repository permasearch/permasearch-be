Headmasters is one of the most common glass manufacturers, at least for the schooner size. Many pubs in Sydney and Melbourne particularly, offer Guinness style and/or conical pint glasses along with tankard glass and British dimpled glass pint mugs. Larger serving measurements have become increasingly popular. Jugs, 1 fluid litre Ma√ü in German-themed bars and beer towers (although technically illegal due to strict self-service of alcohol laws are used in some Asian bars/karaoke parlours) have grown in popularity around Australia in tourist spots.
