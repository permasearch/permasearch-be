The essential feature of a constructive dismissal[63] is that the employee terminates the employment contract. His resignation is not entirely voluntary, however, as it is brought about or necessitated by the actions or omissions of the employer. These actions must be "intolerable."[63] The employee, in resigning, indicates that he would have carried on work indefinitely had not the intolerable situation been created.
