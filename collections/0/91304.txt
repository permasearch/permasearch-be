The term first appeared in 1858 in cricket, to describe H. H. Stephenson's taking three wickets with three consecutive deliveries. Fans held a collection for Stephenson, and presented him with a hat bought with the proceeds.[1] The term was used in print for the first time in 1865.[2] The term was eventually adopted by many other sports including hockey, association football, water polo and team handball.
