In 1893 the city of Chicago hosted the World Columbian Exposition, an early world's fair. So many people were coming to Chicago from all over the world that many smaller conferences, called Congresses and Parliaments, were scheduled to take advantage of this unprecedented gathering. A number of congresses were held in conjunction with the exposition. One of these was the World's Parliament of Religions, an initiative of the Swedenborgian layman (and judge) Charles C. Bonney.[96][97] The Parliament of Religions was by far the largest of the congresses held in conjunction with the Exposition.[98] John Henry Barrows, a Christian clergyman, was appointed as the first chairman of the General Committee of the 1893 Parliament by Charles Carroll Bonney.[99] Barrows was president of one of the colleges studying comparative religion less than a decade later at the University of Chicago,[100][101] and it gained an endowed lectureship based on the enthusiasm of the Parliament of Religions.[102][103] Outside the university, lecture series began in the midwest[104] and New England[105] at least. The 1893 Parliament marked the first organized gathering of representatives of Eastern and Western spiritual traditions. Today it is recognized as the occasion of the birth of formal interreligious dialogue worldwide[106] though it faced censure or lack of enthusiasm in some quarters and after a gap of some years various institutions began similar work,[107] notably the International Association for Religious Freedom (established in 1900), the World Congress of Faiths (established in 1936), and the World Council of Churches (incorporation voted in 1937, formally established in 1948).
