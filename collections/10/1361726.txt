Bold Nassan quits his caravan, A hazy mountain grot to scan; Climbs jaggy rocks to find his way, Doth tax his sight, but far doth stray.  Not work of man, nor sport of child Finds Nassan on this mazy wild; Lax grow his joints, limbs toil in vainâ€” Poor wight! why didst thou quit that plain?  Vainly for succour Nassan calls; Know, Zillah, that thy Nassan falls; But prowling wolf and fox may joy To quarry on thy Arab boy.
