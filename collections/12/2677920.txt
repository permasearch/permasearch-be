Inkjets use solvent-based inks which have much shorter expiration dates compared to laser toner, which has an indefinite shelf life.[citation needed] Inkjet printers tend to clog if not used regularly, whereas laser printers are much more tolerant of intermittent use.[citation needed] Inkjet printers require periodical head cleaning, which consumes a considerable amount of ink, and will drive printing costs higher especially if the printer is unused for long periods.
