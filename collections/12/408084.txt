The Somali community has become increasingly engaged in local politics.[218] Mohamed "Jimmy" Ali became the UK's first Somali councillor in 2004.[114] Councillor Ahmed Omer, who was the civic mayor of Tower Hamlets in 2009/10[219] (a largely ceremonial post made by appointment rather than through direct election[220]), was the first Somali to be appointed to the annual position in London and England.[221][222] Around 17 Somali candidates stood in the 2010 local elections. Of these, at least seven Somali councillors were elected,[218] including Gulaid Abdullah Ahmed,[223] Abdifatah Aden,[224] Awale Olad,[225] and Abdul Mohamed of the Labour Party,[226] as well as Asad Osman of the Liberal Democrats, a former chairman of the Somali Youth Development Resource Centre.[218][227] In the 2014 local elections, nine Somali councillors were also elected to office.[228] Among the officials was Hibaq Jama, a Labour Party Ward Councillor for Lawrence Hill, who is Bristol's first Somali woman councillor,[229] as well as Amina Ali, a Labour Party Ward Councillor for Tower Hamlets, who in February 2015 became the first Somali woman to be selected to contest a seat in the Parliament of the United Kingdom.[230] Ali was chosen from a shortlist of three women but resigned three days later, indicating that she did not want to disrupt her children's upbringing by moving residences.[231][232] For the 2015 elections, Somali community activists in Bristol set up a taskforce to encourage British Somalis to vote.[233] In 2018, former Somali refugee Magid Magid was appointed as Lord Mayor of Sheffield, a ceremonial position held by a member of the city council. Magid was elected as a Green Party councillor for Broomhill and Sharrow Vale in 2016.[234]
