Inside Out opened across 3,946 theaters in the United States and Canada, of which 3,100 showed the film in 3D.[62] It grossed $3.7 million during its Thursday night showings. This was a record among Pixar films that had Thursday night showings, but behind Toy Story 3's $4 million midnight showing.[63] The film then earned $34.3 million on its opening day, which is the third largest opening day for a Pixar film behind Toy Story 3 ($41.1 million) and Finding Dory ($54.7 million).[64][65][66] It ended its opening weekend in second place with $90.4 million, behind the second-weekend gross of dinosaur thriller Jurassic World ($106.6 million).[67] Although it was Pixar's first film not to debut at No. 1, its opening-weekend gross was still the biggest for a Pixar original film (breaking The Incredibles' record), the studio's third-biggest of all time (behind Finding Dory and Toy Story 3), the biggest weekend debut for a film that did not debut at No. 1 (breaking The Day After Tomorrow's record),[68] and the top opening for any original film, live-action or otherwise, not based on sourced material, eclipsing the $77 million debut of Avatar (overtaken by The Secret Life of Pets).[10][69][70] The film's successful opening has been attributed to its Cannes premiere, CinemaCon press screening, its critical reception (particularly the 98% Rotten Tomatoes score), good word-of-mouth, Father's Day weekend, and a successful Tuesday-night Fathom screening.[71][72] In its second weekend, the film fell by 42% to $52.3 million and still held the second spot behind Jurassic World;[73] the rest of the week saw it slightly ahead of the latter.[74] Inside Out reached the No. 1 spot at the box office in its third weekend with $29.8 million.[75] Overall, IMAX contributed 10% or $36 million (as of September 4, 2015) of its total North American revenue.[76]
