Sand dunes were much more widespread and active in many areas during the early Quaternary period. A good example is the Sand Hills region in Nebraska, USA, which covers an area of about 60,000 km2 (23,166 sq mi).[17] This region was a large, active dune field during the Pleistocene epoch, but today is largely stabilized by grass cover.[18][19]
