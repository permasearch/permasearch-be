Magnum XL-200's steel track is 5,106 feet (1,556 m) in length, and its main hill is approximately 205 feet (62 m) high.[1] Magnum XL-200 originally had a scarlet red track with silver supports. The track was repainted Molly orange in 2005, but the supports remained silver.[14] The track consists of a tubular steel spine connected by struts to tubular steel running rails.[20] When it opened, a steel out and back roller coaster without any loops was unheard of. Magnum is not a smooth-riding roller coaster, partly because its pieces were welded together, unassisted by computer design.[22][23] The track sections range from 2 feet (0.61 m) to 200 feet (61 m) and 157 support columns were used.[8]
