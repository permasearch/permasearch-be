Individuals with Down syndrome tend to be more susceptible to gingivitis as well as early, severe periodontal disease, necrotising ulcerative gingivitis, and early tooth loss, especially in the lower front teeth.[54][55] While plaque and poor oral hygiene are contributing factors, the severity of these periodontal diseases cannot be explained solely by external factors.[55] Research suggests that the severity is likely a result of a weakened immune system.[55][56] The weakened immune system also contributes to increased incidence of yeast infections in the mouth (from Candida albicans).[56]
