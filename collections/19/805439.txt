Several large retailers challenged the legal ruling in force before 1994 by opening on Sundays (or simply ignored them, since the fines were far lower than their Sunday profits),[35] and the outcome was that the Sunday Trading Act 1994 permitted "large shops" – those with a "relevant floor area" in excess of 280 m2 (3,000 sq ft)[36] – to open for up to six hours on Sunday between the hours of 10 am and 6 pm. Small shops, those with an area of below 280 m2, are free to set their own Sunday trading times.[37]
