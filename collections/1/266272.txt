He is a compulsive gambler who successfully avoids gambling for several years until "The Diplomat's Club", in which he bets with a wealthy Texan on the arrival and departure times of flights going into New York's LaGuardia Airport. In "The Susie", when Kramer's friend, Mike Moffit, becomes a bookie, he immediately places an outlandish bet on the Knicks "for Jerry", and, when the Knicks shockingly cover the 30+ point spread winning Jerry one thousand dollars, Kramer immediately and compulsively presses Jerry to make more bets. "The Pony Remark" and "The Subway" also show Kramer's compulsiveness as it relates to gambling on just about anything.
