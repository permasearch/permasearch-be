European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) is Europe's longest-running intergovernmental framework for cooperation in science and technology.[1] Founded in 1971, COST holds a successful history of funding science and technology networks for over 40 years, offering scientists the opportunity to embark upon bottom-up, multidisciplinary cooperation across all science and technology domains.
