As for the regular season, the CFL records 14 Argonauts teams at the top of the eastern divisional table since its formation in 1958.[70] Earlier data for the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union provides another 9 years from 1907 to 1957 in which the Argos were the best of the "Big Four," for a total of 23 divisional wins.[71][72] The only pre-1958 year in which the Argos won the IRFU but failed to make a Grey Cup appearance was 1922, when they lost in semi-final to Queen's University.[73]
