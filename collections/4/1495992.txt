In the United States, the red imported fire ant first arrived in the seaport of Mobile, Alabama, by cargo ship between 1933 and 1945.[b][c][78][104][105][106] Arriving with an estimated 9 to 20 unrelated queens,[107][108] the red imported fire ant was only rare at the time, as entomologists were unable to collect any specimens (with the earliest observations first made in 1942, preceded by a population expansion in 1937); the population of these ants exploded by the 1950s.[109][110][111] Since its introduction to the United States, the red imported fire ant has spread throughout the southern states and northeastern Mexico, negatively affecting wildlife and causing economic damage.[74][112][113][114] The expansion of red imported fire ants may be limited since they are almost wiped out during Tennessee winters, thus they may be reaching their northernmost range.[115][116][117] However, global warming may allow the red imported fire ant to expand its geographical range.[118] As of 2004, the ant is found in 13 states and occupies over 128 million hectares of land, and as many as 400 mounds can be found on a single acre of land.[119][120] The United States Department of Agriculture estimates that they expand 193 km (120 mi) per year.[90]
