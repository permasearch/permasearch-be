Before the start of the 2007 season, the club announced that the away jersey would be styled identically to the traditional home jersey, with the exception of sponsorship and the rabbit emblem, which has been styled similarly to the one that initially featured on jerseys in the 1960s.[50] For season 2009, the rabbit emblem is black for home matches whilst the emblem is the original white for away matches.[51]
