The original idea for the action figure that would become G.I. Joe was developed in 1963 by Stan Weston, a Manhattan licensing agent. Weston made rudimentary prototypes of the figure and basic marketing materials that showed the sales potential of a military action figure. When he showed these materials to Donald Levine, a Hasbro executive, Levine told Weston “You will make a fortune with these.”[11][12] Weston subsequently licensed the entire concept to Hasbro for $100000 USD.[13][14]
