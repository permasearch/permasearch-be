Little Free Libraries are starting to pop up in cities like Ann Arbor and Detroit, Michigan, and Cleveland, Ohio. These free libraries follow Carnegie's philosophy of offering to the lower class things that the upper class already has access to. Little Free Libraries is an organization that stocks books in boxes throughout inner-city areas for the youth to enjoy. For many reasons, these kids don't have access to regular libraries. Having instant access to books in their neighborhood is beneficial in helping them improve their literacy and progress with their education at the same pace as the children in the more affluent neighborhoods.
