ITAR remains a major concern in the European aerospace industry as of 2016. The European Space Agency and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency have supplied components that were launched on Chinese rockets.  European manufacturers of satellite components report that ITAR-free status is the first question they are asked by potential customers.  Even U.S. companies have expressed interest in ITAR-free technology.[121]  The Chinese space industry has been able to sell in the global market by bundling Chinese satellites with Chinese rockets, avoiding ITAR.[123]
