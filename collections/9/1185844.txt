Diabetes mellitus is classified into four broad categories: type 1, type 2, gestational diabetes, and "other specific types".[8] The "other specific types" are a collection of a few dozen individual causes.[8] Diabetes is a more variable disease than once thought and people may have combinations of forms.[32] The term "diabetes", without qualification, usually refers to diabetes mellitus.
