Working and living conditions for the average sailor in the Royal Navy in the 18th century were harsh by modern standards. Naval pay was attractive in the 1750s, but towards the end of the century its value had been eroded by rising prices.[1] Sailors' pay on merchant ships was somewhat higher during peacetime, and could increase to double naval pay during wartime.[Note 1]
