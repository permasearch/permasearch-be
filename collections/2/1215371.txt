This section includes an odd claim: "...holds much of the baroque style that is commonly found in preludes." Apart from the unidiomatic use of "hold", what is this trying to say? I think immediately of the preludes by Chopin or Scriabin, and see no evidence of "baroque style". Imaginatorium (talk) 08:51, 29 April 2016 (UTC)
