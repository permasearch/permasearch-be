The Caribbean Research Institute CARIRI investigated possibilities to mass-produce raw forms with the use of pressing machines in the 1970s. Much of this project took place in Sweden in collaboration with the Saab Company. Although first results were promising, the project has been abandoned due to lack of finances and support by local pan tuners in Trinidad.[citation needed]   Another method of shaping the pan was attempted: by spinning.  The pan was spun on a lathe-like device, and a roller on the end of a bar was used to sink the pan.  While this did create pre-sunk pans, a problem was that there would often be scratches and grooves in the steel.[citation needed]
