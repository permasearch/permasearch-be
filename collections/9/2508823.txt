The first movement, in 12 8 time, begins gently and reflectively, with languid double stops and a flowing violin melody line filled with tasteful embellishments.[9] The melody, which moves from the tonic to the mediant key in the middle of the movement includes several deceptive cadences, before returning once again to a tonic theme similar to the beginning.[10] A crisp, quick, highly decorated bravura follows, preceding a brief cantabile slow movement, said to signify Tartini's dream state.[3]
