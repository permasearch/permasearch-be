New Zealand whites descended from New Zealand Reds, which were likely developed in California and developed from a mix of breeds, possibly including Belgian hares and Flemish giants. New Zealand Reds were developed for their quick growth rate and meat type, and were added to the US rabbit standard in 1916. The white variety was created in 1917 by William S. Preshaw out of some white New Zealands born in a litter of reds. While the reds remained more popular for meat for some time, whites quickly caught on because of their white pelt, which could be easily dyed and was more valuable in the fur market.
