"Focusing on comedy and talk, The Bob & Tom Show is a mash-up of news, sports, conversation, and interviews"[7] which airs new broadcasts every weekday morning live from 6 to 10 A.M. in the Eastern Time Zone (5â€“9 A.M. Central) or tape-delayed on affiliated stations in other time zones.[8] There is an additional weekday segment which airs between 10:00 and 10:20 A.M. ET only on home station WFBQ. As of February 13, 2017, the post-show segment airs only on select dates rather than daily.
