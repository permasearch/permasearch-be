Additional filming for the first season took place in the Republic of Macedonia, standing in for Chechnya, and the Dominican Republic, masquerading as Haiti.[52][2][53] During the second season, production filmed for roughly 10 days in Budapest.[54][55] Filming in Prague took place for about three weeks for the third season.[56] The reason for moving to Europe was to benefit from the different flair and to use the older architecture for 1950s stand-ins.[55] Production returned to Prague for the fourth season.[57][58] Standing sets used in the series were changed constantly to reflect both older and newer versions of the locales and also alterations to the locations that resulted from the characters' trips through time.[55]
