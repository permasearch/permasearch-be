Richard Johnson of the New York Post called The Hateful Eight a "box-office disaster, and the police officers who boycotted the movie are taking credit".[68] However, Forbes rebutted this claim in an article titled "No, Police Boycotts Against Quentin Tarantino didn't cause Hateful Eight to Flop", writing that the film, while not as commercially successful as some of Tarantino's other films, was not a "box-office disaster" and cast doubt on claims that a boycott had a strong effect on sales.[71]
