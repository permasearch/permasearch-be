In (b), since Stephen did not report as a substitute, he legally enters the game in the place of the proper batter.  Stephen's name thus replaces Hooker in the order, and Hooker is out of the game.  Since Hooker was no longer in the game when he came to bat, he was an illegal substitute and not a batter out of turn.  The penalty for this infraction is not related to batting out of turn; it is an illegal substitution.
