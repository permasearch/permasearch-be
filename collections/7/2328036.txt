Lui (ルイ, Rui, sometimes romanized as Rui, voiced by Yoshino Takamori) is the twin sister of Lin and the Celestial Empress (天帝, Tentei). Only one of the children was permitted to live, but Falco could not bring himself to kill Lin and instead left her in the care of his aunt and uncle. Lui is kidnapped by Jacó and locked underground in the Imperial Palace as a means by Jacó to blackmail Falco, her protector. Bat, Lin and Ein sets off to the Imperial Castle to free Lui, while Kenshiro is fighting Falco. When Lin meets Lui for the first time, she learns the truth about her heritage. After Lui is freed, Falco turns against Jacó and kills him.
