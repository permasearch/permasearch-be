In 1997, Lee crossed the frozen Yalu River alone in collusion with a friendly border guard to fulfill a dream she had before going off to college, only planning to stay a short while before returning. However, due to complications with the North Korean security police, she had to live with relatives in China as an illegal immigrant. She managed to buy the identity of a mentally-challenged girl from Heilongjiang, and with it, obtained a passport and driver's license. At one point, after being accused of being North Korean, she was interrogated by police and tested on her Chinese and her knowledge of China. She passed the test.
