Examinations are taken at the end of every term as opposed to at the end of the year. Final years are often based on continuous assessments and assignments; however some courses do have final exams. There were no nationally co-ordinated exams in upper secondary education until school year 2003â€“4, when certain subjects were introduced. Institutions are also required to self-assess, like compulsory education institutions they are assessed externally every five years.[6]
