During the post-monsoon months of October to December, a different monsoon cycle, the northeast (or "retreating") monsoon, brings dry, cool, and dense air masses to large parts of India.It is called autumn. Winds spill across the Himalayas and flow to the southwest across the country, resulting in clear, sunny skies.[47] Though the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and other sources refers to this period as a fourth ("post-monsoon") season,[48][49][50] other sources designate only three seasons.[51] Depending on location, this period lasts from October to November, after the southwest monsoon has peaked. Less and less precipitation falls, and vegetation begins to dry out. In most parts of India, this period marks the transition from wet to dry seasonal conditions. Average daily maximum temperatures range between 28 and 34 °C (82 and 93 °F).
