In February 2012, Dassault Aviation and Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) formed a joint venture for joint opportunities in the defence sector and cooperation in the execution of the MMRCA deal. The partnership provides Dassault with a substantial opportunity to fulfill its offset responsibilities under the contract.[152][153] Dassault wanted RIL to be the main partner in production of the aircraft, but the Indian government refused to allow that as the tender for the procurement had already specified that Hindustan Aeronautics would be the lead integrator. The differences were resolved when Dassault agreed to the Indian government's condition.[154][155] Dassault will now help Reliance create a ₹1,500 crore (US$234 million) factory in Bangalore, similar to its production facilities in France, to produce the wings of aircraft.[156][157]
