Sansa Stark confronts Petyr Baelish about his decision to marry her to Ramsay Bolton. He explains that he was ignorant of Ramsay's cruelty and begs for forgiveness. In exchange, he offers her the support of the Vale in her attempt to retake Winterfell from the Boltons, but Sansa declines. As he leaves, Littlefinger reveals that her great-uncle, the Blackfish, has retaken Riverrun with the Tully army; Sansa orders Brienne of Tarth to go and recruit the Blackfish for their cause.
