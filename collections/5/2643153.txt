These are the earliest known references to running as the means of scoring. The change of terminology from "notch" to "run" was gradual and both terms were in use in 1800. The result of a match played in Sussex on 3 August 1800 was a win "by 25 notches"[6] while another match in Sussex on 9 August 1800 was won "by an innings and 38 runs".[7]
