Another application of the SVD is that it provides an explicit representation of the range and null space of a matrix M. The right-singular vectors corresponding to vanishing singular values of M span the null space of M and the left-singular vectors corresponding to the non-zero singular values of M span the range of M. E.g., in the above example the null space is spanned by the last two columns of V and the range is spanned by the first three columns of U.
