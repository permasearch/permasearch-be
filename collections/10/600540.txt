The spotted lanternfly was first recognized in the United States in Berks County, northwest of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On 22 September 2014, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture, and the Pennsylvania Game Commission, confirmed its presence. It is a threat to the state’s grape, fruit tree and logging industries. The greatest risk of spread comes from people transporting materials containing egg masses laid on smooth bark, stone, and other vertical surfaces.[4] On November 1, 2014 the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture banned transport of items that could harbor it, like firewood, lawn mowers, outdoor chairs, trucks and RVs from seven municipalities.[4] Given the presence of old egg masses the insect is estimated to have been in the area since at least 2012, having survived the 2013/14 winter's unusual cold.[8] A national working group led by the U.S. Department of Agriculture,consisting of university and USDA scientists, was organized “to determine what is known about the lanternfly and what research is needed, including DNA analysis to pinpoint where the infestation originated.[5]
