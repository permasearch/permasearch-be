Layering allows the parts of a protocol to be designed and tested without a combinatorial explosion of cases, keeping each design relatively simple. Layering also permits familiar protocols to be adapted to unusual circumstances. For example, the mail protocol above can be adapted to send messages to aircraft by changing the V.42 modem protocol to the INMARS LAPD data protocol used by the international marine radio satellites.
