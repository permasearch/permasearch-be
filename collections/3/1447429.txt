In 1982, John Landis wanted Jack Arnold to direct a remake of the film, and Nigel Kneale was commissioned to write the screenplay. Kneale completed the script, which involved a pair of creatures, one destructive and the other calm and sensitive, being persecuted by the United States Navy.[9] A decision to make the film in 3D led to the remake being canceled by producers at Universal, both for budgetary concerns and to avoid a clash with Jaws 3-D.[9] In 1992, John Carpenter was developing the remake at Universal.[10] He originally hired Bill Phillips to write the script while Rick Baker was hired to create the 3D model of the Creature, but the project never got green-lit. Herschel Weingrod and Timothy Harris wrote a new script,[11] and Universal offered Peter Jackson the director's position in 1995, but he chose to work on King Kong instead.[12] In February 1996, Ivan Reitman was planning to direct the remake, but the outing never materialized.[11] With the financial success of The Mummy remake in May 1999, development of the Creature from the Black Lagoon remake was revived.[13]
