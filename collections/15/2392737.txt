Music historian Ivan Raykoff described Carmichael as "one of America's most prolific songwriters" and an "iconic pianist" whose work appeared in more than a dozen Hollywood films, including his performances in classic films such as To Have and To Have Not and The Best Years of Our Lives. Among the hundreds of Carmichael's published songs, "Stardust" is one of the most-frequently recorded.[85] Carmichael's greatest strength was as a melodist,[24] but he also became known as an "experimental" and "innovative" songwriter, whose "catchy, often jazz-infused, melodies" and their "nostalgic, down-home lyrics"[50] were memorable and had wide public appeal, especially with mass media promotion and through the efforts of numerous entertainers who performed his songs.[86]
