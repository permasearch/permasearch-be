Public schools emerged from charity schools established to educate poor scholars, the term "public" being used to indicate that access to them was not restricted on the basis of religion, occupation, or home location, and that they were subject to public management or control,[2] in contrast to private schools which were run for the personal profit of the proprietors.[3]
