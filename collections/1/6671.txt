Failure of the cell to create a successful product that does not self-react leads to apoptosis. Autoimmunity is prevented by eliminating lymphocytes that self-react in the thymus by testing them against an array of self antigens expressed through the function of Aire. Interestingly, the immunoglobulin lambda light chain locus contains protein-coding genes that can be lost with its rearrangement.[4] This is based on a physiological mechanism and is not pathogenetic for leukemias or lymphomas.[4]
