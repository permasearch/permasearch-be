Curtis's original concept for the film included 14 different scenarios, but four of them were cut (two after having been filmed).[7] The scene in which Colin attempts to chat up the female caterer at the wedding appeared in drafts of the screenplay for Four Weddings and a Funeral, but was cut from the final version.[8] The music video for Billy Mack's song, "Love Is All Around", is a tribute to Robert Palmer's video, "Addicted To Love".[7]
