In 2010, the school opened its Stephen B. Swann Athletic and Wellness Center. The building houses Dining Commons, physical education facilities, and additional office space. The building, covering over 100,00 sq.ft., also includes a gymnasium, indoor track, conditioning and workout facilities, a dance studio, and sports medicine facilities. The building was later modified to expand locker rooms and add a team room and athletic offices. The new dining facilities can seat 480 students, and overlook the school's quarry and Louise Crespi Benners Courtyard. The kitchen also houses a laboratory for instruction from nutritional experts and professional chefs, based on guidelines from the Center for Human Nutrition at The University of Texas Southwest Medical Center.
