The church was built in 1819, and is considered the mother church of the Free Will Baptist movement. It was in this area that Benjamin Randall (1749-1808) rose to prominence. A native of New Castle, New Hampshire, Randall, an itinerant evangelical Baptist, was disfellowshipped by more conventional Baptists for his objections to certain Calvinist teachings. He gained a following in eastern New Hampshire and southern Maine. The first organizational meetings of the Free Will Baptists took place in New Durham in 1780; this church was built eleven years after Randall's death.[2]
