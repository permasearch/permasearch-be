Since 1876, various councils have administered local areas under legislation determined by the central government.[115][119] In 1989, the government reorganised local government into the current two-tier structure of regional councils and territorial authorities.[120] The 249 municipalities[120] that existed in 1975 have now been consolidated into 67 territorial authorities and 11 regional councils.[121] The regional councils' role is to regulate "the natural environment with particular emphasis on resource management",[120] while territorial authorities are responsible for sewage, water, local roads, building consents and other local matters.[122][123] Five of the territorial councils are unitary authorities and also act as regional councils.[123] The territorial authorities consist of 13 city councils, 53 district councils, and the Chatham Islands Council. While officially the Chatham Islands Council is not a unitary authority, it undertakes many functions of a regional council.[124]
