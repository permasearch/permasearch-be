Instead of the optimistic, rock-laced soul that had characterized the Family Stone's 1960s output, There's a Riot Goin' On was urban blues, filled with dark instrumentation, filtered drum machine tracks, and plaintive vocals representing the hopelessness Sly and many other people were feeling in the early 1970s.[39][40] The album is characterized by a significant amount of tape hiss â€“ the result of Sly's extensive re-recording and overdubbing during production.[41] Allegedly, most of the album's instrumentation is performed by Sly alone, who enlisted the Family Stone for some of the additional instrumental parts and friends such as Billy Preston, Ike Turner, and Bobby Womack for others.[42] "(You Caught Me) Smilin'" and "Runnin' Away" were also released as singles, and performed well on the charts.
