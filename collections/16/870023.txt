On August 6, 2010 a massive lahar cascaded down from Capricorn Glacier at a speed of 30 m (98 ft) per second.[57] Experts initially estimated that the volume of debris totaled 40,000,000 m3 (1.4×109 cu ft), which would make it the second largest landslide on record in Canadian history, behind the 1965 Hope Slide that removed 47,000,000 m3 (1.7×109 cu ft) of rock from Johnson Peak.[57][61] However, the Meager landslide was later estimated to be more than 48,500,000 m3 (1.71×109 cu ft), which would make it the largest of all time in Canada.[57]
