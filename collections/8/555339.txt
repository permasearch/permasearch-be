In the Bible, the name appears as Babel (Hebrew: בָּבֶל‎, Bavel, Tib. בָּבֶל, Bāvel; Classical Syriac: ܒܒܠ‎, Bāwēl), interpreted in the Hebrew Scriptures' Book of Genesis to mean "confusion",[14] from the verb bilbél (בלבל, "to confuse").[15] The modern English verb, to "babble", or to speak meaningless words, is popularly thought to derive from this name, but there is no direct connection.[16]
