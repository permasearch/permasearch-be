The Ford Ranger is a nameplate that has been used on three distinct model lines of cars sold by Ford. Originally, the name was used by the short-lived Edsel Ranger car, then it later referred to a version of the Ford F-Series pickup truck sold in North America between model year 1965 and 1981 that denoted a styling package. Ford repurposed the name "Ranger" in 1982 for the 1983 model year for a compact pickup truck sold in North America and, later, parts of South America.
