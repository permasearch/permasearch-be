The 1975 Cricket World Cup was the first World Cup. The final was between the Australian cricket team and the West Indies cricket team. The West Indies were sent in to bat by the Australian captain Ian Chappell and slumped to 3/50 leaving Rohan Kanhai and captain Clive Lloyd at the crease.[2] The pair combined for a partnership of 149 runs for the 4th wicket and brought the West Indies back into the match. Clive Lloyd top scored, with 102 runs coming off just 85 balls.[2] When Lloyd fell the West Indies were 4/199. A lower order batting collapse took the West Indies to 6/209 before the tailenders combined to achieve the total of 291.[2]
