The concept of self is important to the theory of impression management as the images people have of themselves shape and are shaped by social interactions[26] Our self-concept develops from social experience early in life.[27] Schlenker (1980) further suggests that children anticipate the effect that their behaviours will have on others and how others will evaluate them. They control the impressions they might form on others, and in doing so they control the outcomes they obtain from social interactions.
