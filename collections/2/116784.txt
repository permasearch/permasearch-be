Memorial Union is home to many arts venues, including several art galleries, a movie theater, the Wisconsin Union Theater, and a craftshop that provides courses and facilities for arts and crafts activities. Students and Madison community members alike congregate at the Memorial Union for the films and concerts each week. An advisory referendum to renovate and expand Memorial Union was approved by the student body in 2006, and the university is currently undergoing the expansion.[83]
