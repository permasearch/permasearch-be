The list of organisms that may struggle due to ocean acidification include coccolithophores and foraminifera (the base of the marine food chain in many areas), human food sources such as oysters and mussels,[63] and perhaps the most conspicuous, a structure built by organisms â€“ the coral reefs.[62] Most surface water will remain supersaturated with respect to CaCO3 (both calcite and aragonite) for some time on current emissions trajectories,[62] but the organisms that require carbonate will likely be replaced in many areas.[62] Coral reefs are under pressure from overfishing, nitrate pollution, and warming waters; ocean acidification will add additional stress on these important structures.[62]
