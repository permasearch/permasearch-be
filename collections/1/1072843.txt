A director of nursing (DON) is a registered nurse who supervises the care of all the patients at a health care facility.[1] The director of nursing has special training beyond the training of a staff nurse for the position that pertains to health care management, and in some places, a director of nursing must hold a special license in order to be employed in that capacity.
