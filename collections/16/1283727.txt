In East Africa, the British launched a counter-attack against the Italians from Kenya Colony in February 1941. Landings were subsequently conducted in British Somaliland and Italian Ethiopia, while an expedition from the Sudan moved on Addis Ababa. The Italian Viceroy, Duke Amedeo d'Aosta, was forced to surrender by 18 May which effectively ended the campaign, allowing the Empire of Ethiopia to be re-established under Haile Selassie.[69] A number of Italian garrisons continued to hold out, but the last of these, at Gondar, surrendered in November.[70] Small groups of Italian troops carried out the Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia until October 1943.[71]
