From 1922 to 1958, Grand Central Terminal was the home of the Grand Central Art Galleries, which were established by John Singer Sargent, Edmund Greacen, Walter Leighton Clark, and others.[78] The founders had sought a location in Manhattan that was central and easily accessible, and Alfred Holland Smith, president of New York Central, made the top of the terminal available. A 10-year lease[79] was signed, and the galleries, together with the railroad company, spent more than $100,000 to prepare the space.[80] The architect was William Adams Delano, best known for designing Yale Divinity School's Sterling Quadrangle.
