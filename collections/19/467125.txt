While the birth certificates and wills of Roman citizens had to be written in Latin until the 220s,[198] in the legal opinion of Ulpian (ca. 215), fideicommissa (bequests in trust[199]) were not limited to Latin or even Greek, but could also be created in "Punic, Gaulish or any other" language.[200] Originally, a testator's fideicommissum placed the heir under a moral rather than legal obligation,[201] and Ulpian asserted that "any kind of speech contains the obligation of its words, provided that each party understands the other's language himself or through accurate interpreters".[202] The jurist Gaius distinguished between verbal contracts that derived their validity from formulaic utterance in Latin, and obligations expressing a mutual understanding of the ius gentium regardless of whether the parties were Roman or not.[203]
