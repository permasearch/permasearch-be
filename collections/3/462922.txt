Genesis regularly played twelve-string guitars, particularly in the early stages of their career. Songs such as "Cinema Show" on Selling England by the Pound and "Ripples" on A Trick of the Tail used non-standard and unconventional tunings. The group's Mike Rutherford liked tuning the bottom pair of E strings down to D, which helped emphasise minor chords and produce a richer sound.[10] His main onstage instrument throughout the 1970s was a double neck combining twelve-string and bass.[11] Bandmate Tony Banks sometimes played twelve-string instead of keyboards, such as on the first section of "The Musical Box" on Nursery Cryme.[12]
