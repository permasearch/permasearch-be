I have lived in Australia since 1953 and while it's just my personal opinion trick-or-treating has never been "customary" here - especially in the period of 1950s to the 1990s as alluded to in the article. However commercial interests have managed to make it somewhat more prevalent in the last decade 2000-2010. I would like to see some proof that "trick-or-treating has been a customary Halloween tradition since at least the late 1950s" in Australia. â€”Preceding unsigned comment added by 124.191.115.181 (talk) 20:51, 29 October 2010 (UTC)
