Banister played baseball at La Marque High School in La Marque, Texas. He developed bone cancer in his sophomore year, which almost necessitated the amputation of his leg. While playing college baseball for Lee College, he suffered a home plate collision that broke three vertebrae in his neck, leaving him paralyzed for ten days. After rehabilitating, he was named a Junior College All-American the next season, and received a scholarship to the University of Houston, to play for the Houston Cougars baseball team. He was then drafted by the Pirates in 1986. After playing in Minor League Baseball, he appeared in a major league game on July 23, 1991, recording a hit in his only plate appearance. He did not appear in another major league game, and ended his playing career after the 1993 season.
