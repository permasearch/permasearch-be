While the United States Army Aviation Branch operates a few fixed-wing aircraft, it mainly operates several types of rotary-wing aircraft. These include the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter,[118] the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior armed reconnaissance/light attack helicopter,[119] the UH-60 Black Hawk utility tactical transport helicopter[120] and the CH-47 Chinook heavy-lift transport helicopter.[121] Restructuring plans call for reduction of 750 aircraft and from 7 to 4 types.[122]
