Simon cutting off Malchus' ear is related in all four canonical gospels, in Matthew 26:51, Mark 14:47, Luke 22:50-51, and John 18:10â€“11, but Simon and Malchus are named only in the Gospel of John. Also, Luke is the only gospel that says Jesus healed the servant. This was Jesus' last recorded miracle prior to His resurrection.
