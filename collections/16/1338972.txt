Host Jeff Probst visited the Ta Keo camp to inform Terry that his son Danny had been hospitalized, and Terry was subsequently pulled from the game to be with his family. The next morning, the tribes were shuffled again: the new Bayon tribe was composed of Jeremy, Joe, Keith, Kelley Wentworth, Kimmi, Stephen, and Tasha, while Abi-Maria, Andrew, Ciera, Kass, Kelly Wiglesworth, Spencer, and Woo formed the new Ta Keo tribe. Kass and Spencer, nemeses from their original season, were reunited, and Wentworth found herself the sole original Ta Keo tribemate with six original Bayon members.
