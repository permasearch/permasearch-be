The mountain is a popular destination, attracting an estimated 100,000 ascents a year,[2] around three-quarters of which use the Pony Track from Glen Nevis.[3] The 700-metre (2,300Â ft) cliffs of the north face are among the highest in Scotland, providing classic scrambles and rock climbs of all difficulties for climbers and mountaineers. They are also the principal locations in Scotland for ice climbing.
