The corps constructed a permanent auxiliary pump station.[citation needed] During a hurricane event, the gate will be closed and its pump station will operate in tandem with local pump station 6 to act as a barrier to storm surge and lake flooding. In January 2006 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced it had finished the temporary repairs of the breached section of the levee, and construction of more permanent repairs would commence. As a temporary measure, the corps constructed storm surge barrier gates and an interim pump station at the lake end of the canal. In February, 2007, a contract was awarded to WESTON Solutions to increase the pumping capacity of the 17th Street Canal.[5]
