On November 19, 1989, the initial concrete pour was completed signaling the beginning of actual construction.[11] The mat foundation consists of a thick slab containing 3,500 cubic yards (2,700 m3) of concrete and 150 tons of reinforcing steel at the center of the tower. The foundation reaches 38 feet (12 m) below Tryon Street at its deepest point with the tower being supported by 36 concrete and steel piers. These piers are able to withstand the 150,000 pounds of pressure per square foot placed upon them by the 300 million pound structure.[11]
