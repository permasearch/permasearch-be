In the United States, the Fair Housing Act of 1968 was passed to fight the practice. According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development "The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale of a dwelling because of race or national origin. The Act also makes it unlawful for any person or other entity whose business includes residential real estate-related transactions to discriminate against any person in making available such a transaction, or in the terms or conditions of such a transaction, because of race or national origin."[32]  The Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity was tasked with administering and enforcing this law.  Anyone who suspects that their neighborhood has been redlined is able to file a housing discrimination complaint.
