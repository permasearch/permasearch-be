Hi, I am the author of The Last of a Breed, the only book about the entire flying/aviation cadet program in what eventually became the usaf. Our web site is now: www.aviationcadet.org/home.aspx we would greatly appreciate your changing the one you have. Another interesting fact: You show Bruce Ashcroft "We wanted wings..." in the credits. The exact truth of the matter is this: Bruce was sent to our home by the history office at Randolph. This is where we had a great many records of the flying/aviation cadet program, memorabilia etc. We have since formed the aviation cadet museum, Inc. here in Eureka Springs, AR where all of this now resides. He was actually doing research for his doctorate, which we did not know about. He lived with us for about a week using our information to write his aforementioned book. Most of his information came from my book and our records. He didn't give me or us but little credit for the huge amount of his information. I just wanted the record straight as my wife and I are the only ones who know of all this. Bruce died of a heart attack very shortly after his book came out.
