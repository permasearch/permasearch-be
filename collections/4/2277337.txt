Wales enjoyed a second "golden age" in the 1970s,[40][41][42] with world-class players such as Gareth Edwards,[42] J. P. R. Williams, Gerald Davies,[42] Barry John,[40] and Mervyn Davies,[43] in their side. Wales dominated Northern Hemisphere rugby between 1969 and 1979, and attained an incredible winning record, losing only seven times during that period.[40] Wales toured New Zealand for the first time in 1969, but were defeated in both Tests. As well as losing the first Test 19–0, and the second 33–12,[44] they also conceded 24 points to the All Blacks' fullback Fergie McCormick in the second Test; a record at the time.[45]
