Following the release of the first trailer for Discovery in May 2017, fans expressed outrage at the decision to have a black woman helm the series, in addition to the depiction of an Asian, female captain. Referred to as "white genocide in space",[24] the decision to create a diverse cast sparked debate online on the question of what had been referred to as 'forced diversity'. Media outlets, including The Chicago Tribune and The New Yorker referred to the impact of Uhura[25] and the kiss between the character of Uhura and of Captain Kirk as being the first interracial kiss on American television, and its subsequent societal impact that Trek fans would be aware of, making the criticisms baffling.[26]
