This desert lake has an unusually productive ecosystem based on brine shrimp that thrive in its waters, and provides critical nesting habitat for two million annual migratory birds that feed on the shrimp and blackflies (that also feed on the shrimp).[2][3] Historically, the native Kutzadika'a people derived nutrition from the Ehpydra hians pupae, which live in the shallow waters around the edge of the lake having been hatched from the eggs of adult alkali flies.
