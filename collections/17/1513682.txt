After Selena finished recording her cover of the 1961 West Side Story soundtrack song "A Boy Like That" for RCA Victor on 3 March 1995, she began recording for "Dreaming of You" on 5 March at Quintanilla, Jr.'s recording label Q-Productions in Corpus Christi, Texas.[12] During the recording session, Selena was battling bronchitis. Her father asked her to "just try" and sing the song because several producers had arrived from Los Angeles to watch her record the track. After the recording session wrapped, the producers liked the singer's vocal range in the song and decided to use her first take.[12] American producer Guy Roche produced and arranged the piece along with "Captive Heart".[12] After the arrangement to "Dreaming of You", she wanted her husband Chris Pérez to hear the finish product. He was unable to attend after Quintanilla, Jr. wanted him to work with a band he was interested in managing.[12] In 2012, Pérez wrote in his book about his and Selena's relationship together, that he regrets not showing up to the recording session for the song.[14] On 31 March 1995 Selena was murdered in Corpus Christi, by her friend and former employee Yolanda Saldívar.[15] Golde provided the backing vocals on the song after Selena's death.[13] "Dreaming of You" was released as the lead single for the 1995 album Dreaming of You on 14 August 1995, while the album's remix version and radio edit of "Techno Cumbia" was released as the b-side track.[16]
