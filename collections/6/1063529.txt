Slave to the Grind was a departure for the band; while Skid Row was an album that followed the typical 80's band formula, Slave to the Grind had a heavier sound, even verging on speed metal with the title track. Skid Row took out Pantera as an opening act on much of the tour supporting Slave to the Grind. Skid Row originally asked upcoming grunge band Nirvana to open for them but they declined, saying that Skid Row was "too homophobic", relating to the Sebastian Bach T-shirt incident.[6] Coincidentally, Nirvana's original band name was also Skid Row.
