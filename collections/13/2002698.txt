In 2003 the Tasmanian town of Coles Bay was the first location in Australia to ban plastic bags.[2] Although in 2008 the then-Environment Minister Peter Garrett announced the Rudd Government's goal of a nationwide plastic bag ban by year's end, he later abandoned the initiative due to cost of living concerns and disagreement about the policy among state and territory governments.[3][4] This led to states and territories pursuing their own approaches.[5]
