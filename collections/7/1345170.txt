When computer terminals with video screens became available, screen-based text editors (sometimes called just "screen editors") became common. One of the earliest full-screen editors was O26, which was written for the operator console of the CDC 6000 series computers in 1967. Another early full-screen editor was vi. Written in the 1970s, it is still a standard editor[5] on Unix and Linux operating systems. Also written in the 1970s was the UCSD Pascal Screen Oriented Editor, which was optimized both for indented source code as well as general text.[6] Emacs, one of the first open source and free software projects, is another early full-screen or real-time editor, one that was ported to many systems.[7] A full-screen editor's ease-of-use and speed (compared to the line-based editors) motivated many early purchases of video terminals.[8]
