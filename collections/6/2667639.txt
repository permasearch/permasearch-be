The novel is structured in three segments, each segment describing the ever-growing isolation of the protagonist from society. In the first part of the novel, a group of unidentified narrators from Sevierville describe Lester to the audience and frame him within that communityâ€™s mythology and historical consciousness. The second and third parts of the novel increasingly leave culture and community behind as Lester goes from squatter to cave-dweller to serial killer and necrophile as he becomes increasingly associated with pre-modern and inanimate phenomena.[1] The novel ends with the dehumanized and mutilated Ballard dying in incarceration, his remains eventually dissected by medical students and put on public display, while the long-hidden corpses of his victims are unearthed from his former subterranean haunt.
