One Bayfront Plaza[9] was for many years the tallest building ever to be approved for construction in the city, at the maximum FAA height limit of 1,049 feet (320 m), though several other buildings were approved at similar heights in the mid-2010s. It was later reduced and is expected to rise 1,010 feet (308 m), with 80 floors.[10] It also has the distinction of being the first skyscraper over 1,000 feet (305 m), known as a "supertall", to be approved in Miami. Several other buildings have been proposed to rise over 1,000 feet (305 m), including One Brickell City Centre, but have been reduced by the FAA. Approvals for comparably tall buildings in Miami are very rare due to the proximity of Miami International Airport (MIA). The main runways of MIA align planes taking off and landing directly over the greater downtown area, and for this reason the Federal Aviation Administration sets precise height limits for construction in Downtown Miami. The fate of high rise construction in Miami was greatly threatened by a "One Engine Inoperative" (OEI) policy proposed by the FAA in 2014. This proposal would drastically reduce the maximum permitted height of structures around 388 airports in the country, even causing existing structures to be modified.[11] In the end, the FAA did not go forward with the extreme limitations and even began giving quicker approvals to buildings with heights up to 1,049 feet (320 m) above sea level, leading to many proposed and approved supertall projects.[8]
