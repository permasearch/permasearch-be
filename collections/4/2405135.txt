The rebellion originated in an attempt of the republicans to reverse the establishment in 1830 of the July Monarchy of Louis-Philippe, shortly after the death of the king's powerful supporter, President of the Council Casimir Pierre PÃ©rier, on 16 May 1832. The death of Jean Maximilien Lamarque was a spark shortly before the revolutionaries rose to their barricades. The rebellion was the last outbreak of violence linked with the July Revolution of 1830.
