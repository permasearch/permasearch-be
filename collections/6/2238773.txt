There is a significant difference in the amount of TOTs experienced by monolinguals and bilinguals.[24] Bilinguals seem to report the same amount of TOTs as monolinguals for proper names but significantly more TOTs for other words.[24] Specifically, when adjusted for the degree of use of the dominant and less-dominant language, bilinguals have more TOTs with the less-dominant language.[24][25] In a task of picture-naming, bilingual speakers were slower than monolinguals, even when they could use their first and dominant language. This could possibly be the result of bilinguals using the words less often than monolingual speakers.[26] Bilinguals also represent virtually twice as many words and additional cognitive mechanisms for activation and inactivation of languages. Such mechanisms introduce added processing burden that monolinguals do not face. In addition, even when a task seems monolingual, bilingual system is never functionally "off." [24]
