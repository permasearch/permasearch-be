In 1936 the Ink Spots became the first blacks to appear on television; then in 1948 they continued to be television pioneers by becoming the first blacks to appear on Ed Sullivan's successful TV show. The Ink Spots made guest appearances on Milton Berle's "Texaco Star Theater" show on three separate occasions in 1949, on "The Ed Sullivan Show" three times (1948, 1950 and 1952), on Steve Allen's "Songs For Sale" twice in 1952, and on "Star Of The Family" once in 1952.
