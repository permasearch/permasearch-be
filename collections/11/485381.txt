PCI involves small probes, inserted through peripheral blood vessels such as the femoral artery or radial artery into the blood vessels of the heart. The probes are then used to identify and clear blockages using small balloons, which are dragged through the blocked segment, dragging away the clot, or the insertion of stents.[24][58] Coronary artery bypass grafting is only considered when the affected area of heart muscle large, and PCI is unsuitable, for example with difficult cardiac anatomy.[85] After PCI, people are generally placed on aspirin indefinitely and on dual antiplatelet therapy (generally aspirin and clopidogrel) for at least a year.[18][58][86]
