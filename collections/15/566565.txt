Whenever Richman would get upset, she would put her hand on her chest and say "I'm all verklempt" or "I'm a little verklempt." Then she would say, "Talk amongst yourselves," sometimes waving her hand in a dismissive gesture toward the audience. She would often follow this with an example by saying, "I'll give you a topic," which would typically have the structure of a bahuvrihi: "[two- or three-part phrase] is neither [first part], nor [second part] (nor [third part]). Discuss." Richman would then recover after a beat.
