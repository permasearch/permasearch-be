The term axonometric projection (not to be confused with the related principle of axonometry, as described in Pohlke's theorem) is used to describe the type of orthographic projection where the plane or axis of the object depicted is not parallel to the projection plane, and where multiple sides of an object are visible in the same image.[2] It is further subdivided into three groups: isometric, dimetric and trimetric projection, depending on the exact angle at which the view deviates from the orthogonal.[1][3] A typical characteristic of axonometric projection (and other pictorials) is that one axis of space is usually displayed as vertical.
