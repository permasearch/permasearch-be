Meanwhile, there were also two different morning-show predecessors on WABC-TV in New York City. The first was A.M. New York which debuted on May 18, 1970 as a local answer to NBC's Today show,[14] and was originally hosted by John Bartholomew Tucker. After he left in 1972, a succession of hosts came and went, until Stanley Siegel took over in late 1975. Under Siegel's stint, the show went from last to first in the ratings for a brief period, and from 1977 until his departure in 1978 it was known as The Stanley Siegel Show.[15] Following Siegel's departure for rival WCBS-TV, the show reverted to the A.M. New York name until its cancellation in 1980, by which point it had been hosted by Janet Langhart and Clay Cole. A few weeks later, WABC tried again with Good Morning New York, hosted originally by Spencer Christian and Andrea Kirby; Kirby would eventually be replaced by Judy Licht, and Christian was followed by the likes of Dick Wolfsie and longtime Eyewitness News reporter and anchor Doug Johnson. Like its predecessor for much of its run, Good Morning New York failed to make a dent in the ratings against Donahue on WNBC, and was cancelled in early 1983, with The Morning Show as its replacement.[16]
