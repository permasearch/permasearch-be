Redemption 2 features both hunting and fishing, which provide food, income and materials for crafting items.[citation needed] When hunting an animal, players will need to move slowly and carefully and watch the wind direction to avoid alerting their prey. Choice of weapon and shot placement are also important and will affect the quality of the meat and pelt, which in turn affects the price that traders will pay for them.[citation needed] If prey are injured, they will try to escape.
