During the three years that Clive remained in Great Britain, he sought a political position, chiefly that he might influence the course of events in India, which he had left full of promise. He had been well received at court, had been made Baron Clive of Plassey, County Clare, had bought estates, and had a few friends as well as himself returned to the House of Commons. Clive was MP for Shrewsbury from 1761 until his death. He was allowed to sit in the Commons because his peerage was Irish.[35] He was also elected Mayor of Shrewsbury for 1762â€“63.[43] The non-graduate Clive received an honorary degree as DCL from Oxford University in 1760, and in 1764 he was named a Knight of the Bath.[44]
