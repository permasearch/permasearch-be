At the new Saanapu, the alliance of Matt, Flick and Brooke regrouped and made the plan to keep Sam, Kylie and Nick close so that they could first remove Jennah-Louise and then from there establish control of the tribe. Brooke, however, still had her doubts about Matt. Jennah-Louise was very unhappy about her new tribe and had trouble adjusting to her position of power in Vavau to her new place at Saanapu, and guessed correctly that she was brought over because she was an easy vote-out. Jennah-Louise and Nick had an argument in which Nick made it clear that he hadn't forgiven her for voting him out and that she had to live with the consequences of what she'd done. Jennah-Louise tried to explain her reasoning for voting Nick out to him and made her anger about being brought to Saanapu just for revenge and as an easy vote-off clear, but Nick repudiated staying it was the tribe's decision to have her and she has to be accountable of her actions. Neither Nick or Jennah-Louise were happy with the conversation and Nick swore to make sure that Jennah-Louise would not find a foothold within the tribe to save herself.
