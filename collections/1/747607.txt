Closure of the umbilical artery by vasoconstriction consists of multiple constrictions which increase in number and degree with time. There are segments of dilatations with trapped uncoagulated blood between the constrictions before complete occlusion.[8] Both the partial constrictions and the ultimate closure are mainly produced by muscle cells of the outer circular layer.[3] In contrast, the inner layer seems to serve mainly as a plastic tissue which can easily be shifted in an axial direction and then folded into the narrowing lumen to complete the closure.[3] The vasoconstrictive occlusion appears to be mainly mediated by serotonin[9][10] and thromboxane A2.[9] The artery in cords of preterm infants contracts more to angiotensin II and arachidonic acid and is more sensitive to oxytocin than in term ones.[10] In contrast to the contribution of Wharton's jelly, cooling causes only temporary vasoconstriction.[10]
