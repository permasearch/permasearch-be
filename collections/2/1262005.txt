This line went directly in conflict with both proponents of korenizatsiya and some of the local governments, most notably in Ukraine (opposition of Christian Rakovsky) and Georgia (Georgian Affair). Thus the treaty can be viewed as a compromise between the different groups within the Bolshevik camp, to satisfy the aspirations of large minorities (the named examples of Georgia and Ukraine) and to allow for potential expansion, as well. Byelorussia was the smallest republic, yet its official languages included Polish and Yiddish in addition to Russian and Belarusian to undermine the authority of the neighbouring Second Polish Republic and to use its sizeable Jewish minority, as well as the Belarusians and Ukrainians in Poland as a future fifth column. At the same time, it created a new centralized federal government where key functions would clearly be in the hands of Moscow.
