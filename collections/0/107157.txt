Indoor toilets were at first a luxury of the rich and only gradually spread to the lower classes. As late as the 1890s, building regulations in London did not require working-class housing to have indoor toilets; into the early 20th century, some English homes were built with an upstairs toilet for use by the owners and an outhouse for use by the servants.[19] In some cases, there was a transitional stage where toilets were built into the house but accessible only from the outside.[20] After World War I, all new housing in London and its suburbs had indoor toilets.[21]
