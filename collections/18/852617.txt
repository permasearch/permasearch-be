Carrier oil, also known as base oil or vegetable oil, is used to dilute essential oils and absolutes before they are applied to the skin in massage and aromatherapy.  They are so named because they carry the essential oil onto the skin. Diluting essential oils is a critical safety practice when using essential oils. Oils alone are volatile because they begin to dissipate as soon as they are applied. The rate of dispersion will vary based on how light or heavy the carrier oil is. [1] Carrier oils do not contain a concentrated aroma, unlike essential oils, though some, such as olive, have a mild distinctive smell. Neither do they evaporate like essential oils, which are more volatile. The carrier oils used should be as natural and unadulterated as possible.  Many people feel organic oils are of higher quality.  Cold-pressing and maceration are the two main methods of producing carrier oils.
