Until 2017, the criteria and conditions under which the "V" device could be awarded differed between the services. For the Army, the "V" was worn solely to denote "participation in acts of heroism involving conflict with an armed enemy".[5] For the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, the "V" could be worn to denote combat heroism, or to recognize individuals who were "exposed to personal hazard during direct participation in combat operations".[13][8] For the Air Force, the "V" could be worn on the Bronze Star Medal to denote heroism in combat, but also on the Commendation Medal and Achievement Medal to denote heroism or for being "placed in harms' way" during contingency deployment operations. Prior to 1 January 2014, the device was also authorized on Outstanding Unit Awards and Organizational Excellence Awards to indicate the unit participated in direct combat support actions.[6] The "V" device is also authorized for the Air Medal by all the services where heroism in aerial combat was involved on an individual mission. On 15 August 2016, the Coast Guard changed their criteria such that new awards of the "V" would be for valor only, to denote a heroic act or acts while participating in conflict or combat with an armed enemy.[7] On 6 January 2016, the Department of Defense announced that it was revising its military decorations and awards program to include a "V" device change to its original 1940's use of denoting heroism in combat only on specific decorations for the military services.[2][14] Two new "C" and "R" devices will also be used on relevant awards.[2][14] On 2 February 2017, a new silver plated and gold plated "V" device was introduced,[4] with the various colors of the "V" devices now indicating how many times a specific medal was awarded with the "V".[4] Sometime after 2 February 2017, the individual services will change their regulations such that the silver and gold "V" device will be used to denote second and third awards with the "V".[14] A fourth, fifth, and sixth awarding with the "V" is to be issued with a bronze, silver, and gold "V" device atop a wreath.[14]
