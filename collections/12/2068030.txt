José Berríos relieved Santana (who had thrown 64 pitches in the first two innings) to start the bottom of the third, and the Yankees quickly pounced on the right-hander. Gary Sánchez doubled to lead off the inning and later scored on an RBI single by Greg Bird to give the Yankees the lead.. In the bottom of the fourth, rookie sensation Aaron Judge hit a two-run home run to extend the Yankee lead to 7–4.[15] Tommy Kahnle relieved Robertson, who had thrown a career-high ​3 1⁄3 innings, all scoreless, in the top of the seventh and threw two shutout innings of his own.[13] In the bottom of the seventh, a two-out bases-loaded walk to Aaron Hicks further extended the Yankees' lead to 8–4.[13] Closer Aroldis Chapman pitched the ninth inning in a non-save situation for the Yankees to end the game and advance the Yankees to the ALDS.[16]
