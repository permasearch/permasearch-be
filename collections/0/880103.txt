Mechanicles (pronounced "Meh-KANN-ih-kleez", sometimes misspelled "Mechanikles") is a mad scientist who seems to be of an ancient Greek culture (always styling himself as "greatest of the great Greek geniuses"), he is known for being able to make complex technological robots resembling insects (particularly beetles), and other arthropods such as scorpions, in a range of sizes from minuscule to gigantic, almost always with what appears to be a consistent usage of copper alloys such as bronze (especially for their outer casings), which he uses for his various plots. He is the third main antagonist in the animated series. His right eye is aided by a form of "telescopic monocle" which could assist him in building the intricate details of his machines. His voice is provided by Charlie Adler. When he first appeared in "Getting the Bugs Out", he was attacking a distant village with large robotic beetles, even managing to capture the Genie and the Magic Carpet —forcing Aladdin to face the fact that he had become too dependent on them and had begun to take them for granted — before the group found him and destroyed his largest, greatest robot.
