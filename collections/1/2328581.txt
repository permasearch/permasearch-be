the columns (fixed k) are indeed weakly increasing with n and bounded (by 1/k!), while the rows only have finitely many nonzero terms, so condition 2 is satisfied; the theorem now says that you can compute the limit of the row sums     ( 1 + 1  /  n  )  n     {\displaystyle (1+1/n)^{n}}   by taking the sum of the column limits, namelyÂ       1  k !      {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{k!}}}  .
