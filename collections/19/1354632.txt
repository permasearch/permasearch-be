Center of rotation: The horizontal center of rotation is calculated as the distance between the acetabular teardrop and the center of the head (or caput) of the prosthesis and/or the native femoral head on the contralateral side.[19] The vertical center of rotation instead uses the transischial line for reference.[19] The parameter should be equal on both sides.[19]
