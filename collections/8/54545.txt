In 1942, a group of publishing executives created the Council on Books in Wartime. The Council's purpose was to distribute paperback books to soldiers fighting in the Second World War. The Great Gatsby was one of these books. The books proved to be "as popular as pin-up girls" among the soldiers, according to the Saturday Evening Post's contemporary report.[81] 155,000 copies of Gatsby were distributed to soldiers overseas,[82] and it is believed that this publicity ultimately boosted the novel's popularity and sales.[83]
