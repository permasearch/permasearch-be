In addition to being offered better, more diverse roles, Bogart started his own production company in 1948, Santana Productions, named after his sailing yacht (which also lent her name to the cabin cruiser featured in the climax of that year's smash, Key Largo).[110] Earning the right to create his own production company had left Warner Bros. head Jack Warner furious, and afraid other stars would do the same and further erode the major studios' power. In addition to the pressure they were bearing from freelancing actors like Bogart, James Stewart, Henry Fonda and others, they were beginning to buckle from the eroding impact of television and enforcement of anti-trust laws breaking up theater chains.[111] Bogart performed in his final films for Warners, Chain Lightning, released early in 1950, and The Enforcer, early in 1951.
