It is advisable that transfer data be performed via EXI rather than flat files because defining the compression method is not required, because libraries reading the file contents are readily available, and because there is no need for the two communicating systems to first establish a protocol describing data properties such as position, alignment, type, and format.  However, in those circumstances where the sheer mass of data and/or the inadequacy of legacy systems becomes a problem, the only viable solution remains the use of flat files.   In order to successfully handle those problems connected with data communication, format, validation, control and much else (be it a flat file or an XML file data source), it is advisable to adopt a data quality firewall.
