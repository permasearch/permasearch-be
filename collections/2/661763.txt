Thompson's welfare reform policies were criticized.[18] Wendell Primus of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities wrote that "Many families have actually lost ground even though they are no longer on welfare." Many of Wisconsin's poor remained well below the federal poverty line. In addition, slightly more of the state's poorest children reportedly lacked health insurance than before Thompson's welfare overhaul.[18]
