Kristen is a character in the comic Jason X Special by Avatar Press. A bio-engineer living in a laboratory on the dead Earth Prime, Kristen, wanting to study and replicate Jason Voorhees's regenerative abilities to help her dying lover Neil, hacks into and takes control of the holo-deck of The Grendel, the ship Jason is on, and manipulates the crew of it into setting course for her planet. After The Grendel explodes, seemingly killing the crew who had thought they were heading to Earth II, Kristen and her android assistant Michelle capture Jason and extract some of his tissue. Before Kristen can inject Neil with Jason's tissue, Jason breaks free from his restraints and, destroying Michelle, goes after Kristen. Fleeing from Jason, Kristen manages to reach Neil and inject him with the tissue sample before luring Jason into the launch bay of her lab, where she proceeds to launch him into space in a shuttle. With Jason gone, Kristen returns to the now fully healthy Neil who, upon seeing Kristen, attacks her with knife, driven to do so by the voice of Pamela Voorhees. As she lies on the floor dying, Kristen is cursed at by Neil, who now has Pamela's voice, and watches as he kills himself by slitting his own throat.[55]
