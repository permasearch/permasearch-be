The ants finish constructing the fake bird, but during a celebration, P.T. Flea arrives searching for his troupe and he inadvertently reveals their secret. Outraged by Flik's deception, the ants exile him and desperately gather food for a new offering to the grasshoppers. However, when Hopper returns to discover the mediocre offering, he takes over the island and demands the ants' winter food supply, planning to assassinate the Queen afterwards. Overhearing the plan, Dot informs Flik and the Circus Bugs and convinces them to return to Ant Island.
