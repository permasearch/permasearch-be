In the early 90's, Staley enrolled in several rehab programs, but he failed to stay clean for long.[25] At one point, the other members of Alice in Chains flew to Los Angeles for weekly therapy at Staley's rehab, drummer Sean Kinney recalled; "We would have done anything he wanted to have helped him. Sadly, I felt that what he wanted was for us to leave him alone."[25] During the Dirt tour, Alice in Chains manager, Susan Silver, hired bodyguards to keep Staley away from people who might try to pass him drugs,[89] but he ended up relapsing on alcohol and drugs during the tour.[90] Kurt Cobain's death in April 1994 scared Staley into temporary sobriety, but soon he was back into his addiction. "Everyone around him tried over and over again to help him get clean. In the end there was little else anyone could do", said Pearl Jam manager Kelly Curtis.[25] Alice in Chains' managers turned down lucrative touring possibilities and kept the band off the road, hoping that would help Staley.[25] Pearl Jam lead guitarist, Mike McCready, also tried to help Staley by inviting him to his side project Mad Season.[91][92] McCready had hoped that playing with sober musicians would encourage Staley. "I was under the mistaken theory I could help him out. I wanted to lead by example", McCready told Rolling Stone in 2002.[25]
