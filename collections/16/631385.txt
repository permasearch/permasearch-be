Darryl Morris (played by Dorian Gregory) is a lieutenant in the San Francisco Police Department. Darryl is introduced into season one as the partner of Andy Trudeau (Ted King).[1] At first, Darryl is suspicious of the Halliwell sisters' recurring connection to mysterious murders and crimes.[18] However, a few months after Andy's death, the sisters reveal to him that they are good witches trying to bring justice and protection to the world.[3] Throughout the series, Darryl helps the sisters cover up unsolved cases related to demonic activity, grants them favors, and gives them general support. After season seven, Darryl and his family move to the East Coast.[19]
