A collection item may be contrasted with a "demand item" or cash item, under which the bank credits the depositor's account immediately. Cheques (or "checks" as they are known in the United States) are usually handled by banks as a cash item, on the assumption that the payor bank will honor the check.[3] Cheques create float (cash in the payor's account which the payor still has access to while the transition has yet to be finalized).
