In Singapore and Malaysia, the term bungalow is sometimes used to refer to a house that was built during the colonial era. The structures were constructed “from the early 19th century until the end of World War II.”[8] They were built by the British to house their “military officers, High Court judges and other members of the colonial society’s great and good.”[9]
