Soon after Barry Switzer, who previously served as Oklahoma's offensive coordinator, took the reins of the program, the NCAA forced Oklahoma to forfeit nine games from the 1972 season due to violations involving the alteration of transcripts. Fairbanks denied any knowledge of this. As a punishment, the Sooners could not play in a bowl game for two years. This setback did not stop Switzer's Sooners. His 1973 team finished 10–0–1 with only a tie to the number one ranked USC team.[89] They finished the season ranked #3 after beating six teams who spent time in the top 20. The next year, Switzer's Sooners finished 11–0 and won the national championship. This was the Sooners' first undefeated season and national championship since 1956. That team was another high-scoring team averaging 43 points per game.[87] They were led by Steve Davis at quarterback, Joe Washington at running back and the Selmon brothers (Lee Roy, Lucious, and Dewey) on defense.
