Tarantino conceived Kill Bill as an homage to "grindhouse" cinema including martial arts films, samurai cinema, blaxploitation films, and spaghetti westerns. It features an anime sequence animated by Production I.G. It is the first of two Kill Bill films made in a single production; the films were originally set for a single release, but the film, with a runtime of over four hours, was divided in two. Volume 1 became Tarantino's highest-grossing film up to that point, earning over $180 million at the box office. Kill Bill: Volume 2 was released on April 16, 2004.
