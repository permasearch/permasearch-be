After Michelle Gomez reprised her role of Missy in the tenth series, she stated in May 2017 that it would be her last series in the role, and she would not be returning for the eleventh series or beyond.[17] After the tenth series concluded, it was confirmed that neither companion from that series would be reprising their roles for the eleventh series; Matt Lucas left his role as Nardole after the finale of the tenth series, and Pearl Mackie stated at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con that she would not return as Bill Potts after the 2017 Christmas special, "Twice Upon a Time".[18][19] Consequently, series 11 introduced a new set of companions, including Bradley Walsh, Tosin Cole, and Mandip Gill as Graham O'Brien, Ryan Sinclair and Yasmin Khan, respectively.[20][21] Walsh had been a favourite for the role since rumours of his casting began in August 2017.[22][20] Actress Sharon D. Clarke also has a recurring role throughout the series as Graham's wife Grace.[20][23][24]
