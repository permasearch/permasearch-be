Quarks have fractional electric charge values – either (−​1⁄3) or (+​2⁄3) times the elementary charge (e), depending on flavor. Up, charm, and top quarks (collectively referred to as up-type quarks) have a charge of +​2⁄3 e, while down, strange, and bottom quarks (down-type quarks) have −​1⁄3 e. Antiquarks have the opposite charge to their corresponding quarks; up-type antiquarks have charges of −​2⁄3 e and down-type antiquarks have charges of +​1⁄3 e. Since the electric charge of a hadron is the sum of the charges of the constituent quarks, all hadrons have integer charges: the combination of three quarks (baryons), three antiquarks (antibaryons), or a quark and an antiquark (mesons) always results in integer charges.[59] For example, the hadron constituents of atomic nuclei, neutrons and protons, have charges of 0 e and +1 e respectively; the neutron is composed of two down quarks and one up quark, and the proton of two up quarks and one down quark.[12]
