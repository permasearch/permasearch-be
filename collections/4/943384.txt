Some scholars contend that there are students who have a pathological urge to cheat. The writer Thomas Mallon noted that many scholars had found plagiarism in literature (Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Charles Reade being two notable examples) to often be perpetrated in a way similar to kleptomania (a psychological disease associated with uncontrollable stealing, even when it is against the interests of the thief).[55] On the other hand, Mallon concludes it is probable that most "cheaters" make a rational choice to commit academic misconduct.[56] A common reason for unethical behavior is the desire to "gain a competitive advantage in the race for position or power".[57][58]
