Facebook allows users to upload photos, and to add them to albums. In December 2010, the company enabled facial recognition technology, helping users identify people to tag in uploaded photos.[76] In May 2011, Facebook launched a feature to tag specific Facebook pages in photos, including brands, products, and companies.[77] On mobile, Facebook introduced photo filters in August 2011.[78]
