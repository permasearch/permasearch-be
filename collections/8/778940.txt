On October 6, 1973, Syria and Egypt, with support from other Arab nations, launched a surprise attack against Israel on Yom Kippur.[25] On October 12, 1973, US president Richard Nixon authorized Operation Nickel Grass, a strategic airlift to deliver weapons and supplies to Israel in order to replace its materiel losses,[26] after the Soviet Union began sending arms to Syria and Egypt.[27] In response to this, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC, consisting of the Arab members of OPEC plus Egypt and Syria) announced an oil embargo against Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States.[28] Saudi Arabia only consented to the embargo after Nixon's promise of $2.2billion in military aid to Israel.[29] The embargo was accompanied by gradual monthly production cutsâ€”by December, production had been cut to 25% of September levels.[29] This contributed to a global recession and increased tension between the United States and European allies who faulted the US for provoking an embargo by providing assistance to Israel.[30] OAPEC demanded a complete Israeli withdrawal from all territories beyond the 1949 Armistice border.[29][31]
