Other than the previous basic design rules, the Cub Scout is able to carve and decorate the car as he chooses. Many Cub Scouts also add weights to the final design to bring the car to the maximum allowable weight; coins and glued-in lead or steel pieces are common ways to add weight. Cars typically vary from unfinished blocks to whimsical objects, to accurate replicas of actual cars.[9] Graphite is usually the only lubricant allowed, and it often helps to polish the provided nails.
