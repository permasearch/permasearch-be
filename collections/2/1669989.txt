Ten days after the episode's broadcast, Meloni left the show after his contract negotiations failed.[3] B. D. Wong, who was absent from this episode, departed the cast as well to star on the NBC drama Awake.[4] Wong later reprised his role in one episode each for the 13th, 14th, 15th and 17th seasons. A plan to have Hargitay only appear in 13 episodes of the next season was discussed[5] but later retracted, as Hargitay then extended her contract through the 14th season.[6][7][8]
