Olivia Hill is the namesake of Olivia and John Walton (daughter of Olivia's deceased childhood best friend Marnie), is the wife of Bob Hill, whom she marries on the mountain in "The Shivaree" episode. Catastrophe afflicts her family and her husband's family, as both of them have no surviving parents, and they ended up seeing each other before their wedding, said to be bad luck. This turns out to be prophetic when Olivia is reduced to a bereaved widow barely a year later. She returns to Walton's Mountain following her husband's sudden death in "The Loss", said to have been struck by a car during the night on his way home when he didn't see it coming.
