The tour resumed in April 2017 with the Japan shows, revisiting the Budokan like in 2015. Before and after, Paul announced another 2 US legs; a Latin American leg, returning to Brazil after 3 years, and Colombia and Mexico after a 5 and a half years absence; and the first visit to Australia and New Zealand in 24 years, having last visited those countries in 1993 on the New World Tour. This year has seen a couple of changes in the set list, which are "Save Us" and "Letting Go" switching with "Junior's Farm" and "Jet" respectively concert after concert, "Here, There, and Everywhere" dropped out, and "I Wanna Be Your Man" and "Sgt. Pepper's (reprise)" added, with the former added after being successfully performed at the Desert Trip, and the latter reappearing since the Up and Coming Tour, 6 years after the last performance on the last show of that tour in Las Vegas, but now, though it's been inserted in the encore like before, it's not the culminating number of the show and is not attached in a medley with The End.
