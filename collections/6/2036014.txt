The benefit of prompt, primary angioplasty over thrombolytic therapy for acute STEMI is now well established.[19][20][21] When performed rapidly, an angioplasty restores flow in the blocked artery in more than 95% of patients compared with the reperfusion rate of about 65% achieved by thrombolysis.[19] Logistic and economic obstacles seem to hinder a more widespread application of angioplasty,[22] although the feasibility of providing regionalized angioplasty for STEMI is currently being explored in the United States.[23] The use of a coronary angioplasty to abort a myocardial infarction is preceded by a primary percutaneous coronary intervention. The goal of a prompt angioplasty is to open the artery as soon as possible, and preferably within 90 minutes of the patient presenting to the emergency room. This time is referred to as the door-to-balloon time. Few hospitals can provide an angioplasty within the 90 minute interval,[24] which prompted the American College of Cardiology (ACC) to launch a national Door to Balloon (D2B) Initiative in November 2006. Over 800 hospitals have joined the D2B Alliance as of March 16, 2007.[25]
