The 2nd Test started with Indian captain Virat Kohli's surprise decision to bowl first. India included Stuart Binny and Ishant Sharma in place of Amit Mishra and Umesh Yadav. The Indian spinners, Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, took 8 wickets between them to dismiss South Africa for 214. Indian openers Murli Vijay and Shikhar Dhawan started positively and at the end of Day 1 India was in a strong position. However, strong and persistent rain on next 4 days meant that the match ended in a draw without any further play.
