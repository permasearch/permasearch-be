The Wiener process is a stochastic process with stationary and independent increments that are normally distributed based on the size of the increments.[2][74] The Wiener process is named after Norbert Wiener, who proved its mathematical existence, but the process is also called the Brownian motion process or just Brownian motion due to its historical connection as a model for Brownian movement in liquids.[75][76][76][77]
