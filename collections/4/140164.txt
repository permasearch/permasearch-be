Setting out to write something on an epic scale,[85] Martin projected to write three books of 800 manuscript pages in the very early stages of the series.[79] His original 1990s contract specified one-year deadlines for his previous literary works, but Martin only realized later that his new books were longer and hence required more writing time.[41] In 2000, Martin planned to take 18 months to two years for each volume and projected the last of the planned six books to be released five or six years later.[37] However, with the Ice and Fire series evolving into the biggest and most ambitious story he has ever attempted writing,[45] he still has two more books to write as of 2016. Martin said he needed to be in his own office in Santa Fe, New Mexico to immerse himself in the fictional world and write.[25] As of 2011, Martin was still typing his fiction on a DOS computer with WordStar 4.0 software.[87] He begins each day at 10Â am with rewriting and polishing the previous day's work,[78] and may write all day or struggle to write anything.[25] Excised material and previous old versions are saved to be possibly re-inserted at a later time.[45]
