High Point is the only city in North Carolina that exists within four counties: Davidson, Forsyth, Guilford and Randolph.[13] It also stands within two major watersheds: the Yadkin–Pee Dee to the west and the Cape Fear to the east. Parts of the city rise above 1,000 feet (300 m), making it among the highest cities in North Carolina's Piedmont.
