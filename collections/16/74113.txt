Coffee came to India well before the East India company, through an India Sufi saint named "Baba Budan".[52] The first record of coffee growing in India is following the introduction of coffee beans from Yemen by Baba Budan to the hills of Chikmagalur (Coorg, Southern India) in 1670.[53] Since then coffee plantations have become established in the region, extending south to Kodagu.[52]
