Domestic violence in United States is a form of violence expressed by one partner or partners against another partner or partners in the context of an intimate relationship in the U.S.. It is recognized as an important social problem by governmental and non-governmental agencies, and various Violence Against Women Acts have been passed by the US Congress in an attempt to stem this tide.
