The transport and deposition of the sediments in narrow alpine reservoirs is often caused by turbidity currents. They follow the thalweg of the lake to the deepest area near the dam, where the sediments can affect the operation of the bottom outlet and the intake structures.[6] Controlling this sedimentation within the reservoir can be achieved by using solid and permeable obstacles with the right design.[6]
