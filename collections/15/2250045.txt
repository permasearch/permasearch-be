Even though Ambrose's last television appearance was in 2008, he continued to appear in the Monk novel series by Lee Goldberg. In Mr. Monk in Outer Space, he is shown to be a fan of the science fiction series Beyond Earth, and has even written a number of books about the series itself. It is also revealed that he is a good lip-reader, as he can read what a shooter on a surveillance tape is saying. Ambrose is also shown to have learned Pig Latin and the Dratch constructed language of Beyond Earth. Hence, he plays a big part in helping Adrian's investigation into the murder of Beyond Earth creator Conrad Stipe and later executive producer Kingston Mills. He identifies Mills's killer by reading his lips and creating a written translation.
