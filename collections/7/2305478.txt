Windows Phone (WP) is a family of discontinued[6] mobile operating systems developed by Microsoft for smartphones as the replacement successor to Windows Mobile[7][8] and Zune.[9] Windows Phone features a new user interface derived from Metro design language. Unlike Windows Mobile, it is primarily aimed at the consumer market rather than the enterprise market.[10] It was first launched in October 2010 with Windows Phone 7.[11] Windows Phone 8.1 is the latest public release of the operating system, released to manufacturing on April 14, 2014.[12][13]
