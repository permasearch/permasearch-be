The NIYC was founded by Clyde Warrior (Ponca), and Melvin Thom, (Paiute).  Their work resulted in an action program and a newspaper called ABC: Americans Before Columbus.  What seems particularly interesting about the NIYC is the approaches that they took and still take today towards achieving their goals. For instance, they held "fish-ins" along the rivers in Washington in order to protest the treaty-given fishing rights that were being taken away from them. This was due to a nullified supreme court decision. These incidents are not unlike the number of sit-ins held by young African-Americans during the civil rights movement, in protest of equal rights not being granted to them.[14]
