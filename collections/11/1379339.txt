In July 1994 (shortly after her motherâ€™s death), Rudolph was diagnosed with brain cancer. She also had been diagnosed with throat cancer. Her condition worsened day by day and she died on November 12, 1994, at the age of fifty-four, at her home in Brentwood, a suburb of Nashville, Tennessee.[1][40] Rudolph's funeral service was held at Edgefield Missionary Baptist Church in Clarksville, Tennessee. She was survived by her four children, eight grandchildren, and many siblings, nieces and nephews.[41] Thousands of mourners filled Tennessee State University's Kean Hall on November 17, 1994, for the memorial service in her honor. Across Tennessee, the state flag flew at half-mast.[14]
