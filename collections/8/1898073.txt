The part west of downtown Los Angeles was pre-1964 Legislative Route 173, defined in 1933 from Santa Monica to downtown Los Angeles.[22] It was signed as State Route 26 by 1942, running primarily Olympic Boulevard.[citation needed] It was later replaced by the Santa Monica Freeway, and added to the Interstate Highway System on September 15, 1955. It too was assigned the I-10 number on August 14, 1957.[1] It was completed ca. 1964,[23] and became Route 10 in the 1964 renumbering.
