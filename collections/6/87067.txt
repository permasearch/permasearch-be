The Ctenophora and the sponges are unique among the animals in lacking true hox genes.[89] The presence of a Hox/Parahox gene in the Placozoa suggests that either the Porifera or the Ctenophora are the most basal animal clades.[90] Another DNA based study suggests that the Ctenophora are the earliest branching animals.[91] Another study also suggests that this group are a sister group to other animals.[92]
