In Britain, hunting with hounds was popular in Celtic Britain before the Romans arrived, using the Agassaei breed.[2] The Romans brought their Castorian and Fulpine hound breeds to England, along with importing the brown hare (the mountain hare is native) and fallow deer as quarry. Wild boar was also hunted.
