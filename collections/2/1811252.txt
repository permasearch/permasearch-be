Following Frank's eviction, the HouseGuests rolled in the Perfect Shot Head of Household competition. Each HouseGuest had a lane with slots numbered 1-21. They must roll their ball down their lane to try and make the highest score. They had the opportunity to practice by rolling their yellow ball down their lane as often as they wanted. Whenever they decided to take their best shot, they must roll the red ball. Whatever slot the red ball lands in will be their official score. The HouseGuest with the highest score will be the new Head of Household. Paul was the winner. For being the bottom four performers in the Head of Household competition, Corey, Natalie, Paulie and Zakiyah became Have-Nots for the week. However, Natalie received America's Care Package, which contained a Never-Not Pass, rendering her immune from being a Have-Not for the rest of the season. On Day 45, Paul nominated Bridgette and Paulie for eviction. On Day 46, Paul, Bridgette and Paulie, as well as Corey, Victor and Natalie, sprinted in the Ready, Set, Whoa Power of Veto competition. In this competition, HouseGuests had to hold down two buttons in their starting lane. At the end of their lanes, a monitor will cycle though the words "ready, set, go." If a HouseGuest releases a button before the word "go", they will be eliminated. Once they see the word "go," they must run to the end of their lane and hit one of the five buttons. The last person to hit a button will be eliminated. Once a HouseGuest uses a button, it is out of play for future rounds. The last HouseGuest standing will win the Power of Veto. Paulie was the winner. On Day 48, Paulie took himself off the block, and Paul named Da'Vonne as the replacement nominee. On Day 51, Da'Vonne was evicted by a 6-2 vote, with Michelle and Zakiyah voting to evict Bridgette. Da'Vonne was revealed not to have the round trip ticket and she became the first member of the jury.
