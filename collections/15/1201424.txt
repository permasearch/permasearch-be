The new 1985 L98 350 added tuned-port fuel injection "TPI", which was standard on all 1985–1991 Corvettes. It was rated at 230 bhp for 1985–1986, 240 bhp for 1987-1989 (245 bhp with 3.08:1 rear axle ratio (1988-1989 only)), and 245 bhp in 1990-1991 (250 bhp with 3.08:1 rear axle). Aluminum cylinder heads (Corvette only) were released part way through the 1986 model run, modified for 1987 with D-ports, and continued through the end of L98 Corvette production in 1991 (still used on ZZx 350 crate engines until 2015 when the ZZ6 received the Fast Burn heads).[9] The L98 V8 was optional on Jan. '87–'92 Chevrolet Camaro & Pontiac Firebird models (rated at 225 hp (168 kW)-245 hp (183 kW) and 330 lb·ft (447 N·m)-345 lb·ft (468 N·m)) 1987 versions had 20 hp (15 kW) and 15 lb·ft (20 N·m) more and a change to hydraulic roller camshaft. Compression was up again in 1990 to 9.5:1 Camaro/Firebird and 10:1 Corvettes, but rated output stayed the same.
