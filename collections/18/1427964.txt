In 2008, Raimi expressed interest in portraying the transformation of Dr. Curt Connors into his villainous alter-ego, the Lizard; the character's actor Dylan Baker and producer Grant Curtis were also enthusiastic about the idea.[37][38][39] Raimi also discussed his desire to upgrade Bruce Campbell from a cameo appearance to a significant role,[40] later revealed to be Quentin Beck / Mysterio.[41] It was reported in December 2009 that John Malkovich was in negotiations to play Vulture and that Anne Hathaway would play Felicia Hardy, though she would not have transformed into the Black Cat as in the comics. Instead, Raimi's Felicia was expected to become a new superpowered figure called the Vulturess.[42] However, several years later, in 2013, Raimi stated that Hathaway was going to be Black Cat if Spider-Man 4 had been made.[43] Concept art revealed in June 2016 showed the inclusion of an opening montage of Spider-Man going up against C and D-list villains, such as Mysterio, the Shocker, the Prowler, and the Rhino, with the Vulture serving as the main antagonist.[41]
