Fairies are generally described as human in appearance and having magical powers. Diminutive fairies of various kinds have been reported through centuries, ranging from quite tiny to the size of a human child.[8] These small sizes could be magically assumed, rather than constant.[9] Some smaller fairies could expand their figures to imitate humans.[10] On Orkney, fairies were described as short in stature, dressed in dark grey, sometimes seen in armour.[11] In some folklore, fairies have green eyes. Some depictions of fairies show them with footwear, others as barefoot. Wings, while common in Victorian and later artworks, are rare in folklore; fairies flew by means of magic, sometimes perched on ragwort stems or the backs of birds.[12] Modern illustrations often include dragonfly or butterfly wings.[13]
