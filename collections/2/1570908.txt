A second lunar calendar is attested by a demotic astronomical papyrus[24] dating to sometime after AD 144 which outlines a lunisolar calendar operating in accordance with the Egyptian civil calendar according to a 25-year cycle.[25] The calendar seems to show its month beginning with the first visibility of the waxing crescent moon, but Parker displayed an error in the cycle of about a day in 500 years,[26] using it to show the cycle was developed to correspond with the new moon around 357 BC.[27] This date places it prior to the Ptolemaic period and within the native Egyptian Dynasty XXX. Egypt's 1st Persian occupation, however, seems likely to have been its inspiration.[28] This lunisolar calendar's calculations apparently continued to be used without correction into the Roman period, even when they no longer precisely matched the observable lunar phases.[29]
