Della (portrayed by Rebecca Dalton) is a normal student at Whitechapel High, who gets her heart broken after the death of her dog, Puffles. Benny brings Puffles back to life to woo her but ends up bringing to life every other dead animal buried in the ground. This ends up driving her away from Benny. Della is said to be attending therapy since she can't forget Puffles. Della is seen again in the first season finale at the school dance, later talking with Rory.
