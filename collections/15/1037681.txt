Phalke decided to make a feature film after watching The Life of Christ (1906) at a theatre in Mumbai, formerly known as Bombay. He went to London for two weeks to learn filmmaking techniques and founded Phalke Films. He imported the hardware required for the filmmaking and exhibition from England, France, Germany, and the United States. Phalke shot a short film Ankurachi Wadh (Growth of a Pea Plant) to attract investors for his venture. He published advertisements in various newspapers calling for the cast and crew. As no women were available to play female leads, male actors performed the female roles. Phalke was in charge of scriptment, direction, production design, make-up, editing, along with film processing. Trymbak B. Telang handled the camera. Phalke completed filming in six months and 27 days producing a film of 3,700 feet, about four reels.
