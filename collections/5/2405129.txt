As a work of art, the icon is dated to the earlier part of the 12th century, and a date shortly before its arrival in Rus about 1131, according to the chronicles, seems plausible.[5] Like other Byzantine works of high quality, it is thought to have been painted in Constantinople, and is regarded as the finest panel icon surviving from the Komnenian period, the few survivors from which vary considerably in quality. Only the faces and hands are original, with the clothes repainted after suffering damage when a metal cover or riza was placed over them,[6] and in a fire in 1195.[7] The work shows a humanity and tenderness new to Byzantine art in this period.[8] The reverse of the icon, which is much less well known, has a 15th-century image of the "Prepared Table": a Hetoimasia with the Instruments of the Passion and other symbols.[9]
