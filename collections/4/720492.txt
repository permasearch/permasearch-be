Marked sensitivity to antipsychotics. Antipsychotic treatment of people with DLB results in adverse reactions about half of the time,[11] and this can be fatal after a single dose.[15] The Fourth Consensus Report continues to caution against the use of antipsychotics (neuroleptics) for people with DLB.[1] Partly because of dopamine cell loss, people with DLB may have neuroleptic malignant syndrome, impairments in cognition or alertness, or irreversible exacerbation of parkinsonism including severe rigidity,[4] and dysautonomia from the use of antipsychotics.[15] Antipsychotic medications with D2 dopamine receptor blocking properties are used only with great caution.[7]
