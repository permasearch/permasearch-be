In September 1938, the Miller band began making recordings for the RCA Victor subsidiary Bluebird.[31] Cy Shribman, a prominent East Coast businessman, began financing the band, providing a much needed infusion of cash.[32] In the spring of 1939, the band's fortunes improved with a date at the Meadowbrook Ballroom in Cedar Grove, New Jersey, and more dramatically at the Glen Island Casino in New Rochelle, New York. The Glen Island date according to author Gunther Schuller attracted "a record breaking opening night crowd of 1800..."[33] With the Glen Island date, the band began a huge rise in popularity.[34] In 1939, Time magazine noted: "Of the twelve to 24 discs in each of today's 300,000 U.S. jukeboxes, from two to six are usually Glenn Miller's."[35] There were record-breaking recordings such as "Tuxedo Junction", which sold 115,000 copies in the first week.[36] Miller's huge success in 1939 culminated with his band appearing at Carnegie Hall on October 6, with Paul Whiteman, Benny Goodman, and Fred Waring also the main attractions.[37]
