Maugrim's name first appears on the proclamation that the Pevensie children find in Mr Tumnus' ransacked cave, announcing the faun's arrest by the Secret Police for not giving Lucy Pevensie to the White Witch. The wolf is first seen guarding the gate of the White Witch's castle; he takes Edmund's message to the witch and allows him entry. Maugrim is subsequently described as "a huge grey beast - its eyes flaming - far too big to be a dog".[4]
