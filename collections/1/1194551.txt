Apple has gradually expanded its efforts in getting its products into the Indian market. In July 2012, during a conference call with investors, CEO Tim Cook said that he "[loves] India", but that Apple saw larger opportunities outside the region.[415] India's requirement that 30% of products sold be manufactured in the country was described as "really adds cost to getting product to market".[416] In October 2013, Indian Apple executives unveiled a plan for selling devices through instalment plans and store-within-a-store concepts, in an effort to expand further into the market. The news followed Cook's acknowledgment of the country in July when sales results showed that iPhone sales in India grew 400% during the second quarter of 2013.[417][418] In March 2016, The Times of India reported that Apple had sought permission from the Indian government to sell refurbished iPhones in the country.[419][420] However, two months later, the application was rejected, citing official country policy.[421][422] In May 2016, Apple opened an iOS app development center in Bangalore and a maps development office for 4,000 staff in Hyderabad.[423][424][425][426] In February 2017, Apple once again requested permission to sell used iPhones in the country.[427][428] The same month, Bloomberg reported that Apple was close to receiving permission to open its first retail store in the country.[429][430] In March, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple would begin manufacturing iPhone models in India "over the next two months",[431][432] and in May, the Journal wrote that an Apple manufacturer had begun production of iPhone SE in the country,[433][434] while Apple told CNBC that the manufacturing was for a "small number" of units.[435] Reuters reported in December 2017, that Apple and the Indian government were clashing over planned increases to import taxes for components used in mobile phone production, with Apple having engaged in talks with government officials to try to delay the plans, but the Indian government sticking to its policies of no exemptions to its "Made in India" initiative.[436][437] The import tax increases went into effect a few days later, with Apple being hurt the most out of all phone manufacturers, having nine of out ten phones imported into the country, whereas main smartphone competitor Samsung produces almost all of its devices locally.[438]
