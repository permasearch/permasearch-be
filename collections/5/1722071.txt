Bakersfield has seen its population grow from about 105,000 in 1980 to 347,000 in 2010.  Although the city is still growing, its growth rate has slowed in recent years due to the economic recession and high home foreclosure rates. However, in October 2013, Bakersfield was found to be the number two city for the rental market.[61]
