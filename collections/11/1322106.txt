45 of the 50 states have a lieutenant governor who stands in for the governor when the governor is absent from the state or temporarily incapacitated. In most cases, the lieutenant governor ascends to the position of governor after the death or resignation of the governor, but in some states the lieutenant governor becomes an acting governor. In many states, the lieutenant governor has few official powers, similar to the United States Vice President.[1] However, some lieutenant governors do have significant responsibilities.[2] In Texas, the lieutenant governor has numerous powers over the legislative process, particularly in the senate.[3]
