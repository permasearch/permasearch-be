As the combined Texian force prepared for battle, they sent a messenger to instruct the alcalde[15] of the city to surrender. At 11Â pm, the alcade responded that the town would remain neutral, neither surrendering nor fighting. Several of the locals did, however, supply axes to the Texian militia.[14] The Texians divided themselves into four groups, each assigned a different approach to the presidio.[16] In the pre-dawn hours of October 10, the Texians attacked.[14] The lone sentinel managed to give the alarm but was immediately shot dead.[16] The Texians quickly hacked through a door on the north wall of the fortress and ran to the interior courtyard. Hearing the commotion, the Mexican soldiers had lined the walls to defend the fort.[17]
