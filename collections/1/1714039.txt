"Because You Loved Me" received positive reviews from music critics. Larry Flick from Billboard wrote that "Because You Loved Me" is, "rife with grand romance, larger-than-life production, and a climax that is best described as the musical equivalent to 4th of July fireworks."[2] Another Billboard editor, Paul Verna also highlighted the chart-topping "Because You Loved Me."[3] Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised it calling it this year's "Wind Beneath My Wings."[4] Positive review also came from senior editor of AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine who praised ballads like "Because You Loved Me" on Falling into You.[5] And Dave Sholin from the Gavin Report wrote: "How about this daring prediction: It'll be one of the first major hits of 1996! An expected Celine Dion media blitz this spring is certain to take her and this project far into the next galaxy."[6]
