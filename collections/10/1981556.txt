In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, conditions in Eastern Europe convinced many Jews to emigrate to the United States.  In Germany, Jewish integration into the Army and other occupations was successful. In the United States traditional disabilities were generally absent but they faced many different challenges of acculturation. In the early 20th century, there was social discrimination against Jews in certain quarters,[5] with many universities and professions barred to them or with a quota limit.
