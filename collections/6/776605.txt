The Common Admission Test (CAT) is a management aptitude test conducted by the IIMs primarily as an evaluation tool for admission to their two-year PGP programmes. It is widely considered as one of the most competitive exams in the world,[65] with a success rate of around one in two hundred.[66] Even with the addition of new colleges, in 2013 the acceptance rate at IIM was 1.714%, one of the lowest kind in the world.[67]
