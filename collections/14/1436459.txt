A U.S. National Institutes of Health fact sheet of 2011 reported on a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial performed on 111 women affected by fibrosis and having a history of breast pain. In this trial, daily doses of iodine led to decreased in breast pain, tenderness and nodularity. It was emphasized that further research to clarify iodine's role in fibrocystic breast disease is needed and that large doses of iodine should only be used under the guidance of a physician.[28][29]
