The next line-up change occurred in September 2004 when de Lisle was sacked from the band by Plaza and Smith.[43][44] Upon return to Sydney following a tour of Western Australia by the band Twohill was told at the airport that he had played his last show for the band.[44] De Lisle lodged a wrongful dismissal case against his former bandmates with the NSW Industrial Relations Commission in 2007. At the hearing de Lisle said he had "no inkling" that his bandmates were dissatisfied with his performances and his attitude,[43] whereas Plaza advised that the band had been discussing de Lisle's future for some time and had issued the drummer with a warning after alleged unprofessional behaviour during a gig at Ettalong, north of Sydney, in December 2003.
