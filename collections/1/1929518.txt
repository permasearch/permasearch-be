There were two major types of tobacco grown in the colonies â€“ Sweet-scented and Oronoco. Oronoco was coarser, bulkier, and the shape of the leaf was pointier. Sweet-scented leaves on the other hand were rounder and were made up of finer fibers. Oronoco was grown all over the Chesapeake Bay, whereas Sweet-scented was only grown along the Potomac, James, York, and Rappahannock Rivers. While those in England preferred Sweet-scented tobacco, which had a milder flavor, the rest of Europe tended to prefer Oronoco, which was therefore more profitable for colonial plantation owners.[5]
