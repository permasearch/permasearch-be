Scooby-Doo is the eponymous character in the Scooby-Doo animated television series created by the popular American animation company Hanna-Barbera. Scooby-Doo is the pet and lifelong companion of Shaggy Rogers and in many iterations, including the original series, is regarded as a unique Anthropomorphic Great Dane dog who is able to speak in broken English, unlike most other dogs in his reality, and usually puts the letter R in front of words spoken. Other incarnations, such as A Pup Named Scooby-Doo, present talking dogs like Scooby as quite common.
