More than 300 UAE officials, men and women, from 90 local and federal governmental institutions, have worked on developing the national agenda, which has been subdivided into six national axes representing the main sectors, which will be the main focus of the government: Education, Health, Economy, Police and Security, Housing, and Infrastructure and Government Services. The UAE Vision National Agenda aims for the UAE to be the safest place on Earth. The global economy will witness significant changes in the coming years. Education is a fundamental element for the development of a nation and the best investment in its youth.
