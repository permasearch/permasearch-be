Two years later, on the 20th anniversary of Jurassic Park, a 3D version of the film was released in cinemas.[94] Spielberg declared that he had produced the film with a sort of "subconscious 3D", as scenes feature animals walking toward the cameras and some effects of foreground and background overlay.[95] In 2011, he stated in an interview that Jurassic Park was the only of his works he had considered for a conversion,[96] and once he saw the 3D version of Titanic in 2012, he liked the new look of the film so much that he hired the same retrofitting company, Stereo D. Spielberg and cinematographer Janusz Kami≈Ñski supervised the nine-month process closely in-between the production of Lincoln.[95][97] Stereo D executive Aaron Parry declared that the conversion was an evolution of what the company had done with Titanic, "being able to capitalize on everything we learned with Jim on Titanic and take it into a different genre and movie, and one with so many technical achievements." The studio had the help of ILM, which contributed some elements and updated effects shots for a better visual enhancement.[98] It opened in the United States and seven other territories on April 5, 2013,[99] with other countries receiving the re-release in the following six months.[100]
