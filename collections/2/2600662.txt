It was originally known as Sitangiospren ("the Glacier Behind the Town") or Aak'wtaaksitkahan ("the Glacier Behind the Little Lake"), also Latinized as Aakwtaaksit,[5] by the Tlingit. The glacier was named Auke (Auk) Glacier by naturalist John Muir for the Tlingit Auk Kwaan (or Aak'w Kwaan) band in 1888. In 1891 it was renamed in honor of Thomas Corwin Mendenhall. It extends from the Juneau Icefield, its source, to Mendenhall Lake.
