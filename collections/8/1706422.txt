Gluten ataxia is a gluten-related disorder, a wide spectrum of disorders marked by an abnormal immunological response to gluten. Like celiac disease, it is an autoimmune disease.[26] With gluten ataxia, damage takes place in the cerebellum, the balance center of the brain that controls coordination and complex movements like walking, speaking and swallowing.[27] Gluten ataxia is the single most common cause of sporadic idiopathic ataxia.[28] It accounts for 40% of ataxias of unknown origin and 15% of all ataxias.[29]
