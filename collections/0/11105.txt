The Qur'an admonishes Muslim women to dress modestly and cover their breasts and genitals but it doesn't require covering the head.[3] The Qur'an explicitly states that "O wives of the Prophet, you are not like anyone among women"[4] and as such has separate rules specifically for the wives of the Prophet. Wearing hijab, or al-khimar, is considered by some to be obligatory in Islam[citation needed], as the quote states "Tell the believing women to put their khimar over their bosoms", all the major Arab translations and dictionaries agree that "al-khimar" means a veil or scarf that a woman uses to cover her head, and "over their bosoms" implies women should cover their breasts, necks etc.[citation needed]
