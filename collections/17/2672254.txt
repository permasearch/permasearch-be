A bizarre crop with an unusual life-cycle.  Once picked, the fruit must be kept in a dark, dusty drawer for several years, after which time the outer skin crumbles to dust leaving an unidentifiable metal object with screw-holes and various ridges and flanges.  This object will inevitably get thrown away when discovered.  There is general uncertainty as to the evolutionary benefits of this behaviour to the ratchet screwdriver species as a whole.
