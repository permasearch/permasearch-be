Italian comedy rock band Elio e le Storie Tese recorded a parody cover of the song in 1996, entitled "Balla col barlafÃ¼s" (i.e. "Dance with the idiot" in Milanese dialect), with completely new Italian lyrics which mock Umberto Bossi and his attempt, earlier that year, to rally up a human chain across the river Po to symbolically block its course. Apart from the lyrics, the band's cover follows the original song in every detail, including the dance instructions.
