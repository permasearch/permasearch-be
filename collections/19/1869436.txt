The BBC paid £40–50 million for the broadcast rights to the 2012 Olympic Games and showed around 5,800 hours of content over the 17 days of the Games, all of which was available in high definition. This is an increase on the amount of coverage shown at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing when half of the international feed, 2,500 hours, was broadcast.[142] To accompany its coverage the BBC commissioned an anthem from the British band, Elbow, entitled "First Steps".[143]
