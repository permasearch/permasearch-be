The unexpected order to retreat from prepared defensive lines in the face of the enemy, meant that II Corps was required to fight a number of sharp rearguard actions against the Germans. For the first stage of the withdrawal, Smith-Dorrien detailed the 15th Brigade of the 5th Division, which had not been involved in heavy fighting on 23 August, to act as rearguard. On 24 August they fought various holding actions at Paturages, Frameries and Audregnies. During the engagement at Audregnies the 1st Battalions of the Cheshire and Norfolk Regiments temporarily checked the German advance from QuiÃ©vrain and Baisieux despite being heavily outnumbered and took resultant very heavy losses, though in return with the support of the 5th Brigade artillery assets they also inflicted heavy casualties on the advancing German regiments. An evening roll call of the Cheshires 1st Battalion, who had not received an issued withdrawal order, indicated that their establishment had been reduced by almost 80 per cent.
