When children aged between five and seven in the United Kingdom were asked to describe being smacked by parents, their responses included such remarks as, "it feels like someone banged you with a hammer", "it hurts and it’s painful inside—it’s like breaking your bones", and "it just feels horrid, you know, and it really hurts, it stings you and makes you horrible inside".[32] Elizabeth Gershoff writes that "The pain and distress evident in these first-hand accounts can accumulate over time and precipitate the mental-health problems that have been linked with corporal punishment".[5] Other comments by children such as, "you [feel] sort of as though you want to run away because they’re sort of like being mean to you and it hurts a lot" and "you feel you don’t like your parents anymore" are consistent with researchers' concerns that corporal punishment can undermine the quality of parent-child relationships, according to Gershoff.[5]
