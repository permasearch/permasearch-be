The first use of telecommunication in the Republic of South Africa was a single line telegraph connecting Cape Town and Simonstown[citation needed].  At about the time of the Bell Telephone Company's development of the telephone industry post-1876, early undersea telegraph links were introduced, first connecting Durban and Europe, and later connecting the country to the rest of the world[citation needed]. In the mid-twentieth century undersea telephone cables were also commissioned.
