Bacterial anoxygenic photosynthesis is distinguished from the more familiar terrestrial plant oxygenic photosynthesis by the nature of the terminal reductant (e.g. hydrogen sulfide rather than water) and in the byproduct generated (e.g. elemental sulfur instead of molecular oxygen). As its name implies, anoxygenic photosynthesis does not produce oxygen as a byproduct of the reaction. Additionally, all known organisms that carry out anoxygenic photosynthesis are obligate anaerobes. Several groups of bacteria can conduct anoxygenic photosynthesis: green sulfur bacteria (GSB), red and green filamentous phototrophs (FAPs e.g. Chloroflexi), purple bacteria, Acidobacteria, and heliobacteria.[1][2]
