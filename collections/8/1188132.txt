In 1971, Clyde Hutchison and Marshall Edgell showed that it is possible to produce mutants with small fragments of phage Ï•X174 and restriction nucleases.[9][10] Hutchison later produced with his collaborator Michael Smith in 1978 a more flexible approach to site-directed mutagenesis by using oligonucleotides in a primer extension method with DNA polymerase.[11] For his part in the development of this process, Michael Smith later shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in October 1993 with Kary B. Mullis, who invented polymerase chain reaction.
