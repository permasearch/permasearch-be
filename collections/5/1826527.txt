External validity is the validity of generalized (causal) inferences in scientific research, usually based on experiments as experimental validity.[1] In other words, it is the extent to which the results of a study can be generalized to other situations and to other people.[2] Mathematical analysis of external validity concerns a determination of whether generalization across heterogeneous populations is feasible, and devising statistical and computational methods that produce valid generalizations.[3]
