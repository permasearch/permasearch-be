A licentiate is an academic degree that traditionally conferred the license to teach at a university or to practice a particular profession. The term survived despite the fact that nowadays a doctorate is typically needed in order to teach at a university. The term is also used for a person who holds a licentiate.[6][7]  In English, the degree has never been called a license. In French-speaking countries, the bachelor's degree is called a licence.
