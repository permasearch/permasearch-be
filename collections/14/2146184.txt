Here      y  n + 1     {\displaystyle y_{n+1}}   is the RK4 approximation of     y (  t  n + 1   )   {\displaystyle y(t_{n+1})}  , and the next value (     y  n + 1     {\displaystyle y_{n+1}}  ) is determined by the present value (     y  n     {\displaystyle y_{n}}  ) plus the weighted average of four increments, where each increment is the product of the size of the interval, h, and an estimated slope specified by function f on the right-hand side of the differential equation.
