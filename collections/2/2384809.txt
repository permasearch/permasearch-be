The episode describes the ultimate decline of Robin's career as Robin Sparkles, who first appeared in the season 2 episode "Slap Bet", returning in the season 3 episode Sandcastles in the Sand (also the name of Sparkles' music video) and the season 6 episode Glitter. Series co-creator Craig Thomas said it would be a "fitting end" to the show tackling Robin's music past.[1]
