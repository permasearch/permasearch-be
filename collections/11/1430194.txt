Benzodiazepines are considered major drugs of abuse.[20] Benzodiazepine abuse is mostly limited to individuals who abuse other drugs, i.e., poly-drug abusers.  On the international scene, benzodiazepines are categorized as Schedule IV controlled drugs by the INCB, apart from flunitrazepam, which is a Schedule III drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.[198] Some variation in drug scheduling exists in individual countries; for example, in the United Kingdom, midazolam and temazepam are Schedule III controlled drugs.
