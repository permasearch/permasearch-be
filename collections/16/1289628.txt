Chelsea hold the English record for the fewest goals conceded during a league season (15), the highest number of clean sheets overall in a Premier League season (25) (both set during the 2004–05 season),[110] and the most consecutive clean sheets from the start of a league season (6, set during the 2005–06 season).[111] The club's 21–0 aggregate victory over Jeunesse Hautcharage in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1971 remains a record in European competition.[112] Chelsea hold the record for the longest streak of unbeaten matches at home in the English top flight, which lasted 86 matches from 20 March 2004 to 26 October 2008. They secured the record on 12 August 2007, beating the previous record of 63 matches unbeaten set by Liverpool between 1978 and 1980.[113][114] Chelsea's streak of eleven consecutive away league wins, set between 5 April 2008 and 6 December 2008, is also a record for the English top flight.[115] Their £50 million purchase of Fernando Torres from Liverpool in January 2011 was the record transfer fee paid by a British club[116] until Ángel Di María signed for Manchester United in August 2014 for £59.7 million.[117]
