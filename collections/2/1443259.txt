The term "new breed" was originally used to describe the revived ECW brand as a whole, with advertisements and articles using the tagline "A new breed unleashed".[4] In early 2007, the term began to be used as the name for a new stable (faction) on the new ECW brand, which consisted solely of wrestlers that had not been a part of the original ECW. This stable quickly began feuding with the ECW Originals â€“ wrestlers who had been part of the original ECW.
