The historicity of the war remains subject to scholarly discussions.[1] Attempts have been made to assign a historical date to the Kurukshetra War. Suggested dates range from 5561 to around 950 BCE, while popular tradition holds that the war marks the transition to Kaliyuga[citation needed] and thus dates it to 3102 BCE.
