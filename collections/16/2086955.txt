This episode got overwhelmingly positive reviews. Phoebe Reilly of Vulture wrote highly of the episode and called it "the best of the season so far."[18] James Poniewoznik of Time compared the episode and the season at large to the later work of The Beatles; he noted that, "after becoming known for a string of ambitious" entries, they both "decide[d] to take a step backward stylistically".[19] For this reason, he enjoyed "China", and opined that "The China plot, which thankfully focused less on Michael's craziness than his (and his coworkers') relationship with Oscar, demonstrated how well-drawn the show has been even when it comes to its more peripheral characters."[19] He also said the episode was "vintage Office."[19]
