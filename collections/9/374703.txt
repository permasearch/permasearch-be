The movie was filmed during the late summer and early fall 1984, early in Madonna's rise to popularity, and was intended to be an R-rated feature. After the success of her 1984â€“85 hits "Like a Virgin" and "Material Girl" from her Like a Virgin album, the film was trimmed in content by Orion Pictures to get a PG-13 rating in order to also market the film to Madonna's teenage fan base.[8]
