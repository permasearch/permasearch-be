The state is named for the Missouri River, which was named after the indigenous Missouri Indians, a Siouan-language tribe. They were called the ouemessourita (wimihsoorita[7]), meaning "those who have dugout canoes", by the Miami-Illinois language speakers. Also, assuming Missouri were deriving from the Siouan language, it would translate as "It connects to the side of it," in reference to the river itself.[8] As the Illini were the first natives encountered by Europeans in the region, the latter adopted the Illini name for the Missouri people.[9]
