Manga is said to originate from scrolls dating back to the 12th and 13th centuries. During the Edo period (1603-1867), another book of drawings, Toba Ehon, embedded the concept of manga.[6] The word first came into common usage in the late 18th century[7] with the publication of such works as Santō Kyōden's picturebook Shiji no yukikai (1798),[8][9] and in the early 19th century with such works as Aikawa Minwa's Manga hyakujo (1814) and the celebrated Hokusai Manga books (1814–1834) containing assorted drawings from the sketchbooks of the famous ukiyo-e artist Hokusai who lived from 1760–1849.[10] Rakuten Kitazawa (1876–1955) first used the word "manga" in the modern sense.[11]
