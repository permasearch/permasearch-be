In the spring and summer of 1998, Lipinski toured with Champions on Ice. She then toured with Stars on Ice for four seasons. Lipinski appealed to a younger audience, attracting new fans to what had traditionally been an adult-oriented show. Her signing to Stars on Ice was reported as a coup for the tour,[19] which at that time was doing well, with some performances routinely selling out months in advance.[20][21] Choreographer Sandra Bezic commented, "Tara reminds us why we're doing this â€“ the idealism, the genuine love of skating. There's a real sweetness there that makes us all go, 'Yeah, I remember'".[20] Lipinski generally received favorable reviews and was popular with fans, sometimes signing autographs for hours after each show.[22]
