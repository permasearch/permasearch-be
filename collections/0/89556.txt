When Nadal was 12, he won the Spanish and European tennis titles in his age group and was playing tennis and football all the time.[43] Nadal's father made him choose between football and tennis so that his school work would not deteriorate entirely. Nadal said: "I chose tennis. Football had to stop straight away."[43]
