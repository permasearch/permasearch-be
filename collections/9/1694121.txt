Garran's interpretation of section 41 was challenged in 1924 by Mitta Bullosh, a Melbourne resident Indian who had been accepted as a voter by Victoria but rejected by the Commonwealth. (The Commonwealth limitation also applied to native people of Asia, Africa and the Pacific Islands except New Zealand). He won his case in the District Court,[6] and the Commonwealth government later withdrew a High Court challenge to the judge's ruling.[7] The effect of the 1924 finding was that indigenous Australians in all states except Queensland and Western Australia could vote in federal polls.
