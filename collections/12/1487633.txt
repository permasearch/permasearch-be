The GT-R has frequently featured in head to head track comparisons against competing vehicles conducted by the automotive press. Fifth Gear tested the GT-R along with the Mitsubishi Evo FQ 400 in their short autototest agility track and their larger test track.

On the larger track the GT-R was 3 seconds a lap quicker than the Evo FQ 400. Autocar performed several head to head comparisons involving the GT-R and competing vehicles. In the first, against the Porsche 911 GT3 and BMW M3, the GT-R was declared to be faster around the test track.[55] A second test on the Isle of Man on a 4.5 km closed public road, featured with the Audi R8, Lotus Elise, and Lamborghini Gallardo LP560-4. The GT-R's time of 1:56.69 was behind the Gallardo's 1:55.99 time, however, because the GT-R was Japanese-spec, its top speed was limited to 112 mph, which led the journalists to believe it could have performed better.[56] In CAR Magazine's test with the 911 Turbo, BMW M3, and Audi R8 at Rockingham the GT-R was the fastest.[57] Evo tested the GT-R alongside the 911 GT3 at the Bedford Autodrome circuit, the GT-R ran a 1:21.7 lap time compared to GT3's 1:22.6 time.[58] In a Fifth Gear test with the 911 Turbo, Bruno Senna was able to achieve faster lap times in the GT-R.[59] Car and Driver compared the GT-R on Reno-Fernley Raceway with the 911 Turbo and BMW M3, the GT-R's lap time of 1:26.7 made it the fastest on the track.[60] Road & Track was able to achieve quick lap times with the car on Buttonwillow Raceway, clocking in at 1:56.9 which was over 5 seconds faster than the Chevrolet Corvette C6 Z06 and 911 Turbo.[61][62] In an Edmunds.com 6-way test on the Streets of Willow and an improvised mountain road, the GT-R posted faster times than the Audi R8 and Porsche 911 Carrera.[63] Auto Bild compared the GT-R with the 911 Turbo and V10 Audi R8 at Contidrome, the GT-R's time of 1:30.95 placed it ahead of both the Porsche 911 (1:31.75) and the Audi R8 (1:32.11).[64]
