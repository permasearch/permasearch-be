Having premiered in the small sixty-seat Royal Court Theatre, it quickly moved to larger venues in London, transferring to the 230-seat Chelsea Classic Cinema on Kings Road on 14 August 1973, before finding a quasi-permanent home at the 500-seat King's Road Theatre from 3 November 1973, running for six years.[13] The musical made its U.S. debut in Los Angeles in 1974 before being played in New York City as well as other cities.[11] Producer and Ode Records owner Lou Adler attended the London production in the winter of 1973, escorted by friend Britt Ekland. He immediately decided to purchase the U.S. theatrical rights. His production would be staged at his Roxy Theatre in L.A.[14] In 1975, The Rocky Horror Show premiered on Broadway at the 1,000-seat Belasco Theatre.[15]
