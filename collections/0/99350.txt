The United Kingdom does not have one specific constitutional document named as such. Instead, the so called constitution of the United Kingdom, or British constitution, is a sum of laws and principles that make up the country's body politic. This is sometimes referred to as an "unwritten" or uncodified constitution.[1][2] The British constitution primarily draws from four sources: statute law (laws passed by the legislature), common law (laws established through court judgments), parliamentary conventions, and works of authority.[1] Similar to an entirely written constitution, this sum also concerns both the relationship between the individual and the state and the functioning of the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary.
