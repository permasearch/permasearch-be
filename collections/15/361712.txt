Since the formation of the FA Premier League in 1992, only six football teams have won the title â€“ Manchester United, Blackburn Rovers, Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City and Leicester City. With 13 wins to their name, it is unsurprising that Manchester United players hold the top positions for being in title-winning sides.
