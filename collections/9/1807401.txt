Ronnie Scott and Steve Wolfe became her managers, songwriters and producers. "My! My! Honeycomb" was released as her debut single in April 1976, and failed to impact any charts worldwide. RCA increased their promotional efforts for the release of Tyler's second single, "Lost in France", arranging for her to meet with a party of journalists at a French chÃ¢teau.[8] The single had no immediate impact upon its release in September 1976, but became a Top 10 single by the end of the year.[9] Tyler's next single "More Than a Lover" was favoured by some critics, and she performed the song on the BBC's Top of the Pops on 31 March 1977.[10] The song peaked at number 27 in the UK.[9]
