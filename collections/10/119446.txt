Kevin Yeoman of Screen Rant felt the episode was "a drag" but assessed that Sasha's death served as the episode's highlight. He went further saying, "Her plan, to become a spring-loaded zombie in Negan’s coffin [...] worked like a charm and the episode’s technique of filling the frame with Sonequa Martin-Green’s face while she listened to some Donny Hathaway and reminisced about Abraham set the tone for her departure and suggested that even with the loss everything would be okay. Surprisingly, that’s where ‘The First Day of the Rest of Your Life’ excelled. At making one character’s death feel like it meant something after so many of them have increasingly felt like distractions from a go-nowhere plot. In the end, Sasha’s death also provided a necessary distraction, one that let Rick and his crew turn the tables on the duplicitous Jadis and her junkyard kids, and finally push back against the bully in the schoolyard. It’s just too bad the rest of the hour wasn’t as effective as losing Sasha."[11]
