The major weekly worship service occurs on Saturday, typically commencing with Sabbath School which is a structured time of small-group study at church. Adventists make use of an officially produced "Sabbath School Lesson", which deals with a particular biblical text or doctrine every quarter.[35] Special meetings are provided for children and youth in different age groups during this time (analogous to Sunday school in other churches).
