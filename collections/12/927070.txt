Despite initial debate, Petra inseminates herself via a turkey baster, putting her in a position of being in Rafael's life forever. The two are forced to put aside differences and work together through this pregnancy. Though, due to Petra being alone for the most part, she works to get Magda out of jail for pushing Alba down the stairs. Milos also returns again, forcing Petra to marry him, but he flees the country after his illegal operations are exposed. The two are presumably divorced. Petra works on bettering her relationship with Jane, but this is halted when Magda kills Ivan and the two are forced to bury the body. Magda sells Petra out to the police, giving her full blame, but Rafael helps Petra turn things around and get Magda re-incarcerated. Petra gives birth in the fourteenth episode of the season with Jane by her side, delivering twin girls that she and Rafael name "Anna" and "Elsa", Jane being the only one to pick up on the reference. Petra begins to suffer from postpartum depression, not knowing how to be a mother, and she considers running away. She backs out of this at the last minute though, just in time for her twin sister Anezka to show up at her door. Petra takes Anezka in, learning Magda kept Petra over Anezka because she was the "prettier one". Petra embraces having a sister because it means having her own little family, but it turns out that Anezka has been working with Magda all along. In the finale, Anezka injects Petra with something that paralyzes her and she takes her place, going on to have sex with Rafael.
