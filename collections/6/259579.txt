Carla soon strikes up a friendship with Anna herself. On a visit to the Wolek apartment, Clara runs into Sadie. It is abruptly revealed that "Clara Benari" is Carla Gray, who had not died but run away from home at an early age. Sadie is furious to learn that her daughter was pretending to be white, and Carla herself is mortified â€” but not enough to end her ruse there and then. Although heartbroken, Sadie does not reveal her daughter's secret.
