Where the Prime Minister's remuneration was concerned, the Committee recommended that it be pegged to twice of a MR4-grade minister's salary and doing away with the fixed service bonus. Instead, the Prime Minister will receive a larger national bonus. His annual bonus where the targets for the indicators have been met will be six months' salary, and 12 months' salary where they have been greatly exceeded.[84] This will lead to a reduction in the Prime Minister's annual salary of 28% to $2.2 million (about US$1.7 million).[85] Lee Hsien Loong said that he accepted the Committee's recommendations. He remains the best-paid head of government in the world, his proposed annual pay package exceeding that of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong Donald Tsang, the political leader with the second-highest salary in the world (around US$550,000), by about three times; and that of the President of the United States Barack Obama (US$400,000)[86] by over four times.[87]
