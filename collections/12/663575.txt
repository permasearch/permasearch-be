Hawking rarely discussed his illness and physical challenges, even – in a precedent set during their courtship – with Jane.[217] His disabilities meant that the responsibilities of home and family rested firmly on his wife's increasingly overwhelmed shoulders, leaving him more time to think about physics.[218] Upon his appointment in 1974 to a year-long position at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, Jane proposed that a graduate or post-doctoral student live with them and help with his care. Hawking accepted, and Bernard Carr travelled with them as the first of many students who fulfilled this role.[219][220] The family spent a generally happy and stimulating year in Pasadena.[221]
