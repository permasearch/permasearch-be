After beginning D.Gray-man, Hoshino considered continuing to use the name Zone and also contemplated naming the series Dolls or Black Noah. She chose "D.Gray-man" for its several meanings, most referring to the state of Allen and the other main characters.[12] Although the title's meaning was not completely explained, Hoshino said that the "D" stands for "dear".[13] According to the author, she got most of her ideas for the series while sleeping in her bathtub for six hours.[14] One exception was the second-volume plot, based on a Noh story entitled "Koi no Omoni".[15]
