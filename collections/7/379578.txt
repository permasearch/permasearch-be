After graduating from Strathcona High School in Edmonton in 2008, he became a backer. After that, he moved to Vancouver.[12][13] Living in the Killarney neighbourhood, he released a self-produced album, Heat Wave, as a part of the garage-noise/punk rock project Makeout Videotape in 2009. The album sold out its 500-unit run.[14] DeMarco worked on "psychedelic" video projects during this time.[13] He was joined by Alex Calder and Jen Clement, signed to Unfamiliar Records, and toured with Vancouver band Japandroids in 2009.[13] In 2011, DeMarco moved from Vancouver to Montreal to begin recording as a solo artist. Failing to find work as a musician, he participated in medical experiments for money[15] and worked on a road paving crew.[16] On January 9, 2012, record label Captured Tracks announced the signing of DeMarco.[17] In early 2012, he released a mini-LP titled Rock and Roll Night Club. The four-track-recorded album features skits and slowed-down vocals.[15] It impressed his new label enough that they agreed to release a full-length follow-up album.[15] This release, entitled 2, was received well by critics, garnering a "Best New Music" designation from Pitchfork.[18] One of his songs, "Moving Like Mike",[19] was licensed by U.S. retail outlet Target for a commercial.[15]
