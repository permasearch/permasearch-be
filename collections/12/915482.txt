Whitney Houston was born on August 9, 1963, in what was then a middle-income neighborhood in Newark, New Jersey.[12] She was the daughter of Army serviceman and entertainment executive John Russell Houston, Jr. (September 13, 1920 – February 2, 2003), and gospel singer Emily "Cissy" (Drinkard) Houston.[13] Her elder brother Michael is a singer, and her elder half-brother is former basketball player Gary Garland.[14][15] Her parents were both African American. Through her mother, Houston was a first cousin of singers Dionne Warwick and Dee Dee Warwick. Her godmother was Darlene Love[16] and her honorary aunt was Aretha Franklin,[17][18] whom she met at age 8 or 9 when her mother took her to a recording studio.[19] Houston was raised a Baptist, but was also exposed to the Pentecostal church. After the 1967 Newark riots, the family moved to a middle-class area in East Orange, New Jersey, when she was four.[20] Her parents' marriage later ended in divorce.[21]
