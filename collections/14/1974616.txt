In June 1990 an ATF agent, Byerly, attempted to use the sawed-off shotgun charge as leverage to get Weaver to act as an informant for his investigation into the Aryan Nations.[18] When Weaver refused to become "a snitch", the ATF filed the gun charges in June 1990, also claiming Weaver was a bank robber with criminal convictions[25] (those claims were false: at that time Weaver had no criminal record, and the subsequent Senate investigation found: "Weaver was not a suspect in any bank robberies."[26]) A federal grand jury later indicted him in December 1990 for making and possessing, but not for selling, illegal weapons in October 1989.[27]
