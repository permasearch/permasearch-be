The second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy can never decrease over time for an isolated system, meaning - a system which neither energy nor matter can enter or leave. The total entropy can remain constant in ideal cases where the system is in a steady state (equilibrium), or undergoing a reversible process. In all other real cases, the total entropy always increases and the process is irreversible. The increase in entropy accounts for the irreversibility of natural processes, and the asymmetry between future and past.
