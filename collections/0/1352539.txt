In 1952 the most popular version was recorded by The Four Aces. Their recording was released by Decca Records.[3] It first reached the Billboard magazine Best Seller chart on December 28, 1951, and lasted 7 weeks on the chart, peaking at number 14.[4] The flip side, "Tell Me Why," was an even bigger hit for the Aces, reaching number 2 on the chart. The same recording of "A Garden in the Rain"/"Tell Me Why" was also released in the United Kingdom by Brunswick Records in 1952.[5]
