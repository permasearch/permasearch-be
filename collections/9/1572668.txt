The active site, or ATP-binding site, of all kinases is a cleft between a small amino-terminal lobe and a larger carboxy-terminal lobe.[1] The structure of human Cdk2 revealed that CDKs have a modified ATP-binding site that can be regulated by cyclin binding.[1] Phosphorylation by CDK-activating kinase (CAK) at Thr 161 on the T-loop increases the complex activity. Without cyclin, a flexible loop called the activation loop or T-loop blocks the cleft, and the position of several key amino acid residues is not optimal for ATP-binding.[1] With cyclin, two alpha helices change position to permit ATP binding. One of them, the L12 helix that comes just before the T-loop in the primary sequence, becomes a beta strand and helps rearrange the T-loop, so it no longer blocks the active site.[1] The other alpha helix called the PSTAIRE helix rearranges and helps change the position of the key amino acid residues in the active site.[1]
