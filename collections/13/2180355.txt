In Moore's paper "Gedanken-experiments on Sequential Machines",[1] the     ( n ; m ; p )   {\displaystyle (n;m;p)}   automata (or machines)     S   {\displaystyle S}   are defined as having     n   {\displaystyle n}   states,     m   {\displaystyle m}   input symbols and     p   {\displaystyle p}   output symbols. Nine theorems are proved about the structure of     S   {\displaystyle S}  , and experiments with     S   {\displaystyle S}  . Later, "    S   {\displaystyle S}   machines" became known as "Moore machines".
