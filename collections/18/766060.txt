According to both Bronkhorst and Anderson, the Four Noble Truths became a substitution for prajna, or "liberating insight", in the suttas[394][395] in those texts where "liberating insight" was preceded by the four jhƒÅnas.[396] The four truths may not have been formulated in earliest Buddhism, and did not serve in earliest Buddhism as a description of "liberating insight".[397] Gotama's teachings may have been personal, "adjusted to the need of each person."[396]
