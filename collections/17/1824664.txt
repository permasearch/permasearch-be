Since "A Change in Me" was introduced four years into Beauty and the Beast's run,[8] the song has not yet been included on any official English-language cast albums.[45] However, it has been recorded for the 2005 Manila, 2008 Madrid and 2009 Barcelona original cast recordings of the musical by various actresses in their native languages.[46] It has since been covered by several artists. Actress Susan Egan, who originated the role of Belle when the show premiered in 1994, had already long left the production by the time "A Change in Me" was introduced. She covered the song for her debut studio album So Far in 2002.[47][48] Arranged and produced by Craig Barna, Egan's version of "A Change in Me" was the first English-language studio recording of the song.[49]
