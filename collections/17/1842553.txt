Recorded at The Farm in Delaware County, New York by Matthew Cullen and Andris Balins, Kemp Muhl stated in an interview[26] to support the album: “Midnight Sun we consider our first real record, it's the one we spent the most time on. We brought in Dave Fridmann (Tame Impala, Flaming Lips, Mercury Rev, MGMT) to mix it and that made a huge difference. Everything else we did ourselves.”
