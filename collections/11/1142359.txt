The game was referred to as a "social media phenomenon" which has brought people together from all walks of life.[172][173] 231 million people engaged in 1.1 billion interactions that mentioned Pokémon Go on Facebook and Instagram in the month of July.[174] Numerous media outlets referred to the surge in popularity as "Pokémon Go Mania", or simply "Pokémania".[175][176] The massive popularity of the game resulted in several unusual positive effects. For example, the game enabled players to help catch criminals and to report crimes in progress,[177][178][179][180] and has even aided law enforcement's community relations,[181] albeit with caveats.[182] Businesses also benefited from the nearby presence of PokéStops (or them being PokéStops themselves) with the concomitant influx of people,[183][184][185] and the intense exploration of communities has brought local history to the forefront.[186] The game was also seen bringing its players to places of worship, as many Pokégyms are located there.[187] Despite some criticism by religious leaders, this was received positively by religious groups, who saw it as reminding adherents to come and pray.[188] Some establishments considered purchasing lures in the game to attract additional players to PokéStops on their property.[189] Within a week of its release, a secondary market emerged for the game, both for the resell of high-level accounts on Craigslist and PlayerUp, and for the sale of expert advice on Thumbtack.[190][191] Wireless provider T-Mobile US started an offer for free data for a year for Pokémon Go sessions,[192][193] and Yelp added a filter that only shows businesses which have a PokéStop nearby.[194][195] National parks across the United States saw an influx of visitors due to the game, with "hundreds or thousands" of people visiting the National Mall and Memorial Parks in Washington, D.C. on the weekend following Pokémon Go's release in the country.[196] Small museums with PokéStops placed at exhibits also reported increased attendance, such as the McNay Art Museum in San Antonio, Texas, and the Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens in Boca Raton, Florida.[189] Charity organizations also sought engagement from players, with animal shelters offering dog walks to people who want to hatch eggs.[197]
