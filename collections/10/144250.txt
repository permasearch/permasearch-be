The Advocate's Nico Lang described Vause as a notably popular femme fatale character, whom the show brought back after the second season "despite the fact that the real-life character was barely in [Kerman's memoir] at all".[55] Charlotte Richardson Andrews wrote in Sight & Sound that Vause is one of the show's "believable and investment-worthy" queer characters, adding that the "tangled, romantic dance that [Vause and Chapman] do is compelling, nuanced and sexy where, in other hands, it might have felt exploitative".[56] In Digital Spy, Emma Dibdin described a "power shift" in the third season between Vause and Chapman and how this positively impacts both characters; "the power dynamic of [Chapman] and [Vause's] relationship is so dramatically shifted that everything about them feels fresh. [Vause] is more vulnerable than we've ever seen her, utterly shattered to find herself back in jail."[22] The Observer's Orly Greenberg said Vause returns to Litchfield "completely absent of her flashing eyes and snarky confidence, instead relying on [Chapman] as an almost maternal figure" as Chapman leads Vause to believe her return to prison is a product of "the system", rather than Chapman's own doing.[57] Emily Ambash of CutPrintFilm wrote that Vause is "emotionally broken" when she reenters prison; "embarrassed and ashamed of her own choices" and her failure in handling her brief freedom. Vause and Chapman's dynamic in the third season feels "fresh", different from the first season, as they confront their issues in the present without passive aggressiveness and without a focus on the past, Ambash noted; "the characters [are forced to] question their faith not just in each other but also in themselves when dealing with each other."[58] Michael Hindle of Comingsoon.net observed of Vause and Chapman's relationship, while "one has always had power over the other in some form or another now [Vause and Chapman] are more or less on an even playing field".[59] Joshua Alston of The A.V Club said that Vause's return to prison "lands with a surprisingly soft impact". The character Stella "appears right on time to drive a wedge between [Chapman] and [Vause] just as a functional relationship becomes possible", and the show "manages to make [the looming love triangle] feel consequential."[60]
