Brookings traces its history back to 1916 and has contributed to the creation of the United Nations, the Marshall Plan, and the Congressional Budget Office, as well as to the development of influential policies for deregulation, broad-based tax reform, welfare reform, and foreign aid.[58] The annual think tank index published by Foreign Policy ranks it the number one think tank in the U.S.[59] and the Global Go To Think Tank Index believes it is the number one such tank in the world.[60] Moreover, in spite of an overall decline in the number of times information or opinions developed by think tanks are referred to by the U.S. media, of the 200 most prominent think tanks in the U.S., the Brookings Institution's research remains the most frequently cited.[61][62]
