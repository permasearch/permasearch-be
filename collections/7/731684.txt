In November 2015, it was reported that Scott was working on a gospel album.[8] On April 22, 2016, she posted a handwritten note online about the project. In the note she expressed her excitement about it, announced the album's title, Love Remains and formally introduced "Hillary Scott & the Scott Family". On why making a gospel album she explains, "Well, I wanted to make this album to share more of who I am. These songs, and many like them are the cry of my heart. I have been singing songs like this my whole my life whether it be in church, with family and friends gathered around with guitars on my screened porch, rocking my baby girl to sleep or while holding the hand of a dying loved one." It features her parents Linda Davis and Lang Scott, and her little sister Rylee.[9][10] The lead single "Thy Will" was released on April 22, 2016.[11] It will feature original material and gospel standards. Scott penned the newer material with her family, and Ricky Skaggs will be the producer for the album.[8] Love Remains won Best Contemporary Christian Album and "Thy Will" won Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song.[12]
