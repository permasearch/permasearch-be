Photographic comparisons gathered on the first and second flag-raising which were made public in November 2014 by Eric Krelle, a history buff and collector of World War II-era Marine Corps memorabilia, strongly suggested that John Bradley was not one of the actual six flag raisers.[58] According to this research, Franklin Sousley was in the fourth position (left to right) instead of Bradley, and Harold Schultz of Los Angeles (originally from Detroit) was in the second position, previously attributed to Franklin Sousley.[58] Initially, Marine Corps historians and officials and others were not willing to accept these findings.[59] On May 2, 2016, the Marine Corps announced that it was investigating the possibility that Bradley was not one of the flag raisers and Schultz was, a fact they confirmed on June 23, 2016.[60] James Bradley has also subsequently stated that he no longer believes that his father was one of the six men in the Rosenthal photograph.[61][62][63]
