After Stan stays up all night watching Ellen make a fool of herself, he falls asleep, forgetting to turn off the computer. Avery, Tyler, and Chloe look at the computer, finding out that Stan blogs. Meanwhile, Bennett tells Ellen the big news about his book being published. Bennett keeps bragging about how weird his publisher eats, and Stan mistakenly tells Bennett's publisher about it, which gets Bennett's publisher to quit writing Bennett's books. Bennett says if he does not get the publisher back, then they'll lose their home, so Stan writes that he'll stop blogging and talking to Bennett's publisher, even if it means he has to give up his secret, but the publisher had eye surgery and cannot see. Avery, Tyler, and Chloe try to stop Stan; Bennett's publisher hears them talking to Stan, but thinks they are talking to him; he then thanks the children and rehires himself.
