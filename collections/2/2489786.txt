The Victoria sponge, also known as the Victoria sandwich or Victorian cake,[12] was named after Queen Victoria, who was known to enjoy a slice of the sponge cake with her afternoon tea. The sponge part evolved from the classic pound cake â€“ equal quantities of butter, sugar, eggs and flour. The difference was the Victorian creation of baking powder, which was discovered by English food manufacturer Alfred Bird in 1843, which enabled the sponge to rise higher.[13][14] This invention, writes cookery author Felicity Cloake, "was celebrated with a patriotic cake", Victoria sponge.[13]
