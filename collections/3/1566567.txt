In pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon England, legends and other stories were transmitted orally instead of being written down; it is for this reason that very few survive today.[130] In both Beowulf and Deor's Lament there are references to the mythological smith Weyland, and this figure also makes an appearance on the Franks Casket.[131] There are moreover two place-names recorded in tenth century charters that include Weyland's name.[132] This entity's mythological stories are better fleshed out in Norse stories.[133]
