Later, after a bad business venture that brings a lawsuit, there is tension between Logan and Rory until Logan quits working for his father. Logan apologizes to Rory for neglecting her and his work. They go to Stars Hollow, and Lorelai finally appears to accept their relationship. In season 7, Logan asks Lorelai's permission to ask Rory to marry him. Logan proposes to Rory in the next episode, but Rory, caught by surprise, asks for time to think. Logan makes the offer one last time in the penultimate episode, at Rory's graduation from Yale, saying it's all or nothing. Rory rejects the offer, saying that even though she loves him, she wants a wide-open future. Logan takes the ring back, and walks off after that. Logan does not appear in the final episode, and the series ends with them still broken up.
