Most Filipinos colloquially refer to McDonald's as "McDo" (equivalent to "Mickey D's"), and the term has been adapted by McDonald's Philippines, even naming most of their products after the term. Menu items in McDonald's in the Philippines include McSpaghetti, Chicken McDo, Burger McDo and Crispy Chicken Sandwich, in order to compete with the country's largest fast food retail Jollibee. From 2001 to 2006 the McRice, steamed rice formed into buns, was available as a replacement for bread buns on beef and chicken sandwiches.[36] Breakfast menus include longaniza, a Philippine sausage, served with rice and a fried egg, and the Hamdesal, a Pandesal bun with pineapple glaze syrup, mayonnaise, and Canadian bacon served with scrambled eggs, cheese, or both.
