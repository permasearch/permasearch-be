Many of the twenty-one countries listed here typically have had a long-standing agreement with a former occupying country; one example is the agreement between Monaco and France, which has existed for at least 300 years.[4][5] The Compact of Free Association nations of the Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), and Palau rely on the United States for their defense.  They ensure their national security concerns are addressed through annual Joint Committee Meetings to discuss defense matters with US Pacific Command.  Andorra has a small army, and can request defensive aid if necessary,[6][7] while Iceland had a unique agreement with the United States that lasted until 2006, which required them to provide defense to Iceland when needed.[8][9]
