The first offensive play from scrimmage in the 2016 game resulted in a Utah pick-six. However, Utah turned the ball over several times, which led to two BYU fields goals and a touchdown late in the 2nd Quarter. Utah answered with a touchdown of their own and held a slim 14–13 lead as the teams headed into the locker rooms for halftime. After a field goal in the third quarter, Utah led 17–13 as it used most of the time in the fourth on a 19-play drive that eventually stalled inside the ten yard line of BYU. The choice to kick the field goal left BYU with one chance to overcome the 20–13 deficit with 2:47 to go. BYU drove for a touchdown with 18 seconds to play. Rather than kick the PAT to make it 20–20, BYU first year coach Kalani Sitake decided to go for the two point conversion and the win. Quarterback Taysom Hill ran the ball up the middle on a draw, but got nowhere as Utah defenders stuffed him at the three-yard line and preserved the Utah victory, 20–19.
