Herschel returned to England in 1838, was created a baronet, of Slough in the County of Buckingham,[2] and published Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope in 1847. In this publication he proposed the names still used today for the seven then-known satellites of Saturn: Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Titan, and Iapetus.[19] In the same year, Herschel received his second Copley Medal from the Royal Society for this work.  A few years later, in 1852, he proposed the names still used today for the four then-known satellites of Uranus: Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon.
