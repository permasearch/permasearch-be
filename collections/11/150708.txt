Jefferson Middle School is a middle school near P.S. 38 and is the school's sister institution. The middle school's kids are the rivals of PS.38's kids and beat them in almost everything. PS. 38 only beat Jefferson in the 'Snowdown'. Jefferson lost, even though they cheated by packing snow around the spare knight statue.
