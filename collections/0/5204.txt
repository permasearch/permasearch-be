A common procedure is that after the cards have been shuffled, the dealer sets the cards face-down on the table near the player designated to make the cut, typically the player to the dealer's right. That player initiates a cut of the deck by taking a contiguous range of cards off the top of the deck and placing it face-down on the table closer to the dealer; the dealer completes the cut by taking the original bottom portion of the deck and placing it on top of the just-moved cards.[1] Once the cut is complete, the dealer picks up the deck, straightens or "squares" it, and deals the cards.
