Samuel Morse received a Turkish patent for the telegraph in 1847, which was issued by Sultan Abdülmecid who personally tested the new invention.[94] Following this successful test, work on the first Turkish telegraph line (Istanbul-Edirne-Şumnu)[95] began on 9 August 1847.[96] The reformist period peaked with the Constitution, called the Kanûn-u Esâsî. The empire's First Constitutional era was short-lived. The parliament survived for only two years before the sultan suspended it.
