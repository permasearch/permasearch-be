A number of these alleys have no names and some have whimsical names such as “Sal si puedes” (Exit if you can).[15] Another famous alley is the Callejon Oacuten, through which Ignacio Allende and Miguel Hidalgo entered with their army in 1810.[11] One alley near the State Government Palace is called the Callejón de la Condesa (Alley of the Countess). The name comes from the lady of one of the mansions who lived there in the very late 18th and very early 19th centuries. Ashamed of her husband’s bad reputation with other women, before and after the marriage, the Countess began to enter and leave her home through the back door into this alley to avoid the glances of the townspeople.[15]
