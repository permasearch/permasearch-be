During the 1780s, Spain had sought to slow the expansion of the U.S. and lure American settlers into secession from the United States.[63] Washington feared that Spain (as well as Britain) might successfully incite insurrection against the U.S. if he failed to open trade on the Mississippi, and he sent envoy Thomas Pinckney to Spain with that goal in mind.[64] Fearing that the United States and Great Britain might unite to take Spanish territory, Spain decided to seek accommodation with the United States.[65] The two parties signed the Treaty of San Lorenzo in 1795, establishing intentions of friendship between the United States and Spain.[66] The United States and Spain agreed not to incite native tribes to warfare. The western boundary of the United States was established along the Mississippi River from the northern boundary of the United States to the 31st degree north latitude,[66] while the southern boundary of the United States was established on the 31st parallel north.[67] The disputed territory that Spain dropped its claims to would be organized into the Mississippi Territory in 1798.[68]
