Located at 1 Mount Pleasant Road / 1 Ted Rogers Way (formerly 777 Jarvis Street), the complex occupies almost all of the block bounded by Jarvis, Bloor, Huntley and Isabella Streets. Mount Pleasant Road divides the northwest corner of the block from the remainder of the site, but Rogers occupies separate buildings on both sides of Mount Pleasant which are connected by a bridge and an underground tunnel. Collectively all of the interconnected buildings (in addition to nearby buildings at 333 and 350 Bloor Street) are referred to as the Rogers Campus.[citation needed]
