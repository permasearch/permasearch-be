The band was formed in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1965 by their leader, Robert Walter "Bo" Donaldson. They were first discovered while touring with The Osmonds in the early 1970s and signed with Family Productions, releasing their first single in 1972, "Special Someone," but their big break came after moving to ABC Records and working with the record producer Steve Barri in 1973. Although their first single with ABC, "Deeper and Deeper," failed to make a big impression on the charts,[1] beginning in 1974, the band began a string of hit songs. Their first two (and largest two) hits were cover versions of British hit songs whose original versions had not been hits in the U.S.: "Billy Don't Be A Hero" (a cover of a #1 UK Paper Lace song that reached #1 for 2 weeks on the Hot 100 with the Heywoods's version) and "Who Do You Think You Are" (written by Clive Scott & Des Dyer of Jigsaw, which originally became a hit for Candlewick Green and reached #15 on the Hot 100 with the Heywoods's version). This was followed by their last top-40 hit, "The Heartbreak Kid" (# 39 Hot 100), and their ominously titled last Hot 100 hit, "Our Last Song Together" (#95 on the Hot 100, the last song written by the Sedaka-Greenfield tandem before its breakup). "Billy Don't Be A Hero" sold over three and a half million copies, receiving a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. in June 1974.[1]
