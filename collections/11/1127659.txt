During a nine-month period in 1842â€“43, Lovelace translated the Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea's article on Babbage's newest proposed machine, the Analytical Engine. With the article, she appended a set of notes.[57] Explaining the Analytical Engine's function was a difficult task, as even many other scientists did not really grasp the concept and the British establishment was uninterested in it.[58] Lovelace's notes even had to explain how the Analytical Engine differed from the original Difference Engine.[59] Her work was well received at the time; the scientist Michael Faraday described himself as a supporter of her writing.[60]
