When Ish attempts to trick the Anticorians and later rejects joining the villains' side, the Anticorians fit him with an Anticorian Cuff, a device that allows Sudden Death to control Ish's mind and actions. They send Ish out to steal the Detroit Lions Megacore. The rest of the Guardians confront him, and are nearly defeated, as they discover the Anticorian Blitz Borgz can drain their powers. Ricky also overhears the Anticorians' plan: steal the 32 Megacores for Sudden Death before the next solar alignment or risk being trapped on Earth forever. While the Guardians retreat to recharge, RZ 6.0 issues an NFL Rush Zone Red Alert that Ish must be stopped. Ricky takes it upon himself to confront the Anticorians and Blitz Borgz with the Shrink Ray received from Ish earlier that returns the Blitz Borgs to their capsule form. With Detroit Lions Wide Receiver Calvin Johnson's help and reverse encouragement from Sudden Death's harsh words, Ish is able to find his inner strength and partially recovers his Guardian powers long enough to escape Sudden Death, and retrieve the stolen Megacores. The Guardians welcome Ish back, and get a glimpse of his new enhanced powers, if only he can find a way to make them permanent.
