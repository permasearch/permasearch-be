Many argue that product placement is ethically questionable, because it manipulates them against their will.[138][182][183][184] A contrary view is, even if product placement is only perceived unconsciously, it is still evaluated by our mind.[185][186] It cannot make people act against their beliefs. Most people also appreciate the fact, that movies look more realistic with real brands and do not feel disturbed by the placements.[187][188] Additionally, further research argues that product placement is not any different from other marketing tactics when it comes to ethics.[147]
