A key design element is the use of brick.[18] The masonry resembles patterns popular in the Southeast.[18] Braves executive vice president of sales and marketing Derek Schiller says the masonry gives the ballpark’s exterior a look of “timelessness.”[18] In addition, the Braves decided to use pre-cast stone.[18] Schiller said “It looks custom hand-laid. It’s at all of the entryways. It brings the whole scale of the brick way down.”[18] According to Schiller, by designing breaks in the masonry like porches, canopies, varying angles and trellises, “it not only creates shade, it also warms the architecture and gives it a different scale.”[18]
