After Captain America leads Hydra's takeover of Earth as part of the "Secret Empire" storyline, Hawkeye is one of the leaders for the few free heroes left on Earth (others are either trapped outside Earth's atmosphere, trapped in New York behind a Darkforce shield, or working with Hydra).[109] After Rick Jones is able to send information to the heroes revealing that Captain America has been "brainwashed" by the Cosmic Cube Kobik to believe that he has been a Hydra agent since childhood, Hawkeye is one of the heroes favoring the idea that they can recover the fragmented cube and use it to restore Rogers to normal, in opposition to the Black Widow's plan to just kill Rogers and stop him.[110] Despite their opposing viewpoints, Hawkeye falls back in love with Black Widow and is devastated by her supposed death at the hands of the evil Steve Rogers.[111]
