Determined to see grandchildren, the King organizes a ball for Prince Charming in an effort to cause his son to fall in love and marry, with every eligible maiden in the kingdom ordered to attend. At the ball, Prince Charming rejects every girl, until he sees Cinderella, with whom he is immediately smitten in love. The two dance throughout the castle grounds until the clock starts to chime midnight and Cinderella flees away from the castle, accidentally dropping one of her glass slippers. Prince Charming picks up the glass slipper and the next day a royal proclamation is issued, stating the Grand Duke will visit every house in the kingdom to find the girl who fits the glass slipper, so that she can be married to Prince Charming. After the slipper perfectly fits onto Cinderella's foot, Prince Charming marries her.
