In 2011, additional background checks were imposed on the nationals of Iraq.[35] Foreigners who were nationals of those countries, or who had visited those countries since 2011, were required to obtain a visa to enter the United States, even if they were nationals or dual nationals of the 38 countries participating in the Visa Waiver Program.[36] A few months after the original travel ban a revised ban was signed and Iraq was removed from the list of countries in part due to criticism that the original order overlooked the countryâ€™s role in fighting Islamic terrorism and barred entry even to the Iraqi interpreters who had been embedded with US forces in the region.[37]
