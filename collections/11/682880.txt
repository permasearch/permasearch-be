The Russian government said special attention would be paid to security at upcoming international sports events in Russia, including the 2014 Winter Olympics.[318] According to the Russian embassy in the U.S., President Vladimir Putin condemned the bombing as a "barbaric crime" and "stressed that the Russian Federation will be ready, if necessary, to assist in the U.S. authorities' investigation."[319] He urged closer cooperation of security services with Western partners[320] but other Russian authorities and mass media blamed the U.S. authorities for negligence as they warned the US of the Tsarnaevs.[321] Moreover Russian authorities and mass media since the spring of 2014 blame USA for politically motivated false information about lack of response from Russian authorities after subsequent U.S. requests.[citation needed] As proof a letter from the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) was shown to the members of an official U.S. Congressional delegation to Moscow during their visit. This letter with information about Tsarnaev (including his biography details, connections and phone number) had been sent from FSB to FBI and CIA during March 2011.[322]
