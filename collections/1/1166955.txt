In October 2017, the Seven Network announced they acquired production rights for 2018.[2] A sequel series, possibly titled The Blake Mysteries is proposed by the Seven Network and supported by Screen Australia. The series would open with a telemovie, similar in length to the finale that closed the five seasons of The Doctor Blake Mysteries.[4] Although lead actor Craig McLachlan was cleared of sexual harassment charges, he and his character will not be part of the plots of the sequel, which will begin three years after the end of the present series, and is expected to include the regular characters of the present cast.[4] The plots of four telemovies will see Doctor Lucien Blake disappear in mysterious circumstances, with his new bride Jean Beazley to take on a more central role.[5]
