Economics was not on Nobel's original list of prize disciplines. The Bank of Sweden created it in 1969. Although it is governed by the same rules as the others, many, including members of the Nobel Family, criticized this prize for violating Nobel's intent. As of 2010[update], the faculty of the University of Chicago had garnered nine Prizesâ€”far more than any other university. This led to claims of bias against alternative or heterodox economics.[who?]
