Left Behind is a series of 16 best-selling religious novels by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, dealing with Christian dispensationalist End Times: the pretribulation, premillennial, Christian eschatological interpretation of the Biblical apocalypse. The primary conflict of the series is the members of the Tribulation Force, an underground network of converts, against an NWO-esque organization, Global Community, and its leader Nicolae Carpathia—the Antichrist. Left Behind is also the title of the first book in the series. The series was first published between 1995–2007 by Tyndale House, a firm with a history of interest in dispensationalism.
