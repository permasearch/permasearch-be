Liquidity is defined formally in many accounting regimes and has in recent years been more strictly defined.  For instance, the US Federal Reserve intends to apply quantitative liquidity requirements based on Basel III liquidity rules as of fiscal 2012.[5][6]  Bank directors will also be required to know of, and approve, major liquidity risks personally.  Other rules require diversifying counterparty risk and portfolio stress testing against extreme scenarios, which tend to identify unusual market liquidity conditions and avoid investments that are particularly vulnerable to sudden liquidity shifts.
