Sexual harassment by strangers, as with any type of harassment, has been a notoriously difficult crime to prove, as perpetrators often devise discreet ways to harass women, although Eve teasing usually occurs in public spaces and streets and on public transport.[13] Some guidebooks to the region warn female tourists to avoid attracting the attention of these kinds of men by wearing conservative clothing.[14][15] However, this harassment is reported both by Indian women and by conservatively dressed foreign women.[16]
