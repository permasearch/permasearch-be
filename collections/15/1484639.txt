Mt. Ararat is featured prominently in Armenian literature. According to MelinÃ© Karakashian, Armenian poets "attribute to it symbolic meanings of unity, freedom, and independence."[155] According to Kevork Bardakjian, in Armenian literature, Ararat "epitomizes Armenia and Armenian suffering and aspirations, especially the consequences of the 1915 genocide: almost total annihilation, loss of a unique culture and land [...] and an implicit determination never to recognize the new political borders."[156]
