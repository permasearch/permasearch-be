Organized groups began to emerge in the mid 20th century, including the Ophite Cultus Satanas (1948)[78] and The Church of Satan (1966). After seeing Margaret Murray's book The God of the Witches the leader of Ophite Cultus Satanas, Herbert Arthur Sloane, said he realized that the horned god was Satan (Sathanas). Sloane also corresponded with his contemporary Gerald Gardner, founder of the Wicca religion, and implied that his views of Satan and the horned god were not necessarily in conflict with Gardner's approach. However, he did believe that, while "gnosis" referred to knowledge, and "Wicca" referred to wisdom, modern witches had fallen away from the true knowledge, and instead had begun worshipping a fertility god, a reflection of the creator god. He wrote that "the largest existing body of witches who are true Satanists would be the Yezedees". Sloane highly recommended the book The Gnostic Religion, and sections of it were sometimes read at ceremonies.[79] It was estimated that there were up to 100,000 Satanists worldwide by 2006, twice the number estimated in 1990.[80] Satanistic beliefs have been largely permitted as a valid expression of religious belief in the West. For example, they were allowed in the British Royal Navy in 2004,[81][82][83] and an appeal was considered in 2005 for religious status as a right of prisoners by the Supreme Court of the United States.[84][85] Contemporary Satanism is mainly an American phenomenon,[86] although it began to reach Eastern Europe in the 1990s around the time of the fall of the Soviet Union.[87][88]
