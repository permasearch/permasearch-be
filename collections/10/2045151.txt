When GTA V was released on PC, the question of breakthrough of new mods depended on production of new GTA-specific tools for modification. While GTA IV is one of the games with most fan made mods,[17] GTA V modders had difficulties creating mods until completely new tools were made.[5][18] One of the most notable tools that initiated significant GTA V modification is OpenIV which provided database manipulation.[19] Many mods had compatibility issues with every new GTA V update patch.[20]
