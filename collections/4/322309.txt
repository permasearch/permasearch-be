The Blair Witch Project premiered on January 25, 1999 at the Sundance Film Festival, and had a limited release on July 14 before going wide on July 30 after months of publicity, including a campaign by the studio to use the Internet and suggest that the film was "a record of real events". The distribution strategy for the film was created and implemented by Artisan studio executive Steven Rothenberg.[35][36] The film earned $1,512,054 in its limited release opening weekend.[2] The film went on to gross $29,207,381 from 1,101 locations and placed at number two in the United States box office third opening weekend, surpassing the science fiction horror film Deep Blue Sea which cleared $19,107,643 weekend gross.[37] The film secured its second place in its fourth weekend, behind another horror film The Sixth Sense, which cleared $26,681,262.[38] The film descended at number three in its fifth weekend,[39] at number five in its sixth weekend,[40] and number eight in its seventh and eighth weekend during Labor Day.[41][42] The film dropped out of the top-ten list in its tenth weekend until its last screening in 107 theaters in its seventeenth weekend, grossing $28,866 and placing in number sixty-three.[43][44] By the end of its theatrical run, the film grossed $140,539,099 in the US and Canada in its total screening and produced $108,100,000 in other territories, having an overall gross of $248,639,099 (over 4,000 times its original budget).[2][19] The Blair Witch Project was the tenth highest-grossing film in the US in 1999,[45] and has since earned the reputation of becoming a sleeper hit.[46]
