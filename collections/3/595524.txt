In one of the hadith Muhammad supposedly said, "I leave among you two things of high estimation: the Book of God and my Family."[11] Some scholars argue that this provides evidence that the Quran had been collected and written during this time because it is not correct to call something al-kitab (book) when it is merely in the [people's] memories. The word al-kitab signifies a single and united entity and does not apply to a text which is scattered and not collected.[12]
