Ham wrote the song about his mixed feelings upon the band's leaving Apple Records (which was the "apple of my eye" to Ham) to pursue a larger contract by moving to Warner Bros. Records.[1] The same concern is reflected on the Ass album cover, which shows a donkey following a carrot into the distance. Coincidentally, it was the last single (Apple 49) released by Apple before its collapse that wasn't performed by an ex-Beatle.
