Data quality has become a major focus of public health programs in recent years, especially as demand for accountability increases.[21] Work towards ambitious goals related to the fight against diseases such as AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria must be predicated on strong Monitoring and Evaluation systems that produce quality data related to program implementation.[22] These programs, and program auditors, increasingly seek tools to standardize and streamline the process of determining the quality of data,[23] verify the quality of reported data, and assess the underlying data management and reporting systems for indicators.[24] An example is WHO and MEASURE Evaluationâ€™s Data Quality Review Tool[25] WHO, the Global Fund, GAVI, and MEASURE Evaluation have collaborated to produce a harmonized approach to data quality assurance across different diseases and programs.[26]
