Along the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria (Varna), coast of Romania (Constanta and Mamaia), Sochi, Russia and Crimea, Ukrainian territory occupied by Russia, have summers too warm (>22 Â°C in the warmest month) to qualify as oceanic, no freezing month, and enough summer precipitation and sometimes humid conditions, where they'd be fit to be classed under Cfa. Though they closely border the Humid continental climate zone. All these areas are subject to occasional, in some cases repeated snowfalls and freezes during winter.
