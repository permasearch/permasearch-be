Carl Auer von Welsbach was not only the discoverer of neodymium and praseodymium, and co-discoverer of lutetium, but was also the inventor of the gas mantle (using thorium) and of the rare-earth industry. After extracting necessary thorium content from monazite sand, a lot of lanthanides were left over, for which there was no commercial use. He began exploration for applications to which the rare earths might be put. Among his first discoveries/inventions to bear practical fruit was mischmetal.
