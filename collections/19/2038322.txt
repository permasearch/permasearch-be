In the aftermath of Lord Business' scheme on Taco Tuesday, the Duplo invaders have made Bricksburg into a post-apocalyptic wasteland as a result of Finn's father allowing his younger sister to play with him. Emmet is completely unaffected by this dramatic change and pretends everything is still awesome, unlike everyone else, who have been toughened and hardened, ready for more fighting. When an intergalactic invader named Sweet Mayhem comes from outer space and kidnaps his friends Wyldstyle, Batman, MetalBeard, Princess Unikitty and Benny, Emmet's master building skills are put to the ultimate test. He must use them to travel to space and rescue his friends, defeat Sweet Mayhem, and restore harmony to Bricksburg and the rest of the Lego Universe.
