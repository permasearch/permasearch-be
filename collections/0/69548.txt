Peroxisomes are organelles found in virtually all eukaryotic cells.[30] They are involved in the catabolism of very long chain fatty acids, branched chain fatty acids, D-amino acids, polyamines, and biosynthesis of plasmalogens, etherphospholipids critical for the normal function of mammalian brains and lungs.[31] Upon oxidation, they produce hydrogen peroxide in the following process:[32]
