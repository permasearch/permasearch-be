Black leaders such as W. E. B. Du Bois, who supported classical academic standards for education, disagreed with Washington and said he was acquiescing to oppression. Du Bois, who had earned his doctorate in Germany and was one of the most highly educated black men in America, in 1897 joined the faculty of Atlanta University and taught there for several years.
