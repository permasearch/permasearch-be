The Buddhist tradition has incorporated two traditions regarding the use of dhyāna (meditation, Pali jhāna).[229] There is a tradition that stresses attaining prajñā (insight, bodhi, kenshō, vipassana) as the means to awakening and liberation. But it has also incorporated the yogic tradition, as reflected in the use of jhana, which is rejected in other sutras as not resulting in the final result of liberation.[139][229][248][note 32] Lambert Schmithausen, a professor of Buddhist Studies, discerns three possible roads to liberation as described in the suttas,[note 33] to which Vetter adds the sole practice of dhyana itself.[251][note 34] According to Vetter and Bronkhorst, the earliest Buddhist path consisted of a set of practices which culminate in the practice of dhyana, leading to a calm of mind which according to Vetter is the liberation which is being sought.[252][253] Later on, "liberating insight" came to be regarded as equally liberating.[254][253] This "liberating insight" came to be exemplified by prajna, or the insight in the "four truths,"[254][253] but also by other elements of the Buddhist teachings.[252][255]
