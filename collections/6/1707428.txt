The Boat Deck level of the stairwell functioned as an interior balcony overlooking the staircase and A-Deck below. This level was 56 ft. wide by 33 ft. long.[1] There were two entry vestibules, 5 ft. x 6 ft., on either side of the Boat Deck that communicated with the outside. The Gymnasium entrance was right next to the Starboard Grand Staircase entrance. The Officer's Quarters and Marconi Room were also accessible via two corridors that branched forward from either side of the staircase. This level was lined with arched windows that provided ample natural light to the stairwell during the day.
