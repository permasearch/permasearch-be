Medics were at Kumaritashvili's side immediately after the crash. Both cardio-pulmonary and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation were performed.[20] He was airlifted to a Whistler hospital, where he died of his injuries.[22] It was luge's first fatality since 10 December 1975, when an Italian luger had been killed.[23] Kumaritashvili became the fourth athlete to die during preparations for a Winter Olympics, after British luger Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypeski and Australian skier Ross Milne (both 1964 Innsbruck), and Swiss speed skier Nicolas Bochatay (1992 Albertville). He was also the seventh athlete to die in either a Summer or Winter Olympic Games.[24]
