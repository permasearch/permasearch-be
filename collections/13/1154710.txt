In 2015 Richard Faille developed the idea of souvenir Euro notes made to the same standards as the currency, but without value.  These can then be sold at a profit to commemorate places or events.[101]  Since then these have become increasingly popular, and the European Central Bank has approved their printing.[102]  A popular addition to this series was issued in 2018 by the city of Trier, and shows Karl Marx, commemorating the bicentennial of his birth there.[103]
