Variety's Owen Gleiberman found the film "garishly rote" saying "For 92 minutes, it more or less succeeds in sawing through your boredom, slicing and dicing with a glum explicitness that raises the occasional tingle of gross-out suspense but no longer carries any kick of true shock value."[39] io9 largely panned the film saying "[it] is one of the better films in the franchise. Unfortunately, that's not saying much."[40]
