The Andaman and Nicobar islands have tropical evergreen forests and tropical semi-evergreen forests as well as tropical monsoon forests.[3] The dominant species of Keruing wood is Dipterocarpus grandiflorus in hilly areas, while Dipterocarpus kerrii is dominant on some islands in the southern parts of the archipelago. The monsoon forests of the Andamans are dominated by the Andaman Redwood (Pterocarpus dalbergioides) and Terminalia spp.[4][better source needed]
