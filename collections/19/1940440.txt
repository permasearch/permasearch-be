The male has a downward bend in the neck and the female has a shorter, straighter beak. The plumage is predominantly white except on remiges, with a faint pink tinge on the neck and a yellowish base on the foreneck.[3] The primary feathers are black, with white shafts at the bases, occasionally with paler tips and narrow fringes. The secondary feathers are also black, but with a whitish fringe. The upperwing coverts, underwing coverts, and tertials are white.[3] The forehead is swollen and pinkish skin surrounds the bare, dark eyes having brown-red to dark brown irides.[3][5][9] It has fleshy-yellow legs and pointed forehead-feathers where meeting the culmen.[9] In breeding season, the male has pinkish skin while the female has orangey skin on its face.[10] The bill is mostly bluish grey, with a red tip, reddish maxilla edges, and a cream-yellow to yolk-yellow gular pouch.[3] The white plumage becomes tinged-pink with a yellow patch on the breast,[5] and the body is tinged yellowish-rosy.[9] It also has a short, shaggy crest on the nape.[9] The white covert feathers contrast with the solid black primary and secondary feathers.[2] The legs are yellow-flesh to pinkish orange. Both male and female are similar, but the female is smaller and has brighter orange facial skin in the breeding season.[3]
