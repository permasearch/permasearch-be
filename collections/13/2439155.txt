The Quran describes these sins throughout the text and demonstrates that some sins are more punishable than others. A clear distinction is made between major and minor sins (53:31â€“32), indicating that if an individual stays away from the major sins, then he/she will be forgiven of the minor sins.[1][not in citation given] Regardless, Islam teaches that God is merciful and individuals can be forgiven of their sins if they repent.[1][not in citation given]
