Stars range in size from neutron stars, which vary anywhere from 20 to 40 km (25 mi) in diameter, to supergiants like Betelgeuse in the Orion constellation, which has a diameter approximately 1,070 times that of the Sun—about 1,490,171,880 km (925,949,878 mi). Betelgeuse, however, has a much lower density than the Sun.[102]
