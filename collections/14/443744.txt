Kiedis was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, to actor John Michael Kiedis, known professionally as Blackie Dammett, and Margaret "Peggy" Noble.[2] His paternal grandfather's family emigrated from Lithuania in the early 1900s; the remainder of his ancestry includes Greek, English, French, Dutch, and Mohican.[3] In 1966, when he was three years old, his parents divorced. Along with his two half-sisters, Julie and Jenny, he was raised by his mother and stepfather in Grand Rapids.[4] Each summer, he would visit his father in Hollywood for two weeks, a time during which the two would bond. He idolized his father, and recalled, "Those trips to California were the happiest, most carefree, the-world-is-a-beautiful-oyster times I'd ever experienced."[5] In 1974, when Kiedis was twelve years old, he moved to Hollywood to live with his father full-time.[6] His father was a struggling actor who sold drugs, which had a significant impact on Kiedis, as the two would often use marijuana and cocaine together.[7] Kiedis accidentally tried heroin for the first time at age 14, mistaking the substance for cocaine.[8] Through his father Blackie, Kiedis, who worked under the stage name of Cole Dammett, landed his first acting role appearing as Sylvester Stallone's character's son in the 1978 film, F.I.S.T. That same year he would land two more acting jobs, one being on an ABC Afterschool Special and the other an appearance in the film, Jokes My Folks Never Told Me.
