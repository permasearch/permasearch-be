As opposed to Rock & Rule (which Nelvana owned outright),[25][62] the characters in The Care Bears Movie were the property of American Greetings, who paid Nelvana a service fee to work on the film.[62]  Nelvana, however, hardly received any profits from the production; this caused its founders to express regret about the situation.[155]  In The Nelvana Story, Patrick Loubert explained the catch-22 that they would face numerous times in the years to come: "We could have waived our fee and taken a big piece of the film. We were offered that deal. But if we had waived the fee, we couldn't have made the payroll. Once the picture was hugely successful, we thought we should have waived the fee. But we couldn't have."[155]  At the time of production, Nelvana had begun embarking on service work that other companies provided them,[25] not only to help ease the debts the studio incurred after Rock & Rule,[156][157] but also because it proved profitable in due time.[25][155][157]
