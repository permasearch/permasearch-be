An online community builds weaker bonds if allows users to be anonymous. Clay Shirky, a researcher on digital media, states in reference to the audience of an online community, "An audience isn’t just a big community; it can be more anonymous, with many fewer ties among users. A community isn’t just a small audience either; it has a social density that audiences lack." The sites that offer online communities, like Myspace, Twitter, Facebook,  Instagram, Tumblr, and Pinterest allow users to "stalk" their community and act anonymously.[7]
