The TV image is composed of many lines of pixels. Ideally, the TV watcher sits far enough away from the screen that the individual lines merge into one solid image. The watcher may sit even farther away and still see a good picture, but it will be a smaller portion of their visual field. However, note that viewing behavior is dependent on screen size [1]. With increasing screen sizes visual exploration is enhanced with an increased number of fixations of shorter duration and a tendency to view only the center of the display.
