Serbia called upon about 255,000 men (out of a population of 2,912,000 people) with about 228 heavy guns, grouped in 10 infantry divisions, two independent brigades and a cavalry division, under the effective command of the former War Minister Radomir Putnik.[3] The Serbian High Command, in its pre-war wargames,[clarification needed] had concluded that the likeliest site of the decisive battle against the Ottoman Vardar Army would be on the Ovƒçe Pole plateau, before Skopje. Hence, the main forces were formed in three armies for the advance towards Skopje, while a division and an independent brigade were to cooperate with the Montenegrins in the Sanjak of Novi Pazar.
