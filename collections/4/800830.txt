When Rocky and CeCe get to dance with teen sensation Justin Starr, they go to his apartment and rehearse, but when Rocky and CeCe are expected to leave, Rocky wants to stay because she wants to take a picture with Justin Starr's hat. Unfortunately CeCe catches Justin making out with his manager. CeCe then tries sending the picture to her mom, thinking that she may have a solution to the problem, but she accidentally sends it to everyone on her contact list. Later, they go to apologize to Justin, but instead of being mad at them, he thanked them, revealing to them that he's not 16, but 24 years old and that his manager is his wife. Meanwhile, Ty tries to make Gunther more "hip", after being rejected by a popular cheerleader. Later, Gunther realizes that he doesn't need to change to impress a girl, after Danielle states that Tinka is a reject.
