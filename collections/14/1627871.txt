Ed Liu of ToonZone considered the episode felt "rushed and perfunctory", having nearly two separate stories that would have been told better across two separate episodes, and considered that the large number of songs was a contributing factor towards this.[8] While Liu did not consider it a poor episode of the series, he felt the show had done better with emotional conclusions in previous seasons.[8] Daniel Alvarez of Unleash the Fanboy also acknowledged that the musical format took away time from the story element, but otherwise considered it a "very grand episode".[9] The episode, and its composers, Daniel Ingram and Steffan Andrews, received the 2013 Leo Award for "Best Musical Score in an Animated Program or Series".[1]
