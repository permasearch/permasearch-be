On November 8, 2012, the band performed the song on The Voice with their touring member, Sam Farrar.[29] The song was also performed on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on November 12, 2012.[30] The band performed the song at 2013 Grammy Awards on a mashup with "Girl on Fire," alongside Alicia Keys. The performance was introduced by LL Cool J, who claimed the performance was going to be "literally on fire."[31] The performance was heavily criticized by critics in general. Samantha Martin of Pop Dust gave the performance 2.5 out of 5 stars, writing that she was "bored" with the performance, criticizing Alicia's onstage abilities. Martin also wrote that, "As expected, it was bland, and the interplay between 'Girl of Fire' and 'Daylight' weren't as clever or inspired as LL Cool J might have advertised."[31] Melissa Locker of Time gave the performance a "C" rating, writing that "the problem is: both songs are repetitive and light on hooksâ€”mashing them together did neither song any favors."[32] Marc Hogan of Spin listed the performance as one of the "worst," writing that Keys was "unfortunately below-her-usual-standards." He criticized her for not playing her usual piano, writing that "her stint on drums still felt like an effort to signal that she, like Maroon 5, can play an Instrument. It didn't matter. It doesn't matter. It never mattered," he concluded.[33]
