Improvements were made in June/July 2011 to the website version to incorporate subtitles and CITV programming. The website version relaunched with a cleaner, less cluttered new look on Monday 22 August 2011. The new look seamlessly fits in with the redesigned itv.com and has upgraded search features, images and a new Flash video player designed to make playback more reliable. In January 2012, the site was due to be overhauled to offer paid-for content in addition to the existing free 30-day catch up,[4] however this was delayed until 29 October 2012.[5]
