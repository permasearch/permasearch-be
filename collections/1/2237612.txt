The syndrome was first described and named in 1893 by Henri Huchard,[3] a French cardiologist, who called it "précordialgie" (from the latin "praecordia" meaning "before the heart"), or "Syndrôme de Huchard" ("Huchard syndrome").[4][5] The term "precordial" had entered the French medical lexicon with the 1370 translation of Guy de Chauliac's Chirurgia magna.[6] Previously, the Latin term "praecordia" had been used to refer to the diaphragm, a sense now obsolete.[6][7]
