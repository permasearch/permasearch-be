The city was called Izcuinapan by the indigenous people. The city has since been known by various names since the Spanish settlements. The Spanish called it San Miguel el Grande and sometimes San Miguel de los Chichimecas. A Franciscan friar, Juan de San Miguel, was a Spanish missionary who converted the natives. The name of the town was changed in 1826 to San Miguel de Allende in order to honor Ignacio Allende, a leader in the fight for independence of Mexico who was born there. The surrounding municipality was officially called Allende. The county has a coat-of-arms that was designed by the well-known cultural group called Amigos de San Miguel.[2]
