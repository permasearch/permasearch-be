The Greek painter Apelles of Kos, a contemporary of Praxiteles, produced the panel painting Aphrodite Anadyomene (Aphrodite Rising from the Sea).[205] According to Athenaeus, Apelles was inspired to paint the painting after watching the courtesan Phryne take off her clothes, untie her hair, and bathe naked in the sea at Eleusis.[205] The painting was displayed in the Asclepeion on the island of Kos.[205] The Aphrodite Anadyomene went unnoticed for centuries,[205] but Pliny the Elder records that, in his own time, it was regarded as Apelles's most famous work.[205]
