The song has appeared from time to time in television programs, commercials, and films, often for comic effect. For example, in the TV show The West Wing, new White House Assistant Counsel Ainsley Hayes (played by Emily Procter) is dancing joyfully to a recording of the song by Annette Funicello, wearing a bathrobe, and drinking a cocktail to celebrate a successful television appearance when she is shocked to see President Jed Bartlet (Martin Sheen) enter her office to meet her for the first time. Former San Francisco 49ers head coach George Seifert performs the song karaoke-style in a Visa commercial that aired during the 1990s. Jack Mac Ferland from Will and Grace sings it too when he prepares his "garlic jazz" in season one.
