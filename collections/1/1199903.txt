For the project, 228 buildings on the site were razed and some 4,000 tenants relocated.[72][73] Demolition of the properties began in 1930.[4] All of the buildings' leases had been bought by August 1931,[74] though there were some tenants on the western and southeastern edges of the plot who refused to leave their property, and Rockefeller Center was built around these buildings.[75][76] Excavation of the Sixth Avenue side of the complex began in July 1931,[77] and construction on the first buildings—the Music Hall and Center Theatre—began in September and November, respectively.[78][79] The plans for the complex notably included Indiana Limestone on the facades of the fourteen planned buildings, and the builders ordered 14,000,000 cubic feet (400,000 m3) of limestone in December 1931, the largest such order at the time.[80]
