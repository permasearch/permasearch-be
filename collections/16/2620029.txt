Jennifer eventually overcame her fears of becoming ill, but not before Frankie had sex with Paula Carson in her apartment after she had revealed her husband had committed suicide.  After he and Jennifer reconciled, Frankie and Paula agreed to keep their one-night stand a secret.  However, Eve learned of this, and in an attempt to break Frankie and Jennifer up wrote an anonymous article in the paper; although Eve did not expose Frankie, she did Paula, and Frankie admitted to Jennifer he was the guy who had slept with her.  Jennifer broke up with him again, but before long she forgave him and once again they resumed their relationship.
