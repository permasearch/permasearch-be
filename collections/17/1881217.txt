Seattle was the host city for the Final Four for the first time since 1952, and the first time in the Kingdome, then home to the NBA SuperSonics as well as the MLB Mariners and NFL Seahawks. The Kingdome became the third domed multipurpose stadium, after the Astrodome and the Superdome, to host a Final Four. Three cities – East Rutherford, Memphis and Milwaukee – became host cities for the first time. East Rutherford, located between New York City and Newark, was the fourth site to host games in the New York metropolitan area. The Mid-South Coliseum and MECCA Arena would only host one time, with future games in Memphis held at The Pyramid and FedExForum and in Milwaukee at the Bradley Center. The gmaes at the MECCA Arena were the first tournament games held in Wisconsin since being held in Madison in 1969. This tournament would also be the last time the Palestra, the "Cathedral of College Basketball", would host an NCAA Tournament Game; all future games in the city would be held at either the Spectrum or the Wells Fargo Center. It was also the last time a team could play in their home arena as Illinois got hosed by the officials in the Kentucky home arena in the elite eight.
