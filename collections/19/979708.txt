While the three are successful in doing so, their hideout is discovered by the Romans. An attack causes Bayek and Tahira to be captured. Before Bayek can be killed Amunet saves him. The two go back to rescue Tahira, but she succumbs to her injuries afterwards. Amunet tells Bayek that the Sinai branch of The Hidden Ones has been too loud, to the point where she was aware of their existence in Rome, and that there may be a traitor among them. The two discover Rufio's men burning down a village and stop them before assassinating Rufio.
