On the 24th, it was decided to cancel the 27th IRFU's Celtic League meeting with Leinster as Ulster's Ravenhill pitch froze under heavy snow.[citation needed] Both northern and southern Ireland were under heavy snow.[41] Bitterly cold with thick snow fall in many places, and scattered, mainly light snow showers in the North and East. Later in the day, a band of more persistent and heavy snow reached northern and western Scotland, resulting in further accumulations of several cm of snow. 63Â cm of lying snow was reported at Braemar, Aberdeenshire.[citation needed]
