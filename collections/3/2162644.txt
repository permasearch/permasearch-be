Monaco made a special agreement with France in 1963 in which French customs laws apply in Monaco and its territorial waters.[128] Monaco uses the euro but is not a member of the European Union.[128] Monaco shares a 6-kilometre (3.7-mile) border with France but also has about 2-kilometre (1.2-mile) of coastline with the Mediterranean sea.[186] Two important agreements that support Monaco's independence from France include the Franco-Monegasque Treaty of 1861 and the French Treaty of 1918 (see also Kingdom of Sardinia The United States CIA Factbook records 1419 as the year of Monaco's independence).[186]
