As shown above, Coming to America features Murphy and Hall in several different roles, of various colours, creeds and genders. Following the success of this film, this became a Murphy staple, as seen in four later films: Vampire in Brooklyn (1995); The Nutty Professor (1996); Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (2000); and Norbit (2007).
