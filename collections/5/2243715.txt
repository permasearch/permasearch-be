The Mermaid had released just three trailers before the movie's debut. In the first trailer, the tycoon, played by Deng Chao, tells police that he has met and been kidnapped by a mermaid. In its final 90-second trailer released on 31 January 2016, it shows the love story between Liu Xuan and Shan, the two lead characters, as well as large-scale killing and hunting for mermaids. An interesting twist and an historical link was seen in the second trailer, where there is a clue hinting at legendary Chinese mariner Zheng He's voyages in the 15th century.[18] But much of the storyline was kept in secret and the trailers didn't reveal too much as the marketing team held the belief to make the trailers "less amazing than the actual movie", in order to lower the already too high expectation, then when audiences eventually saw the film, they would be "surprised".[28]
