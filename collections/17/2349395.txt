The 1978 FIBA World Championship was the first held in Asia, with the Philippines hosting the event fifteen years after they were originally scheduled to host the 1963 tournament. Fourteen teams participated in the tournament for the second time, while the qualification again remained the same. The tournament took a slightly different format for this edition; the top eight teams again qualified for a final round robin, but the top two teams after the round robin met in a playoff for the gold medal, while the third and fourth placed teams met for the bronze. The high-powered Yugoslav team scored more than 100 points in eight of their ten group stage games, cruising to an undefeated record.[3] The Soviet Union went 9–1 to finish second and meet Yugoslavia in the gold medal game. The Soviet team held Yugoslavia to its lowest point total of the tournament, but fell 82–81 in a back-and-forth overtime thriller.[24] After scoring a World Championship record 154 points in a preliminary round victory over China, Brazil beat Italy for the bronze medal, the fourth time in the last five years that those three teams had claimed the podium.[22] After sending college players to the previous two World Championships, the United States sent an Athletes in Action squad because the early October schedule interfered with college team preparations.[25] Somewhat predictably, the team struggled to a 6–4 record and a fifth-place finish. Oceania champions Australia improved, qualifying for the final round for the first time, becoming the first team from outside the Americas and Europe to qualify for the final round since the Philippines in 1954 (Philippines also qualified for the final round in this tournament, although they qualified automatically as hosts). Senegal won a game, beating Asian champion China in the consolation round to become the first African champion to win a game since they were given an automatic berth at the World Championship in 1970.
