In the 2009 UNCAF Nations Cup, hosted in Honduras, El Salvador was drawn into a group with Belize, Honduras, and Nicaragua. They defeated Belize 4–1, tied against Nicaragua 1–1 with an own-goal, and lost to Honduras 0–2. This gave them second place in the group and qualified them for the semifinals. There, the team faced Costa Rica. However, the games was called off after 60 minutes of play (with Costa Rica leading 1–0) when El Salvador was reduced to six players. Two El Salvador players, Alexander Escobar and Eliseo Quintanilla, were awarded red cards in the first half, while Deris Umanzor, Rodolfo Zelaya, and goalkeeper Juan José Gómez were injured and had to leave the game after El Salvador had already exhausted their three substitutions. The game was awarded 3–0 to Costa Rica. In the third place playoff, Honduras earned a win over La Selecta with the only goal scored by Roger Espinoza (30').[54] At the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup, El Salvador were in Group A alongside Canada, Costa Rica, and Jamaica. They debuted against Costa Rica, winning 2–1 with El Salvador's goals scored by Osael Romero in the 19th and 85th minute. However, they lost their games against Canada and Jamaica, both matches 1–0. The team was still coached by Carlos de los Cobos.[55]
