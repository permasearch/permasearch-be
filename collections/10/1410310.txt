On 12 November, plans to post observers to Spanish frontiers and ports to prevent breaches of the agreement were ratified. France and the United Kingdom became split on whether to recognise Franco's forces as a belligerent as the British wanted, or to fail to do as the French wanted.[23] This was subsumed by the news that the Italian and German governments had recognised the Nationalists as the true government of Spain.[23] The League of Nations condemned intervention, urged its council's members to support non-intervention, and commended mediation.[24] It then closed discussion on Spain, leaving it to the Committee.[25] A mediation plan, however, was soon dropped.[24]
