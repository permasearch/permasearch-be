The $1 "yo" (eleven) bet, split with the dealers on come-out rolls by calling out "two-way yo", tends to be a favorite with many players as means of tipping the dealers without giving up too much per gambling trip. If eleven comes out on the come out roll, the pass line win bets and the more substantial "yo" bet splits.[12] A "three-way yo" is a $1 "yo" for the better, a $1 "yo" for the crew, and a $1 "yo" for the shooter. This bet cannot be booked if the bettor is also the shooter.
