Semaphores come in "lower quadrant" and "upper quadrant" forms. In lower quadrant signals, the arm pivots down for less restrictive aspects. Upper quadrant signals, as the name implies, pivot the arm upward. Either type may be capable of showing two or three indications depending on the application. For example, it was common in the United States for train order signals to point the arm straight down to indicate "Proceed." Many British Railway companies, for example the London North Eastern Railway, and the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, favoured the upper quadrant design since any fault in the mechanical linkage would default the signal to the "danger" or "stop" position.
