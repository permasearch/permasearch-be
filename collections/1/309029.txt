Each justice has five assigned law clerks.[20] Since the late 1980s, the Court has turned away from the traditional use of law clerks, and has switched to permanent staff attorneys.[22] Justice Goodwin Liu, however, has returned to the traditional use of recent law school graduates as one-year clerks.[20] The Court has about 85 staff attorneys, some of whom are attached to particular justices; the rest are shared as a central staff.[23][24] The advantage to this system is that the reduced turnover of staff attorneys (versus the traditional system of rotating through new law clerks every year) has improved the efficiency of the court in dealing with complex cases, particularly death penalty cases.
