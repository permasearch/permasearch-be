To obtain sap and nectar from plants, sugar gliders will strip the bark off trees or open bore holes with their teeth to access stored liquid gum.[39] Little time is spent foraging for insects, as it is an energetically expensive process, and sugar gliders will wait until insects fly into their habitat, or stop to feed on flowers.[39] Gliders consume approximately 11 g of dry food matter per day.[33] This equates to roughly 8% and 9.5% of body weight for males and females, respectively.
