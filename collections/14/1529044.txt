Flight archery relies on the finest in performance equipment, optimized for the single purpose of greater range, using various types of bows (some unusual such as foot bows). The search for better flight archery equipment has led to many developments in archery equipment in general, such as the development of carbon arrows.[3] Flight archery arrows are highly specialized. They are very short (Mahmoud Effendi's was only 14Â inches), so that the point of the arrow is inside the arc of the fully drawn bow, requiring a support projecting back from the bow towards the archer to keep the arrow in position, or the use of a 'siper'(Turkish) on the bow hand/wrist on which to rest the arrow.[4] Also, the shafts are 'barrelled', tapering towards both ends from the middle, to reduce both weight and air resistance.
