In 2002, Cohle links a series of missing persons to Tuttle-funded schools. A former pastor in Tuttle's ministries claims Tuttle covered up child molestation. Ledoux's surviving victim, now institutionalized with regressive catatonia, tells Cohle about a third attacker—a giant man with scars—and begins screaming when Cohle asks her about the man's face. Tuttle complains to the police department following a tense meeting with Cohle, who has been warned to cease his investigation and is suspended from duty. Hart begins an affair with Beth (Lili Simmons), a former underage prostitute whom he interviewed in 1995 while working on the Lange case. After Maggie discovers the new affair, she manipulates a drunk Cohle and has sex with him, because she knows that Hart would never forgive her for that, and she could get a divorce. After she tells Hart, he and Cohle fight in the police station parking lot. Cohle quits the police force immediately after the fight.
