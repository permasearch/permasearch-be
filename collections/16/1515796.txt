An Epiphany Window was installed at St James the Great Anglican Church a few weeks after the execution. It was created by the artist Dr Miroslav "Dismas" Zika, who etched an inscription in Latin into the glass towards the base of the window, a translation of which in English is rendered "Dismas made this in 1967 at the beginning of the month when Bolte, scandalous, arrogant, was demanding Ryan suffer capital punishment." Bolte considered this objectionable. The Archbishop of Melbourne, Dr Frank Woods, apologised to the Premier, clarifying that the inscription had neither been included in the original design brief, nor had any "official authorisation", and that the offending inscription would be removed. Dr Zika remained unrepentant.[77]
