About 20% of patients who successfully complete therapy of primary infection with metronidazole or vancomycin will experience a relapse. A fraction of those patients will experience continuous reoccurrences of the infection. The first relapse of a C. difficile is usually treated with the same antibiotic used to treat the primary infection. Any subsequent infections should not be treated with metronidazole. Occasionally, a standard 10 day course of oral vancomycin will not work. In these cases, a vancomycin taper is the preferred treatment. Patients will take decreasing doses of vancomycin over a period of up to 3 months, depending on the severity of the infection.[19]
