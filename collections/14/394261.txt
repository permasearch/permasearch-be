The saloon model was built and sold in Latin America as Chevrolet Corsa Classic until 2010. A budget version introduced for the Brazilian market, the Chevrolet Celta, has bodywork resembling the late 1990s Vectra and Astra. The Celta was sold in Argentina as the Suzuki Fun for a certain period. In 2011, GM stopped representing Suzuki in Argentina, so the Celta reverted to its original name under the Chevrolet brand.
