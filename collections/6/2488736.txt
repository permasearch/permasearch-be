The deadline for expressions of interests for Australian franchises was 10 April 2007.[3] In March 2007, Netball Australia chief executive Kate Palmer said the preferred model was for one team each from New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia.[4] In April this was confirmed as the composition of the league's Australian teams. Netball New South Wales boss Caroline Campbell said that she was disappointed that the Sydney Swifts and the Hunter Jaegers would have to merge.[5] Netball Victoria president Jenny Sanchez said that she had an open mind about whether Victoria would enter one of the two existing teams or a new franchise,[4] but by May 2007, the organisation had chosen to enter a single merged team.[6] Netball ACT also bid for a franchise,[7] but were unsuccessful.[6]
