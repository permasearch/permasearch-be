Finally, when the aircraft is flying the propelling jet itself contains wasted kinetic energy after it has left the engine. This is quantified by the term propulsive, or Froude, efficiency      η  p     {\displaystyle \eta _{p}}   and may be reduced by redesigning the engine to give it bypass flow and a lower speed for the propelling jet, for example as a turboprop or turbofan engine. At the same time forward speed increases the      η  t h     {\displaystyle \eta _{th}}   by increasing the Overall pressure ratio.
