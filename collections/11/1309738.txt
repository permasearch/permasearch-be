Until 1932, visitors to the cavern had to walk down a switchback ramp that took them 750 feet (230Â m) below the surface. The walk back up was tiring for some. In 1932 the national park opened up a large visitor center building that contained two elevators that would take visitors in and out of the caverns below. The new center included a cafeteria, waiting room, museum and first aid area.[8]
