The question of the citizenship status of U.S.-born children of alien parents had, up to this time, never been decided by the Supreme Court.[68][91]  The U.S. government argued that Wong's claim to U.S. citizenship was ruled out by the Supreme Court's interpretation of jurisdiction in its 1873 Slaughterhouse Cases ruling,[66] but the district judge concluded that the language in question was obiter dictum and not directly relevant to the case at hand.[68][92]  The government also cited a similar statement in Elk v. Wilkins, but the judge was not convinced by this argument either.[93][94]
