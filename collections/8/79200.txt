[34] It has also been suggested that the method used by Gutenberg involved using a single punch to make a mould, but the mould was such that the process of taking the type out disturbed the casting, creating variants and anomalies, and that the punch-matrix system came into use possibly around the 1470s.[35] This raises the possibility that the development of movable type in the West may have been progressive rather than a single innovation.[36]
