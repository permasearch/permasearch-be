The Chateau d'If was finished in 1531, while Notre-Dame de la Garde was not completed until 1536, when it was used to help repel the troops of Charles Quint. It was built using stone from Cap Couronne, as well as materials from buildings outside the ramparts of the demolished city to keep them from providing shelter to enemy troops.[11] Among these was the monastery of the Mineurs brothers where Louis of Toulouse was buried near the Cours BelsunceÂ (fr) and Cours Saint-Louis.[12]
