In 2013, she co-starred with David Krumholtz in The Big Ask. The film received mixed reviews, but Lynskey's performance was considered to be one of its high points.[59][60][61] She next starred in the comedy-drama Happy Christmas (2014), directed by Joe Swanberg. Lynskey was praised for her portrayal of Kelly, an aspiring novelist whose passion for writing is rekindled when her sister-in-law (played by Anna Kendrick) comes to visit.[62][63] The film drew attention for being almost entirely improvised.[64] Stephen Holden of The New York Times commented, "The performances in Happy Christmas are so natural that the actors melt into their characters".[65] That same year, she appeared with Amy Poehler in David Wain's satirical romantic comedy They Came Together, and played the female leads in We'll Never Have Paris,[66] opposite Simon Helberg, and Goodbye to All That, opposite Paul Schneider. In his review of the latter, Bilge Ebiri called the film "charming, beautiful, and sad", and described Lynskey as "fantastic".[67] In April 2014, she was named an Emerging Master honoree at the RiverRun International Film Festival.[68]
