As a major product pre-war anastigmat, 4-element, 4-group lens, it was replacing the Imagonal in ~1909. Their formula was changed from double-gauss to dialyt somewhere between number 116.000 and 239.000, but there were still some double-gauss-Eurynar's, where a greater angle was necessary. The Lens Collector's Vade Mecum (M. Wilkinson and C. Glanfield) is giving 1924 as the date for this change.
