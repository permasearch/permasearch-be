In an epilogue of the same book, Frankie was found dead. A young police constable walking his beat accidentally discovered the body of Frankie Brown beneath sheets of newspaper in an alley at the edge of Chelsea, on a freezing November night. The young man’s body lay frozen in a foetal position. An autopsy would later reveal a number of facts: for instance that Frankie had died of hypothermia, that he was a long-time drug abuser, and that he had probably not eaten for at least three days. However, there was one secret the autopsy could not extract. For the last eight years of his life, Francis Brown had lived under the name of Ben Daly. Before burning the dead man’s clothes, an assistant of the coroner’s office went through the pockets in search of anything that might be valuable. They were empty but for a dirty, crumpled envelope upon which was written ‘Dublin Papers’.
