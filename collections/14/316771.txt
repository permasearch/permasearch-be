Solutes in water also affect water activity that affects many chemical reactions and the growth of microbes in food.[72] Water activity can be described as a ratio of the vapor pressure of water in a solution to the vapor pressure of pure water.[71] Solutes in water lower water activityâ€”this is important to know because most bacterial growth ceases at low levels of water activity.[72] Not only does microbial growth affect the safety of food, but also the preservation and shelf life of food.
