The Mishnah contains the second known reference to Rosh Hashanah as the "day of judgment".[12] In the Talmud tractate on Rosh Hashanah, it states that three books of account are opened on Rosh Hashanah, wherein the fate of the wicked, the righteous, and those of an intermediate class are recorded. The names of the righteous are immediately inscribed in the book of life and they are sealed "to live". The intermediate class are allowed a respite of ten days, until Yom Kippur, to reflect, repent and become righteous;[13] the wicked are "blotted out of the book of the living forever".[14]
