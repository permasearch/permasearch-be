Sodium and potassium occur in all known biological systems, generally functioning as electrolytes inside and outside cells.[221][222] Sodium is an essential nutrient that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500 milligrams per day.[223] Sodium chloride (also known as common salt) is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative, such as for pickling and jerky; most of it comes from processed foods.[224] The Dietary Reference Intake for sodium is 1.5 grams per day,[225] but most people in the United States consume more than 2.3 grams per day,[226] the minimum amount that promotes hypertension;[227] this in turn causes 7.6 million premature deaths worldwide.[228]
