According to the New York Times, if Clinton was a recipient of classified emails, "it is not clear that she would have known that they contained government secrets, since they were not marked classified."[87][101] The newspaper reported that "most specialists believe the occasional appearance of classified information in the Clinton account was probably of marginal consequence."[13] Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists, said that inadvertent "spillage" of classified information into an unclassified realm is a common occurrence.[13]
