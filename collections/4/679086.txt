Sri Lankan Ambassador in Geneva Tamara Kunanayakam pointed out that 80% of the UNHRCâ€™s funding requirements are supplied by powerful nations such as the United States and its allies. Also, key positions in the UNHCR are mostly held by those who have served in the foreign services of such countries.[195] Sri Lanka's position is that this fact is significantly detrimental to the impartiality of the UNHRC activities, especially when dealing with the developing world. As a result, Sri Lanka, along with Cuba and Pakistan, sponsored a resolution seeking transparency in funding and staffing the UNHRC, during its 19th session starting in February 2012.[195] The resolution passed on 4 April 2012.[196]
