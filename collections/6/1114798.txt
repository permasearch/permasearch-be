Hank Thunderman (Chris Tallman) is the husband to Barb and father to Phoebe, Max, Billy, Nora, and Chloe. His superhero alias is Thunder Man. His superpowers are super-strength and flight. Hank has now half-unwillingly retired as a superhero in order to give his kids a stable and normal home. He still uses his powers to fly to places around the world.
