Frances Folsom, who was 21 years old, married President Grover Cleveland, age 49, on June 2, 1886, at the White House. This was the only time a president married in the Executive Mansion, and Frances was the only First Lady to marry in the White House.[5][6] Their age difference of 28 years is the second largest of any presidential marriage (behind that of President John Tyler, whose second wife, Julia Gardiner Tyler, was thirty years his junior when they wed in New York City in 1844).
