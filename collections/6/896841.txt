With the Argonauts moving to the renovated BMO Field beginning with the 2016 season, the team was awarded on October 1, 2015 the right to host the 104th Grey Cup at the stadium on November 27, 2016.[108] On June 11, 2016, the Argonauts played their first game at the stadium, a preseason (exhibition) game; the Argos defeated the Hamilton Tiger-Cats 25–16.[109] On June 23, the Argos played their first regular season game at BMO Field; the Ti-Cats defeated the Argos 42–20.[110] Due to the position of the stands, each end zone is only 18 yards deep rather than the standard 20 in Canadian football.
