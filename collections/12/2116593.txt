The H gene of the ABO system encodes a fucosyltransferase that adds fucose to type 2 precursor substances on the surface of RBCs to make H antigen. The h gene is an amorph. If no further modifications are made to the H antigen, the person is type O. When the A gene product acts on the H antigen and adds an N-acetylgalactosamine, the A antigen results and the person is type A. When the B gene product acts on the H antigen to add a galactose, the B antigen results and the person is type B.[1]
