In 1963, the musical team Peter, Paul and Mary, along with their musical director Milt Okun, adapted and rewrote "Go Tell It on the Mountain" as "Tell It on the Mountain", their lyrics referring specifically to: Exodus and using the phrase "Let my people go," but referring implicitly to the Civil Rights struggle of the early 1960s. This version became a moderately successful single for them (US #33 pop, 1964).
