Trypsin is produced as the inactive zymogen trypsinogen in the pancreas. When the pancreas is stimulated by cholecystokinin, it is then secreted into the first part of the small intestine (the duodenum) via the pancreatic duct. Once in the small intestine, the enzyme enteropeptidase activates trypsinogen into trypsin by proteolytic cleavage.  Autocatalysis does not happen with trypsin, as  trypsinogen is a poor substrate, therefore enzymatic damage to the pancreas is avoided.[6]
