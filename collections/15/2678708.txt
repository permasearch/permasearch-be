The myths of the people of Arnhem Land have preserved accounts of the trepang-catching, rice-growing Baijini people, who, according to the myths, were in Australia in the earliest times, before the Macassans. The Baijini have been variously interpreted by modern researchers as a different group of presumably South East Asian people, such as Bajau visitors to Australia who may have visited Arnhem Land before the Macassans,[43][44] as a mythological reflection of the experiences of some YolÅ‹u people who have travelled to Sulawesi with the Macassans and came back,[45] or, in more fringe views, even as visitors from China.[46]
