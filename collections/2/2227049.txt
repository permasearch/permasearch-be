All penguins are countershaded for camouflage â€“ that is, they have black backs and wings with white fronts.[37] A predator looking up from below (such as an orca or a leopard seal) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the reflective water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above.
