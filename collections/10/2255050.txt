The novel was adapted for the screen in 1977 by Tony Richardson, Allan Scott and Chris Bryant. Richardson directed the critically well-received work, with Michael Hordern as Adams, Peter Firth as Joseph, and Lady Booby played by Swedish-born Ann-Margret, who received a Golden Globe nomination for the role. The tag line (‘The story of a young, English footman who served the Lady Booby but loved the little Fanny’) suggests how it captures some of the source material's bawdy humour. It was released on region 1 DVD in 2003.
