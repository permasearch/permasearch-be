When Charlie was young, he was embarrassed by his younger brother Alan, and when Alan had his first school day, Charlie told everyone at school that Alan was his shaved monkey (he later explained he did this because he always wanted a shaved monkey). He also gave his brother full-time wedgies and abused him whenever he could. Charlie has dependably had a stressed association with Alan, and would go to all expenses to escape being a decent enormous sibling to him. As a child, Charlie would spook his sibling by giving him wedgies and ridiculing him at school. As a child, Charlie once put a toy in Alan's pocket to shop-lift, and when they got, he influenced Alan to assume the fault. Charlie drank a lot when he was a teenager, was a chain smoker, and constantly ran away, nevertheless his mother did not mind because he always came back, and generally didn't care about her sons. He once even, when he was 16, drove to Tijuana, Mexico with a school nurse. When he was 17, he almost married a woman whom he thought to be his love, but relented, and as Charlie says, if he didn't, he would today be married to a "65-year old retired belly dancer".[6] Charlie constantly criticizes Alan's and Jake's presence in his house but generally seems comfortable that they are around, because they are the only people who have known him for a long time and remain in his daily life. When Alan was surprised to find Charlie did not have their mom's cell phone number in his contacts list, Charlie told him "If I can't eat it, bang it or bet on it, it's not in my phone." On a later episode, it is shown Charlie does get his mother's number. In fact, he has it on the speed dial address that he finds appropriate for her, "666".
