Of all the characters in the series, Jason is the one who struggles the most with the differences between the Greek and Roman perspectives. Piper McLean describes Jason as very rule- and duty-oriented, though the Roman god Terminus describes him as a "rule-flouter." However, when his former compatriot Reyna sees him again in The Mark of Athena, she comments that he seems to have lost some of his Roman qualities. When the Argo II is stuck in North Africa, he realizes that he must choose one identity or the other. He chooses to consider himself a Greek, despite his parentage, and is later unable to command a legion of ghosts sworn to obey only Roman officers.[5] During The House of Hades it is revealed that Jason has plans to return to Camp Jupiter to improve it with things he learned at Camp Half-Blood, such as giving the fauns (the Roman equivalent of a satyr) more rights and responsibilities.[15] Later, during The Blood of Olympus, Jason decides to consider both the Greek and Roman traditions as part of his heritage.[14] He becomes "Pontifex Maximus", a role which will see him travel between Camp Half-Blood and Camp Jupiter to build shrines for every god and goddess in the pantheon, allowing him to stay in touch with both sides.
