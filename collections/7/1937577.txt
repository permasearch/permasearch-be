On 13 February 2015 the Reserve Bank of Australia announced that the next series of Australia notes would have a tactile feature to help the visually impaired community to tell the value of the note after a successful campaign led by 15-year-old Connor McLeod, who is blind, to introduce the new feature.[12][13] The $5 banknote includes the tactile feature and was issued on 1 September 2016, to coincide with Australia's National Wattle Day.[14] Philip Lowe, the governor of the Reserve Bank, has said that the other fourth series banknotes will be released separately, anticipating that the $10 note will be released in September 2017, followed by the $50 note in 2018, with remaining denominations released in subsequent years.[15] The Reserve Bank has no plans to release fourth series banknotes in denominations higher than $100.
