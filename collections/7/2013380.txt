Adventure novels were popular, including Sir John Barrow's descriptive 1831 account of the Mutiny on the Bounty. The Lost World literary genre was inspired by real stories of archaeological discoveries by imperial adventurers. Sir Henry Rider Haggard wrote one of the earliest examples, King Solomon's Mines, in 1885. Contemporary European politics and diplomatic manoeuvrings informed Anthony Hope's swashbuckling Ruritanian adventure novels The Prisoner of Zenda 1894. Robert Louis Stevenson (1850â€“94) also wrote works in this genre including, Kidnapped (1886), an historical novel set in the aftermath of the Jacobite rising of 1745, and Treasure Island )1883), the classic pirate adventure.
