In 1980, Lisa Coleman replaced Gayle Chapman in Prince's touring band[2] on keyboards and piano. Coleman was asked to contribute vocals to several tracks over his next few albums. In 1983, guitarist Dez Dickerson left the band over religious conflicts. Coleman suggested Wendy Melvoin, who had been brought on tour, as a replacement.  Prince accepted Melvoin into the band as they began to record Purple Rain.[3] The film and album were a phenomenon, turning Prince and the newly named Revolution into superstars. Prince's personal life also became intertwined with Melvoin's when he began dating her twin sister Susannah.
