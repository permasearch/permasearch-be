The town of Chamonix is served by French Route Nationale 205 (RN 205), nicknamed the Route blanche,[9] or "white route", due to its snowiness. This is an extension of French autoroute 40 (A40), similarly nicknamed the autoroute blanche, which ends at Le Fayet, a village in the commune of Saint-Gervais-les-Bains.[10] The 11.6-km Mont Blanc Tunnel originates here, linking Chamonix to Courmayeur in Italy.[11] Chamonix is linked to Switzerland by what used to be RN 506a. In 2006, it was converted to a Route DÃ©partementale 1506, with a part of it integrated into RN 205. The nearest airport to Chamonix is Geneva Cointrin International and it is 88 kilometres (55 miles) in distance.
