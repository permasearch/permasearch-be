Clegg was the sounding-board for Compo's glee and the third man's authority, and was often instrumental in pointing out the pitfalls concealed within the schemes of the third man.[4] Clegg is also well known for his philosophical asides, which have received praise for interjecting intellectual material into the series.[5] In early episodes, Clegg was much more opinionated and courageous. Sometimes he was shown to be the leader of the trio in the earlier episodes (such as taking them on a camping trip in the hills one stormy night). Within a few years he became more quiet and laid-back (although he was still seen to relish the odd practical joke or escapade), and the group came to be led by Foggy and the "third men" who succeeded him. During the earlier episodes he was also less awkward and more talkative when interacting with women which is shown when he once made an offhand remark about Nora Batty's father (which she overheard). When Cyril commented on how brave it was to do so, he claimed to have had "years of marital combat experience". Eventually he became more nervous when interacting with the local ladies. Despite his neurosis and frequent skepticism, Clegg was the one who had the most average lifestyle and particularly in earlier episodes is portrayed as the most friendly out of the trio.
