In his six-year tenure with Detroit, Fielder had four consecutive 30-homer and 100-RBI seasons. During the strike-shortened 1994 season, he had 28 home runs and 90 RBIs in 109 games. He also became the first Tiger to hit at least 25 home runs in six consecutive seasons. No player in Detroit history hit as many over a six-year period (219) until Miguel Cabrera hit 227 in 2008â€“13, and no major league player had more home runs between 1990 and 1995.[citation needed]
