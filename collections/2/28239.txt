Our Casuarina Tree is an autobiographical poem . While living abroad, she is pining for the scenes of her native land and reliving the memories of childhood. In the first part of the poem the poet depicts the Casuarina Tree trailed by a creeper vine like a huge python, winding round and round with the rough trunk, sunken deep with scars . It reached to the height touching the very summit of stars. The Casuarina Tree stood alone unaccompanied in the compound. It was wearing the scarf of the creeper hung with crimson cluster of flowers among the boughs accompanied by the bird and hives of bees humming around. the tree is dear to the poet because it is the solo bond between the poets past and present, when she recalls it a chain of pleasant and poignant memories to her mind and again she tastes the flavour of her childhood. In her imagination she is again transported to the golden age and hears the same cries, laughter and noise of her sweet departed playmates, this tree reminds of her siblings who used to play with her under this Casuarina Tree.
