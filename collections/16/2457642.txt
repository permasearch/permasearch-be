The number of sperm in an ejaculation also varies widely, depending on many factors, including the time since the last ejaculation,[13] age, stress levels,[14] and testosterone. Greater lengths of sexual stimulation immediately preceding ejaculation can result in higher concentrations of sperm.[12] An unusually low sperm count, not the same as low semen volume, is known as oligospermia, and the absence of any sperm from the semen is termed azoospermia.
