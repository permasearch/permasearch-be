Also, until the 1980s, there was an Alternate US-231 which ran north from the intersection/interchange with US-280 just south of Sylacauga, Alabama, northeastward through Sylacauga, Winterboro, and onto Talladega, Alabama. This routing was co-signed with Alabama State Route 21. From Talladega, Alternate US-231 ran northward co-signed with Alabama State Route 77 to just south of Lincoln, Alabama. There for a one-mile segment, Alternate US 231 ran along its own route just west of and parallel to Alabama State Route 77 until it reached an intersection with US-78 in the center of the small town of Lincoln, Alabama. There Alternate US-231 turned westward for nine miles co-signed with US-78 into Pell City, Alabama. There Alternate US-231 rejoined US-231. Alternate US-231 was decommissioned in the early 1980s.
