In March 2013, television journalists noted Berkus began working on a primetime series with NBC, initially titled Renovation Nation.[14]  By May 2013 the title was changed to American Dream Builders. Berkus is the host and one of the producers of the show in which, according to NBC, "American top designers, builders, architects and landscapers go head-to-head each week, putting their talents to the test on extreme home renovations."[15]  Early descriptions report that the cross-country competitions will be judged by both design experts and viewers; the live finale will include audience evaluation to determine the winner.[14] NBC has initially ordered 10 episodes which will reportedly premiere mid-season 2013â€“14 on Sunday evenings.[16]
