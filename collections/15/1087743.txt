At its peak, Cardiff's port area, known as Tiger Bay, became the busiest port in the world and—for some time—the world's most important coal port.[128][129] In the years leading up to the First World War, more than 10 million tonnes of coal was exported annually from Cardiff Docks.[130] In 1907, Cardiff's Coal Exchange was the first host to a business deal for a million pounds Sterling.[131] After a period of decline, Cardiff's port has started to grow again – over 3 million tonnes of cargo passed through the docks in 2007.[132]
