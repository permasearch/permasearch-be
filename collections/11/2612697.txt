Soap Central's Tamilu had a tough time accepting Sanders in the role and explained that Drew Garrett's ousting as Michael was already enough for viewers to deal with, and losing a beloved actor like Refvem was a bit shocking. She said the climactic scenes in which Morgan discovered Michael's prison sentence kind of fell flat due to the sudden recast. However, the user praised Refvem for being able to "cry at the drop of a hat" and said that he oozed sincerity.[52] With the installation of new head-writer Garin Wolf, some advised the scribe to bring Refvem back as Morgan.[53] Despite some mixed reviews early on, other critics began to accept Sanders as the "NuMorgan." Michael Fairman applauded Sanders for his performance during a scene in February 2011 in which Morgan learned of Carly and Jax's separation. Fairman said Sanders "delivered a very real and emotional moment."[54] Sanders was also nominated for a Young Artist Award for his portrayal of Morgan in February 2011.[55]
