Enemies is a broad term that applies to all manner of foes and adversaries. In this verse persecutors are specifically mentioned. At the time Matthew was writing the Christian community had recently faced considerable persecution under Nero. The entire Jewish community at both Jesus and Matthew's time was subject to persecution by the Romans.[8][9] (see History of the Jews in the Roman Empire, Persecution of Christians in the New Testament, and Anti-Christian policies in the Roman Empire)
