Upon consecration, Yohannan Sulaqa took the name Shimun and by the end of the year he returned to the homeland and started to organize pro-Catholic party by appointing several metropolitans and bishops,[12] thus establishing the first group of hierarchs in the newly created Eastern Catholic Patriarchate of Mosul. That was the seminal event in the early history of the Chaldean Catholic Church. Creation of the separate Eastern-Catholic hierarchy was not welcomed by the traditionalist patriarch Shemon VII and thus an ecclesiastical rivalry between two parties was born, lasting for decades and centuries. Initial splits and conflicts affected both communities, and marked the beginning of a long series of splits and mergers within both branches.
