The arena also held one of its more interesting events during the summer of 1991: a pre-season game between the New York Rangers and Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League. A rink was laid out over the parking lot and held firm despite 95-degree temperatures. Behind a goal from Wayne Gretzky, the Kings came back from a 2–0 deficit to win 5–2 before a crowd of over 13,000.[164] The game served as a predecessor to both the Frozen Fury (the Kings' annual preseason game in Las Vegas that began in 1997[165]) and the Winter Classic (the annual regular season game played outdoors on New Year's Day that began in 2008).[166]
