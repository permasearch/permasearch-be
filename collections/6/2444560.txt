The demonstrative pronouns are 这 [這] zhè "this" and 那 nà "that" (with alternative colloquial pronunciations zhèi and nèi). They are optionally pluralized by the addition of 些 xiē. There is a reflexive pronoun 自己 zìjǐ meaning "oneself, myself, etc.", which can stand alone as an object or a possessive, or may follow a personal pronoun for emphasis. The reciprocal pronoun "each other" can be translated by 彼此 bǐcǐ, usually in adverb position (where an alternative is 互相 hùxiāng "mutually").
