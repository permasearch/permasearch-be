This list contains a selection of objects 50 and 100 km in radius (100 km to 200 km in average diameter). The listed objects currently include most objects in the asteroid belt and moons of the giant planets in this size range, but many newly discovered objects in the outer Solar System are missing, such as those included in the following reference.[20] Asteroid spectral types are mostly Tholen, but some might be SMASS.
