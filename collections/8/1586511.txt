The band recorded with their instruments and a backing group on the weekends. Michael Jackson sang lead vocals on the majority of the tracks beginning with "Big Boy" in 1967, which took a few hours to record at Sunny Sawyers recording studio in South Chicago. "Big Boy" was written by Eddie Silvers, a Chicago musician.[5][6][7][8] According to legend, the group were paid three cents for each record sold, which was equally split among the five brothers and their drummer.[9][10] The group's first single "Big Boy", was backed with the B-side "You've Changed".[6][10] "The Jackson Five Plus Johnny" (Johnny Jackson on drums, no relation)[11] would go on to perform "Big Boy" and other songs locally throughout the Gary and South Chicago area before moving to California in 1969.[12]
