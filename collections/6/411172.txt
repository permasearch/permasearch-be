As of January 2014, the TEDxTalks library contained some 30,000 films and presentations from over 130 countries.[72][73] As of October 2017, the TEDx archive surpassed 100,000 talks.[74] In March 2013, eight TEDx events were organised every day; raised up from five in June 2012, the previous year, in 133 countries.[75][76] TEDx presentations also include live performances, which are catalogued in the TEDx Music Project.[77] In 2011, TED began a program called "TEDx in a Box" that allows people in developing countries to hold TEDx events. TEDx also expanded to include TEDxYouth events, TEDx corporate events, and TEDxWomen.[citation needed] TEDxYouth events are independent programs set up for students roughly between 7â€“12 grades.[78] These events usually have people closer to the age of the students and sometimes show TED Talks.[citation needed] According to TEDxSanta Cruz, "as of 2015, over 1,500 [TEDx events] have been scheduled all over the world".[79] TEDx events evolved over a period of time and events like TEDxBeaconStreet created TEDx Adventures for participants where participants sign up for free, hands-on experiences in their local communities, led by an expert.[80]
