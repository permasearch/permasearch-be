Texhoma students in both Texas and Oklahoma are served jointly by an unusual bi-state arrangement. Kindergarten through fourth grade students are served by the Texhoma Independent School District [1] in Texas, while fifth through twelfth grade students by Texhoma Public Schools in Oklahoma. It is the only city in Oklahoma where graduating students can attend either Oklahoma or Texas public universities at the in-state tuition rates for either.[6]
