Not all critics were as impressed. Writing for his Consumer Guide column in The Village Voice, Robert Christgau wrote: "I originally underrated what many consider McCartney's definitive post-Beatles statement, but not as much as its admirers overrate it. Pop masterpiece? This? Sure it's a relief after the vagaries of Wild Life and Red Rose Speedway." He did however praise the title track and the "Afro-soul" introduction to "Mamunia", calling them "the high points."[52] Christgau ultimately awarded the album a C+ rating, indicating "a not disreputable performance, most likely a failed experiment or a pleasant piece of hackwork."
