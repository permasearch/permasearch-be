Overall the loop of Henle reabsorbs around 25% of filtered ions and 20% of the filtered water in a normal kidney.  These ions are mostly Na+, Cl−, K+, Ca2+and HCO3−.  The powering force is the Na/K ATPase on the basolateral membrane which maintains the ion concentrations inside the cells.  On the luminal membrane, Na enters the cells passively; using the Na-K-2Cl symporter.  Then the Na/K ATPase will pump 3 Na out into the peritubular fluid and 2 K into the cell on the non-lumen side of the cell.  This gives the lumen of the fluid in the loop a positive charge in comparison and creates a Na concentration gradient, which both push more Na into the cell via the Na-H antiporter.  The hydrogen ion for the antiporter comes from the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, which takes water and carbon dioxide and forms bicarbonate and hydrogen ion.  The hydrogen ion is exchanged for the Na in the tubular fluid of the loop of Henle.[3]
