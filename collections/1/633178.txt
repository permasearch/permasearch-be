On July 18, 2015, a handful of information regarding the mid-season finale including the reveal of 'A' was allegedly leaked on Reddit. The person behind the account claimed to have been fired after being a PA at the set of Pretty Little Liars after failing a drug test, and could therefore reveal information about the show.[55] Showrunner I. Marlene King took to Instagram, where she posted a picture and reassured the audience that the claims were false and that the identity of 'A' had not been leaked.[56] ABC Family responded to the leaks, stating, "All of the info on the site is false. No crew member was fired from PLL and we believe it is just a fan spreading incorrect information to rile up the fan base."[55]
