where     m   {\displaystyle m}   is the mass of the object,     g   {\displaystyle g}   is local acceleration of gravity, and     r   {\displaystyle r}   is the distance from the pivot point to the centre of mass of the object. Measuring this frequency of oscillation over small angular displacements provides an effective way of measuring moment of inertia of a body.[17]:516â€“517
