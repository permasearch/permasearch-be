Each game level was devised by a team comprised on an environmental artist and level designer working collaboratively,[citation needed] as opposed to a workflow where the level was designed and then handed over to art teams to be detailed.[citation needed] Level designer Steve Gaynor recalled that by involving the level designer, they could make sure that gameplay spaces still felt like functional, real spaces, making sure that the Rapture of BioShock 2 still felt like a living, breathing world.[citation needed]
