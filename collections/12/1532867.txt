In 2012, the Pirates aggressively pursued and acquired Yankees pitcher A. J. Burnett to bolster their starting pitching staff.  During the first few months of the season, team pitching held up very well, but the offense was sluggish.  However, the bats began to pick up in June as many of the players began to dramatically improve offensively. By the time July hit, the Pirates had soared to first place in the NL Central at the All Star break â€“ the first time the Bucs entered the break at first place since the "Freak Show" team of 1997. Andrew McCutchen would lead the majors in batting average and the "Power of Zoltan" (reference to a character scene in the movie Dude, Where's My Car?) began to sweep PNC Park and the city of Pittsburgh.
