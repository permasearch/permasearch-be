Alara founded the Napatan, or 25th, Kushite dynasty at Napata in Nubia, now Sudan.. Alara's successor Kashta extended Kushite control north to Elephantine and Thebes in Upper Egypt. Kashta's successor Piye seized control of Lower Egypt around 727Â BC,[24] creating the Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt. This continued until about 671 BC when they were deposed by the Neo-Assyrian Empire.
