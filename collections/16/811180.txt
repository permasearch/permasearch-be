No evidence exists of the product being of great importance in Britain before the High Middle Ages, after about AD 1000.[28] Mineral coal came to be referred to as "seacoal" in the 13th century; the wharf where the material arrived in London was known as Seacoal Lane, so identified in a charter of King Henry III granted in 1253.[29] Initially, the name was given because much coal was found on the shore, having fallen from the exposed coal seams on cliffs above or washed out of underwater coal outcrops,[28] but by the time of Henry VIII, it was understood to derive from the way it was carried to London by sea.[30] In 1257â€“1259, coal from Newcastle upon Tyne was shipped to London for the smiths and lime-burners building Westminster Abbey.[28] Seacoal Lane and Newcastle Lane, where coal was unloaded at wharves along the River Fleet, are still in existence.[31] (See Industrial processes below for modern uses of the term.)
