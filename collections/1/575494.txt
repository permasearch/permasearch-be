The Indian economy under the British Raj describes the economy of India during the years of the British Raj, from 1858 to 1947. During this period, the Indian economy essentially remained stagnant, growing at the same rate (1.2%) as the population.[1] India experienced deindustrialization during this period.[2] Compared to the Mughal Era, India during the British colonial era had a lower per-capita income, a large decline in the secondary sector,[3] and lower levels of urbanisation.[4] India's share of the world economy[5] and share of global industrial output declined significantly during British rule from 28% to 2%.[6]
