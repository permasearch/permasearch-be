The band is first mentioned in the unaired Buffy pilot with a title card date of 05/03/96. Xander says, "They donâ€™t know any actual chords yet, but they have really big amps." They did not appear on the show until the second season, in "Inca Mummy Girl," October 6, 1997. Dingoes continued to appear throughout Seasons 3 and 4 until Oz left Sunnydale. A poster of theirs is seen once afterward, in the episode Superstar. Most of their performances took place at The Bronze, Sunnydale's local nightclub.
