Asparagus by nature, Art Bigotti (introduced 1997) is a bowling champion. Although he has yet to have an individual speaking part and has only appeared in one video, as part of the Silly Song High Silk Hat, Art Bigotti has been mentioned in several episodes including when Junior Asparagus unintentionally breaks his dad's rare "Art Bigotti limited edition collector's plate" in Larry-Boy and the Fib from Outer Space!.
