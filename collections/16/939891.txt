Topping the albums chart for the fourth time, Oasis hit the top with their new album, Heathen Chemistry. The album's singles had already received success with "The Hindu Times" becoming their 6th No. 1 and the follow-up single, "Stop Crying Your Heart Out" peaking at #2. The album, however, only spent a week at the top quickly overtaken by the first release in 2 years from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, By the Way. The title track from the album became their highest charting single ever, making #2. This was also their only No. 1 album.
