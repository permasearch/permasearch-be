Now hiding from an FBI agent, Nomi and Neets eventually choose to move-in with her old hacking friend, Bug. She routinely helps out other sensates by being the eyes they cannot have by accessing security cameras in other rooms. She eventually gets tired of hiding from the FBI and gets a pass with the help of Bug. Bug gets the idea to give Nomi an 'E-death' meaning all her records and past crimes will be erased from the government records and she will be free. The E-death successfully works and she is finally able to be the maid of honour at her sister's wedding. During the ceremony however the FBI agent Bendix apprehends her, but without proof of warrant she is able to go free. At the end of season 2, Neets proposes to Nomi and in turn, Nomi proposes to Neets.
