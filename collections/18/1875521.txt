The Citadel Council partitioned the Milky Way into five different sectors, known as the Terminus Systems, the Attican Traverse, Inner and Outer Council Space, and Alliance Space. Earth is a significant setting, particularly in the third installment. A space station known as the "Citadel," left behind by the Protheans, serves as the capitol for the galaxy; most species have an embassy there, and the Council meets there to deliberate matters of galactic import.
