Ratified in 1789, the current North Carolina Constitution contains a Preamble and 14 articles. Each of the articles covers a different area, with the last article including all miscellaneous topics. Each article is further divided into sections. This constitution incorporates amendments into the document, unlike the United States Constitution which only appends amendments.
