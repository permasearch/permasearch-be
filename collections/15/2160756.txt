The younger generation also contributed substantially. Dwijendranath's second son Sudhindranath (1869–1929) was a renowned author. His son Soumyendranath (1901–74) was well known as a leftist politician. Soumyendranath was anti-Nazi and was briefly arrested in 1933 in connection with a plot to assassinate Hitler [1]. Satyendranath's son Surendranath (1872–1940) also had political links. Satyendranath's daughter Indira (1873–1960) distinguished herself in literature, music and in the women's movement. She married Pramatha Chowdhury, a distinguished scholar and writer. The list does not end here. All of them had enormous talent and were brought up in an ideal environment of literary debates and discussions, musical compositions, painting, and theatrical performances. Sharmila Tagore, a well-known Mumbai actress who is connected with Rabindranath Tagore, in an interview stated that her mother's mother, Latika Tagore was the granddaughter of Rabindranath Tagore's brother, Dwijendranath.[37] Pranati Tagore is a renowned and eminent elocutionist, news reader and Bengali actor. She is married to Sunando Tagore, the great grandson to Satyendranath Tagore. Pragnasundari Debi, grand daughter of Maharshi Debendranath Tagore, married the most famous Assam author Sahityarathi Laxminath Bezbarua. She was a literary phenomenon in her own right, her cookbook Aamish O Niramish Ahar (1900, reprinted 1995) was a standard given to every Bengali bride with her trousseau, and earning her the appellation "India's Mrs Beeton".
