After the implementation of the North American Numbering Plan, placing a local call within the caller's area code involved only seven-digit dialing. Callers dialed only the central office code (three digits) and the four-digit station number of the telephone subscriber to reach. For example, a person at a station with the telephone number 212-555-7890 called the number 212-555-3456 by dialing 555-3456.
