Institutions can purchase ready-to-feed formula in containers that can be used as baby bottles.[3] The lid screws off and is replaced by a disposable teat when the formula is ready to be used. This avoids storing the formula with the teat and possibly clogging the teat holes when formula is splashed within the bottle and dries.
