Some commentators have actually expressed concern that United States military and diplomatic interventions in the Middle East and elsewhere might lead, or perhaps have already led, to the existence of American satellite states.[11] William Pfaff has warned that a permanent American presence in Iraq would "turn Iraq into an American satellite state".[12]  The term has also been used in the past to describe the relationship between Lebanon and Syria, as Syria has been accused of intervening in Lebanese political affairs.[13] In addition, Swaziland and Lesotho have both been described as satellite states of South Africa.[14]
