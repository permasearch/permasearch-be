The 2-mile (3.2 km)[72] first phase was built within budget, at $4.45 billion.[72][73] Its construction site was designated as being from 105th Street and Second Avenue to 63rd Street and Third Avenue.[74] Deep bore tunneling methods were to be used in order to avoid the disruptions for road traffic, pedestrians, utilities and local businesses produced by cut-and-cover methods of past generations. Stations were to retain cut-and-cover construction.[75] The total cost of the 8.5-mile (13.7 km) line is expected to exceed $17 billion.[76] In 2014, MTA Capital Construction President Dr. Michael Horodniceanu stated that the whole line may be completed as early as 2029,[77] and would serve 560,000 daily passengers upon completion;[78] however, as of December 2016[update], only Phases 1 and 2 would be completed by 2029.[79] The line is described as the New York City Subway's "first major expansion" in more than a half-century.[80][81] It would add two tracks to fill the gap that has existed since the elevated Second and Third Avenue Lines were demolished in the 1950s.[64] According to the line's final environmental impact statement, the catchment area of the line's first phase would include 200,000 daily riders.[65][82][83][84][83][84]
