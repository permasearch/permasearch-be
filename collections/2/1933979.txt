For Hole 7, which used to be a straight but narrow par 4 with bunkers guarding both sides of the landing area,  Jones recreated the bunker complex on the right side of the hole to punish any player who bails out of a swing.  Jones also moved the green back and to the left in order to bring the creek into play, once again, creating a tough back left pin location.
