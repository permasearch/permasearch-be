All episodes follow a similar format. The episode starts with an introduction by Molly, saying 'Hi: it's me: Molly: and it's time for-' only to be stopped by Gil performing an act related to the episode's subject. One of the two then states 'It's time for Bubble Guppies!', and the theme song plays. After the theme song, the Little Fish say the episode's name.
