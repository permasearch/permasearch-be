Anzac Day has been criticised by a number of Australians and New Zealanders.[108][109] At its inception, Anzac Day faced criticism from the Australian labour movement, and in the country at large, there was opposition to political exploitation of what was seen as a day of mourning.[110] One controversy occurred in 1960 with the publication of Alan Seymour's classic play, The One Day of the Year,[111] which dramatised the growing social divide in Australia and the questioning of old values. In the play, Anzac Day is critiqued by the central character, Hughie, as a day of drunken debauchery by returned soldiers and as a day when questions of what it means to be loyal to a nation or Empire must be raised. The play was scheduled to be performed at the inaugural Adelaide Festival of Arts, but after complaints from the Returned Services League, the governors of the Festival refused permission for this to occur.[112]
