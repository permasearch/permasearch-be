The early rounds of the 2008â€“09 competition were covered for the first time by ITV's online service, ITV Local. The first match of the competition, between Wantage Town and Brading Town, was broadcast live online. Highlights of eight games of each round were broadcast as catch up on ITV Local.[70][71] Since ITV Local closed, this coverage did not continue.
