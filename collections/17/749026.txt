The Great Karoo and Little Karoo lie almost entirely within two of South Africaâ€™s eight botanical biomes,[27] namely the "Succulent Karoo biome" and the "Nama Karoo biome", both of which, like the "Karoo Geological System", are more extensive than the geographical or historical Karoo described in South African atlases and Guide Books (compare the map on the right with the map at the beginning of the article).[4][14][28]
