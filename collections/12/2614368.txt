Due to his size, Gaedel had worked as a riveter during World War II, and was able to crawl inside the wings of airplanes.[5] He was a professional performer, belonging to the American Guild of Variety Artists (AGVA). After the war, Gaedel was hired in 1946 by Mercury Records as a mascot to portray the "Mercury Man." He sported a winged hat similar to the record label's logo, to promote Mercury recordings.[6][7][8] Some early Mercury recordings featured a caricature of him as its logo.[9][10]
