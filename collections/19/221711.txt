Someone has stolen leeks from Tom's allotment. Tom investigates, and is told that Arty Stephenson may know something about it. Arty tells Tom that he chased off two children. Following Arty's lead, Tom and Billy find leak leaves in a dustbin, but tempers cool when they discover the culprits: two emaciated children. Their father was killed whilst off-duty, so their mother, Elsie Carter, doesn't receive a widow's pension. Tom tells Elsie that she's welcome to his leeks.
