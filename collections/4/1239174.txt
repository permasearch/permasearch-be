The abdominal cavity is a large body cavity in humans[1] and many other animals that contains many organs. It is a part of the abdominopelvic cavity.[2] It is located below the thoracic cavity, and above the pelvic cavity. Its dome-shaped roof is the thoracic diaphragm, a thin sheet of muscle under the lungs, and its floor is the pelvic inlet, opening into the pelvis. The abdominal cavity of humans is divided into 4 quadrants: the right upper quadrant (RUQ), the left upper quadrant (LUQ), the right lower quadrant (RLQ) and the left lower quadrant (LLQ). [3]
