Bailey was a pioneer member of the WSM Grand Ole Opry and one of its most popular performers, appearing on the program from 1927 to 1941.[14] During this period he toured with major country stars, including Uncle Dave Macon, Bill Monroe, and Roy Acuff.[15] Like other black stars of his day traveling in the South and West, he faced difficulties in finding food and accommodations because of discriminatory Jim Crow laws.[16]
