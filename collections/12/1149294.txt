Public utilities can be privately owned or publicly owned. Publicly owned utilities include cooperative and municipal utilities. Municipal utilities may actually include territories outside of city limits or may not even serve the entire city. Cooperative utilities are owned by the customers they serve. They are usually found in rural areas. Publicly owned utilities are non-profit.[citation needed] Private utilities, also called investor-owned utilities, are owned by investors,[6][7][8] and operate for profit, often referred to as a rate of return.
