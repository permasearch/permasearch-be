The first claimed detection of mammalian endogenous DMT was published in June 1965: German researchers F. Franzen and H. Gross report to have evidenced and quantified DMT, along with its structural analog bufotenin (5-HO-DMT), in human blood and urine.[84] In an article published four months later, the method used in their study was strongly criticized, and the credibility of their results challenged.[85]
