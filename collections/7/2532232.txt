At the school, Pearson taught a three-hour seminar on foreign relations, with a particular focus on collective security. Though Pearson’s teaching style was largely informal, he took his commitment as a professor seriously, making up missed seminars even as his health began to fail. Pearson once even declined an invitation from U.S. President Richard Nixon to dine at the White House on account of his teaching duties. Pearson also enjoyed engaging with students, though he was apparently not an easy marker and seldom saw fit to make comments on students’ work.[11][12]
