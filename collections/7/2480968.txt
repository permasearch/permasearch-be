The 1983–84 season saw Celtic competing in the UEFA Cup. After a straightforward 5–1 aggregate win over AGF Aarhus in September 1983,[67] Celtic were then drawn against Sporting Lisbon in the second round. The first leg away in Lisbon on 19 October saw Celtic start brightly but fade very quickly, and were fortunate to lose only 2–0. Manager Davie Hay admitted Celtic were "lucky" to not concede more goals, although he insisted that whilst they were in an "awkward position" to salavage the tie, it was not "impossible".[68] Celtic's response two weeks later in the return match in Glasgow saw them produce a performance described by The Herald as "quite brilliant". Tommy Burns ran the show for Celtic and opened the scoring on 17 minutes with a headed goal. Shortly before half-time, Tom McAdam levelled the tie with a powerful shot. On half-time, Brian McClair took a pass from Frank McGarvey, ran 30 yards before shooting in to put Celtic ahead on aggregate. Further goals in the second half from Murdo MacLeod and McGarvey sealed an emphatic 5–0 win on the night, and progression to the third round.[69] Having replaced Billy McNeill as manager in the summer, Davie Hay described the win as "the best performance since I took over".[70] Celtic's next opponents were Nottingham Forest,[67] and a scoreless draw away in the first leg put them in a strong position. Celtic dominated the match, with Forest manager Brian Clough acknowledging that Celtic "played really well" and had been "the best team on the night".[71] The second leg, however, proved to be an anti-climax for Celtic as Forest outplayed them, easing to a 2–1 win on the night to eliminate the Scots.[72]
