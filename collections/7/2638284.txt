Pulp is pumped through a sequence of tanks that are commonly called chests, which may be either round or more commonly rectangular.  Historically these were made of special ceramic tile faced reinforced concrete, but mild and stainless steels are also used.  Low consistency pulp slurries are kept agitated in these chests by propeller like agitators near the pump suction at the chest bottom.
