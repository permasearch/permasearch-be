As of March 2017, the P100D variant holds the record for the fastest acceleration of any production vehicle with a NHRA rolling start to 60 mph in Motor Trend tests with 2.28 seconds (0 to 100 km/h in 2.36 seconds) in ludicrous mode,[77] although other independent tests have placed it behind the Porsche 918 Spyder.[78] Due to overheating issues, Tesla limits the amount of times that a driver is able to use ludicrous mode within a certain amount of time, as driving the car in that mode may shorten the battery's lifespan and can cause damage to the car.[79][80] According to Motor Trend, selecting the "Yes, bring it on!" option for maximum acceleration "initiates a process of battery and motor conditioning, wherein the battery temperature is raised slightly and the motors are cooled using the air-conditioning system. It usually takes just a few minutes, longer in extreme ambient temperatures or after repeated runs. You should expect to wait a minimum of 10 minutes in-between runs."[77]
