The occurrence of planktonic foraminifera across the K–Pg boundary has been studied since the 1930s.[37] Research spurred by the possibility of an impact event at the K–Pg boundary resulted in numerous publications detailing planktonic foraminiferal extinction at the boundary,[28] however, there is ongoing debate between groups that think the evidence indicates substantial extinction of these species at the K–Pg boundary,[38] and those who think the evidence supports multiple extinctions and expansions through the boundary.[39][40]
