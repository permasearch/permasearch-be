When Justinian sought to marry Theodora, he could not: He was heir of the throne of his uncle, Emperor Justin I, and a Roman law from Constantine's time prevented anyone of senatorial rank from marrying actresses. In 525, Justin repealed the law, and Justinian married Theodora.[11] By this point, she already had a daughter (whose name has been lost). Justinian apparently treated the daughter and the daughter's son Athanasius as fully legitimate,[12] although sources disagree whether Justinian was the girl's father.
