The Irish rock band U2 is another important influence on Martin both musically and politically.[18] Martin wrote for Rolling Stone Magazine's "100 Greatest Artists of All Time" on the band,[19] saying: "I don't buy weekend tickets to Ireland and hang out in front of their gates, but U2 are the only band whose entire catalogue I know by heart. The first song on The Unforgettable Fire, "A Sort of Homecoming", I know backward and forward â€“ it's so rousing, brilliant, and beautiful. It's one of the first songs I played to my unborn baby." Martin also comments on Bono's effect on his own charity and political involvement he is even known to joke with friends referring to himself as "Crono".[18]
