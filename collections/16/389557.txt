In July 2006, the Los Angeles Times published a story on the allegations raised in the SCA case.[111] The report cited evidence at the trial including the results of the LNDD test and an analysis of these results by an expert witness.[112] From the Los Angeles Times article: "The results, Australian researcher Michael Ashenden testified in Dallas, show Armstrong's levels rising and falling, consistent with a series of injections during the Tour. Ashenden, a paid expert retained by SCA Promotions, told arbitrators the results painted a "compelling picture" that the world's most famous cyclist "used EPO in the '99 Tour."[111]
