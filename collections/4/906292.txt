The series is presented by motor vehicle and engineering enthusiast Tim Shaw, and musician and mechanic, Fuzz Townshend.[1] Townshend leads a team of car restoration experts who mainly work off camera, though they do have occasional cameos, most notably "Workshop" Phil Palmer's appearances within skits or scripted light-hearted moments taking place within the workshop.
