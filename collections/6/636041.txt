Currency for international travel and cross-border payments is predominantly purchased from banks, foreign exchange brokerages and various forms of bureaux de change. These retail outlets source currency from the inter-bank markets, which are valued by the Bank for International Settlements at 5.3 trillion US dollars per day.[3] The purchase is made at the spot contract rate. Retail customers will be charged, in the form of commission or otherwise, to cover the provider's costs and generate a profits. One form of charge is the use of an exchange rate that is less favourable than the wholesale spot rate.[4] The difference between retail buying and selling prices is referred to as the bid-ask spread.
