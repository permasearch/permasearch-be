A bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA)[1] or bone-anchored hearing device,[2] is a type of hearing aid based on bone conduction. It is primarily suited for people who have conductive hearing losses, unilateral hearing loss, single-sided deafness and people with mixed hearing losses who cannot otherwise wear 'in the ear' or 'behind the ear' hearing aids. They are more expensive than conventional hearing aids, and their placement involves invasive surgery which carries a risk of complications,[2] although when complications do occur, they are usually minor.[3]
