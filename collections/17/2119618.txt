By the Bog of Cats is a play by Marina Carr. By the Bog of Cats premiered at Dublin’s Abbey Theatre in October 1998. A 2004 revival of the play in London’s West End starred Hollywood actress Holly Hunter in the role of protagonist Hester Swane.[1] The play takes place in the Midlands Region of Ireland in an unspecified time in the modern era. It is loosely based on the Greek myth Medea. In this myth, the sorceress Medea marries the hero Jason and has two children with him. When Jason leaves her for another woman, Medea kills their children, Jason’s new bride, and the bride’s father. By the Bog of Cats contains many mystical and mythical elements, including ghosts, magic, and curses. It includes themes of motherhood, betrayal/abandonment, and ethnic prejudice.
