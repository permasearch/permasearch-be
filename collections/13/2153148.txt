In 1871 the Colorado Springs Company laid out the towns of La Font (later called Manitou Springs) and Fountain Colony, upstream and downstream respectively, of Colorado City.[16] Within a year, Fountain Colony would be renamed "Colorado Springs", and was officially incorporated.[17] The El Paso County seat shifted from Colorado City in 1873 to the Town of Colorado Springs.[18] On DecemberÂ 1, 1880, Colorado Springs expanded northward with two annexations.[19] [20]
