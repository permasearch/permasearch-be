Mudclaw, a mottled dark brown tom, is a WindClan warrior introduced in Fire and Ice of the original series,[8]  and is the WindClan deputy from Firestar's Quest[11] to Starlight.[3]  Typically, he is hostile and easy to anger. He routinely attacks cats he finds on WindClan territory without asking for explanations first. Mudclaw is the leader of the patrol that prevents Bluestar from reaching Highstones in Rising Storm,[14] causing her to renounce faith in and declare war on StarClan. Fiercely loyal to WindClan and highly aggressive to all other cats, Mudclaw was appointed deputy of WindClan after the death of Deadfoot. As The New Prophecy series continues, Tallstar continues to grow more ill and Mudclaw takes over many of his duties, often acting as a secondary leader. It also implied that he even occasionally steals prey from the other Clans without his leader's knowledge.
