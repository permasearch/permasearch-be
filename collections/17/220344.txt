One cut Goldenberg had to make, which he "hated" to do, was the absence of Quidditch, the Wizarding sport.[72] "The truth is that any movie made of this book, whoever made it, that had included the Quidditch subplot would have been a lesser film", he said.[71] In the book, Ron grows as a character by trying out for the Quidditch team. "Ron facing challenges and coming into his own in the same way that Harry is, we tried to get that into the film in other ways, as much as possible. So, you feel like, if not the details of that story, at least the spirit of it is present in the film".[71] The change disappointed actor Rupert Grint who had been "quite looking forward to the Quidditch stuff".[73][not in citation given]
