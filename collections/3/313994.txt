Radcliffe first expressed a desire to act at the age of five,[11] and in December 1999, aged 10, he made his acting debut in BBC One's televised two-part adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel David Copperfield, portraying the title character as a young boy.[12] He was educated at three independent schools for boys: Redcliffe School[13], a day school in Chelsea's Redcliffe Square, Sussex House School[14], a day school in Chelsea's Cadogan Square,[15] and the City of London School, a day school on the North Bank of the River Thames in London's financial district (known as the City of London).[16] Attending school became difficult for Radcliffe after the release of the first Harry Potter film, with some fellow pupils becoming hostile, though he says it was people just trying to "have a crack at the kid that plays Harry Potter" rather than jealousy.[17]
