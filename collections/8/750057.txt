Conservative media often clash against the Bulletin. Keith Payne writes in the National Review that the clock overestimates the effects of "developments in the areas of nuclear testing and formal arms control".[23] Tristin Hopper in the National Post acknowledges that "there are plenty of things to worry about regarding climate change", but states that climate change isn't in the same league as total nuclear destruction.[24] In addition, some critics accuse the Bulletin of pushing a political agenda.[21][24][25]
