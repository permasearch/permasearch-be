Sandoval was born to Pablo Sr. and Amelia Sandoval on August 11, 1986, in Puerto Cabello, Carabobo, Venezuela. He practiced baseball in an empty two-car garage with his older brother, Michael. His favorite players were Omar Vizquel (later his teammate on the Giants) and Andr√©s Galarraga. He was born left-handed but wanted to be able to play shortstop like Vizquel. Thus, at nine, he taught himself to throw right-handed as well. He can still throw with both hands, but throws right-handed during games.[1]
