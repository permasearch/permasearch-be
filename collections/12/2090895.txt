Krusty has been included in many Simpsons publications, toys and other merchandise. Krusty-themed merchandise includes dolls, posters, figurines, Jack-in-the-boxes, Pint glasses, bobblehead dolls, costumes, and clothing such as T-shirts.[47] Playmates Toys has made a talking evil Krusty doll, based on the one that appeared in "Treehouse of Horror III".[48] In 1992, Acclaim Entertainment released the video game Krusty's Fun House for PC and home consoles. Krusty was made into an action figure, and several different versions were included as part of the World of Springfield toy line. The first, which shows Krusty in his normal clown attire with several Krusty products, was released in 2000 as part of "wave one".[49] The second, released in 2002 as part of "wave nine", is called "busted Krusty" and shows him in a prison and without his clown makeup, as he was seen in "Krusty Gets Busted".[50] The third was released in 2003 as part of "wave thirteen" and was called "Tuxedo Krusty".[51] Several Krusty themed play sets were also released, including a Krusty-Lu Studios[52] and Krusty Burger playset, both released in 2001.[53] Krusty appears as a playable character in the toys-to-life video game Lego Dimensions, released via a "Fun Pack" packaged with a Clown Bike accessory in November 2015.[54]
