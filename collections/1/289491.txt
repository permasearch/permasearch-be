The first broadcast of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood was on the National Educational Television network on February 19, 1968; the color NET logo appeared on a model building at the beginning and end of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood from 1969 to 1970. When NET closed its doors, the series moved to PBS, even though episodes as late as 1971 were still copyrighted by and produced for NET.[32]
