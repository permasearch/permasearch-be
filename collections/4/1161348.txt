The actual treatment was far different. The hostages described beatings,[78] theft,[79] and fear of bodily harm. Two of them, William Belk and Kathryn Koob, recalled being paraded blindfolded before an angry, chanting crowd outside the embassy.[80] Others reported having their hands bound "day and night" for days[81] or even weeks;[82] long periods of solitary confinement;[83] and months of being forbidden to speak to one another[84] or to stand, walk, or leave their space unless they were going to the bathroom.[85] All of the hostages "were threatened repeatedly with execution, and took it seriously".[86] The hostage-takers played Russian roulette with their victims.[87]
