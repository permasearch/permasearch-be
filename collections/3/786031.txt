To achieve the effect in which water appears to be flowing from subjects' mouths, each video has a segment where the subject's lips are puckered, which is then timed to correspond to the spouting water, reminiscent of gargoyle fountains.[1][32] Each face is cropped so that no hair and usually no ears are visible.[18] Since there is no tripod designed for cameras turned on their sides,[30] an adjustable barber/dentist's chair was used to minimize the need for the movement of the state-of-the-art camera during filming.[25][18] Nonetheless, in some case, digital manipulation was necessary to properly simulate puckering in the exact proper location on the video.[24]  Many of the faces had to be stretched in order to get the mouths properly positioned.[18]  Additionally, each video was color-corrected for brightness, contrast and color saturation.  Both the playback equipment and the final videos had to be further adjusted to account for sunlight during viewing.[18]
