The United States estimated that the IRIAF was able to keep between 15 and 20 F-14s operational by cannibalizing parts from other examples. The IRIAF claims a higher figure, and was able to assemble 25 aircraft for an 11 February 1985 fly-over of Tehran. Despite the embargo,[further explanation needed] Iran was able to acquire parts for its American aircraft, including the F-14, F-4, and F-5. Sources[who?] indicate these came via the Iran-Contra arms deal, collusion with Israel, or from domestic production. Iran has claimed that it has been able to produce all of the parts required, though US intelligence indicates that total is about 70 percent.[citation needed]
