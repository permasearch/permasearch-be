His mother's name is Bolonia (Patricia Rae), but little is known about his father other than he and Bolonia are no longer together.[10] Morgan has implied in at least one episode even his own mother doesn't think much of him.[11] Despite Bolonia's heavy Latin American accent, Morgan does not know how to speak Spanish. Morgan is also the only Hispanic employed at the Burbank Buy More.[8] Morgan has no known siblings but does mention having a nephew. As a child he was teased with the nickname "Organ."[12]
