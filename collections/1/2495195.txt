The season began on 3 April with the defending champions the Kolkata Knight Riders defeating the Delhi Daredevils. Kolkata would then struggle and lose five of their next six matches due to good batting performances only coming from captain Gautam Gambhir and Eoin Morgan.[25] Delhi, who topped the group stage in 2012, had a six-match losing streak due to batting failures apart from three half-centuries from captain Mahela Jayawardene and David Warner.[26] Both Delhi and Kolkata were positioned at the bottom of the points table for the first half of the season.
