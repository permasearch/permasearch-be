In 1928, "My Old Kentucky Home" was "selected and adopted" by the Kentucky state legislature as the state's official song.[19]  It has remained so, subject to one change that was made in 1986.  In that year, a Japanese youth group visiting the Kentucky General Assembly sang the song to the legislators, using the original lyrics that included the word "darkies".  Legislator Carl Hines was offended by this and subsequently introduced a resolution that would substitute the word "people" in place of "darkies" whenever the song was used by the House of Representatives.  A similar resolution was introduced by Georgia Davis Powers in the Kentucky State Senate.  The resolution was adopted by both chambers.[20]
