The name came from a discussion between owner Walter Brown and Howie McHugh, the Bruins/Boston Garden publicist and the man in charge of the upstart new NBA team. McHugh of Irish descent, had just returned from a trip to Ireland and, well aware of the strong and passionate Irish heritage in the Boston area, suggested the name Celtics, which apparently had roots in an original Celtics team in New York in the 1920's. Brown immediately latched onto the name and the Celtics were born. Interestingly, over time some of the scribes of history have been transferring credit of Celtic name to Walter Brown likely due to his status as the owner of the team. The name is pronounced with a soft C, the same as the Scottish football club.
