In 1982, with inflation and the increasing popularity of vending machines, 500-won coins were introduced on June 12, 1982. In January 1983, with the purpose of standardizing the coinage, a new series of 1-, 5-, 10-, 50-, and 100-won coins was issued, using the same layout as the 500-won coins, but conserving the coins old themes.[5]
