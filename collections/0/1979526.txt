In Simon Leng's opinion, "Whether intentionally or not, on 'I Don't Care Anymore', Harrison sounds in danger of coming off the dark racecourse completely", and he comments that, while the "growled gibberish" at the start of the track was designed to be comical, "the real gag was that it mirrored exactly what his voice would sound like on the Dark Horse Tour."[47] Like Leng,[11] AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine dismisses the song as a "throwaway".[48] Writing in Goldmine magazine in 2002, Dave Thompson considered "I Don't Care Anymore" to be "pleasant enough" among the songs from Harrison's Dark Horse period, few of which "could be compared to past triumphs".[49] More impressed, Doug Gallant of the Canadian newspaper The Guardian describes the track as a "little gem".[50]
