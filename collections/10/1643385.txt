On January 23, 2002, students and staff at Juneau-Douglas High School in Alaska were permitted to leave classes[5] to watch the Olympic Torch pass by. Joseph Frederick, who was late for school that day, joined some friends on the sidewalk across from the high school, off school grounds.[6] Frederick and his friends waited for the television cameras so they could unfurl a banner reading "BONG HITS 4 JESUS". Frederick was quoted as saying he'd first seen the phrase on a snowboard sticker.[7] When they displayed the banner, then-principal Deborah Morse ran across the street and seized it.[nb 1]
