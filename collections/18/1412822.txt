The concept for the series began as Stan Lee's answer to fans' questions about what super power he would like to have: luck. After starting up POW!, he and his team considered making a TV series based on such a super power. Neil Biswas then took Lee's original idea and wrote the pilot episode, developing the central character and the world around him. With the help of his writing team, Biswas developed the mythology for the first series: Stan Lee's original idea of a lucky charm that is given to a compulsive gambler became an ancient bracelet that Harry Clayton wakes up with on his wrist after a night spent with the mysterious Eve. With his gambling addiction having cost him his wife and daughter, and being in debt for thousands of pounds to a casino owner, Clayton soon begins to use the bracelet to his own advantage.[4]
