At the University of California, Berkeley, on May 5, 1965, amid a protest march of several hundred people carrying a black coffin to the Berkeley draft board, 40 men burned their draft cards.[27] One of them told reporters the act was symbolicâ€”he said "we can get new cards if we apply for them."[7] On May 22, 1965, the Berkeley draft board was visited again, with 19 men burning their cards. President Lyndon B. Johnson was hanged in effigy.[27]
