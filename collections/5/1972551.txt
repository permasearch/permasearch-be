Deathstroke appears in Injustice: Gods Among Us's chapter 35 of Year Five, the last series before the game. The actions of the Regime has forced Deathstroke into early retirement, causing him to develop a grudge. Batman and Lex Luthor need a Mother Box located in S.T.A.R. Labs that will allow them to pull over doppelgangers from another universe to combat the Regime. Since Batman is the most wanted man on the planet, Deathstroke is the next best person to retrieve it, which he agrees to. He breaks into the facility and is easily able to fend off any soldiers standing guard. When he obtains the Mother Box, he is greeted by Metamorpho before he can leave. He is able to kill him after a tense fight and, realizing he will not get out with the Mother Box, uploads a blueprint of the device and sends it to Batman and Luthor so they can build it themselves. He is captured by Cyborg and Raven. In Ground Zero, which adapts the events of the game, Deathstroke is saved and aids the Insurgency in taking over the Watchtower. When Luthor calls to inform him that he will be using the kryptonite gun on Superman, Deathstroke urges him to use it to kill so they can finally be free of the corrupt Kryptonian.
