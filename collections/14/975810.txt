In most Torrens Title jurisdictions a life tenant has, like in UK and US, the right  to possession and enjoyment of the property, but once the tenant dies the property will return to the remainderman.[7] The main difference is that, the life estate  will be registered by the Registrar general of that jurisdiction, and will appear on the registered title. This has the effect of making them [8] one of the 9 types of recognised  interest in land, and one of the four that confirm possession. The registration process in Torrens title systems usually confers indefeasibility on the life estate.[9][10]
