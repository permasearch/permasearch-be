In mid-November 2012, construction walls went up, blocking off the construction site in Six Flags Plaza.[9] For the new themed section, What the Fried? (restaurant) and Warner Bros. Kids' Club (theater) were demolished before the construction walls went up.[9] By mid-December, the first pieces of Full Throttle's track had arrived on site.[10] In late February, Full Throttle started to become vertical until April 12, 2013 when it was complete.[11][12]
