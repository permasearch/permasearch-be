Dick's entrance was hidden in a drain sump in the washroom of hut 122 and had the most secure trap door.  It was to go in the same direction as Tom and the prisoners decided that the hut would not be a suspected tunnel site as it was more inward than the others.  Dick was abandoned for escape purposes because the area where it would have surfaced was cleared for camp expansion.  Dick was then used to store dirt and supplies, and as a workshop.
