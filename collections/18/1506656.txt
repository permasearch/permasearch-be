Flowers were first planted in Hyde Park in 1860 by William Andrews Nesfield.  The next year, the Italian Water Garden was constructed at Victoria Gate, including fountains and a summer house.  Queen Anne's Alcove was designed by Sir Christopher Wren and was moved to the park from its original location in Kensington Gardens.[16]
