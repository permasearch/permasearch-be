While ratings were lower than those of the third season, the final season is generally regarded by fans and critics as an improvement on the third. Variety's Josef Adalian said that "[the show] is once again in great creative shape". He added that "the scripts are snappy, the plots make sense, the acting's solid, [and] the music is appropriately indie" but criticized Fox for "throwing away" the show by giving it the Thursday 9:00 p.m. timeslot.[25] The difficult timeslot Adalian was referring to was against two other very popular shows, CSI and Grey's Anatomy.[26] With a later start to the season in November the premiere attracted 3.4 million viewers,[2] which was a series low and marked a 55 percent decrease in the 18â€“49 demographic, from the third season premiere.[27] The first half of the season averaged 4.06 million viewers,[28] with the season as a whole averaging 4.6 million viewers.[29] This increase was mostly due to 6.7 million viewers, 76 percent more than the season average, tuning in to see the final ever installment of The O.C.[30]
