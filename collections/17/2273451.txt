As did Avempace and Ibn Tufail, Averroes criticizes the Ptolemaic system using philosophical arguments and rejects the use of eccentrics and epicycles to explain the apparent motions of the moon, the sun and the planets. He argued that those objects move uniformly in a strictly circular motion around the earth, following Aristotelian principles.[62] He postulates that there are three type of planetary motions; those that can be seen with the naked eye, those that requires instruments to observe and those that can only be known by philosophical reasoning.[11] Averroes attempted to redefine astronomy as being based on physics rather than just mathematics as was commonly practiced by Arabic and Andalusian astronomers of his time; later in his life he declared that his attempts had failed.[62][12] Averroes argues that the occasional opaque colors of the moon are caused by variations in its thickness; the thicker parts receive more light from the Sun than the thinner parts.[63]
