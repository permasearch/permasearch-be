Dub is a genre of reggae that was pioneered in the early days by studio producers Lee 'Scratch' Perry and King Tubby. It involves extensive remixing of recorded material, and particular emphasis is placed on the drum and bass line. The techniques used resulted in an even more visceral feel described by King Tubby as sounding "jusâ€™ like a volcano in yuh head."[7] Augustus Pablo and Mikey Dread were two of the early notable proponents of this music style, which continues today.
