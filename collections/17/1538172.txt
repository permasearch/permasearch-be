The war has received widespread criticism and had a dramatic worsening effect on the humanitarian situation, that reached the level of a "humanitarian disaster"[12] or "humanitarian catastrophe".[133][134][135] After the Saudi-led coalition declared the entire Saada Governorate a military target, the UN's Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen and Human Rights Watch said that air strikes by the Saudi-led coalition on Saada city in Yemen were in breach of international law.[136][137] On 1 July UN declared for Yemen a "level-three" emergency – the highest UN emergency level – for a period of six months.[138][139] Human rights groups repeatedly blamed the Saudi-led military coalition for killing civilians and destroying health centers and other infrastructure with airstrikes.[140] The de facto blockade left 78% (20 million) of the Yemeni population in urgent need of food, water and medical aid. Aid ships are allowed, but the bulk of commercial shipping, on which the country relies, is blocked.[141] In one occasion, coalition jets prevented an Iranian Red Crescent plane from landing by bombing Sana'a International Airport's (SIA) runway, which blocked aid delivery via air.[142] As of 10 December, more than 2,500,000 people had been internally displaced by the fighting.[143] Many countries evacuated more than 23,000 foreign citizens from Yemen.[144][145][146] More than 1,000,000 people fled Yemen for Saudi Arabia,[147] Djibouti, Somalia, Ethiopia, Sudan and Oman.[146]
