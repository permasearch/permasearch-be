In America, gold and silver became scarce which made it harder for colonists to trade with Native Americans. The cultivation of tobacco in the Chesapeake area was essential to solving this problem. Without silver and gold to trade to the Indians, colonists traded tobacco for essential natural resources. This started in the 1620s.[14] Tobacco was also used as a currency in the colonies, used for paying fines, taxes, and even marriage licenses.[15]
