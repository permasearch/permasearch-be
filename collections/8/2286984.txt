The evocative theme tune for the TV series was composed by Ken Howard and Alan Blaikley. The series opening titles featured paintings of seemingly pleasant village life, darkened by suspicious looking characters and the shot of a murder victim behind a cricket sight screen. Gossipy women were made to look like they were hiding secrets, whilst the vicar appeared to be hiding in the shadows. For the first four episodes, these paintings were black and white. From "The Murder at the Vicarage" onwards, new, colour drawings replaced these, though they still depicted suspicious looking villagers in the surroundings.
