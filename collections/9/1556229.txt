In the United States, the owner of an Oversize Load often must hire a Pilot Car (flag or escort car) before the Load can be moved on a public roadway . An Oversize Load may exceed one or all normal vehicle dimensions of weight, height, length, width and/or extend beyond the commonly-recognized perimeter of the Load vehicle. All Pilot Cars in an individual state must be uniformly identified with required durable, fade-resistant yellow OVERSIZE LOAD sign (on rooftop or the car’s position bumper) and amber flashing or rotating lights that are visible 360° and at least 100 feet (30 m) away. Those Pilot Cars may legally operate ahead of, behind or in any position relative to the Load that ensures the safe movement of the Load vehicle and all assisting Pilot, Police and Utility vehicles that are necessary for the move.
