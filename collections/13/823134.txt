The feathers and other parts of the red-tailed hawk are considered sacred to many American indigenous people and, like the feathers of the bald eagle and golden eagle, are sometimes used in religious ceremonies and found adorning the regalia of many Native Americans in the United States; these parts, most especially their distinctive tail feathers, are a popular item in the Native American community.[327] As with the other two species, the feathers and parts of the red-tailed hawk are regulated by the eagle feather law,[328] which governs the possession of feathers and parts of migratory birds.[329]
