After releasing three successful singles from Revival, Gomez announced that she had begun recording a follow-up to the album, stating that she was ready to move on from the era. However, in an interview for 97.5 Now FM, Gomez revealed that "Kill Em with Kindness" was going to be released as the album's fourth and final single, saying: "‘Kill Em with Kindness’ is lyrically my favorite song I put on the record and I definitely can’t wait to be able for that to have a story."[7] It was serviced to contemporary hit radio on May 3, 2016.[8] On May 31, 2016, the official cover art for the single was released. It features a lipstick print against a black surface, which Mike Wass of Idolator noted "vaguely ties in with the song’s message of rising above your haters."[9]
