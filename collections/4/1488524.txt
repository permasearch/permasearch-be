Due to a lack of written records on the reasons or motivation for cranial modification, the reason the head was the center of this modification is still not clear. One reason is possibly the need for children to be protected when they are born.[3] The Maya believed when children were born, they were vulnerable and thus needed to be protected from soul loss and evil winds.[3] The soul was encased within the head, and therefore these newly souled infants needed to be guarded; cranium modification was one of the ways to protect the soul from being snatched from the newborn.[3] The head was understood to be a portal into a personâ€™s true essence or essential entity, which could be harmed, stolen, or manipulated.[3] Performing cranial modification as soon as the child was born ensured the soul, or essence, of the child was fully protected.
