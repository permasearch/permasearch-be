Religions can be categorized into how many deities they worship. Monotheistic religions accept only one deity (predominantly referred to as God),[5][6] polytheistic religions accept multiple deities,[7] henotheistic religions accept one supreme deity without denying other deities, considering them as equivalent aspects of the same divine principle;[8][9] and nontheistic religions deny any supreme eternal creator deity but accept a pantheon of deities which live, die, and are reborn just like any other being.[10]:35-37[11]:357-358
