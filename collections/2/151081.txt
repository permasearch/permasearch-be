The original bridge on the spot opened on September 1, 1849, when the PRR began operating over it. The Northern Central Railway began to use it after abandoning their Marysville Bridge. The current bridge was built by Italian laborers, who worked for two contractors (Drake & Stratton Co. and H.S. Kerbaugh), one on the east side of the Susquehanna River and one on the west.[3] Local people from the Harrisburg area also worked on the bridge.
