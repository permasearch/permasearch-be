The Wii console is able to connect to the Internet through its built-in 802.11b/g Wi-Fi or through a USB-to-Ethernet adapter, with both methods allowing players to access the established Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service.[19] Wireless encryption by WEP, WPA (TKIP/RC4) and WPA2 (CCMP/AES) are supported.[20] AOSS support was discreetly added in System Menu version 3.0.[21] Just as for the Nintendo DS, Nintendo does not charge fees for playing via the service[22][23] and the 12 digit Friend Code system controls how players connect to one another. Each Wii also has its own unique 16 digit Wii Code for use with Wii's non-game features.[23][24] This system also implements console-based software including the Wii Message Board. One can also connect to the internet with third-party devices.[25]
