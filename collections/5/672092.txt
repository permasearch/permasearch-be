The theory of constraints (TOC) is an overall management philosophy introduced by Eliyahu M. Goldratt in his 1984 book titled The Goal, that is geared to help organizations continually achieve their goals.[1] Goldratt adapted the concept to project management with his book Critical Chain, published in 1997.
