The mission statement of Habitat for Humanity is "Seeking to put Godâ€™s love into action, Habitat for Humanity brings people together to build homes, communities and hope".[3] Homes are built using volunteer labor and Habitat makes no profit on the sales.[2] In some locations outside the United States, Habitat for Humanity charges interest to protect against inflation. This policy has been in place since 1986. Habitat has helped more than 4 million people construct, rehabilitate or preserve more than 800,000 homes since its founding in 1976, making Habitat the largest not-for-profit builder in the world.[4][5]
