Nitrogenous bases are typically classified as the derivatives of two parent compounds, pyrimidine and purine.[1] They are non-polar and due to their aromaticity, planar. Both pyrimidines and purines resemble pyridine and are thus weak bases and relatively unreactive towards electrophilic aromatic substitution.[2]
