As the Season 4 North American LCS began, TSM was eager to show off its new mid laner Bjergsen. After losing its first match against Cloud9, TSM shook off the loss and won eleven in a row, holding first place for a team-record eight weeks. Although they entered Week 10 with a 19-3 record and a one-game lead over rival Cloud9, the team struggled to close out the season and finished second. TSM's 22 wins were still a team best and tied with Fnatic for fourth best of any team in LCS history.
