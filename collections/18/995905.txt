Columbo is a shrewd but inelegant blue-collar homicide detective whose trademarks include his shambling manner, rumpled beige raincoat, cigar smoking, and generally disheveled appearance. His suspects are often affluent members of high society who try to carefully cover their tracks. Initially dismissive of Columbo's circumstantial speech and apparent absentmindedness, they become increasingly unsettled as his pestering behavior and formidable eye for detail lead him to tease out incriminating evidence. His relentless approach often leads to self-incrimination or an outright confession by the suspect.
