During somitogenesis, a molecular oscillator in paraxial mesoderm cells dictates the precise rate of somite formation. A clock and wavefront model has been proposed in order to spatially determine the location and boundaries between somites. This process is highly regulated as somites must have the correct size and spacing in order to avoid malformations within the axial skeleton that may potentially lead to spondylocostal dysostosis. Several key components of the Notch signaling pathway help coordinate key steps in this process. In mice, mutations in Notch1, Dll1 or Dll3, Lfng, or Hes7 result in abnormal somite formation. Similarly, in humans, the following mutations have been seen to lead to development of spondylocostal dysostosis: DLL3, LFNG, or HES7.[66]
