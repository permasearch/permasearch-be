The EU is negotiating a link with Switzerland's domestic trading system.[107] Distinct emissions trading systems can be linked through the recognition of emissions allowances for compliance. Linking[108] systems creates a larger carbon market, which can reduce overall compliance costs, increase market liquidity and generate a more stable carbon market.[109][110] Linking systems can also be politically symbolic as it shows willingness to undertake a common effort to reduce GHG emissions. Some scholars have argued that linking may provide a starting point for developing a new, bottom-up international climate policy architecture whereby multiple unique systems successively link their various systems.[111][112]
