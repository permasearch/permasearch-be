Additional studies have shown that the mobility of TNT degradation products is likely to be lower “than TNT in subsurface environments where specific adsorption to clay minerals dominates the sorption process.”[37]  Thus, the mobility of TNT and its transformation products are dependent on the characteristics of the sorbent.[37] The mobility of TNT in groundwater and soil has been extrapolated from “sorption and desorption isotherm models determined with humic acids, in aquifer sediments, and soils”.[37]  From these models, it is predicted that TNT has a low retention and transports readily in the environment.[30]
