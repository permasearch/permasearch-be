"Winner(s)" of each episode as chosen by hosts Drew Carey (seasons 1–8) and Aisha Tyler (seasons 9–) are highlighted in italics.  Under Drew Carey, the winner would take his seat and call a sketch for Drew to perform (often with the help of the rest).  Under Aisha Tyler, the winners perform a sketch during the credit roll, just like in the original UK series.
