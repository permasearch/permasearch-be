In the 21st century, eight Indian tribes are officially recognized by Virginia as having ancestral ties to the Powhatan confederation[7]. The Pamunkey and Mattaponi are the only two peoples who have retained reservation lands from the 17th century.[2] The competing cultures of the Powhatan and English settlers were united through unions and marriages of members, of which the most well known was that of Pocahontas and John Rolfe. Their son Thomas Rolfe was the ancestor of many Virginians; many of the First Families of Virginia have both English and Virginia Algonquian ancestry.[1]
