Even before 1752, 1 January was sometimes treated as the start of the new year – for example by Pepys[88] – while the "year starting 25th March was called the Civil or Legal Year".[89] To reduce misunderstandings on the date, it was not uncommon for a date between 1 January and 24 March to be written as "1661/62". This was to explain to the reader that the year was 1661 counting from March and 1662 counting from January as the start of the year.[90] (For more detail, see Dual dating).
