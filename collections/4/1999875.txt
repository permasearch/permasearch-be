Logical partitioning divides hardware resources. Two LPARs may access memory from a common memory chip, provided that the ranges of addresses directly accessible to each do not overlap. One partition may indirectly control memory controlled by a second partition, but only by commanding a process in that partition[clarification needed]. CPUs may be dedicated to a single LPAR or shared. While on Amdahl's MDF(Multiple Domain Feature)[clarification needed] it was possible to configure an LPAR with both shared and dedicated CPUs. This is no longer possible with any mainframes flavours currently in the market.
