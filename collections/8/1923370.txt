Ohio State finished the season with an appearance in the 2006 Fiesta Bowl where they defeated the Notre Dame Fighting Irish 34â€“20.[56][57]  They finished the season ranked No. 4 in the nation.[58] The two teams met the next year in Texas, with Ohio State prevailing 24-7 in a rematch. In 2009, they met again in the Fiesta Bowl, with Texas scoring with 16 seconds left to win 24-21. The two teams haven't met since then. However, they are said to meet in another home and home series in 2022 and 2023, with the 2022 game occurring in Texas and the 2023 game occurring in Columbus. However, this has since been pushed back a ways. Now, the two games are to occur in 2025 and 2026. The 2025 game will be played in Texas, and the 2026 game will be played in Columbus.
