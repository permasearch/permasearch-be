Overarching Mystery Events: The good personality components of all members of previous mystery groups and the people associated with the cursed treasure (among them ex-Mayor Fred Jones Sr., Ed Machine, Cassidy Williams, Ricky Owens, Brad Chiles and Judy Reeves) were sent to the dream dimension where they remained to stay. The very first mystery group, the Hunters of Secrets, was first manipulated by the entity within the sarcophagus; however, they were pure and realized they were being manipulated. They attempted to destroy the entity with a relic referred to as the "Heart of the Jaguar", but never succeeded due to the conquistadors' interruption. The Keys are being used by previous mystery groups (such as the Darrow Family, the Alianza Mysterio, the Fraternitas Mysterium, the Mystery Gang, and the Benevolent Lodge of Mystery) when the gang visits them in the dream world, symbolizing their use with the gates to the cursed treasure. If they destroy the entity, everyone from the dream world would be set free from the curse.
