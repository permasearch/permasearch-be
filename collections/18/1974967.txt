After the switch to HD production, Lisa has also performed occasionally her solo on an instrument other than the saxophone. As of Season 20 to 28, she has played a trumpet, violin or fiddle, tuba, baritone horn, clarinet, theremin, and harp. In this last instance, she drags the instrument with her and continues playing once Mr. Largo orders her out of the room. When Lisa rides home on her bike after she has played a different instrument, she is seen to still have it with her.
