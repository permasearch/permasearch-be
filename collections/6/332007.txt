The average day of work for a firefighter can often be under the sound exposure limit for both OSHA and NIOSH.[23] While the average day of sound exposure as a firefighter is often under the limit, firefighters can be exposed to impulse noise, which has a very low acceptable time exposure before permanent hearing damage can occur due to the high intensity and short duration.[22]
