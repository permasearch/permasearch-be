Model organisms have been used in the study of PTH function. A conditional knockout mouse line called Pthtm1a(EUCOMM)Wtsi was generated at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.[30] Male and female animals underwent a standardized phenotypic screen[31] to determine the effects of deletion.[32][33][34][35] Additional screens performed: - In-depth immunological phenotyping[36]
