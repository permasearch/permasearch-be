Masashi and his twin brother Seishi have been drawing manga together since early childhood, thus their styles are similar.[61] As a result, each has frequently been accused of copying the other, not just artwork, but story elements as well. Seishi notes that the similarities are not intentional but are likely because they were influenced by many of the same things.[62][63]
