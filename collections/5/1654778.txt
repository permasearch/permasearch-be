The first women were admitted to Stevens graduate program in 1967. Stevens undergraduate program became coeducational in 1971.  The Class of 1975 matriculated 19 women, and 40 years later, women make up 25 percent of undergraduates.[34] The change in demographic eventually lead to the establishment of the Lore-El Center, named for Lore E. Feiler, to enhance the learning and social experience of women at Stevens.[35]
