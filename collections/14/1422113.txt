The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) used the terms "radical traditionalist Catholics" to describe those who "may make up the largest single group of serious anti-Semites in America, subscribe to an ideology that is rejected by the Vatican and some 70 million mainstream American Catholics. Many of their leaders have been condemned and even excommunicated by the official church."[27] The SPLC claims that adherents of radical traditional Catholicism "routinely pillory Jews as 'the perpetual enemy of Christ'",[27][28] reject the ecumenical efforts of the Vatican, and sometimes assert all recent Popes are illegitimate.[27] The SPLC says that adherents are "incensed by the liberalizing reforms" of the Second Vatican Council (1962â€“65) which condemned hatred for Jewish people and "rejected the accusation that Jews are collectively responsible for deicide in the form of the crucifixion of Christ"[27] and that "Radical traditional Catholics" also embrace "extremely conservative social ideals with respect to women."[27]
