In response to growing concerns over the inappropriate use of journal impact factors in evaluating scientific outputs and scientists themselves, the American Society for Cell Biology together with a group of editors and publishers of scholarly journals created the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA). Released in May 2013, DORA has garnered support from thousands of individuals and hundreds of institutions,[47] including in March 2015 the League of European Research Universities (a consortium of 21 of the most renowned research universities in Europe),[48] who have endorsed the document on the DORA website.
