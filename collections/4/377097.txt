In season two flashbacks, he is severely wounded by Dr. Ivo's mortar attacks and Oliver injects him with Mirakuru, a strength-enhancing serum left on the island in WWII by Japan, in order to save his life. When Shado is killed, Slade blames Oliver for her death and turns on him. In the present, Slade is alive, now operating as the mercenary "Deathstroke", and plots to destroy Starling City with an army of Mirakuru soldiers working with Sebastian Blood and Isabel Rochev. He undermines Oliver's life by causing him to lose his money and his business, revealing some of Oliver's secrets to Laurel and Thea and killing Moira before unleashing his army on the city. Oliver defeats him when Felicity injects him with the Mirakuru cure and he is imprisoned in an A.R.G.U.S. supermax prison on Lian Yu.
