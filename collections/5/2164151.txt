After hearing the song "Meadowlark" countless times in auditions, director Trevor Nunn persuaded the authors to mount a production. The Baker's Wife, starring Alun Armstrong and Sharon Lee-Hill, premiered at The Wolsey Theatre in Ipswich, Suffolk from October - November,[6] transferring to the West End, Phoenix Theatre on November 27, 1989,[7] and closed on January 6, 1990,[8] after 56 performances. This production, too, was ill-fated: though reviews were strong and audience reaction positive, the production was steadily losing money. According to Carol De Giere, "While reviewers offered praise, audiences were small and the show closed after only 56 performances. Schwartz explains,'The major thing that was wrong was that it was just too long'...Nunn comments 'Every performance there had a standing ovation, which is not at all normal in the English provinces."[9] Bowing to financial reality, the show closed prematurely, but received the Laurence Olivier Award nomination for Musical of the Year.
