The school curriculum was radically modified to eliminate teaching in the Korean language and history.[206] The Korean language was banned, Koreans were forced to adopt Japanese names,[214] and newspapers were prohibited from publishing in Korean. Numerous Korean cultural artifacts were destroyed or taken to Japan.[215] According to an investigation by the South Korean government, 75,311 cultural assets were taken from Korea.[215][216]
