Prior to the construction of its new campus, HHS had occupied the same building since its founding in 1966. The new construction was designed by Charles Williams & Associates architects and cost $54 million.[7] It was built on the site of the former East Town Shopping Center adjacent to the older campus, which was then demolished to make space for the new athletics complex.
