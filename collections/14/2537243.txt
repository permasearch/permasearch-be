In 1956 the State Department of Water Resources reported that Los Angeles was only exporting 320,000 acre feet (390,000,000 m3) of water of the 590,000 acre feet (730,000,000 m3) available in the Owens Valley and Mono Basin. Three years later, the State Water Rights Board warned Los Angeles that they could lose rights to the water they were permitted for but not appropriating.
