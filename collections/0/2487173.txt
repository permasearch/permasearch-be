Albert and Victoria were shot at again on both 29 and 30 May 1842, but were unhurt. The culprit, John Francis, was detained and condemned to death,[45] although he was later reprieved.[46] Some of their early unpopularity came about because of their stiffness and adherence to protocol in public, though in private the couple were more easy-going.[47] In early 1844, Victoria and Albert were apart for the first time since their marriage when he returned to Coburg on the death of his father.[48]
