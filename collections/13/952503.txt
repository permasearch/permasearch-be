In Crown of Aragon and the territories under its influence (Aragon, Catalonia, Northern Catalonia in France, the Balearic Islands, the Valencian Country, among others in the Italian islands), the Gothic style suppressed the transept and made the aisle almost as high as the main nave, allowing it to create very wide spaces, with few ornaments; it is called Catalan Gothic style (different than the Kingdom of Castile or French style).
