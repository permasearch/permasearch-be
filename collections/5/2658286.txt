The title of the album was revealed through the 'Smoking Section' of Rolling Stone magazine on February 2, 2009, where it was also announced that a music video would be filmed for the track "I Want to Kill You Like They Do in the Movies".[36] Throughout March, five rough mixes of songs from the album were leaked.[34] In an interview with a fansite, Chris Vrenna said of the leak: "I hate stealing of music in any form. If a band chooses to put tracks online, that's great. [...] I think true fans know that usually songs found online before the record is released are rough mixes, and will wait to hear the music the way the artist intended."[37] "We're from America" was released as a free download on the band's website from March 27, with a one-track digital single released through online retailers on April 7.[38] A CD single was released on April 14, and was exclusively sold at Hot Topic.[39] It peaked at number three on Billboard's Hot Singles Sales, spending six weeks on the chart.[40]
