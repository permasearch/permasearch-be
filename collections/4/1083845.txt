The Bronco was designed under engineer Paul G. Axelrad. The axles and brakes from the Ford F-100 four wheel drive pickup truck were used, but the front axle was located by radius arms (from the frame near the rear of the transmission forward to the axle). A lateral track bar allowed the use of coil springs that gave the Bronco a 34-foot (10.4Â m) turning circle, long wheel travel, and an anti-dive geometry, which was useful for snowplowing. The rear suspension was more conventional, with leaf springs in a typical Hotchkiss design. A shift-on the-fly Dana transfer case and locking hubs were standard, and heavy-duty suspension was an option.
