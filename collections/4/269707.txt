Shults began writing the film after the death of his father as a way of dealing with the pain.[6] Although the film is post-apocalyptic Shults did not look to any other such films as inspiration; instead, he cited the work of Paul Thomas Anderson and John Cassavetes and the films Night of the Living Dead and The Shining as inspirations. To the later point, the film takes some influences from The Shining's Overlook Hotel in that the layout of the house is specifically obscure and never properly established. Shults has described it "as this kind of labyrinth" and a metaphor for "the mesh of Travisâ€™ head."[6]
