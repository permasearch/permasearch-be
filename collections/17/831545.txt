While his father, James Unaipon (c.1835-1907), contributed to accounts of aboriginal mythology written by the missionary George Taplin,[22] David Unaipon (1872–1967) provided the first accounts of aboriginal mythology written by an aboriginal: Legendary Tales of the Aborigines. For this he is known as the first Aboriginal author. Oodgeroo Noonuccal (1920–1995) (born Kath Walker) was an Australian poet, political activist, artist and educator. She was also a campaigner for Aboriginal rights.[23] Oodgeroo was best known for her poetry, and was the first Aboriginal Australian to publish a book of verse We Are Going (1964).[24]
