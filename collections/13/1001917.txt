The Spaniards prevented food and water from reaching Tenochtitlan along the three causeways. They limited the supplies reaching the city from the nine surrounding towns via canoe, by sending out two of their launches on nightly capture missions.

They captured two Spanish launches, killing Captain de Portilla and Pedro Barba.[25]:368–69, 382–83
