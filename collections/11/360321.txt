A player who declares for the draft will lose his college eligibility, even if he is not drafted, if he signs with any agent.[24] Before 2016, the NCAA only allowed a player to enter the draft once without losing eligibility,[22] but current NCAA rules now allow players to declare for and withdraw from multiple drafts while retaining college eligibility.[23] The CBA allows a player to withdraw twice.[20]
