An important innovation was the invention of the stirrup. From early Indian invention,[177][178] which allowed cavalrymen to be much more effective in combat; this innovation later spread to East north and west via the nomadic populations of central Asia and to west by the Avars. However, some believe northern nomads were responsible for this innovation.[179][180][181]
