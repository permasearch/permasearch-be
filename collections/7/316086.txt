The 2001–2006 Mazda Tribute was available as front- or four-wheel drive and featured a plain-looking but comfortable roomy interior, decent handling and car-like ride. The Tribute and Escape debuted in 2000, offering front or all wheel drive and a choice of a transversely mounted 2.0 L Ford Zetec 4-cylinder engine with 129 PS (95 kW)/183 N·m (135 lb·ft), or 3.0 L Ford Duratec V6 with 203 PS (150 kW)/265 N·m (195 lb·ft). The 2.0 L 4-cylinder engine had Timing belt driven Camshafts, while the 3.0 L Duratec V6 featured a maintenance-free timing chain.[16]
