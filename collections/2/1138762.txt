Markers were also placed in another major stopping point of the Great Western Cattle Trail: Seymour, Texas. One marker was erected in 1972 by the Seymour Historical Society, another four have been added since. Seymour was historically a popular campsite for cowboys since it was a major supply center. In fact, both Cowboys and Indians alike mingled in peace. In part due to the Great Western Cattle Trail's traffic, Seymour was seen as an ideal place to host a Cowboy Reunion. Jeff Scott was the retired Cowboy who broached the idea and it 'took'. In 1896 the Cowboy's Reunion was organized and had 10,000 spectators. The following year, 1897, Native American Chief Quanah Parker attended the Reunion, where he performed war dances with 300-500 of his Braves. The tradition of the Cowboy Reunion still continues today, except that it is now called the Seymour Rodeo and Reunion, and occurs on the second weekend of each July.
