I completely agree. Which is why I do not understand that there is not a larger and more serious and thorough criticism section. Seeing as it is more than a little blatantly obvious that there are large amounts of well documented historic criticism publicly available from enough reputable sources. As it is, the article makes it seem as if there has been little no historic controversy. It sort of defies both logic and intellectual honesty.Nunamiut (talk) 10:40, 24 August 2009 (UTC)
