In February 2009, the ECI banned the publishing of all exit polls starting 48 hours before Phase 1 of the election until the end of Phase 5. This was intended to prevent exit polls from earlier phases affecting voter decisions in later phases.[53] The ban ended with the close of Phase 5 voting at 5:00 pm IST on 13 May.
