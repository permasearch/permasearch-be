Before he became a contract killer, Kuklinski worked in a warehouse in New Jersey, and met and married Barbara Pedrici. She claimed in a later interview that once, during an argument in a car, she told Richard she did not want to stay in the car, felt a pain in her neck and, when she touched it, felt and saw blood. Kuklinski told her, "That is an object lesson: never leave me." She claimed he stabbed her.
