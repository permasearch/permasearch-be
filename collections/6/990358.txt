On January 13, 2013, a JAL 787 at Narita International Airport outside Tokyo was found to also have a fuel leak during an inspection, the third time a fuel leak had been reported within a week. The aircraft reportedly was the same one that had a fuel leak in Boston on January 8.[316] This leak was caused by a different valve; the causes of the leaks are unknown.[317] Japan's transport ministry has also launched an investigation.[318]
