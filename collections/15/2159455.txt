A BBC spokeswoman denied this, saying, "Speculation is rife about returning characters but this is not true. However, as with all characters, we would never say never."[25] Talking about these rumours she replied,"No, [it's] not for me."[26] It was again reported in August 2011, that Ryan was returning, for a Christmas special. They reported that she was "excited" over possible storylines with Wallace and Richie. A BBC spokesperson dismissed the rumours, telling Digital Spy that there are no plans for Zoe to return.[27]
