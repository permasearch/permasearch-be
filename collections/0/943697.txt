At the time of European settlement of the valley, Dakota and Ojibwe were engaged in a long and deadly war with each other.  Consequently, the portion of the river below the confluence with Trade River is called Jiibayaatig-ziibi (Grave-marker River) in the Ojibwe language,[9] reinforcing the earlier "RiviÃ¨re Tombeaux" name in their language.
