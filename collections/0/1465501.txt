Writer-director Nick Gillespie had collaborated with executive producer Ben Wheatley on several films previously, including Kill List.  Smiley had also appeared in that film.  Besides Wheatley, Gillespie cited Clive Barker as an influence.  Although the film was not meant to be deeply political, Gillespie used imagery reminiscent of the Abu Grahib Prison Scandal to subvert viewer expectations about the prisoners.  When they are revealed to be young women, Gillespie said it is meant to signify that "something's not quite right there".  Of the film's plot, Gillespie said it was designed to allow viewers to come to their own conclusions, as he found it more interesting to offer clues than direct answers.[4]
