Salt Lake City is the headquarters for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and has many LDS-related sites open to visitors. The most popular is Temple Square, which includes the Salt Lake Temple (not open to the general public) and visitors' centers open to the public, free of charge. Temple Square also includes the historic Tabernacle, home of the world-famous Mormon Tabernacle Choir. The modern LDS Conference Center is located across the street to the north. The Family History Library, the world's largest genealogical library, is just west of Temple Square. It is run by the LDS Church and is open to the public and free of charge. Next to Temple Square is also the Eagle Gate Monument.
