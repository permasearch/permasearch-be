Relegation continued in 1994 and 1995;[89] but in 1996 a different pre-selection system was used, in which nearly all the countries participated. Audio tapes of all the songs were sent to juries in each of the countries some weeks before the television show. These juries selected the songs which would be included in the international broadcast.[90] Norway, as the host country in 1996 (having won the previous year), automatically qualified and so did not need to go through pre-selection.
