The clearomizer was invented in 2009 that originated from the cartomizer design.[56] It contained the wicking material, an e-liquid chamber, and an atomizer coil within a single clear component.[56] This allows the user to monitor the liquid level in the device.[56] Clearomizers or "clearos", are like cartotanks, in that an atomizer is inserted into the tank.[59] There are different wicking systems used inside clearomizers.[3] Some rely on gravity to bring the e-liquid to the wick and coil assembly (bottom coil clearomizers for example) and others rely on capillary action or to some degree the user agitating the e-liquid while handling the clearomizer (top coil clearomizers).[3] The coil and wicks are typically inside a prefabricated assembly or "head" that is replaceable by the user.[60]
