According to some scholars, these words mean that the whisperer whispers evil into the hearts of two kinds of people: the jinn and the men. If this meaning is admitted, the word nās would apply to both jinn and men. They say that this can be so, for when the word rijāl (men) in the Quran has been used for the jinn, as in Al-Jinn: 6, and when nafar can be used for the single of jinn, or human as in Al-Ahqaf: 29, men and jinn both can be included metaphorically in the word nās also. But this view is wrong[citation needed], because the words nās, ʾins and ʾinsān are even lexically contrary in meaning to the word jinn. The actual meaning of jinn is hidden creation and jinn is called jinn because he is hidden from man's eye. On the contrary, the words nās and ʾins are spoken for ʾinsān (man) only on the basis that he is manifest and visible and perceptible. In Surah Al-Qasas: 29, the word anasa has been used in the meaning of ra'a, i.e. "the Prophet Moses saw a fire in the direction of Tur. " In Surah An-Nisa': 6, the word anastum has been used in the meaning of ahsastum or ra'aytum (i.e. if one perceives or sees that the orphans have become capable). Therefore, nās cannot apply to jinn lexically, and the correct meaning of the verse is: "from the evil of the whisperer who whispers evil into the hearts of men, whether he be from among the jinn or from the men themselves." In other words, whispering of evil is done by devils from among jinn as well as by devils from among men and the prayer in this surah has been taught to seek refuge from the evil of both. This meaning is supported by the Qur'an as well as by the Hadith. The Qur'an says: "And so it has always been that We set against every Prophet enemies from among devils of men and devils of jinn, who have been inspiring one another with charming things to delude the minds."
