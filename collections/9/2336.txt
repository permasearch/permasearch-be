The full tour announcement came on April 1, 2016, when the band announced 20 cities as part of a North American leg of the tour dubbed "Not in This Lifetime...".[35] The tour's name is a reference to a 2012 interview in which Rose, when asked about when a potential reunion would happen, responded "not in this lifetime."[35] The reunion was billed as a "regrouping" by the band instead of a full reunion, since Slash and McKagan were filling empty spots in the existing band lineup.[36] Additional dates in Chicago, New England, New York, and Los Angeles were announced on April 25 due to shows selling out.[37] On May 18, Alice In Chains and Lenny Kravitz were announced as openers for select shows of the tour.[38][39][40] Two weeks before the tour began, The Cult, Chris Stapleton, Billy Talent, and Skrillex were announced as additional openers for select shows.[41] On June 30, Wolfmother and Tyler Bryant & The Shakedown were announced for several shows.[42] Zakk Wylde was added as an additional opener to the band's show of August 15 in Glendale, Arizona.[43]
