In the United States, radio was so widely used for propaganda that it greatly exceeded the use of other media that was typically used against other nations.[43] President Roosevelt's fireside chats are an excellent example of this use of radio.[44] In February 1941, Norman Corwin's This is War series was broadcast throughout the country and, by shortwave, throughout the world.[45] Other significant uses of radio overseas includes messages to the Italian Navy, which persuaded it to surrender.[46] CBS Radio's counterpropaganda series Our Secret Weapon (1942â€“43), featuring writer Rex Stout representing Freedom House, monitored Axis shortwave radio propaganda broadcasts and rebutted the most entertaining lies of the week.[47]:529
