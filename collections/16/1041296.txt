Vertical equity usually refers to the idea that people with a greater ability to pay taxes should pay more.  If the rich pay more in proportion to their income, this is known as a proportional tax; if they pay an increasing proportion, this is termed a  progressive tax, sometimes associated with redistribution of wealth.[4]
