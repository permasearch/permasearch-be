Walking out of her barn in "The Silence of the E. Lamb", Melissa is greeted by Spencer who asks her when she got back, to which Melissa replies "last night". Spencer further questions Melissa about their father's whereabouts and she replies that he's staying at her apartment in London, taking some time for himself. Afterwards, Melissa asks Spencer if anyone had been in the barn lately, to which Spencer divulges the last person to crash there was her sober buddy, prompting Melissa to make a remark on how he was a lousy housekeeper. Spencer informs Melissa that Peter wants to sell the house, and Melissa suggests they should, only for her sister to insist that it's their home. Lifting up a garbage bag, Melissa starts to walk away until Spencer grabs the item and drops it after finding a dead rat in a trap. Shaking her head, Melissa picks up the rat trap and garbage bag, before dropping the animal into a bin and making a snarky comment on how "she needs to wash her hands". Later, as Melissa walks down the stairs after having taken up food to Veronica, Spencer asks if their mother ate anything, to which Melissa answers “just some salad”. Melissa mentions their mother lacked appetite, and Spencer points out that Veronica knows she's more supportive of Peter. Melissa insists she’s not taking sides, but Spencer doesn’t believe it, reminding her sister that she’s letting Peter stay in her apartment. Melissa affirms that the two of them fighting isn’t helping anything, and that things are bad enough between Veronica and Peter. Spencer deduces that the tension that's been pitting their family against one another is about Alison, and what really happened to the girl who ended up in her grave. Getting emotional, Melissa asserts Spencer she’s right, but that it's "still about love".
