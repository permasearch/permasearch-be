The controversial treaty was eventually approved on February 6, 1899, by a vote 57 to 27, only one vote more than the two-thirds majority required.[25] Only two Republicans voted against ratification, George Frisbie Hoar of Massachusetts and Eugene Pryor Hale of Maine. Senator Nelson W. Aldrich had opposed entry into the Spanishâ€“American War, but supported McKinley when it began. He played a central role in winning two-thirds Senate approval of the Treaty of Paris.[26]
