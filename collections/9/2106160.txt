From 1940 to 1945, the Aggies had a revolving door of coaching changes as the team had four different head coaches, Homer Harris, Roland Bernard, Charles DeBerry, and Charles Carter within a five-year span. Of the coaches during this time period, DeBerry was the only man to lead the team for more than one season.[4] In 1943 DeBerry led the Aggies to their second undefeated season in the team's history. That season, the Aggies would compete in their first post-season bowl game, as the team defeated Southern, 14–12, in the Flower Bowl. Over the three seasons DeBerry led the Aggies, he compiled a record of 13–12–1.
