Market failures are often associated with time-inconsistent preferences,[5] information asymmetries,[6] non-competitive markets, principalâ€“agent problems, externalities,[7] or public goods,[8] thus existence of a market failure is often the reason that self-regulatory organizations, governments or supra-national institutions intervene in a particular market.[9][10] Economists, especially microeconomists, are often concerned with the causes of market failure and possible means of correction.[11] Such analysis plays an important role in many types of public policy decisions and studies. However, government policy interventions, such as taxes, subsidies, bailouts, wage and price controls, and regulations (including poorly implemented attempts to correct market failure), may also lead to an inefficient allocation of resources, sometimes called government failure.[12]
