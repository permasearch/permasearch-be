Some researchers suggest that by 2050 there could be more plastic than fish in the oceans by weight,[36] with about 8,800,000 metric tons (9,700,000 short tons) of plastic being discharged into the oceans annually.[150] Single-use plastics, such as plastic shopping bags, make up the bulk of this, and can often be ingested by marine life, such as with sea turtles.[151] These plastics can degrade into microplastics, smaller particles that can affect a larger array of species. Microplastics make up the bulk of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, and their smaller size is detrimental to cleanup efforts.[152]
