Washington had given charge of the crossing logistics to his chief of artillery, the portly Henry Knox. In addition to the crossing of large numbers of troops (most of whom could not swim), he had to safely transport horses and eighteen pieces of artillery over the river. Knox wrote that the crossing was accomplished "with almost infinite difficulty", and that its most significant danger was "floating ice in the river".[29] One observer noted that the whole operation might well have failed "but for the stentorian lungs of Colonel Knox".[29] Ice had formed in the river due to the Little Ice Age.[30]
