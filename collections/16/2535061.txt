Zoey's boyfriend, James, gives her a necklace with the inscription I love you â€“ James. Zoey, however, is still unsure about how she feels about James. This leads to Zoey's eventual break up with James when she admits "something's in the way". When she offers to return the necklace, James insists that she keep it, saying he will still love her. They each agree to remain friends. Dateless for the prom, Zoey stubbornly refuses to attend despite the efforts of her friends to cheer her up. The night of prom, Zoey is wandering around the empty campus when she gets a phone call from Chase. During their conversation, Zoey turns around to see that Chase has returned to PCA. After making a clumsy entrance, Zoey and Chase share their first kiss. Zoey then realizes that the reason she didn't love James was because she was in love with Chase the entire time. At the prom, Zoey and Chase announce their relationship to their ecstatic friends. Zoey invites Chase to stay with her in Hawaii for the summer, which Chase gladly accepts.
