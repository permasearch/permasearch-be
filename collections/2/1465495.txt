Reeves and Gantz find mercenaries, whom they refer to as "group D", and two other captives, all decapitated, in a barn. As they return, they hear music from a storage container. They find a woman inside, who panics when they turn off the music. Karlsson sedates her and Smith orders her brought along. An enemy flare is shot off, and Smith orders a retreat, leaving Capper behind. Gantz and Evan fire at a hooded figure before retreating, but Evan returns as Capper calls out. The rest flee through a field until they encounter an abandoned armoured personnel carrier. Seeking refuge, they throw out its cargo while Gantz fires at another hooded figure. One of the prisoners stabs Gantz, and Reeves kills her.
