Cinderella (voiced by Amy Sedaris) is one of Princess Fiona's friends. She wears her pair of glass slippers throughout the events of Shrek the Third. She uses her glass slipper as a weapon, somewhat like a boomerang. She is obsessed with cleanliness and tidiness after doing a great deal of housework for her stepmother and stepsisters (revealed to be Doris and Mabel).
