On the first season of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, Briscoe makes three guest appearances assisting his old boss, Captain Cragen (one of these reunions involves re-opening a serial murder case that Briscoe and Logan had failed to solve several years earlier in the 1994 episode "Mayhem"[36]). Briscoe also makes a guest appearance in the Law & Order: Criminal Intent episode "Poison" with his former partner Ed Green, in which he assists the Major Case Squad on a similar case. He also appeared in three episodes of Homicide: Life on the Street.
