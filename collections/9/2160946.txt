where     M   {\displaystyle M}   is the mass of the gyroscope,         v →      C M     2   =  Ω  2    R  2    sin  2   ⁡ δ =   c o n s t a n t     {\displaystyle {\vec {v}}_{\rm {CM}}^{\,2}=\Omega ^{2}R^{2}\sin ^{2}\delta ={\rm {constant}}}   is the squared inertial speed of the origin of the coordinates of the final coordinate system (i.e. the center of mass). This constant term does not affect the dynamics of the gyroscope and it can be neglected. On the other hand, the tensor of inertia is given by
