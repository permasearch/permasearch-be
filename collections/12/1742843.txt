The second generation Fusion was built with a 122 mm (4.8 in) longer wheelbase than the outgoing model's CD3 platform, is 28 mm (1.1 in) bigger overall, 18 mm (0.7 in) wider, and 31 mm (1.2 in) taller. In contrast to the front double wishbone suspension of the first generation Fusion, at front are MacPherson struts, and at rear is a multi-link rear suspension. Despite larger exterior dimensions, some aspects of the interior have shrunk, including the trunk, which fell slightly from 467 to 453 L (16.5 to 16.0 cu ft).
