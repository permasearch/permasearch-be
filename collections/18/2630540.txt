To thunderous applause from the New York crowd,[89][90] Harrison appeared on stage along with his temporary band, comprising Ringo Starr, a very sick[16] Eric Clapton, Leon Russell, Billy Preston, Klaus Voormann, Jim Keltner and eighteen others.[91] Backed by this "full Phil Spector/All Things Must Pass rock orchestra",[92] Harrison began the Western portion of the concert with "Wah-Wah", followed by his Beatles hit song' "Something" and the gospel-rocker "Awaiting on You All".[87] Harrison then handed the spotlight over to Preston, who performed his only sizeable hit (thus far), "That's the Way God Planned It",[93] followed by Starr, whose song "It Don't Come Easy" had recently established the drummer as a solo artist.[94][95][nb 8] Nicholas Schaffner was in the audience for this first show and later described Starr's turn as having received the "biggest ovation" of the afternoon.[8]
