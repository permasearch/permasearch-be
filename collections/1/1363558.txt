As a result of the Partitions, Poles were forced to seek a change of status quo in Europe.[16][17] Polish poets, politicians, noblemen, writers, artists, many of whom were forced to emigrate (thus the term Great Emigration), became the revolutionaries of the 19th century, as desire for freedom became one of the defining parts of Polish romanticism.[18][19] Polish revolutionaries participated in uprisings in Prussia, the Austrian Empire and Imperial Russia.[20] Polish legions fought alongside Napoleon[21][22] and, under the slogan of For our freedom and yours, participated widely in the Spring of Nations (particularly the Hungarian Revolution of 1848).[20][23]
