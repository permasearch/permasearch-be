The 3D printer head or 3D printer extruder is a part in material extrusion-type printing responsible for raw material melting and forming it into a continuous profile. A wide variety of materials are extruded, including thermoplastics such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polylactic acid (PLA), high-impact polystyrene (HIPS), thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), aliphatic polyamides (nylon),[1] and recently also PEEK.[2] Paste-like materials such as ceramics and chocolate can be extruded using the fused filament process and a paste extruder.[3]
