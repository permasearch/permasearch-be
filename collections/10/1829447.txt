As noted above, prior BCG vaccination can produce false positive TST results. In a study of military personnel returning from missions, about one-half of the positive TSTs were falsely positive.[7] In a more recent study of military returning from missions, Franken et al.[8] reported evidence suggesting false positive TST results are common and that QFT testing could guide more targeted treatment and alleviate unnecessary anti-tuberculous treatment.
