Prior to the start of the tournament, hopes were not as high for Germany as in previous tournaments (even in Germany itself), even though it was the host nation. Critics pointed out the apparent lack of quality players in the squad and coach Klinsmann's decision to live in America rather than Germany. However, Germany won the opening game of the World Cup against Costa Rica 4–2.[62] They continued to develop both confidence and support across the group stage, conceding no further goals as they beat Poland 1–0[63] and Ecuador 3–0, with Miroslav Klose scoring twice and Lukas Podolski adding another in the last match.[64] Germany finished on top of their group with three wins. The team went on to defeat Sweden 2–0 in the round of 16, with Lukas Podolski netting both goals in only 12 minutes, from assists by Miroslav Klose.[65]
