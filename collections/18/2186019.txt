And the city and mind of many a people he knew,  And many a woe he endur'd on the face of the deep  To win both life for himself and his comrades' return;  Yet for all his striving he brought not his company home,  For they by their own blindness at last were stroy'd,  Fools! who ate of the sacred beeves of the Sun  And he, Hyperion, ras'd out their day of return:  Sing, then, O daughter of Zeus, that Wanderer's tale.
