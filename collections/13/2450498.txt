The Kepler team originally promised to release data within one year of observations.[202] However, this plan was changed after launch, with data being scheduled for release up to three years after its collection.[203] This resulted in considerable criticism,[204][205][206][207][208] leading the Kepler science team to release the third quarter of their data one year and nine months after collection.[209] The data through September 2010 (quarters 4, 5, and 6) was made public in January 2012.[210]
