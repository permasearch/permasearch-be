After so many drunk driving convictions, some provinces, such as Nova Scotia,[9] will impose a lifetime driving ban, with no possibility of license reinstatement. Ontario[10] courts, however, have the power to enact lifetime driving bans, with no possibility of reinstatement, after so many Criminal Code driving convictions. Under such circumstances, ignition interlock conditions are not put in place on the person's license.
