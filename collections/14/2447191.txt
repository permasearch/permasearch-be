In response to the rural recession of the 1980s, the Government conducted a Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport to advise on the most efficient and cost-effective grain distribution system for Australia's future needs. The Commission's recommendations included deregulation of the wheat distribution system to minimise costs.
