Lyndon B. Johnson nominated Abe Fortas, then an associate justice, for Chief Justice. Fortas would have succeeded Earl Warren, who had decided to retire. Controversy ensued regarding Fortas's extrajudicial activities, and at Fortas's request, Johnson withdrew the nomination prior to a vote of the full Senate.[40] Fortas's nomination was also opposed by many senators who opposed the rulings of the Warren Court.[21] President Nixon instead filled the vacancy caused by Warren's retirement with Warren Burger.
