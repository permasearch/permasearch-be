In September 2011, Rowling was named a "core participant" in the Leveson Inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the British press, as one of dozens of celebrities who may have been the victim of phone hacking.[227] On 24 November 2011, Rowling gave evidence before the inquiry; although she was not suspected to have been the victim of phone hacking,[228] her testimony included accounts of photographers camping on her doorstep, her fiancÃ© being duped into giving his home address to a journalist masquerading as a tax official,[228] her chasing a journalist a week after giving birth,[221] a journalist leaving a note inside her then-five-year-old daughter's schoolbag, and an attempt by The Sun to "blackmail" her into a photo opportunity in exchange for the return of a stolen manuscript.[229] Rowling claimed she had to leave her former home in Merchiston because of press intrusion.[229] In November 2012, Rowling wrote an article for The Guardian in reaction to David Cameron's decision not to implement the full recommendations of the Leveson inquiry, saying she felt "duped and angry".[230]
