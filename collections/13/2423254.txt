The Ravens converted three first-quarter turnovers by Patriots quarterback Tom Brady into 17 points on their way to a 24â€“0 lead New England could not recover from. It was the Patriots' first home loss of the season and their first home playoff loss in more than 30 years. On top of that, it was the Ravens' first ever win against the Patriots after five consecutive losses.
