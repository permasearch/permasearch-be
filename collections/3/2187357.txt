The ring burglarized the home of Audrina Patridge on February 22, 2009, the night of the that year's Academy Awards ceremony. They accessed her home in Hollywood Hills by entering through an unlocked door, and took jewelry, her passport, her laptop computer, and custom-fit jeans. The value of what they took was estimated to amount to around $43,000.[7] Lee and Prugo were recorded on Patridge's surveillance videos, which she uploaded to her website. Despite the videos being posted, the burglaries continued.[7]
