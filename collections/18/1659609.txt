105 years before the events of Fairy Tail, six-year-old Mavis Vermillion lives on Sirius Island as a servant of the Red Lizard (赤い蜥蜴 (レッドリザード), Reddo Rizādo) wizards' guild. A violent skirmish breaks out between Red Lizard and Blue Skull (青い髑髏 (ブルースカル), Burū Sukaru), a rival guild, leaving Mavis the apparent sole survivor alongside Zera, the young daughter of Red Lizard's master. Seven years later, a band of treasure hunters—Yuri Dreyar, Precht Gaebolg, and Warrod Sequen—come to the island in search of its sacred relic, the Sirius Orb (天狼玉, Tenrōgyoku). As Mavis and Yuri contend over ownership of the orb, they discover it has already been taken by Blue Skull. Mavis proposes she and Zera accompany the treasure hunters to recover the orb.
