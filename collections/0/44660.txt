The Spanish campaign began in February 1519, following the Spanish arrival in Yucatán in 1517. Two years later the Spanish set sail, thus beginning the campaign of colonization of the Americas.[3] The Spanish campaign declared victorious on August 13, 1521, when a coalition army of Spanish forces and native Tlaxcalan warriors led by Hernán Cortés and Xicotencatl the Younger captured the emperor Cuauhtemoc and Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec Empire.
