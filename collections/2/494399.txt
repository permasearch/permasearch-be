Because they are used to refer to an individual entity, proper names are, by their nature, definite; so a definite article would be redundant, and personal names (like John) are used without an article or other determiner. However, some proper names (especially certain geographical names) are usually used with the definite article. These have been termed weak proper names, in contrast with the more typical strong proper names, which are normally used without an article. Entities with weak proper names include geographical features (e.g. the Mediterranean, the Thames), buildings (e.g. the Parthenon), institutions (e.g. the House of Commons), cities and districts (e.g. The Hague, the Bronx), works of literature (e.g. the Bible), and newspapers and magazines (e.g. The Times, The Economist, the New Statesman).[15] Plural proper names are weak. Such plural proper names include mountain ranges (e.g. the Himalayas), and collections of islands (e.g. the Hebrides).[15]
