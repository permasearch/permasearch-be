Taylor is a surname used in the British Isles of French and Latin origin which originated as a Norman occupational surname (meaning tailor) in France[1][2] It is derived from the Old French tailleur ("cutter"),[3] which is in turn derived from the Late Latin taliator, from taliare ("to cut").[4][5] The first historical evidence of the surname dates to the County of Somerset, South West England in 1182.[6] "Taylor" is the fifth-most common surname in England, the 11th-most common in Scotland and the 22nd-most common in Wales.[1][7] It is also common in other English speaking countries (especially Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States, where it was the tenth most frequently encountered surname in the 2000 US Census),[8] but has a low incidence in Ireland, where it is mostly concentrated in the North.[1] It is often the anglicized form of the German surname Schneider.[9]
