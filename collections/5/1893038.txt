On 25 September 1965, Surtees had a life-threatening accident at the Mosport Circuit (Ontario, Canada) while practising in a Lola T70 sports racing car.[2] A front upright casting had broken. A.J. Baime in his book Go Like Hell says Surtees came out of the crash with one side of his body four inches shorter than the other.[11] Doctors set most of the breaks nonsurgically, in part by physically stretching his shattered body until the right-left discrepancy was under an inch â€“ and there it stayed.
