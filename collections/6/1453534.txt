The Sautr훮ntika were an early Buddhist school generally believed to be descended from the Sthavira nik훮ya by way of their immediate parent school, the Sarv훮stiv훮dins. Their name means literally "those who rely upon the sutras", and indicated their rejection of the Abhidharma texts of other early Buddhist schools.[1]
