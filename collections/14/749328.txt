Images obtained by MESSENGER have revealed evidence for pyroclastic flows on Mercury from low-profile shield volcanoes.[55][56][57] MESSENGER data has helped identify 51 pyroclastic deposits on the surface,[58] where 90% of them are found within impact craters.[58] A study of the degradation state of the impact craters that host pyroclastic deposits suggests that pyroclastic activity occurred on Mercury over a prolonged interval.[58]
