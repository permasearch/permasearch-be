Direct therapies address the physical aspects of vocal production.[7] Techniques work to either modify vocal fold contact, manage breathing patterns, and/or change the tension at level of the larynx.[7] Notable techniques include, but are not limited to, the yawn-sigh method, optimal pitch, laryngeal manipulation, humming, the accent method, and the Lee Silverman Voice Treatment.[7][23] An example of a direct therapy is circumlaryngeal manual therapy, which has been used to reduce tension and massage hyoid-laryngeal muscles.[10] This area is often tense from chronic elevation of the larynx.[10] Pressure is applied to these areas as the patient hums or sustains a vowel.[10] Traditional voice therapy is often used to treat muscular tension dysphonia.[10]
