Royal Holloway College, originally a women-only college, was founded by the Victorian entrepreneur Thomas Holloway in 1879 on the Mount Lee Estate in Egham.[11] The founding of the college was brought about after Holloway, seeking to fulfil a philanthropic gesture,[12] began a public debate through The Builder[12] regarding 'How best to spend a quarter of a million or more', at which point his wife proposed to build a college especially for women.[13] Holloway later increased his original sum of money to half a million, and today, the campus is still best known for its original 600-bed building, known as the Founder's Building, designed by William Henry Crossland and inspired by the Ch√¢teau de Chambord in the Loire Valley, France.[12][14]
