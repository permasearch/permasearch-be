Historians have pointed to many events and factors within the Ancien RÃ©gime that led to the Revolution. Rising social and economic inequality,[13][14] new political ideas emerging from the Enlightenment,[15] economic mismanagement, environmental factors leading to agricultural failure, unmanageable national debt,[16] and political mismanagement on the part of King Louis XVI have all been cited as laying the groundwork for the Revolution.[17][18][19][20]
