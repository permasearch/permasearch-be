Asheville is a major hub of whitewater recreation, particularly whitewater kayaking, in the eastern US. Many kayak manufacturers have their bases of operation in the Asheville area.[99] Some of the most distinguished whitewater kayakers live in or around Asheville.[100] In its July/August 2006 journal, the group American Whitewater named Asheville one of the top five US whitewater cities.[100] Asheville is also home to numerous Disc Golf courses. Soccer is another popular recreational sport in Asheville. There are two youth soccer clubs in Asheville, Asheville Shield Football Club and HFC. The Asheville Hockey League provides opportunities for youth and adult inline hockey at an outdoor rink at Carrier Park. The rink is open to the public and pick-up hockey is also available. The Asheville Civic Center has held recreational ice hockey leagues in the past.
