During the live finals stage, each remaining contestant will perform a dance for the judges and the live audience, week after week. The public would get choose who they want to remain the competition by voting. The bottom two will perform again and then the judges will decide which act they would like to see again in the competition. The season finale consists of the top 4, and in addition to their solos, each also dances several other numbers, while being paired or grouped with the other finalists in such a way that "everyone dances with everyone." In addition, during the grand finale, contestants who were eliminated that season come back, and that season's favorite dances are showcased. At the end of the finale, the winner (the competitor with the highest number of audience votes from the night before) is revealed.
