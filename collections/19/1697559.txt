After production on Restoration ended, Grant’s co-star, Robert Downey Jr., revealed to Gayl Murphy on Hollywood Correspondent that he and Grant did not get along during filming. Downey went on to say that: "I kinda think he's [Grant’s] a jerk," he told Murphy, “Don't know, I just think he is. My personal experience with him is I think he's this kind of self-important, kind of, like, boring flash-in-the-pan a--hole Brit." In 2018, after filming of Paddington 2 was done, Grant would later go on to confirm the on-set tension he and Downey had, stating: "He [Downey] hated me. He took one look at me and wanted to kill me," he said of the actor. "I was so hurt."[172] As a result of Grant’s confirmation of their decades-long feud, Downey later went to Twitter to make amends with Grant, to which Grant agreed.[173]
