The fourth person to receive the tapes was Tyler Down, a classmate who worked as a photographer for the yearbook. After suspecting that someone was taking pictures of her through her bedroom window, Hannah enlisted her classmate Courtney Crimson, who was unnamed at this point, to help catch the Peeping Tom. They staged a massage and then Courtney exclaimed over some "toys" she pretended to find. Based on the glimpse she got as the perpetrator ran away and his reaction at school, Hannah was able to determine that Tyler was the one at the window.
