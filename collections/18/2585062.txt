During April 2010 the duo toured the UK to sold-out venues, Katy Ratican of Contactmusic.com caught their performance at the Ruby Lounge in Manchester, "a set led primarily by Julia, she had the greater presence of the duo throughout. With Angus appearing the most shy of the two, it was left to Julia to engage the audience with chat and it wasn't until later in the set that Angus' seemingly gentle nature was fully accepted".[31] Alexander Gunz described their gig in Berlin "[they] look exactly as they do in the press photos: a slightly pot-smoking Neo-Hippie couple. He with artfully excellent and fluffy hair under his hat, her with Edding-painted roses on her guitar and a long blue dress, which while dancing she lifts slightly with her fingertips".[32] The following month, the Big Jet Plane EP was released which included Julia singing a cover version of "You're the One That I Want" from Grease.[31][33] In Australia, "Big Jet Plane", their highest charting single, peaked at No. 21.[20] It appeared at No. 20 on the New Zealand Singles Chart,[34] No. 23 in Belgium and top 40 on the French Singles Chart.[35][36]
