A well-studied solution uses a remotely controlled vehicle to rendezvous with, capture and return debris to a central station.[137] One such system is Space Infrastructure Servicing, a commercially developed refueling depot and service spacecraft for communications satellites in geosynchronous orbit originally scheduled for a 2015 launch.[138] The SIS would be able to "push dead satellites into graveyard orbits."[139] The Advanced Common Evolved Stage family of upper stages is being designed with a high leftover-propellant margin (for derelict capture and de-orbit) and in-space refueling capability for the high delta-v required to de-orbit heavy objects from geosynchronous orbit.[128] A tug-like satellite to drag debris to a safe altitude for it to burn up in the atmosphere has been researched.[140] When debris is identified the satellite creates a difference in potential between the debris and itself, then using its thrusters to move itself and the debris to a safer orbit.
