During Week 13 against the Buffalo Bills, Gronkowski had 9 receptions for 147 receiving yards as the Patriots won 23â€“3. However, after Bills rookie cornerback Tre'Davious White intercepted a pass intended for Gronkowski during the fourth quarter, he responded by body slamming White, drawing a personal foul penalty and giving White a concussion. Gronkowski was upset, claiming that White should have been flagged for a pass interference penalty.[60] On December 4, the day after the game, Gronkowski was suspended for one game for his hit on White.[61] The next day, December 5, the NFL denied Gronkowski's appeal of the one-game suspension.[62] With Gronkowski suspended for the Miami Dolphins game, the Patriots lost 20-27.[63] The following week in Week 15 against the Steelers, Gronkowski caught nine passes for a career-high 168 yards in a 27-24 win in Pittsburgh. This marked the 26th game in Gronkowski's eight-year career that he's totaled 100 yards receiving, as the only tight end with more 100-yard games in a career is Tony Gonzalez with 31. He also eclipsed the 1,000-yard mark on the season, his fourth in his career, joining Gonzalez and Jason Witten as the only NFL tight ends with four 1,000-yard seasons.[64]
