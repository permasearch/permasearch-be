In September and November 1995, the M3 coupe and saloon, respectively, were upgraded to the 239.4 kilowatts (321.0Â hp) 3.2-litre S50B32 engine. At the same time, the cars received clear indicator lenses, new wheels and a 6-speed gearbox. The convertible did not receive these changes until February 1996.[14]
