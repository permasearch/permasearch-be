In the aftermath of the sinking, a number of eyewitness testimonies arose of a shooting/suicide by an officer during the launching of the last lifeboat. It is possible that Murdoch was that officer. The reported incident has been portrayed in two films about the Titanic. There has been no evidence yet to prove that Murdoch was not the officer seen committing suicide.
