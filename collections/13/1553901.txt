It is common for the terms and conditions of chequing accounts to state that post-dated cheques should not be written and will be dishonoured if detected.[20][21] In some instances a post-dated cheque may be retained by the bank and paid on the due date if that date is only a few days away.[22] Some UK organisations do not accept post-dated cheques[23] as well as some Government Departments,[24] while paying income tax or voluntary National Insurance may only be done with post-dated cheques with permission from HM Revenue and Customs.[25][26]
