After having an affair with David Clarke, Victoria reluctantly agreed to help Conrad and Frank frame him to cover up their crimes. Victoria and Conrad's marriage deteriorates steadily, and the couple begin divorce proceedings.

During difficult times for her family, Victoria occasionally asks Emily for assistance, severing contact when Emily has fulfilled her usefulness.
