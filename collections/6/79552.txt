After graduation, Cheban began working for publicist Peggy Siegal at her firm in New York.[2] At one point, music manager Benny Medina called Siegal to work on Sean Combs' 29th birthday party. When Siegal rejected the offer despite Cheban's urging, Cheban accepted the job himself. Cheban left Siegal and formed his own PR firm with two other publicists. However, he split with his partners in 2001[2] and founded his own public relations firm, CommandPR.[citation needed]
