Meanwhile, on Minbar, during a birthday party for Sheridan and Delenn's son David, his parents give David an urn that Emperor Londo Mollari presented to them years earlier, in Objects at Rest of the TV series. Unbeknownst to them, the urn contains a Drakh keeper at the bottom. Later, when David is in his room alone, the keeper jumps out of the urn and attaches itself to David's shoulder. Under the keeper's influence, David steals a ship and travels to Centauri Prime, where he is delivered into Durla's hands.
