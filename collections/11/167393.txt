Get Smart, the spy-spoof television series, did a parody of the show in the 1968 episode titled "Die Spy".  In this, agent Maxwell Smart (Don Adams) pretends to be an international table-tennis champion.  The episode faithfully recreates the theme music, montage graphics, and back-and-forth banter between Robinson and Scottâ€”with actor/comedian Stu Gilliam imitating Cosby. Robert Culp makes an uncredited cameo appearance as an inebriated Turkish waiter.
