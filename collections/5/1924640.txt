Although several ancient cities bore the name of Philadelphia,[6] this is definitely the one listed among the seven churches by John in the Book of Revelation.[7] Philadelphia is the sixth church of the seven (Revelation 1:11). A letter specifically addressed to the Philadelphian church is recorded in Revelation 3:7-13. According to this letter, the Philadelphian Christians were suffering persecution at the hands of the local Jews, whom Revelation calls "the synagogue of Satan" (Revelation 3:9). The city's history of earthquakes may lie behind the reference to making her church a temple pillar (Revelation 3:12).
