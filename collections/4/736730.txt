On the June 8 episode of Raw Is War, Kane and Mankind attacked WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin. On the following episode of Raw is War, Austin blamed Mr. McMahon for setting up the attack; McMahon denied it and blamed the attack on The Undertaker, who denied setting up the attack and teamed up with Steve Austin to face Kane and Mankind in the first ever tag team Hell in a Cell match, which ended in no contest as the referee failed to restore order in the match (actually, Taker and Austin won the match but it wasn't shown on TV). At King of the Ring 1998, Kane and Austin faced each other in a First Blood match for Austin's WWF Championship. The stipulation was that if Kane lost, he would set himself on fire.[2] The referee was knocked out and Undertaker interfered in the match with a steel chair and came to hit Kane with the chair, but accidentally nailed Austin with the chair, which helped Kane to win the championship.[2][11] Undertaker formed a partnership with Kane after he later revealed that he attacked Austin because he didn't want his "brother" to be burned.[2] Undertaker started a rivalry with Steve Austin, who later regained the WWF title from Kane while Kane and Mankind won the WWF Tag Team Championship. At Fully Loaded: In Your House, the duo were forced to team up together and defeat Kane and Mankind to win the titles.[1][5][10][12]
