Due to concerns raised by patients having to pay unfair costs when calling NHS services by telephone,[76] the usage of 0870 non-geographic numbers was banned by the Department of Health in 2005.[77][78][79] At that time, 0870 numbers often cost more to call than geographic 01 and 02 numbers and were not usually included in bundled minutes. Around 400 GP surgeries used 0870 numbers and were also coming under greater scrutiny[80][81][82] with a few reverting to geographic numbers.[83]
