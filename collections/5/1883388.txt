Kāmarūpa (/ˈkɑːməˌruːpə/; also called Pragjyotisha), was a power during the Classical period on the Indian subcontinent; and along with Davaka, the first historical kingdom of Assam.[5] Though Kamarupa existed from 350 CE to 1140 CE, Davaka was absorbed by Kamarupa in the 5th century CE.[6][7] Ruled by three dynasties from their capitals in present-day Guwahati, North Guwahati and Tezpur, Kamarupa at its height covered the entire Brahmaputra Valley, North Bengal,[8] Bhutan and northern part of Bangladesh, and at times portions of West Bengal and Bihar.[2]
