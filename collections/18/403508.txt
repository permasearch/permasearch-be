The longest game in high school history was in a 1996 FCIAC quarterfinal matchup in Darien, Connecticut between archrivals Wilton and Ridgefield that went to a tenth eight-minute overtime period after 45 minutes of regulation (125:00 of hockey). Chris Ludwig of Wilton scored the game-winner while being hauled down in front of the Ridgefield net in the tenth overtime period.
