Although never being assigned a name, Old Mr. Grace's Secretary (Debbie Linden) is very good-looking. When Old Mr. Grace first meets her, she is described by Mr. Harman as 'one owner since new, very sporty, and capable of high speeds if you put your foot down and she's all yours.' She is blonde, and often wears short skirts, low cut tops and she also has a small purple streak in her hair. She only appeared in five episodes in Series 8, after which Mr. Grace says that she is going off on a course.
