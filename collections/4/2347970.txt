For example, John Webster's The Duchess of Malfi (c.1613), while often classified as a tragedy (originally was marketed as The Tragedy of the Dutchesse of Malfy), can also be classified or read as a revenge tragedy, since both major and minor characters are motivated by revenge. Likewise, Titus Andronicus was originally marketed in the First Folio as The Lamentable Tragedy of Titus Andronicus. Hamlet was similarly titled in the First Folio as The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark and The Tragical History of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark in the Second Quarto edition (1604). It's not unusual to find present-day editors classifying these plays as tragedies;[5][6] however, it is becoming increasingly common to also read and interpret early modern drama with other genres in mind, such as revenge tragedy.
