Next, suppose that the material is also subjected to bending forces. The max tensile stress equation of bending is     σ = ( − M y )  /  I   {\displaystyle \sigma =(-My)/I}  , where     M   {\displaystyle M}   is the bending moment,     y   {\displaystyle y}   is the distance from the neutral axis, and     I   {\displaystyle I}   is the moment of inertia. This is shown in Figure 2. Using the weight equation above and solving for the free variables, the solution arrived at is     w =   6 M b  L  2     ( ρ  /    σ   )   {\displaystyle w={\sqrt {6MbL^{2}}}(\rho /{\sqrt {\sigma }})}  , where     L   {\displaystyle L}   is the length and     b   {\displaystyle b}   is the height of the beam. Assuming that     b   {\displaystyle b}  ,     L   {\displaystyle L}  , and     M   {\displaystyle M}   are fixed design variables, the performance index for bending becomes      P  C R   =   σ    /  ρ   {\displaystyle P_{CR}={\sqrt {\sigma }}/\rho }  .
