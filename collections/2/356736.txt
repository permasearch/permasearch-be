Service: This service's table-side appetizer was Parmesan frica, served by Alison and Nick for their respective teams. Daddy Yankee and Dave Mustaine both appeared as guests for this service. The women started off well thanks to Meghan's strong leadership on the appetizer section, but were soon backed up by Monique constantly serving bland, under-cooked garnishes. Meghan jumped on the garnish section, but in her absence Sarah quickly fell apart handling the remaining appetizers, and Christine also had to be repeatedly told how to cook the salmon, and yet still sent it up raw. Ramsay brought the team into the pantry to give them a final warning, only for Christine's next order of salmon to turn out to be burnt, leading to the whole team being ejected. The men got off to a slower start due to Adam having initial problems with the risotto, but he soon got it together and got the remaining appetizers out without trouble. Bret also overcooked their first order of salmon, but likewise got his remaining orders out correctly. The main problem faced by the team was Brendan's weak performance on the meat station, as he struggled to give the other chefs correct times, and ended up holding up the kitchen for fifteen minutes while waiting for a rack of lamb to cook. Despite this, the team was eventually able to complete service, and were named the winners for the second week in a row. Ramsay was so disgusted by the red team's performance that he sent sous chef Andi up to the dorms to tell them to nominate two people for elimination.
