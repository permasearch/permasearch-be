Several actors were considered by del Toro for roles in the film. He wrote the part of Beorn specifically for American actor Ron Perlman.[46] Del Toro had originally considered asking Perlman to voice the dragon Smaug, but decided against this.[47] Del Toro met with English actor Brian Blessed to discuss the possibility of him playing Thorin Oakenshield.[48] The director later stated that he thought Ian McShane "would make the most perfect dwarf".[49] Frequent del Toro collaborator Doug Jones said that he would love to play the Elvenking Thranduil, but del Toro later stated that he had another role (or roles) in mind for the actor.[50] Del Toro was the one who originally pushed to cast Sylvester McCoy as Radagast the Brown, a choice Peter Jackson later followed.[51] While del Toro initially wanted Ian Holm to reprise the role of Bilbo Baggins, he also said that he "absolutely" supported the casting of Martin Freeman as the character,[52] and wanted all other returning Lord of the Rings characters to be played by the original actors where possible.[47]
