Vern Perry, a reviewer with The Orange County Register, called "Starvin' Marvin" his favorite South Park episode.[25] The "Starvin' Marvin" episode was featured in a 1998 Chicago Tribune list of the top ten reasons for the popularity of South Park.[26] The Chicago Tribune also included "Starvin' Marvin" in a 2003 list of the top ten funniest episodes.[27] Bill Ward, of the Star Tribune, described "Starvin Marvin" as Cartman's "finest half-hour".[28] Not all reviews were positive; Boston Globe writer Matthew Gilbert, who described South Park as immature and low-brow, called "Starvin' Marvin" a particularly "uncuddly episode".[29] Brian Boyd of The Irish Times criticized the episode for making jokes at the expense of starving African children.[30]
