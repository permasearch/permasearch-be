where      χ  i     {\displaystyle \chi _{\text{i}}}   is the instantaneous response and      Φ  d   ( τ )   {\displaystyle \Phi _{d}(\tau )}   is the impulse response to an impulse that occurred     τ   {\displaystyle \tau }   time units in the past. In the frequency domain, input and output are related by a complex generalized susceptibility that can be computed from      Φ  d     {\displaystyle \Phi _{d}}  ; it is mathematically equivalent to a transfer function in linear filter theory and analogue signal processing.[2]
