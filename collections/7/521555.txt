Huey, Dewey, and Louie (voiced by Russi Taylor in the 1987 series, Danny Pudi, Ben Schwartz and Bobby Moynihan respectively in the 2017 series) are triplets of Della Duck, the nephews of Donald Duck, and the grand-nephews of Scrooge McDuck. All three tend to be playful and mischievous, while also being devoted members of the Junior Woodchucks scouts. In the original 1987 series, the triplets are sent to Scrooge to stay with him, while their uncle leaves to join the navy. All three are identical in appearance and personality, and wear identical outfits - a cap and jumper- with the only difference between each of them being the color of their clothing - Huey wears red, Dewey wears blue, and Louie wears green. The introduction of this scheme by DuckTales was adapted for later use in future animations that featured the triplets.
