The White Sox enjoy healthy divisional rivalries. The Detroit Tigers are one of Chicago's primary rivals, and the cities of Chicago and Detroit share rivalries in other sports as well, such as the Bulls–Pistons rivalry, Blackhawks–Red Wings rivalry and the Bears–Lions rivalry. The rivalry has had its fair share of fights as well. The two teams are separated by a small under 5 hour drive, leading to fans of both teams showing up in large numbers at each others home stadiums. The teams have also got into a number of brawls, the most famous of which occurred in 2000 along with "binocular-gate" in 2014. In 2016, Al Avila, the GM of the Tigers let his own son, catcher Alex Avila, leave the Tigers to sign with the White Sox.
