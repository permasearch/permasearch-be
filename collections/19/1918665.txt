Citadels since the mid 20th century are commonly military command and control centres built to resist attacks such as aerial or nuclear bombardment. The military citadels under London such as the massive underground complex beneath the Ministry of Defense called Pindar are examples, as is the Cheyenne Mountain nuclear bunker in the US.
