The cumulative number of coups is a strong predictor of future coups.[18][20][21] Hybrid regimes are more vulnerable to coups than very authoritarian states or democratic states.[22] A 2015 study finds that terrorism is strongly associated with re-shuffling coups.[23] A 2016 study finds that there is an ethnic component to coups: "When leaders attempt to build ethnic armies, or dismantle those created by their predecessors, they provoke violent resistance from military officers."[24] Another 2016 study shows that protests increase the risk of coups, presumably because they ease coordination obstacles among coup plotters and make international actors less likely to punish coup leaders.[25] A third 2016 study finds that coups become more likely in the wake of elections in autocracies when the results reveal electoral weakness for the incumbent autocrat.[26] A fourth 2016 study finds that inequality between social classes increase the likelihood of coups.[27] A fifth 2016 study rejects the notion that participation in war makes coups more likely; to the contrary, coup risk declines in the presence of enduring interstate conflict.[28] A sixth 2016 study finds no evidence that coups are contagious; one coup in a region does not make other coups in the region likely to follow.[29] One study found that coups are more likely to occur in states with small populations, as there are smaller coordination problems for coup-plotters.[30]
