The word "titration" descends from the French word tiltre (1543), meaning the "proportion of gold or silver in coins or in works of gold or silver"; i.e., a measure of fineness or purity. Tiltre became titre,[4] which thus came to mean the "fineness of alloyed gold",[5] and then the "concentration of a substance in a given sample".[6] In 1828, the French chemist Gay-Lussac first used titre as a verb (titrer), meaning "to determine the concentration of (a substance in a given sample)".[7]
