On August 14, 1959, the league held an organizational meeting and announced its plans; eight days later it announced its name: the American Football League (AFL), the fourth league to take that name.[5] On November 24, 1959, the AFL held its first draft; the "Titans of New York", as the franchise awarded to Wismer was dubbed, selected Notre Dame quarterback George Izo as their first pick.[6] The league announced a policy, formulated by Wismer, that it would negotiate with a network for a single television contract to cover all the teams, the first league to do so.[7] On December 7, the Titans hired Steve Sebo as general manager. Sebo had just been fired as coach at the University of Pennsylvania, despite taking the Quakers to the Ivy League championship.[8] On December 17, the Titans announced at a press conference that "one of the biggest names in the history of football" would be soon be named as their head coach.[9] Although Wismer was prone to hyperbole, in this case he told the truth: New York had persuaded a former NFL great, quarterback and punter Sammy Baugh, to be its coach. Since his retirement as a player, Baugh had coached at tiny Hardinâ€“Simmons University, where he built a strong football program that sent a team to the 1958 Sun Bowl.[10] Before appearing at the press conference, Baugh demanded his entire salary of $20,000 for 1960, in cash. The Titans accommodated him.[11]
