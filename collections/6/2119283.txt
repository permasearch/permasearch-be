Filippo Brunelleschi's octagonal brick domical vault over Florence Cathedral was built between 1420 and 1436 and the lantern surmounting the dome was completed in 1467. The dome is 42 meters wide and made of two shells.[177] The dome is not itself Renaissance in style, although the lantern is closer.[178] A combination of dome, drum, pendentives, and barrel vaults developed as the characteristic structural forms of large Renaissance churches following a period of innovation in the later fifteenth century.[179] Florence was the first Italian city to develop the new style, followed by Rome and then Venice.[180] Brunelleschi's domes at San Lorenzo and the Pazzi Chapel established them as a key element of Renaissance architecture.[181] His plan for the dome of the Pazzi Chapel in Florence's Basilica of Santa Croce (1430â€“52) illustrates the Renaissance enthusiasm for geometry and for the circle as geometry's supreme form. This emphasis on geometric essentials would be very influential.[182]
