Dental floss, or tooth floss, is a cord of thin filaments used to remove food and dental plaque from between teeth in areas a toothbrush is unable to reach.[1] As the build-up of plaque between the teeth is the primary cause of dental disease, such as gingivitis and dental caries, the use of floss is commonly recommended in order to prevent these conditions from developing.[2]
