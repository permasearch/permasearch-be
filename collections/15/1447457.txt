In March 2017, Chinese ships were spotted in the Benham Plateau (also known as Benham Rise), an internationally recognized territory of the Philippines. The Philippines, through its ambassador to Beijing has officially asked China to explain the reported presence of one of its vessels in Benham Rise in the Pacific.[22][23] A week later, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement saying that China is honoring the Philippines' sovereign rights over Benham Rise. A few days after, China revoked the statement stating that the Philippines has no sovereignty and sovereign rights on the Benham Rise. It would later be acknowledged by the Philippine government that China was conducting research on the Philippine Rise without going through the Philippine government, sparking public outrage in the Philippines.[24]
