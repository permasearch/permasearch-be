Back to the Future spent 11 weeks at number one.[11] Gale recalled "Our second weekend was higher than our first weekend, which is indicative of great word of mouth. National Lampoon's European Vacation came out in August and it kicked us out of number one for one week and then we were back to number one."[15] The film went on to gross $210.61 million in North America and $173.2 million in foreign countries, accumulating a worldwide total of $383.87Â million.[4] Back to the Future had the fourth-highest opening weekend of 1985 and was the top-grossing film of the year.[49] Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 59 million tickets in the US.[50]
