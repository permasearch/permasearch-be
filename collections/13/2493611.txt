The Northern line is a London Underground line that runs essentially from south-west to north London, with two branches through central London and three in the north. Its southern section runs from Morden in the borough of Merton to Kennington in Southwark, where it then divides into two central branches, one via Charing Cross in the West End and the other via Bank in the City. The central branches re-join at Camden Town, where the line again divides into two branches, one to High Barnet and the other to Edgware in the borough of Barnet. On the High Barnet branch there is a short single-track branch to Mill Hill East only.
