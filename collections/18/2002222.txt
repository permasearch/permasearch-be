While one of their most popular songs, "Here Without You" was not a large hit on the band's home format of rock radio, peaking at No. 14 on the Mainstream Rock Songs chart and No. 22 on Alternative Songs. After the song's release, "Here Without You" remained a staple on pop and adult contemporary radio but not on rock or alternative radio.
