At seaside locations, such as those at Saurashtra, Gujarat, India,[16] the CaCl2 solution may be discharged directly into the sea, apparently without substantial environmental harm, the major concern is discharge location falls within the Marine National Park of Gulf of Kutch which serves as habitat for coral reefs, seagrass and seaweed community. At Osborne, South Australia,[17] a settling pond is now used to remove 99% of the CaCl2 as the former discharge was silting up the shipping channel.
