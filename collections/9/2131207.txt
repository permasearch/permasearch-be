"Young, Wild & Free" is a song by American rappers Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa with American singer-songwriter Bruno Mars. It was released on October 11, 2011 by Atlantic Records as the lead single from the soundtrack of the film, Mac & Devin Go to High School. Mars, Philip Lawrence, and Ari Levine of The Smeezingtons co-wrote the track with Christopher Brown, Snoop Dogg, and Wiz Khalifa. Since the song samples two other songs ("Toot It & Boot It" and "Sneakin' in the Back"), songwriting credits were added for a total of seventeen. Produced by the Smeezingtons, its composition begun during a Smeezingtons freestyle studio session; when progress on the song stalled, Aaron Bay-Shuck considered it a potential hit and asked them to finish it. After the song was finished, Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa were added.
