Carla is subsequently raped by Frank Foster and Peter lends much emotional support, to the annoyance of Leanne. Peter begins drinking again and goes to Carla's flat, telling her that she was the woman he loved and that he would leave Leanne for her. He and Carla sleep together that night and an affair begins. Leanne finds out about the affair but offers to forgive him and try to work on their marriage but Peter tells her that he loves Carla. Leanne leaves in a taxi with a tearful Simon running after the car, begging her to stay. Simon then starts misbehaving with Peter as he blames him and Carla for Leanne's departure. When Leanne returns she fights Peter for custody of Simon and Leanne eventually wins a residency order, at the same time reconciling with Nick. Peter and Carla later get engaged.
