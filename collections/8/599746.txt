In an interview with E!, McCord revealed what she expected for Naomi after she was attacked at the end of Season 2. "I kinda feel like there will be some downward spiral in a way for Naomi's character, but she's good at covering, so she'll still have that facade."[51] In a later interview with HollywoodLife.com, she further stated, "For me, it's important to let all teenagers know, and all women know, if you're violated you have to speak up." The actress also expressed a personal investment in the story, having worked with victims of abuse in a real-life anti-trafficking organization.[52]
