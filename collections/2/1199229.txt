In late 2008 Yankovic started to explore the digital distribution of his songs. On October 7, 2008, Yankovic planned to release a parody of "Whatever You Like" from artist T.I., which Yankovic said he had come up with two weeks before. Yankovic said that the benefit of digital distribution is that "I do not have to wait around while my songs get old and dated—I can get them out on the Internet almost immediately."[2] On October 7, 2008, the planned release date, an unexpected error left "Whatever You Like" out of the iTunes new release list. Jon "Bermuda" Schwartz, Yankovic's drummer and webmaster, posted this message: "Apparently there was a glitch at iTunes last night and Al's new single—'Whatever You Like'—did not debut with the rest of the new releases. We're being told that they're working on the problem and (hopefully!!) it will be up later today."[3] The song then became available.
