Similar to other GameCube rereleases, the games are emulations of the originals by the GameCube hardware.[72] The only differences are minor adjustments to button icons to conform to the GameCube's controller. Majora's Mask also boots with a disclaimer that some of the original sounds from the game may cause problems due to their emulation.[72] Aside from these deliberate changes, GameSpot's Ricardo Torres found that the frame rate "appears choppier" and notes inconstant audio.[74] The GameCube version also features a slightly higher native resolution than its Nintendo 64 counterpart, as well as progressive scan.[72]
