The Billings Fire Department was first founded in 1883 as a volunteer fire company named the Billings Fire Brigade. In 1886, the Yellowstone Hook and Ladder Company was founded; that company was disbanded in 1888 after the mayor criticized the group for how that handled a fire, leaving the town without a fire department for almost six months.[69] The last volunteer fire company, Maverick Hose Company, served as the city's fire department until 1918.[70] The modern fire department has seven stations, employs 114 people, and has been given a class three rating by ISO.[71]
