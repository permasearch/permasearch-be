At the same time she was dealing with her personal life, she discovered that her father had had a long affair with mistress Holly Harper which produced a daughter, Rebecca. At that point only she and her brothers Kevin and Tommy knew about her. Fortunately, Sarah, Tommy and Kevin later discovered that their father had bought land worth millions of dollars; the company was saved. Unfortunately, William had a last surprise for her: he had made Holly one of the major shareholder of his company. Much to Sarah's displeasure, Holly decided that she wanted to be an integral part of the company instead of selling the shares. This created tensions within the company until Holly decided to leave to create her own winery. Much to Sarah's surprise, her brother Tommy decided to quit as well and became Holly's business partner.
