The first match that aired was the tag team encounter of L.O.D. 2000 and the Disciples of Apocalypse (D.O.A).[18][19] Control of the match went back and forth between the two teams throughout, until 8-Ball attempted to switch places with Skull. Droz, who was at ringside in L.O.D's corner, interfered by clotheslining 8-Ball, leaving Skull to receive a powerslam and be pinned by Animal, thus L.O.D 2000 won the match.[5][20][21] After that match, The Rock came out to insult the Milwaukee audience, but Faarooq came out and attacked The Rock with a steel chair, and finished off the attack with a piledriver onto the chair.[5][21] Commissioner Slaughter then announced that The Rock had to compete in his match later in the event, despite any injury he may have suffered.[5][21]
