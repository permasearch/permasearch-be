FBI Special Agent Tim "Sully" Sullivan (seasons 2, 12) is introduced in Season 2 to be Dr. Brennan's love interest. He makes four consecutive appearances starting with the episode "The Girl in the Gator", where he works with Dr. Brennan while Booth was sidelined because he shot an ice cream truck clown. At first, Brennan doubted his sincerity because of his wide variety of interests and hobbiesâ€”he has a minor in kinesiology and a major in art history, is a certified EMT, a finish carpenter, and a criminal profiler; but Booth assured her Sully is serious about his job and mentions he lost his previous partner.[15] After the case, Sully asked Brennan out on a date, which she eagerly accepted. Their relationship becomes more serious; and, in the episode "The Boneless Bride in the River", Sully asks Brennan to go with him to the Caribbean in his new boat, which he named Temperance, for a year but she refuses. He tells Brennan he will come back in a year's time. He returns in the season 12 episode "The Grief and the Girl".
