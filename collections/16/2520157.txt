The queue is themed to the lobby of Gringotts Wizarding Bank, where the goblin character Bogrod, one of the bank's tellers, awaits guests who are visiting the bank to open an account. After allowing them access to enter the vaults, guests walk toward a security check to have their ID picture taken. After getting clearance, guests walk through the offices of the goblins that work at Gringotts. In one of those offices, silhouettes of Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger (disguised by polyjuice potion as Bellatrix Lestrange), and Griphook can be seen and heard as they plot to infiltrate the vaults to retrieve an unmentioned item. Continuing through the queue, guests enter Bill Weasley's office, where they are welcomed by Blordak and eventually joined by Bill. Guests are then shown by Blordak the direction toward the vaults. As guests exit the office, a moving portrait of a goblin explains the safety precautions of the ride. Doors open revealing an elevator lift for guests to board, and it descends to an area near the boarding area. Upon arrival, guests retrieve cart goggles and ascend a flight of stairs to the cart boarding station.[27]
