Multiple race types are included, from drift to rally and point-to-point races. The roads feature both AI traffic and other festival drivers.[5] Players may challenge the other racers they encounter in a one-on-one race to a given location. The races start at the current location, and finish at a randomly generated way-point. The AI have the ability to use shortcuts to their advantage.[6] Races will take place at different times throughout the day/night cycle included in the game, including night races.[5] A skill system is implemented in the game; players earn street cred during races by driving aggressively. Acts such as drifting, jumping over obstacles and getting a car on two wheels all contribute to the cred. These can be chained together in a combo, which in turn affects the money players are paid at the end of a given race.[7] Cred also affects a player's popularity level in the game. As a player's popularity increases new special events are unlocked, such as races against helicopters and planes.[7]
