Adams was raised a Mormon in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints until her parents divorced in 1985 and left the church.[4][8] She did not have a strong religious belief but has said that she valued her upbringing for teaching her about love and compassion.[3] Following the split, Richard moved to Arizona and remarried, and the children continued to live with their mother.[2][6] Kathryn subsequently became a semi-professional bodybuilder and took the children with her to the gym when she trained.[4][6] Adams has compared her uninhibited early years with her siblings with the Lord of the Flies.[3] Describing herself as a "scrappy, tough kid", Adams has said that she frequently got into fights with other children.[9]
