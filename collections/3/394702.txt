Zachariah is a Silent Brother who becomes the one most contacted by the Clave to solve cases regarding the New York Institute in 2007 after the Silent Brothers' massacre by Valentine. He used to be Jem Carstairs, a main character of The Infernal Devices series, who was turned into a Silent Brother to save his life as he laid dying due to running out of the yin fen medication required to sustain his life, in the process breaking his parabatai link with Will Herondale and separating him from his fiancÃ©e, Tessa Gray. He and Tessa together performed the Shadowhunter protection ritual on Clary when she was younger, which also erased her knowledge about the Shadow World for a time. When he finds out that Jace is a descendant of Will, Zachariah becomes fiercely protective of him, especially when he is put under Jonathan Morgenstern's spell and infused with the heavenly fire. In City of Heavenly Fire, Zachariah's attempt to save Jace infuses him with the heavenly fire, which burns out his yin fen and turns him back into a mortal Jem Carstairs again. During the war he finds Emma Carstairs a descendant of His family and fiercely protects her during the war. After the war, Jem reunites with Tessa and marries her a year after Jocelyn and Luke's wedding. He also begins to keep an eye on his distant relative, Emma Carstairs, in Los Angeles and Jace Herondale.
