Eight-man football consists of fast-paced games with higher scoring than the traditional game. Eight-man scores vary depending on the offensive and defensive strategies, but scores typically fall in the 40-60 point range, with "high scoring" games reaching the 70s and "low scoring" games falling below 30.[7] Eight-man football is noted for producing multi-skilled players that are responsible for playing several positions, which require speed, agility, and strength. Eight-man players each account for 12.5% of the responsibility in eight-man football, compared to 9.09% responsibility in the eleven-man format, due to having fewer players.
