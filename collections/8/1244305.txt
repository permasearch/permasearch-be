Since the RBM has the shape of a bipartite graph, with no intra-layer connections, the hidden unit activations are mutually independent given the visible unit activations and conversely, the visible unit activations are mutually independent given the hidden unit activations.[7] That is, for     m   {\displaystyle m}   visible units and     n   {\displaystyle n}   hidden units, the conditional probability of a configuration of the visible units v, given a configuration of the hidden units h, is
