The fourth part of the show started with Grande returning to the catwalk wearing a white bra and harem pants and singing "Moonlight" as she knelt in front of a celestial background and projections.[15][16] Next was "Love Me Harder" and a reworked version of "Break Free" with laser effects around the stage.[16][13] This was followed by "Sometimes", during which pink balloons fell from the ceiling.[16] Grande then sang "Thinking Bout You" as the video screen showed colored silhouettes of opposite-sex and same-sex couples.[16] There ensued an optional interchangeable section of the concert, followed by "Problem" with the stage dimmed to blue lights while the dancers carried big blue glow sticks, followed by "Into You", which concluded the main set.[15] For the encore, after a two minute silence, Grande performed "Dangerous Woman", wearing a black latex dress, with red lighting and pyrotechnics on the stage. Grande thanked the audience and bade them farewell as the band ended the song.[13][16][15]
