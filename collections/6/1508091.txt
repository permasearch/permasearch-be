Referring to the neural pathway schematic diagram, the entire pupillary light reflex system can be visualized as having eight neural segments, numbered 1 through 8. Odd-numbered segments 1, 3, 5, and 7 are on the left. Even-numbered segments 2, 4, 6, and 8 are on the right. Segments 3 and 4 are cross-over nerve fibers that occupy essentially the same space in the midbrain. Segments 3, 4, 5, and 6 are all located within a compact region within the midbrain.
