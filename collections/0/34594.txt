"Lives" serve as a mechanism to throttle how often new games can be started, and also provide an in-app revenue opportunity for the developer. Each time a player starts a game by pressing the New Game button, or accepts a Facebook friend's request to play against them, they are charged a Life. A player can have as many lives as they wish, and as they spend lives, the game will automatically replenish one life every hour, provided they are below 5 lives, until the player returns to a full charge of 5 lives. A heart icon on the app's main screen shows how many lives the player currently has, and if they have less than 5, a timer will also display that ticks down in real time to show how long until the next replenishment. If the player runs out of lives, they must wait for replenishment before they can start any new games or approve a new game started against them by a Facebook friend. A player who does not want to wait can either request lives from their Facebook friends, or can buy lives through an in-app purchase.
