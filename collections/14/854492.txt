Critics blamed this underestimation of the risk of the securities on the conflict between two interests the CRAs haveâ€”rating securities accurately, and serving their customers, the security issuers[136] who need high ratings to sell to investors subject to ratings-based constraints, such as pension funds and life insurance companies.[120][121] While this conflict had existed for years, the combination of CRA focus on market share and earnings growth,[137] the importance of structured finance to CRA profits,[138] and pressure from issuers who began to `shop around` for the best ratings brought the conflict to a head between 2000 and 2007.[139][140][141][142]
