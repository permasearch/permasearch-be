Resident Evil 2 was promoted with a US$5 million advertising campaign. In Italy, the game reached 100,000 pre-orders, worth over 12 billion lire (about more than 6.6 million dollars).[84] It became the fastest-selling video game in North America. On the weekend following its release, it sold 380,000 copies and grossed US$19 million. It therefore surpassed the revenue of all but one Hollywood movie at that time and broke previous sales records set by the video games Final Fantasy VII and Super Mario 64.[115] With 4.96Â million copies sold, the PlayStation version of Resident Evil 2 was a commercial success, and is the franchise's best-selling game on a single platform.[116] Another 810,000 copies of the Dual Shock Ver. were shipped by March 1999.[117]
