In 2011, Brewer made her television debut as Adelaide "Addie" Langdon in American Horror Story: Murder House.[1] "I first got word of the audition for the show from a friend of mine." She said. "They were looking for a young lady with Down syndrome who could act. My headshot and resume were submitted and I was called for an audition and, to my surprise I got the part. I was so excited."[2] About her role, Brewer stated: "Adelaide is a complex character, but the most difficult part of playing Adelaide is learning how to portray someone who isnâ€™t always viewed acceptable to her mother and society. This is a new challenge for me."[3]
