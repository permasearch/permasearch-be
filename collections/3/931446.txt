Morello was a recurring character for the first and second seasons of Orange Is the New Black.[19] In March 2014, series creator Jenji Kohan said Morello's backstory would be revealed in the second season.[20] While Stone commented there would be some "pretty hard hitting truths coming out" and that she was amazed at what happens to her character.[21] The episode, titled "A Whole Other Hole", revealed that Morello's often mentioned fiancé, Christopher MacLaren (Stephen O'Reilly), was not actually her fiancé and she had been incarcerated for stalking and terrorizing him.[15] Stone learned the truth about Morello's backstory the day she got the script for the episode. Prior to that, she had imagined her own version of Morello's history, believing that she might have committed an assault or been charged for the mail fraud.[18][22] Stone pointed out that there had been some hints that Morello was not telling the truth during previous episodes, including Nicky mentioning that Christopher had not been to visit and Morello's sister, Francine (Kristen Sieh), calling her to say that Christopher was getting married.[15]
