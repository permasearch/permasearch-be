In many disciplines, the hooves are painted with either clear or black hoof polish as a finishing touch. Clear polish is generally used in dressage, show hunters, jumpers, and eventing, as well as most breed shows, other than some stock horse breeds. Black polish is seen in the western disciplines, especially western pleasure, but some breeds, notably the Appaloosa, ban any polish that alters the natural hoof color.  Gaited breeds have varying rules, some allowing black polish, others limiting its use.  Whether clear or colored, polish is applied purely for aesthetic reasons, as a finishing touch.
