On October 3, 2004, the stadium was the venue for the last game in the history of the Montreal Expos when the Mets defeated the Expos 8â€“1.[27] Their story ended where it had started 35 years earlier: at Shea Stadium.[28] The following year, the Expos relocated to Washington, D.C., where they were renamed the Nationals.
