Winter temperatures at the North Pole can range from about −50 to −13 °C (−58 to 9 °F), averaging around −31 °C (−24 °F).A However, a freak storm caused the temperature to reach 0.7 °C (33 °F) for a time at a World Meteorological Organization buoy, located at 87.45°N, on December 30, 2015. It was estimated that the temperature at the North Pole was between 30 and 35 °F (−1 and 2 °C) during the storm.[55] Summer temperatures (June, July, and August) average around the freezing point (0 °C (32 °F)). The highest temperature yet recorded is 13 °C (55 °F),[56] much warmer than the South Pole's record high of only −12.3 °C (9.9 °F).[57] A similar spike in temperatures occurred on November 15, 2016 when temperatures hit freezing.[58] Yet again, February of 2018 featured a storm so powerful that temperatures at Cape Morris Jesup, the world northermost weather station in Greenland, reached 6.1 °C (43 °F) and spent 24 straight hours above freezing.[59] Meanwhile, the pole itself was estimated to reach a high temperature of 1.6 °C (35 °F). This same temperature of 1.6 °C (35 °F) was also recorded at the Hollywood Burbank Airport in Los Angeles at the very same time.[60]
