The common house martin has a large range, with an estimated global extent of 10,000,000 km2 (3,900,000 sq mi).[25] Its European population is estimated to be 20–48 million individuals. Global population trends have not been quantified, although there is evidence of population fluctuations.[6][9] For these reasons, the species is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List,[1] and has no special status under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) which regulates international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants. In Europe and Britain however, population numbers indicate a declining trend,[4] and leading conservation groups in Britain have updated the conservations status to amber indicating medium conservation concern there.[26][27]
