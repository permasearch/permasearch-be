Some of the scenes for the visual were also filmed in private jets, helicopters, and using zip-line, however, they were not included in the final version.[45][46] During an interview with Out magazine, Tourso spoke about his collaboration with BeyoncÃ©, calling her "open to mistakes" and praising her work ethic. He recalled that when they were watching the footage that had been filmed for "Heaven", "it was actually all the real stuff we shot that felt powerful and the other stuff we shot that felt kind of corny".[47] While discussing it with the singer, she agreed and the concept behind the clip slightly changed: "It's the same concept [with the bucket list], but it's not quite as literal and defined. Instead, we had happy vignettes of these two girls throughout their life and it'll just end with her walking through a cemetery. Kind of abstract and less literal in the end. I think it made it much more powerful."[47]
