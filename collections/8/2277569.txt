In 1765, when he visited the ruins at the site, he found the people of the village collecting large ancient bricks exposed at the river bank.[7][2] The villagers told him that they had retrieved the bricks from an old fort of the king the Vira-Raguen.[7] In 1937, Jouveau Dubreuil, an Indologist, also from France, purchased gem stone antiquities from local children, and also gathered some exposed on the site's surface. In particular, he found an intaglio carved with the picture of a man. As a numismatist, he identified the intaglio as Augustus Caesar. He also found fine beads and gems. He concluded that these antiquities belonged to the Roman Empire. Dubreuil informed the local Governor of Pondicherry about his find, and called Arikamedu "a true Roman city." He published a short note about his findings.[8][5][6][7]
