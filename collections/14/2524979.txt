In addition to manufacturing, Carthage practised highly advanced and productive agriculture,[134] using iron ploughs, irrigation,[135] crop rotation, threshing machines, hand-driven rotary mills and horse mills, the latter two which they invented in the late 6th century BC and 375â€“350 BC, respectively.[136][137] After the Second Punic War, Hannibal promoted agriculture[138] to help restore Carthage's economy and pay the war indemnity to Rome (10,000 talents or 800,000 Roman pounds of silver),[139][140] and he was largely successful. When Rome conquered and destroyed Carthage in 146 BC, the Roman Senate decreed that Mago's famous treatise on agriculture be translated into Latin.[141]
