Across the country, breakfast sandwiches are a common choice for the first meal of the day.[citation needed] A typical sandwich is composed of egg, cheese, and cooked breakfast meat such as bacon or sausage, on a roll, although regional varietals are common.[citation needed] In New Jersey, bacon is often swapped out of the breakfast sandwich and replaced with a processed meat called Pork Roll (also known as Taylor Ham).[citation needed] Other areas alter the breakfast sandwich medium with regional favorites: in New York, bagels are popular, and in the South, biscuits. A variation is the breakfast burrito, which originates from Southwestern and Tex-Mex cuisines.[109]
