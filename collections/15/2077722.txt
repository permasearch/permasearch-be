Pietersen became the fastest batsman to reach both 1,000 and 2,000 runs in One Day International cricket.[11][12] He has the second-highest run total from his first 25 Tests, behind only Sir Don Bradman of Australia,[13] and was the fastest player, in terms of days, to reach 4,000, 5,000 and 7,000 Test runs.[14][15][16] He became only the third English batsman to top the ICC One Day International rankings, doing so in March 2007.[17] In July 2008, after a century against South Africa, The Times called him "the most complete batsman in cricket"[18] and in 2012 The Guardian called him "England's greatest modern batsman".[19]
