Land planning in the 1980s has protected the land corridor of the original Northwest Freeway between Alderley and Carseldine.  The corridor is most obvious in the suburb running parallel to Trouts Road in the suburb's west.  It is referred to as the Northwest Transport Corridor and remains in current planning standards as a four-lane median-divided road[1].  There is speculation that the corridor may form part of a western bypass road which will link the Western Freeway with the Bruce Highway.  Another proposal has been for a light-rail system to connect Caboolture and Ferny Grove lines.
