EugÃ¨ne Meyer of Paris, France is now regarded as the father of the high bicycle[8] by the International Cycling History Conference in place of James Starley. Meyer patented a wire-spoke tension wheel with individually adjustable spokes in 1869.[3] They were called "spider" wheels in Britain when introduced there.[3] Meyer produced a classic high bicycle design during the 1880s.
