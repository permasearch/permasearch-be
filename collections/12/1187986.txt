By November 2004, Livingstone directly contradicted his belief that the charge would not be raised, saying: "I have always said that during this term [his second term in office] it will go up to at least £6."[95] By the end of the month, Livingstone announced that, in fact, the rise would be to £8 for private vehicles and £7 for commercial traffic. Business groups such as London First said following the announcement that the charges were "totally unsatisfactory and unacceptable".[96][97] The rise to £8 was announced formally on 1 April 2005, along with discounts for drivers buying month or year-long tickets.[98][99] On 10 May 2006, in a live TV debate, Livingstone supported a rise in the charge to £10 by 2008.[100]
