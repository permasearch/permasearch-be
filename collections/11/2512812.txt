Lerner was told about the signs after recounting his experience of aggressive drivers when driving his baby nephew home in busy traffic.[2] An urban legend claims that the death of a baby led to the creation of the signs, but there is no truth to this claim.[3][1]  Lerner eventually bought PHOB for approximately US$150,000, and changed the name to Safety 1st. The company later diversified into infant and child care products.[3]
