In February 2007, it was announced that Boots, the UK pharmacy chain, would try over-the-counter sales of Viagra in stores in Manchester, England. Men between the ages of 30 and 65 would be eligible to buy four tablets after a consultation with a pharmacist.[54]. In 2017, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency enacted legislation that expanded this nationwide.[55], allowing a particular branded formulation of Sildenafil, Viagra Connect (50mg), to be sold over the counter and without a prescription throughout the UK from early 2018. While the sale remains subject to a consultation with a pharmacist, the other restrictions from the trial have been removed, allowing customers over the age of 18 to purchase an unlimited number of pills [56] The decision was made, in part, to reduce online sales of counterfeit and potentially dangerous erectile dysfunction treatments.
