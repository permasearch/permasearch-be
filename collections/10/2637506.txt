The School of Computer Science's administrative offices were located in the College of Computing Building on Georgia Tech's Central Campus. Additionally, many College of Computing faculty and graduate students had offices in this building until recently.[5] In 2006, the Klaus Advanced Computing Building, donated by Georgia Tech alum Chris Klaus, was completed to provide additional offices, laboratories, and classrooms for the College of Computing.[6] All of the School of Computer Science personnel have since moved to the second and third floor of the Klaus Building.[7]
