Coach Thompson's tenure set the Pirates back several years, accumulating only three wins over two years, with records of 1–11 in 2003[72] and 2–9 in 2004.[73] His teams beat only Army both years and Tulane his second year. Amid much fan and administration impatience and frustration with the struggles of the football program, athletics director Terry Holland fired Thompson after the 2004 season.[74] Thompson left with an abysmal 3–20 record.[75]
