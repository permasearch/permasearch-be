The main characters of the play are George and Maggie Antrobus (from Greek: άνθρωπος (anthropos), "human" or "person"), their two children, Henry and Gladys, and Sabina, who appears as the family's maid in the first and third acts, and as a beauty queen temptress in the second act.  The play's action takes place in a modern setting, but is full of anachronisms reaching back to prehistoric times.  The characters' roles as archetypes are emphasized by their identification with Biblical and classical personalities (see below).
