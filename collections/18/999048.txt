Barnes & Noble Booksellers purchased Babbage's Etc. in October 1999 for $215 million.[16] Because Babbage's Etc. was principally owned by Leonard Riggio, who was also Barnes & Noble's chairman and principal shareholder, a special committee of independent directors of Barnes & Noble Booksellers evaluated and signed-off on the deal.[16] A few months later, in May 2000, Barnes & Noble acquired Funco, an Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based video game retailer, for $160 million.[17] Babbage's Etc., which had been previously operating as a direct subsidiary of Barnes & Noble, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Funco.[18] With its acquisition of Funco, Barnes & Noble also acquired Game Informer, a video game magazine that was first published in 1991.[19] Funco was renamed GameStop, Inc. in December 2000 in anticipation of holding an initial public offering for the company.[18]
