Musically, "Roar" is a pop song that features elements of arena rock.[5][6] Throughout the song, Perry "flexes diva-like vocals", singing the lyric "Hey!" several times in a way resemblant of The Lumineers.[7] The song's instrumentation is composed of "pounding" pianos and "booming" bass drums.[7] According to the sheet music published by Alfred Publishing Co., Inc. on Musicnotes.com, "Roar" is composed in the key of B♭ major and set in a 4 4 time signature at a moderate tempo of 90 beats per minute. Perry's vocal range spawns from the low note B♭3 to the high note E♭5, while the music follows the chord progression of B♭–Cm–Gm–E♭.[8] The song shares the theme of empowerment with Perry's single "Firework".[9][10] Perry described the track as a song speaking about standing up for oneself.[11]
