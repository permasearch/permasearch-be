In a third season flashback episode, it is revealed that Mike was accepted to Harvard as an undergraduate transfer student[3] ten years before the series began; however, Trevor was caught selling a calculus test that Mike had memorized, which put him in danger of expulsion. In order to save Trevor, Mike confessed, believing the dean wouldn't go to such extremes in punishing him. But it is revealed the test was sold to the dean's daughter, resulting in the university board demanding the dean's resignation. As his last act, the dean expels Mike then further punishes him by calling Harvard to inform them of his transgressions. Thus, Mike is unable to pursue his dream, until the series began.
