As Titanic broke apart, many objects and pieces of hull were scattered across the sea bed.[84] There are two debris fields in the vicinity of the wreck, each between 2,000–2,600 ft (610–790 m) long, trailing in a south-westerly direction from the bow and stern.[6] They cover an area of about 2 square miles (5.2 km2).[86] Most of the debris is concentrated near the stern section of Titanic.[87] It consists of thousands of objects from the interior of the ship, ranging from tons of coal spilled from ruptured bunkers to suitcases, clothes, corked wine bottles (many still intact despite the pressure), bathtubs, windows, washbasins, jugs, bowls, hand mirrors and numerous other personal effects.[88] The debris field also includes numerous pieces of the ship itself, with the largest pieces of debris in the vicinity of the partially disintegrated stern section.[84]
