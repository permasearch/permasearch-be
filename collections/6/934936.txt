At the beginning of Season 3, the new British management promotes Pete to Head of Accounts. He is overjoyed until he discovers that he is actually a "co-head" of the department, sharing the position with Ken Cosgrove. Pete becomes enraged and lashes out at Cosgrove, despite the fact that the new management clearly intends to play the two off each other.[3] Pete later distinguishes himself in the position, however, particularly by helping the firm appeal to the previously untapped "Negro market".[4]
