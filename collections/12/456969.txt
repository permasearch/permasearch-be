They proceeded to the second stage, and each was given a $10,000 prize. Saarinen changed the height of the arch from 580 feet to 630 feet (190 m)[b] and wrote that the arch symbolized "the gateway to the West, the national expansion, and whatnot."[23] He wanted the landscape surrounding the arch to "be so densely covered with trees that it will be a forest-like park, a green retreat from the tension of the downtown city," according to The New York Times architectural critic Aline Bernstein Louchheim[c] The deadline for the second stage arrived on February 10, 1948, and on February 18, the jury chose Saarinen's design unanimously,[24] praising its "profoundly evocative and truly monumental expression."[31] The following day,[26] during a formal dinner at Statler Hotel that the finalists and the media attended, Wurster pronounced Saarinen the winner of the competition and awarded the checks—$40,000 to his team[23] and $50,000 to Saarinen.[32] The competition was the first major architectural design that Saarinen developed unaided by his father.[24]
