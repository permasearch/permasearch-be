In order to improve the handling ability of the car, the entire suspension system was further refined.[40] Specially developed racing springs and dampers were given to the CSL, and a tightened steering ratio (14.5:1 vs 15.4:1 on the regular M3) improved responsiveness.[43] The braking system was also improved with larger front floating rotors and larger pistons in the rear calipers; front calipers were the same as the standard M3 but with a larger calliper carrier to allow for the larger rotor. Rear discs are M3 standard.
