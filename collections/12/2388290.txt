Most reviewers were highly critical of the inclusion of Morrison's "Still Got Tonight", the second single from his solo album. VanDerWerff called it "way too self-indulgent" and Kubicek characterized it as "shameless self promotion".[17][26] Gonzalez said the song "isn't half bad" and gave it a "Bâˆ’", while Benigno was more generous with a "B+", despite his belief that it did not belong in the episode.[22][23] Futterman called it "a generic-sounding pop melody".[6] The use of "Bella Notte", by contrast, was generally approved of, though Kubicek thought it was "kind of weird that they weren't really there", and Berk gave both of its two stars out of five solely due to the "spectral singers".[26][27] VanDerWerff thought the song was "well-performed", and Benigno gave it a "B+"; he had a very different take from Kubicek, as he found the imaginary appearance by the male club members hilarious.[17][22]
