One of the main reasons for a shift in gender roles was the unprecedented high incidences of men leaving their homes to travel, which in turn gave women more freedom for action. Wives of such men often became the ones to run the household, especially with financial matters. Elite women also began to pursue different kinds of fashionable activities, such as writing poetry, and a new frenzy of female sociability appeared. Women started to leave their households to attend local opera performances and temple festivals and some even began to form little societies to venture about famous sacred sites with other restless women, which helped to shape a new view of the conventional societal norms on how women should act.[118]
