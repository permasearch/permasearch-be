Industrial pig farming, a subset of CAFOs (concentrated animal feeding operations) poses numerous threats to environmental health and justice. Deforestation is a common occurrence under the placement of new farms. Feces and waste often spread to surrounding neighborhoods, polluting air and water with toxic waste particles.[14] Waste from swine on these farms carry a host of pathogens and bacteria as well as heavy metals. These toxins can leach down through the soil into groundwater, polluting local drinking water supplies. Pathogens can also become airborne, polluting the air and harming individuals when ingested.[15] Contents from waste have been shown to cause many detrimental health implications, as well as harmful algal blooms in surrounding bodies of water.[16]
