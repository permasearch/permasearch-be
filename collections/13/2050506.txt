The British Pharmaceutical Codex (BPC) was first published in 1907, to supplement the British Pharmacopoeia which although extensive, did not cover all the medicinal items that a pharmacist might require in daily work. Other books existed, such as Squire's, but the BPC was intended to be official, published by the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (PSGB).
