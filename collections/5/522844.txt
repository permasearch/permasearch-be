The score also includes four songs not originally written for Show Boat: "Bill" was originally written by Kern and P.Â G. Wodehouse in 1917 and was reworked by Hammerstein for Show Boat. Two other songs not by Kern and Hammerstein, "Goodbye, My Lady Love" by Joseph E. Howard and "After the Ball" by Charles K. Harris, were included by the authors for historical atmosphere and are included in revivals.[9] The New Year's Eve scene features an instrumental version of "There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight".
