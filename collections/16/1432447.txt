The Blackhawks and their arena mates, the Chicago Bulls, embarked on an annual two-week road trip in mid-November dating back to when both teams inhabited Chicago Stadium.[156] The Wirtz Family, who at one point owned the Blackhawks, Bulls, and Chicago Stadium, would lease the venue to circus acts and ice skating troupes.[157][158][159] The Blackhawks played between six and seven games in western Canada and California during this time.[156] In November 2016, the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus announced they would not be returning to the United Center in 2017.[156]
