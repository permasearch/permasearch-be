Dean Carlson of Allmusic gave "Where I Wanna Be" a mixed review stating "Shade Sheist's Where I Wanna Be hoped to resurrect the forgotten art of summer hip-hop. It failed, of course, but in a gallant sort of way... It was from there, with Nate Dogg and Kurupt chasing each other's slow rhymes at the wayside, that "Where I Wanna Be" eventually became a sort of heat-induced muscle relaxant this side of De La Soul's "A Roller Skating Jam Named 'Saturdays'" or Black Eyed Peas' "Magic," if only substituting their pleasantries for suspiciously placed arrogance. It was an unworkable contradiction when it came down to it, but Where I Wanna Be became the number one rap single for four months in America and went on to crack the British Top 20 the following summer."[2]
