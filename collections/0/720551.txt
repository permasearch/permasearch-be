Compared to AD, which is better studied, memory is retained longer, while verbal fluency may be lost faster.[14] There are more neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB than AD, and they may emerge earlier, so according to Mueller, those with DLB "might have a less favourable prognosis, with accelerated cognitive decline, shorter lifespan, and increased admission to residential care".[14] The difference in admissions to hospital and time in nursing care may be explained by the presence of hallucinations.[14] Increased mortality relative to AD may be attributed to a higher risk of injury from falls.[47]
