Until December 2014 California not only had more plug-in electric vehicles than any other American state but also more than any other country in the world.[233][234] In 2015 only two countries, Norway (22.4%) and the Netherlands (9.7%), achieved a higher plug-in market share than California.[231] Sales of plug-in electric cars in the state passed the 200,000 unit milestone in March 2016.[235] By November 2016, with about 250,000 plug-in cars sold in the state since 2010, China was the only country market that exceeds California in terms of cumulative plug-in electric car sales.[236]
