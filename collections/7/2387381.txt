As a hurricane moves in, McCall returns to his seaside hometown, which has been evacuated. Kovac, Ari, and Resnik head in after McCall as York situates himself at the town's watchtower in a sniper's position. Kovac enters a tackle shop and is killed with a harpoon gun. Ari heads toward the seaside and is disturbed by pictures of Susan along the way, and is then caught off guard and is stabbed by McCall. McCall enters his wife's old bakery to lure in Resnik, who is killed after the grenade he tossed into the building sets off a trap set by McCall. Enraged, York shoots at his car, which has Miles tied up in the trunk. With the storm growing heavier, York is knocked down before being confronted by McCall atop the tower. McCall gets the upper hand, stabs York and shoves him over the edge, killing him. McCall retrieves Miles from the trunk and takes him to his old house to treat his wounds.
