The official Ace of Base website became defunct in 2013. In January 2014, Julia announced on her official Facebook page that she had left the band in 2012.[60] She later confirmed that Clara was also no longer part of the band, saying on her Facebook page, "I never really left the group, one day I just didn't hear anything from them and it's the same with Clara. Like it went up in smoke; really strange".[10][61]
