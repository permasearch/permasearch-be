Ben wakes up in a hospital and goes to Alex's room, where he finds her with Mark (Dermot Mulroney), her fiancÃ©. Mark praises Ben for saving Alex, to which Ben replies she saved him, and he leaves the room, heartbroken. Some time afterward, Mark tells Alex, "I told myself that if you ever lost a part of you (an arm or leg in her dangerous job as a photojournalist), I would still love you." But now, it's obvious to him that he has lost her heart.
