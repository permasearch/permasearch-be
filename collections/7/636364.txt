(9 February 2009) There has been little to report, and my students and I [Geoff Hill] have been enjoying the calm. We continue to work to get definitive documentation of the ivory-billed woodpecker in the Choctawhatchee River Basin.â€¦ To my knowledge, there have been no sightings of ivory-billed woodpeckers in the Choctawhatchee region since last spring. There were a few double knock detections in January, but not by my paid crew, Brian [Rolek], or me.
