Working from Carpenter's advice to "make [the film] his own",[3] Zombie chose to develop the film as both a prequel and a remake, allowing for more original content than simply re-filming the same scenes. Despite mostly negative reviews, the film, which cost $15 million to make,[2] went on to gross $80,208,039 worldwide, making it the second highest-grossing film in the Halloween franchise in unadjusted U.S. dollars behind Halloween H20. Zombie followed the film with a sequel, Halloween II, in 2009.
