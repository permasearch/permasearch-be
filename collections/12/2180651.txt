Emmett repeated this story in the May 19, 1877, New York Clipper, although other details changed.[67] The press began to refer to Emmett as "Ole Dan Tucker",[61] and Emmett eventually adopted the nickname. The Virginia Minstrels sometimes went by "Ole Dan Tucker and Co."[68] They were called "Old Dan Tucker & Co.," either by themselves or by the press, as early as February 16, 1843.[69]
