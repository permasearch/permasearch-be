Like most Spanish dialects, standard Colombian Spanish has five vowels: two high vowels (/i, u/), two mid vowels (/e, o/) and one open vowel (/a/). However, vowel shifts, reductions, and breaking have taken place in many of Colombia's populous regions, particularly in Bogot√° and the Paisa region.[4] This means that in Colombian Spanish there may also be an additional number of vowels, making it one of the most phonologically rich varieties of the Spanish language.
