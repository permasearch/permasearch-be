Navi Mumbai is envisaged as a metro sized counter magnet to reduce the pressure on the Mumbai metropolis. It is planned as a polycentric new town with a series of nodal concentrations along mass transport corridors. When fully built, it is expected to have 14 such townships with a combined population holding capacity of four millions and one million jobs.
