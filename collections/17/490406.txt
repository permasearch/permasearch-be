The series begins as Ned Stark is asked to become the chief advisor (known as the Hand of the King) to lecherous King Robert Baratheon. Ned and his wife Catelyn receive a letter from Catelyn's sister Lysa that gives them reason to believe that rival House Lannister – to which the King's wife Cersei belongs – was the cause of the previous Hand's death. Ned must travel south to help the king and find out who killed the previous Hand of the King, Jon Arryn, while trying to protect his family from the Lannisters. As he tries to uncover the reasons behind Jon Arryn's death he uncovers the dark secrets about the Lannisters that Arryn himself died trying to expose.[1]
