The history of soccer in the United States has numerous different roots. The modern-day game is often considered to have been brought to the United States through Ellis Island in the 1870s. However, recent research has shown that the modern game entered America in the 1850s through New Orleans when Scottish, Irish, German and Italian immigrants brought the game with them. It was in New Orleans that some of the first organized games that used modern English rules were held.[1]
