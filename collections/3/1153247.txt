While similar in concept and theme to the original attraction in Florida, the attraction at Disney California Adventure, which opened in 2004[8] and closed in 2017, featured some significant differences. The exterior of Disney California Adventure's tower had architectural features reminiscent of Pueblo Deco styles found throughout Southern California during the Golden Age of Hollywood.
