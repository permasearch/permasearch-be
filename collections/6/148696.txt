A Skorokhod space, also written as Skorohod space, is a mathematical space of all the functions that are right-continuous with left limits, defined on some interval of the real line such as     [ 0 , 1 ]   {\displaystyle [0,1]}   or     [ 0 , ∞ )   {\displaystyle [0,\infty )}  , and take values on the real line or on some metric space.[288][289][290] Such functions are known as càdlàg or cadlag functions, based on the acronym of the French expression continue à droite, limite à gauche, due to the functions being right-continuous with left limits.[288][291] A Skorokhod function space, introduced by Anatoliy Skorokhod,[290] is often denoted with the letter     D   {\displaystyle D}  ,[288][289][290][291] so the function space is also referred to as space     D   {\displaystyle D}  .[288][292][293] The notation of this function space can also include the interval on which all the càdlàg functions are defined, so, for example,     D [ 0 , 1 ]   {\displaystyle D[0,1]}   denotes the space of càdlàg functions defined on the unit interval     [ 0 , 1 ]   {\displaystyle [0,1]}  .[291][293][294]
