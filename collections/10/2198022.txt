The first large wave of settlement to the areas that would later become Milwaukee County and the City of Milwaukee began in 1835. Early that year it became known Juneau and Kilbourn intended to lay out competing town-sites and by the years' end both had purchased their lands from the government and made their first sales. There were perhaps 100 new settlers in this year, mostly from New England and other Eastern States. On September 17, 1835, the first election was held in Milwaukee; the number of votes cast was 39.[18]
