At MacLeod's urging, Zelle returned to him, but his behavior did not change. She escaped her circumstances by studying the local culture.[6] In 1899, their children fell violently ill from complications relating to the treatment of syphilis contracted from their parents[citation needed], though the family claimed they were poisoned by an irate servant. Jeanne survived, but Norman died. Some sources[6] maintain that one of MacLeod's enemies may have poisoned a supper to kill both of their children. After moving back to the Netherlands, the couple officially separated on 30 August 1902. The divorce became final in 1906. Zelle was awarded custody of Jeanne. MacLeod was legally required to pay support, which he never did, making life very difficult for Zelle and her daughter. During a visit of Jeanne with her father, MacLeod decided not to return Jeanne to her mother. Zelle did not have resources to fight the situation and accepted it, believing that while McLeod had been an abusive husband, he had always been a good father. Jeanne later died at the age of 21, also possibly from complications relating to syphilis.[8][10]
