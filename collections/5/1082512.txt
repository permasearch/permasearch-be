After the financial success of Dr. No, United Artists doubled the budget offered to Eon Productions to $2 million for the company's next film, From Russia with Love.[37] The film was shot in locations in Europe, which had turned out to be the more profitable market for Dr. No.[38] Most of the crew from the first film returned, with major exceptions being production designer Ken Adam—who went to work on Dr. Strangelove and was replaced by Dr. No's art director Syd Cain—and title designer Maurice Binder, who was replaced by Robert Brownjohn.[39][40]
