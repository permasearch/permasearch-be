The Detour was a choice between Chow or Plow inside Ch√¢teau de Cheverny. In Chow, teams prepared a meal of meat and other food for a large number of hunting dogs. They had to remove debris and bones from the meat, cut the meat into appropriate sizes, weigh out a designated amount of food, and then lay it out appropriately, before the judge would release the hounds and give them their next clue. In Plow, teams used a plow attached to a work horse to mill four lines in a designated field to the farmer's satisfaction in order to get their next clue. Each Detour selection only had two workstations, which were first-come, first-served.
