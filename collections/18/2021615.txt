The 1962 British Lions tour to South Africa lost all three tests. In 1963 the touring Wallabies beat the Springboks in consecutive tests, the first team to do so since the 1896 British team.[citation needed] In 1964, in Wales' first overseas tour they played one test match against South Africa, losing 24â€“3, their biggest defeat in 40 years.[50][51][52]
