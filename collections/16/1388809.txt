Some of the crowd spotted paratroopers hiding in a derelict three-story building overlooking William Street, and began throwing stones at the windows. At about 3:55pm, these paratroopers opened fire. Civilians Damien Donaghy and John Johnston were shot and wounded while standing on waste ground opposite the building. These were the first shots fired.[36] The soldiers claimed Donaghy was holding a black cylindrical object,[37] but the Saville Inquiry concluded that all of those shot were unarmed.[38]
