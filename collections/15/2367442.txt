At Cindy's behest the family and Sam (Allan Melvin) put on a backyard theater production of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" to raise funds for a retirement gift for Cindy's popular teacher Mrs. Whitfield (Frances Whitfield). When it is discovered Alice has already eaten the "poisoned apple" while rehearsing, Sam and Mike rush to the store (in costume) to buy an apple. Sam receives a parking fine, and the policeman says they must have a permit to host the production. A permit is granted on short notice allowing the show to go on.
