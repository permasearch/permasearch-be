Morison worked with a team of researchers to prepare the History of United States Naval Operations in World War II, published in 15 volumes between 1947â€“1962, documenting everything from strategy and tactics to technology and the exploits of individuals. British military historian Sir John Keegan called it the best to come out of that conflict. Issued as The Rising Sun in the Pacific in 1948, Volume 3 won the Bancroft Prize in 1949.[1]
