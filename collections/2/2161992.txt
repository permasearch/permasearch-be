The American folk, country, and bluegrass musician John Hartford's song "Long Hot Summer Days", on his 1976 album Mark Twang, is about a man who works on a towboat on the Illinois River.  The chorus of the song includes the lyrics, "For every day I work on the Illinois River / Get a half a day off with pay / Ol' towboat makin' up barges / On a long hot summer day".
