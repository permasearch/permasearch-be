Kabuki (歌舞伎?) is a type of Japanese theatre. It is known for its highly stylized dancing and singing as well as the elaborate make-up worn by the predominately all male cast. The first instances of kabuki used the hayashi from noh performances. Later on, kabuki began incorporating other instruments like the shamisen. The music of kabuki can be divided into three categories:[1] geza, shosa-ongaku, and ki and tsuke.
