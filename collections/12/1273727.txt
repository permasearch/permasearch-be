Warren and Brandeis then discuss the origin of what they called a "right to be let alone".  They explain that the right of property provides the foundation for the right to prevent publication.

The law did not yet recognize the idea that there was value in preventing publication. As a result, the ability to prevent publication did not clearly exist as a right of property.
