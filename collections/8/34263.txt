Several polytheistic religions were practised in Sussex before Christianity was firmly established in Sussex in the 7th century, including Celtic polytheism and Roman religion. Christianity was practised during part of the Romano-British period, but was replaced in the 5th century by the polytheistic religion of the South Saxons. According to Bede, it was the last area of what was to become England to be converted.[83][84] After the Council of London of 1075 decreed that sees should be centred in cities rather than vills,[85] the South Saxon diocese, with its see at Selsey was transferred to Chichester.
