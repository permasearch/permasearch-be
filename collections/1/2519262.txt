Winn-Dixie is known for its private label Chek brand soft drinks, which are produced in over 20 different flavors plus diet and caffeine-free varieties—one of the widest assortments. Winn-Dixie has been known as "The Beef People" throughout its lifetime.  In its advertising and print media, Winn-Dixie uses the brand promises of "Fresh Checked Every Day" for its Jacksonville DMA, "Getting Better All The Time" in its locations in Central Florida, "El Sabor De Tu País", or "The Flavor Of Your Country", in its Miami area stores, and "Local Flavor Since 1956" in its Louisiana area stores.
