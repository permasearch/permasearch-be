In the United Kingdom when selling certain goods, bakers were obliged to sell goods by the dozen at a specific weight or quality (or a specific average weight). Bakers who sold a dozen units under the required weight could result in a hefty fine. To avoid risking a penalty, some bakers included an extra unit to be sure the minimum weight was met bringing the total to 13 units or a baker's dozen.[12][13]
