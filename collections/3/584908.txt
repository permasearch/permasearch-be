Texas covers a total area of 268,581 square miles (695,622 km2). The longest straight-line distance is from the northwest corner of the panhandle to the Rio Grande river just below Brownsville, 801 miles (1,289 km).[1] The width west-to-east, from El Paso to Orange, Texas, is 762 miles (1,226 km). The largest continental state is so expansive that El Paso, in the western corner of the state, is closer to San Diego, California, than to the Houston and Beaumont area, near the Louisiana state line; while Orange, on the border to Louisiana, is closer to Jacksonville, Florida than it is to El Paso. Texarkana, in the northeastern corner of the state, is about the same distance from Chicago, Illinois, as it is to El Paso, and Dalhart, in the northwestern corner of the state, is closer to the state capitals of Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Wyoming than it is to Austin, its own state capital.[6]
