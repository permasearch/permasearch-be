Ludwik Hirszfeld and E. von Dungern discovered the heritability of ABO blood groups in 1910â€“11. Felix Bernstein demonstrated the correct blood group inheritance pattern of multiple alleles at one locus in 1924.[12] Watkins and Morgan, in England, discovered that the ABO epitopes were conferred by sugars, to be specific, N-acetylgalactosamine for the A-type and galactose for the B-type.[13][14][15] After much published literature claiming that the ABH substances were all attached to glycosphingolipids, Finne et al. (1978) found that the human erythrocyte glycoproteins contain polylactosamine chains[16] that contains ABH substances attached and represent the majority of the antigens.[17][18][19] The main glycoproteins carrying the ABH antigens were identified to be the Band 3 and Band 4.5 proteins and glycophorin.[20] Later, Yamamoto's group showed the precise glycosyl transferase set that confers the A, B and O epitopes.[21]
