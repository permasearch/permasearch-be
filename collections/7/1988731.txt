Dial-up modem use in the U.S. had dropped to 60% by 2003, and in 2006, stood at 36%.[citation needed] Voiceband modems were once the most popular means of Internet access in the U.S., but with the advent of new ways of accessing the Internet, the traditional 56K modem is losing popularity. The dial-up modem is still widely used by customers in rural areas, where DSL, cable, satellite, or fiber optic service is not available, or they are unwilling to pay what these companies charge.[15] In its 2012 annual report, AOL showed it still collects around US$700 million in fees from dial-up users: about three million people.
