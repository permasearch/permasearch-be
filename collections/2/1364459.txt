At the Olympic Games, the two Murrays competed together in the doubles tournament.[55] After defeating Canadian pair Frédéric Niemeyer and Daniel Nestor in the first Round, they then lost to the French pair, Arnaud Clément and Michaël Llodra, in straight sets.[56] The Davis Cup captain John Lloyd said he watched the Murrays doubles at the Olympics, and it was clear they were not getting on.[57]
