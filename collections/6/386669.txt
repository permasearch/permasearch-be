A treaty was not established, but the conference agreed to establish a legally binding deal comprising all countries by 2015, which was to take effect in 2020.[2] There was also progress regarding the creation of a Green Climate Fund for which a management framework was adopted. The fund is to distribute US$100Â billion per year to help poor countries adapt to climate impacts.[3]
