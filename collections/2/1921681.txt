The Congress Plaza Hotel is located on South Michigan Avenue across from Grant Park in Chicago at 520 South Michigan Avenue. After opening for business in 1893, for the World's Columbian Exposition,[1] the hotel underwent two major expansions and renovations; it now features 871 guest rooms and suites. Its 11 story edifice was originally designed by architect Clinton J. Warren as an annex to the Auditorium Theater across the street. The two buildings were linked by a marble-lined underground passage called Peacock Alley. In 1902 and then in 1907, the firm of Holabird & Roche oversaw the design and construction of two additions, bringing the total complex up to 1 million square feet.[2]
