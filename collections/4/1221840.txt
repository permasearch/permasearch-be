Miles and D'Alesandro realized that the owners were simply looking for a way to push Veeck out. Over the next 48 hours, Miles lined up enough support from his group of investors to buy out Veeck's stake entirely for $2.5 million. The plan called for Baltimore brewer Jerold Hoffberger to emerge as the largest single shareholder. With his only leverage, ownership of Sportsman's Park, gone and facing threats of the liquidation of his franchise, Veeck had little choice but to agree. With Veeck "out of the way", the American League owners quickly approved the relocation of the team to Baltimore for the 1954 season.
