Scott often suggests alternatives to his fathers elaborate machinations that are more straightforward and would guarantee success (e.g. rather than slowly lowering Austin Powers into a pool of ill-tempered, mutated sea bass, Scott pleads with his father to just shoot Powers immediately). Dr. Evil then dismisses Scott's ideas because, in his mind, Scott isn't evil enough to be taken seriously; in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, Dr. Evil calls Scott "the Diet Coke of evil. Just one calorie, not evil enough." In one scene from the film, Scott is clearly perturbed and frustrated with Doctor Evil, exclaiming "God! You do this every time!" At one other point in the movie, Dr. Evil attempted to kill Scott by the same means that he killed Mustafa, however Frau Farbissina stopped him before he was able to send Scott to his doom.
