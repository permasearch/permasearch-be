Press do not decide Govt projects. International Govt provides aid to a state but does not make a policy. Since Karnataka Govt which has legal control over the river has not approved (above editors agree), the project is not valid. To date none have shown the proof that the project is officially approved by all concerned Govt authorities. The statements about the project is pure Synthesis based on on going dispute and speculative conclusion drawn by some editors. Therefore it needs to be removed immediately. It may be considered for Wikipedia if it gets officially approved by all Govts with endorsement by Govt of India. However still there is another issue. There is no relation between a falls and drinking water project as it was explained earlier. I guess irrigation engineers agree with this.
