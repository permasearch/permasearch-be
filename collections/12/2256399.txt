In Sydney, the harbour is a focus and boat races are held, such as a ferry race and the tall ships race. In Adelaide, the key celebrations are "Australia Day in the City" which is a parade, concert and fireworks display held in Elder park and the traditional International Cricket match played at the Adelaide Oval. Featuring the People's March and the Voyages Concert, Melbourne's events[36] focus strongly on the celebration of multiculturalism.[37] Despite a drop in attendance in 2010, but with audiences still estimated at 400,000,[38] the Perth Skyworks is the largest single event presented each Australia Day.[39]
