The two Conjuring films were met with generally positive reviews by both critics and horror fans, earning praise for Wan's directing and main cast performances, particularly Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga's on-screen chemistry as Ed and Lorraine. Critics also acknowledged the effect the films have had on popular culture as well as in the production of modern horror films. The first entry in the Annabelle film series received more mixed to negative reviews, being considered by many, mainly fans of the first picture, as an inferior film to its forerunner. Annabelle: Creation was met with generally positive reviews. The Nun, on the other hand, received generally mix to negative reviews. The two main films and its three spin-offs have proven themselves to be successful at the box office, having combined earnings of over $1.567 billion worldwide, against a combined budget of $103.5 million,[5] making it the highest-grossing horror franchise in history and one of the most critically acclaimed.
