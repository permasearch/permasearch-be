With the return of Julian Edelman from a foot injury, the Patriots defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in the divisional round by a score of 27–20 after advancing with a first round bye.[296] The Patriots advanced to the AFC Championship at Mile High Stadium to face Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos at Sports Authority Field at Mile High. It would turn out to be the 17th and final meeting between the two storied quarterbacks, as Manning would announce his retirement after the season ended. The Broncos' top-ranked defense harassed Brady, who completed 27-of-56 passes with two interceptions and a touchdown, all day, and the Patriots eventually lost the game 20–18 after a potential game-tying two-point conversion attempt failed with 17 seconds left in regulation.[297]
