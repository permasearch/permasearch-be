A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010 found that the genus Grus, as then defined, was polyphyletic.[11] In the resulting rearrangement to create monophyletic genera, the Siberian crane was moved to the resurrected genus Leucogeranus.[12] The genus Leucogeranus had been introduced by the French biologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1855.[13]
