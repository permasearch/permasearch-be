On 17 March 1960, the CIA put forward their plan for the overthrow of Castro's administration to the U.S. National Security Council (NSC), where it was given the support of US President Dwight D. Eisenhower.[66] The stated first objective of the plan was to "bring about the replacement of the Castro regime with one more devoted to the true interests of the Cuban people and more acceptable to the US in such a manner to avoid any appearance of US intervention."[72] Four major forms of action were to be taken to aid anti-communist opposition in Cuba at the time. These were to: provide a powerful propaganda offensive against the regime, perfect a covert intelligence network within Cuba, develop paramilitary forces outside of Cuba, and get the necessary logistical support for covert military operations on the island. At this stage it was still not clear that an invasion would take place.[73]
