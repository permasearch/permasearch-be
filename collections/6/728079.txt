For example, increasing the gene dosage of the gene SIR-2, which regulates DNA packaging in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, can significantly extend lifespan.[63] The mammalian homolog of SIR-2 is known to induce downstream DNA repair factors involved in NHEJ, an activity that is especially promoted under conditions of caloric restriction.[64] Caloric restriction has been closely linked to the rate of base excision repair in the nuclear DNA of rodents,[65] although similar effects have not been observed in mitochondrial DNA.[66]
