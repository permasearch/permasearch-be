A member of the Evil Horde, Grizzlor is a hairy man-beast creature from the wild. He has thick, brown fur and sharp claws, and he attacks his opponents with the power of brute strength. Most story media have portrayed him as either a mindless brute or as comically unintelligent. He looks more intimidating in the cartoon than the figure.
