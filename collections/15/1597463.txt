Jon Snow and Davos Seaworth arrive at Dragonstone with their soldiers. Tyrion Lannister and Missandei meet them and take their weapons and boat. Daenerys Targaryen offers to make Jon Warden of the North if he bends the knee, but he refuses. They agree Daenerys is not responsible for her father's crimes, but Daenerys denies Jon's assertion he should not be held by his ancestor's oath to hers. Jon explains the threat of White Walkers and wights, but Daenerys wants to claim the Iron Throne before considering other threats. Jon barely stops Davos from revealing Jon's resurrection while endorsing him. Daenerys cuts the meeting short to receive news from Varys that Euron has defeated Yara. Jon is forced to remain at Dragonstone, a prisoner in all but name. Tyrion discourages Daenerys's desire to burn Euron's ships with her dragons, which would require her to accompany them.
