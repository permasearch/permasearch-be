The parish was originally located on the northeast corner of Madison Avenue and East 42nd Street in a Victorian cottage ornéé (ornamental cottage) designed by Jacob Wrey Mould.[1] This building was replaced on the site in 1873[1] by one designed by Leopold Eidlitz in a High Victorian hybrid of the German Romanesque design. This was generally referred to as Dr. Tyng's Church after the "hardworking churchman, the younger Stephen H. Tyng, who organized it in 1874."[2] The church building at that location was rather short-lived: in 1895, the parish merged with St. James', and the building was sold and demolished.[3]
