The term CEU is not a trademarked term; therefore, any educational institution may use it to describe their courses.  In this regard, there are no requirements for educator qualifications that are attached to each institutions courses when offering CEUs.  There have been some bodies created which are attempting to standardize and accredit institutions using the term CEU, the International Association for Continuing Education and Training being one of them; however, professions and industries usually regulate their approved continuing education within their bylaws and not one institute or accrediting body has become a standard to accept in this regard.  Professionals should always consult their Association or regulating body prior to embarking on continuing education and not assume a CEU will be accepted as part of their professional development.
