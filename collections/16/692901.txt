On ultrasound, B-mode imaging depicts lymph node morphology, whilst power Doppler can assess the vascular pattern.[37] B-mode imaging features that can distinguish metastasis and lymphoma include size, shape, calcification, loss of hilar architecture, as well as intranodal necrosis.[37] Soft tissue edema and nodal matting on B-mode imaging suggests tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis or previous radiation therapy.[37] Serial monitoring of nodal size and vascularity are useful in assessing treatment response.[37]
