Kicking is the act of propelling a ball by striking it with the foot or depending upon the sport, with the shin. Kicking is most common in Association Football, where only the two goalkeepers are allowed to use their hands. It is also the primary method of transferring the ball in Australian rules football and Gaelic football. Whereas most sports allow goals, touch downs or tries to be scored by methods other than kicking, in Australian rules football kicking for goal is the only method allowed to score a goal and get the maximum six point score. Kicking is used less frequently in Rugby League, Rugby Union, American, Canadian forms of football and may be restricted to specialist positions, but it is still an important tactical skill in each sport.
