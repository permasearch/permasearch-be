Reductants causing reductive dissolution include natural electron donors such as ascorbic acid and       Fe   (  aq )   2 +      {\displaystyle {\ce {Fe^{2}+_{(}aq)}}}  . Chelating species such as oxalate accelerate the process by detaching surface-bound       Fe    2 +      {\displaystyle {\ce {Fe^{2}+}}}  , opening surface sites for further attack by reductants. Reductive dissolution is also promoted by light.[3]
