Some prime movers (internal combustion engines, reciprocating or turbine steam engines, water wheels, and others) have a range of operating speeds which can be varied continuously (by adjusting fuel rate or similar means). However, efficiency may be low at extremes of the speed range, and there may be system reasons why the prime mover speed cannot be maintained at very low or very high speeds.
