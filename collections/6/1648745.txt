Null-terminated strings require that the encoding does not use a zero byte (0x00) anywhere, therefore it is not possible to store every possible ASCII or UTF-8 string.[5][6][7] However, it is common to store the subset of ASCII or UTF-8 – every character except the NUL character – in null-terminated strings. Some systems use "modified UTF-8" which encodes the NUL character as two non-zero bytes (0xC0, 0x80) and thus allow all possible strings to be stored. This is not allowed by the UTF-8 standard as it is a security risk. A 0xC0, 0x80 NUL might be seen as a string terminator in security validation and as a character when used. Some other byte may be used as end of string instead, like 0xFE or 0xFF, which are not used in UTF-8.
