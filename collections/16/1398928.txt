Macau is an offshore financial centre, a tax haven, and a free port with no foreign exchange control regimes.[93][94][95] The Monetary Authority of Macau regulates offshore finance,[96] while the Macau Trade and Investment Promotion Institute provides services for investment in Macau.[97] In 2007, Moody's Investors Service upgraded Macau's foreign and local currency government issuer ratings to 'Aa3' from 'A1', citing its government's solid finances as a large net creditor. The rating agency also upgraded Macau's foreign currency bank deposit ceiling to 'Aa3' from 'A1'.[98]
