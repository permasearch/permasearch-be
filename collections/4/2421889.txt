In Hinduism, states Jeaneane Fowler, a Murti itself is not god, it is an "image of god" and thus a symbol and representation.[3] A Murti is a form and manifestation, states Fowler, of the formless Absolute.[3] Thus a literal translation of Murti as idol is incorrect, when idol is understood as superstitious end in itself. Just like the photograph of a person is not the real person, a Murti is an image in Hinduism but not the real thing, but in both cases the image reminds of something of emotional and real value to the viewer.[3] When a person worships a Murti, it is assumed to be a manifestation of the essence or spirit of the deity, the worshipper's spiritual ideas and needs are meditated through it, yet the idea of ultimate reality or Brahman is not confined in it.[3]
