The CPP mandates all employed Canadians who are 18 years of age and over to contribute a prescribed portion of their earnings income to a federally administered pension plan. The plan is administered by Employment and Social Development Canada on behalf of employees in all provinces and territories except Quebec, which operates an equivalent plan, the Quebec Pension Plan. Because the Constitutional authority for pensions is shared between the provincial and federal governments, stewardship for the CPP is jointly shared.  As a result, major changes to the CPP, including those that alter how benefits are calculated, require the approval of at least ⅔ of Canadian provinces representing at least ⅔ of the country's population.[4]
