In the final battle against Jones and Cutler Beckett, Bootstrap, still delusional, encounters and fights Will, not recognising him. He is subdued by Will, and only recognises his son after seeing Jones stab Will and catching a glimpse of Will's dagger. In a fit of rage, Bootstrap attacks Jones and is nearly killed before Sparrow uses Will to stab Jones' heart. With their captain gone, Bootstrap and the other crewmen cut out Will's heart and place it in the Dead Man's Chest, restoring him as the new captain of the Dutchman.
