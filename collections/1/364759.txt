Kinsey and Wilson also noted that the cast and crew could neither "confirm nor deny" but were "hoping" for a return of Steve Carell as Michael Scott.[18] In mid-December, Krasinski later revealed that he was optimistic about a return; in an interview with E! Online Krasinski said that the producers were supposedly "still trying to figure out [Carell's] schedule" and that the finale "just wouldn't be the same without him".[31] However, NBC chairman Robert Greenblatt later admitted during an interview that while he is "hopeful", he does not think Carell will return; he noted that Carell was satisfied with his character's exit and did not want to tarnish it.[32] On January 16, Daniels revealed that Carell would not appear in the finale in any capacity,[15] a decision that Carell later reiterated.[33] Three months later, however, the producers for The Office mounted "an 11th-hour effort last month" to get Carell to make a cameo in the show's final episode, according to TVLine.[34] Carell's personal representative confirmed that Carell was on the set for the final episode, but that he did not film any scenes. However, an anonymous source close to the show cryptically said "don't rule anything out".[34] TVLine later reported on May 6, that Carell would appear in a cameo, although NBC declined to comment and Carell's representatives continued to deny the reports.[35] Carell, however, did end up returning for the finale; his character, Michael Scott, becomes Dwight's best man at his wedding.[36][37] A month after the episode aired, Carell explained in an interview with TVLine that he "lied for months to the press, to almost everyone, really".[38] He noted that he "felt terribly for the cast and for [executive producer] Greg Daniels, because they all lied, too."[38] Krasinski, on the other hand, explained that "It was so thrilling. We all just flat-out lied â€¦ It was just one of those things that we all vowed and had to protect".[38]
