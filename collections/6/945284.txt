"My Little Grass Shack" is a hapa haole song, "a hybrid genre that mixed American jazz and dance rhythms (swing and foxtrot), Hawaiian instrumentation (such as the steel guitar and ukulele), and lyrics in both English and Hawaiian"[12] (hapa haole means "half foreign" and is also used in a literal sense to mean "multiracial"). It was written, recorded, and reached the top of the charts nearly two decades after the start of the hapa haole fad, the Hawaiian music craze, which began with the popularity of a 1912 Broadway musical, The Bird of Paradise, and exploded in earnest at the Hawaiian Pavilion at San Francisco's Panama-Pacific International Exposition in 1915.[13]
