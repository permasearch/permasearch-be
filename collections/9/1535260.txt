The music used in the titles was derived from the classic game consoles, and arranged by Go Ichinose. Masuda and Ichinose decided not to change the reused music from the basic background sounds used in the originals, and instead updated them by adding additional sounds. Some of the songs have additional key changes compared to the original soundtrack and some songs that are re-written for the GBA contain sliding between notes.[18] A two-disc set of the music entitled GBA PokÃ©mon FireRed & LeafGreen Super Complete was released, with the first disc featuring all the music used normally in-game, while the second disc featured bonus tracks based on and inspired by the music in the games. Among these are two vocal tracks.[19]
