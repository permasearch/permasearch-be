Chelsea goes into labor just hours after marrying Dylan who delivers the child before mother and son are taken to the hospital. By the time of Connor's birth, Adam had given up on his belief that he is the child's father. However, Chelsea worried about Dylan asking questions. Connor is named after Dylan's late father, Terrence Connor McAvoy.[47] Adam realizes he is Connor's father after he overhears Dylan tell Billy Abbott (Billy Miller) that Connor may have a genetic eye disorder - Retinitis Pigmentosa. After being examined by an eye specialist, it is determined that Connor suffers from Peters Anomaly, and requires an immediate cornea transplant to save his sight. After Delia Abbott is killed in a hit and run by Adam, her corneas are harvested and transplanted to Connor. The surgery is a success and Connor's eyesight is saved.
