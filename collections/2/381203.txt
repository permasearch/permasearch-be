Marie Antoinette's second pregnancy ended in a miscarriage early in July 1779, as confirmed by letters between the queen and her mother, although some historians believed that she may have experienced bleeding related to an irregular menstrual cycle, which she mistook for a lost pregnancy.[73] Her third pregnancy was affirmed in March 1781, and on 22 October she gave birth to Louis Joseph Xavier FranÃ§ois, Dauphin of France.
