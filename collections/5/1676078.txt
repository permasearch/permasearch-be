The German cockroach reproduces faster than any other residential cockroach,[13] growing from egg to reproductive adult in roughly 50 â€“ 60 days.[14]  Once fertilized, a female German cockroach develops an ootheca in her abdomen. The abdomen swells as her eggs develop,  until the translucent tip of the ootheca begins to protrude from the end of her abdomen, and by that time the eggs inside are fully sized, about 1/4 inch long with 16 segments.  The ootheca, at first translucent, soon turns white and then within a few hours it turns pink, progressively darkening until, some 48 hours later, it attains the dark red-brown of the shell of a chestnut.  The ootheca has a keel-like ridge along the line where the young emerge, and curls slightly towards that edge as it completes its maturation.  A small percentage of the nymphs may hatch while the ootheca is still attached to the female, but the majority emerge some 24 hours after it has detached from the female's body.  The newly hatched 3-mm-long black nymphs then progress through six or seven instars before becoming sexually mature, but ecdysis is such a hazardous process that nearly half the nymphs die of natural causes before reaching adulthood.  Molted skins and dead nymphs are soon eaten by living nymphs present at the time of molting.[13]
