The original narrative can be found in the rambling chronicle El Carnero of Juan Rodriguez Freyle. According to Freyle, zipa of the Muisca, in a ritual at Lake Guatavita near present-day Bogot√°, was said to be covered with gold dust, which he then washed off in the lake while his attendants threw trinkets made of gold, emeralds, and precious stones into the lake.
