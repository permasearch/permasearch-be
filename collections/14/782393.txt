Around 10:50Â p.m., the Lennons' limousine returned to the Dakota. Lennon and Ono got out, passed Chapman and walked toward the archway entrance of the building. From the street behind them, Chapman fired three shots from a .38 special revolver, two of which hit Lennon in the chest and one in the left arm, puncturing the left lung and left subclavian artery.[25]
