Controversy over significance testing, and its effects on publication bias in particular, has produced several results. The American Psychological Association has strengthened its statistical reporting requirements after review,[68] medical journal publishers have recognized the obligation to publish some results that are not statistically significant to combat publication bias[69] and a journal (Journal of Articles in Support of the Null Hypothesis) has been created to publish such results exclusively.[70] Textbooks have added some cautions[71] and increased coverage of the tools necessary to estimate the size of the sample required to produce significant results. Major organizations have not abandoned use of significance tests although some have discussed doing so.[68]
