Max Richter's musical composition for the episode was well-received. The Independent writers compliment Richter for "blending the diegetic sounds of the app with the non-diegetic score evoking our protagonist's struggle to determine reality and fiction",[39] an element which Robinson also praises.[25] Fowler calls the score "very compelling"[46] and Monahan describes it as "elegantly elegiac".[7]
