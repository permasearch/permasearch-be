Over time, the structure of the Indonesian economy has changed considerably.[147] Historically, it has been heavily weighted towards agriculture, reflecting both its stage of economic development and government policies in the 1950s and 1960s to promote agricultural self-sufficiency.[147] A gradual process of industrialisation and urbanisation began in the late 1960s, and accelerated in the 1980s as falling oil prices saw the government focus on diversifying away from oil exports and towards manufactured exports.[147] This development continued throughout the 1980s and into the next decade despite the 1990 oil price shock, during which the GDP rose at an average rate of 7.1%. The consistent growth saw the official poverty rate falling from 60% to 15%.[148] From the mid 1980s, the economy became more globally integrated as trade barriers were reduced. The 1997 Asian financial crisis affected Indonesia both economically and politically. The government's initial response was to float the rupiah, raise key domestic interest rates, and tighten fiscal policy. The effects of the crisis were severe. By November 1997, rapid currency depreciation had caused public debt to reach US$60 billion, imposing severe strains on the government's budget.[149] In 1998, real GDP contracted by 13.1% and inflation reached 72% (slowed to 2% in 1999). The economy reached its low point in mid-1999 with only 0.8% real GDP growth.
