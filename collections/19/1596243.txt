Starting in 1995, NBC unveiled a new theme composed by veteran composer Randy Edelman which was used for both their pregame show (now simply titled The NFL on NBC) and during the game.  This theme would be used until the end of the 1997 season, including Super Bowl XXXII between the Denver Broncos and Green Bay Packers. NBC lost AFC television rights after 1997 to CBS which currently has them today. The NFL would not return to NBC until 2006 for Sunday Night Football.  NBC still uses the 1995-1997 era theme, but only for Sunday Night Football online (dubbed NBC Sunday Night Football Extra) if you open the feed prior to the game start time.
