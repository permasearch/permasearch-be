Twilight Struggle has been emulated for computer by Vassal and WarGameRoom.[2] In April 2016, a paid version was released on Steam, which allowed players to play against others via an internet connection as well as, for the first time, against the computer.[3] The computer release was the result of a successful crowdfunding campaign.[4]
