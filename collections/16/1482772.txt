The current reference range for acceptable blood lead concentrations in healthy persons without excessive exposure to environmental sources of lead is less than 5 µg/dL for children.[8] It was less than 25 µg/dL for adults.[162] Previous to 2012 the value for children was 10 (µg/dl).[163] The current biological exposure index (a level that should not be exceeded) for lead-exposed workers in the U.S. is 30 µg/dL in a random blood specimen.
