The Bougainville Civil War, also known as the Bougainville Conflict, was a multi-layered armed conflict fought from 1988 to 1998 between Papua New Guinea and the secessionist forces of the Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA), and between the BRA and other armed groups on Bougainville. The conflict is recognised as the largest conflict in Oceania since the end of World War II, with an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 Bougainvilleans dead.
