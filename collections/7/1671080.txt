MacArthur had one of the most powerful PR machines of any Allied general during the war, which made him into an extremely popular war hero with the American people.[208] In late 1943â€“early 1944, there was a serious effort by the conservative faction in the Republican Party centered in the Midwest to have MacArthur seek the Republican nomination, as they regarded the two men most likely to win the Republican nomination to be the candidate for the presidency in the 1944 election, namely Wendell Willkie and Governor Thomas E. Dewey of New York, as too liberal.[208] For a time, MacArthur, who had long seen himself as a potential president was in the words of the U.S historian Gerhard Weinberg "very interested" in running as the Republican candidate in 1944.[208] However, MacArthur's vow to "return" to the Philippines had not been fulfilled in early 1944 and he decided not to run for president until he had liberated the Philippines.[209]
