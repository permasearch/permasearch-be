As a result, the A's went into a decline that lasted for over 30 years, through three cities. Except for a fifth-place finish in 1944, they finished in last or next-to-last place every year from 1935 to 1946. In 1936, Tom Shibe died, and John succeeded him as club president. However, John resigned due to illness a few months later, leaving the presidency to Mack. When John died on July 11, 1937, Mack bought enough shares from the Shibe estate to become majority owner.[7] However, Mack had been the franchise's number-one man since Ben Shibe's death. Even as bad as the A's got during this time and long after most other teams hired a general manager, Mack retained complete authority over baseball matters, making personnel decisions and leading the team on the field. One of the few times that he even considered ceding some of his duties came in the 1934-35 offseason, when he entertained hiring Babe Ruth to succeed him as manager. However, he backed off from this idea, saying that the Babe's wife, Claire, would be running the team within a month.[8] Even when the Phillies moved to Shibe Park as tenants of the A's midway through the 1938 season, not enough revenue came in for Mack to build another winner.
