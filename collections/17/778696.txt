In 1937, the stadium was renovated and P. K. Wrigley discussed beautification with then Chicago Cubs President Bill Veeck, Sr. Veeck suggested planting ivy on the outfield walls.[31] The ivy was originally English ivy but was later changed to Parthenocissus tricuspidata -- what's commonly called, Boston Ivy and Japanese Bittersweet, which can endure the harsh Chicago winters better than its English cousin.[32] Cuttings from the ivy were sold by local vendors. The Chicago Cubs attempted to grow the ivy on the outside of Wrigley Field as well, but the plantings were often stolen so the Cubs abandoned the plans.[33]
