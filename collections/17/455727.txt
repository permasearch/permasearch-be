Tom Haverford (Aziz Ansari) was an administrator in the parks department for most of the show, although he also became a minor investor in the Snake Hole Lounge and quit at the end of the third season to form an entertainment company with his friend Jean-Ralphio.[24][25] Tom was Leslie's immediate subordinate on the parks department and the two would often work together on tasks.[23] The sarcastic Tom seemed to care little for his mid-level government job and seldom showed any initiative or work ethic. This made him a favorite of Ron Swanson, who once quipped, "I like Tom. He doesn’t do a lot of work around here. He shows zero initiative. He’s not a team player. He’s never one to go that extra mile. Tom is exactly what I’m looking for in a government employee."[26][27] However, Tom harbors strong aspirations of becoming a media mogul, and sometimes used his parks department job to increase his stature and curry favors with others.[23][28] Tom considers himself an extremely stylish dresser and smooth pickup artist,[29][30] and believes he carries himself in the style of rapper Jay-Z.[31] He constantly hits on women, particularly Ann Perkins, but usually to little success.[23][32] Tom was married to an attractive surgeon named Wendy at the start of the show, but it is eventually revealed to be a green card marriage that amicably ends in divorce.[21][33]
