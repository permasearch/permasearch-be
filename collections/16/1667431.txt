In Asia, brown bears are found in nearly every part of Russia, thence to the southeast in a small area of Northeast China, western China, and parts of North Korea. Further west, they reach the southern limits of their worldwide distribution, dwelling spottily in northern Pakistan, Afghanistan and the northernmost point of India, i.e. Jammu and Kashmir.[1] They possibly persist in northern Nepal, northern Bhutan and northern Myanmar but are not confirmed residents today in these nations.[177][178][179]
