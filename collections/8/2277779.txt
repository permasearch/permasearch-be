There is no standard music played before every association football match. Each club chooses its own, although some tournaments may have a stipulated theme, like the Champions League. We are the champions is a common choice, but more idiosyncratic choices include Hi Ho Silver Lining (Wolves) and the theme tune from Z-cars (Everton). I think we used to have an article about this... I'll dig. --Dweller (talk) 23:36, 7 July 2012 (UTC)
