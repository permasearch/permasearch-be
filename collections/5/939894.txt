Reviving an old number one for the second time to create another one for themselves were girl group Atomic Kitten. This time it was Blondie's 1980 chart topper "The Tide Is High", which they changed slightly to make "The Tide Is High (Get the Feeling)". It topped the charts for three weeks and after this they never saw the top of the charts again in the United Kingdom, however they had managed three number-one singles in the UK throughout their career. They split at the beginning of 2004, releasing a Greatest Hits album. US solo performer, Pink scored her first solo chart topper with a track taken from her second album, Missundaztood. The track was called "Just Like a Pill" and gave P!nk her second UK number one. Her album Missundaztood only peaked at number 2 despite producing several hit singles.
