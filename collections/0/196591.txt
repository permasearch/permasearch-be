Rideau Hall, located in Ottawa, is the official residence of the Canadian monarch[82] and of the governor general and is thus the location of the viceregal household and the Chancellery of Honours. For a part of each year since 1872, governors general have also resided at the Citadel (La Citadelle) in Quebec City, Quebec.[83] A governor general's wife is known as the chatelaine of Rideau Hall, though there is no equivalent term for a governor general's husband.
