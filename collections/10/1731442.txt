Adenoviruses are the most common cause of viral conjunctivitis (adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis).[12] Herpetic keratoconjunctivitis, caused by herpes simplex viruses, can be serious and requires treatment with acyclovir. Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is a highly contagious disease caused by one of two enteroviruses, Enterovirus 70 and Coxsackievirus A24. These were first identified in an outbreak in Ghana in 1969, and have spread worldwide since then, causing several epidemics.[13]
