Fry wields a considerable amount of influence through his use of Twitter.[93][94] He is frequently asked to promote various charities and causes, often inadvertently causing their websites to crash because of the volume of traffic generated by his large number of followers; as Fry notes on his website: "Four thousand hits a second all diving down the pipeline at the same time for minutes on end."[95] He uses his influence to recommend underexposed musicians and authors (who often see large increases in web hits and sales)[96][97] and to raise awareness of contemporary issues in the world of media and politics, notably the dropping of an injunction against The Guardian[98][99] and the attacking of Daily Mail columnist Jan Moir over her article on the death of Boyzone member Stephen Gately.[100][101]
