Wanting to bring in Christian mythology to the series, the writers created the angel Castiel.[124] With Kripke wanting to keep the introduction of an angel a secret, the character was instead described as a demon during auditions.[125] Misha Collins was cast as the character. Making his debut in the fourth-season premiere, Castiel resurrects Dean from Hell after his death in the third season, and comes to be an ally of the Winchesters. The character was originally intended for only a six-episode story arc, but the role was later expanded.[126] Collins was promoted to a series regular for the fifth and sixth season, something Collins believes to be mainly due to fan support.[127] Collins was downgraded to recurring status for the seventh and eighth seasons, but returned to series regular status for seasons nine and ten.[128]
