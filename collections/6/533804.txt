The volcanic risk is somewhat mitigated by lahar warning sirens and escape route signs in Pierce County.[50] The more populous King County is also in the lahar area, but currently has no zoning restrictions due to volcanic hazard.[51] More recently (since 2001) funding from the federal government for lahar protection in the area has dried up, leading local authorities in at-risk cities like Orting to fear a disaster similar to the Armero tragedy.[52][53]
