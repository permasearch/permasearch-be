Another proposed solution was to use a mechanical timepiece, to be carried on a ship, that would maintain the correct time at a reference location. The concept of using a clock can be attributed to Gemma Frisius. Attempts had been made on land using pendulum clocks, with some success. In particular, Huygens had made accurate pendulum clocks that made it possible to determine longitude on land. He also proposed the use of a balance spring to regulate clocks. There is some dispute as to whether he or Robert Hooke first proposed this idea.[13] However, many, including Isaac Newton, were pessimistic that a clock of the required accuracy could ever be developed. At that time, there were no clocks that could maintain accurate time while being subjected to the conditions of a moving ship. The rolling, pitching and yawing, coupled with the pounding of wind and waves, would knock existing clocks out of the correct time.
