A fail-safe cooling system with a dual speed electric fan was put in place, along with a coil-on-plug ignition system. Larger dual piston brake calipers were added to the front, requiring 16Â inch wheels to be standard.[5] A Watt's linkage was added to the rear suspension. Fuel lines were moved to the passenger side frame rail. A coded ignition key (known as Passive Anti-Theft System, or "PATS") system was introduced and a 72 amp/hour battery replaced the previous 58. Other minor changes included a redesigned engine cover and the power steering fluid reservoir being moved to the front of the engine.[5]
