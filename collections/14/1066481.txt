Boro Grove's Spore Flowers are Wonderland plant species. The spore flowers grow on trunks of Boro Grove trees, and they exude a purple-pinkish cloud of fog that gives off a fragrant perfume. Those that inhale the scent are plagued with almost instant amnesia and are drawn into a lively stupor of wanting to stay in the Boro Grove. If the person stays in this state after a short period of time, he or she will begin turning into a Boro Grove tree. The spore flowers affect humans, except for those who don't have their hearts.
