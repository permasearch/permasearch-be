Recent publications from the office of the President of the United States of America also refer to Ph.D. holders as Dr. Soandso,[81][82] and Second Lady Jill Biden used the style "Dr. Jill Biden" after earning her Ph.D.[83][84] For addresses (defined as "the conventional forms of address as determined by social and official custom"), NASA uses "Dr. (full name)" in addresses for Ph.D. holders while for physicians it uses "(full name), MD", although both are addressed as "Dr. (surname)" in the salutation (which is described as "informal").[85] The National Institutes of Health similarly use "Dr. (surname)" in salutations for people with an M.D., Ph.D. or D.D.S.[86] They advise using full name followed by degrees in addressees, explicitly stating not to use the title "Dr.", although an example in the following paragraph does, in fact, use the title rather than giving degrees.[87]
