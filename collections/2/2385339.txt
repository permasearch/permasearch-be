The system was developed in the 1970s for the South African Defence Force to clear military convoy routes of mines in Namibia and Angola. The VMMD system consists of two Husky vehicles. The first one acts as a Mine Detection Vehicle (MDV). In the past this vehicle was called a Meerkat and wasn't a 4x4. The second Husky in the system tows a set of three Duisendpoots and is known as a towing /mine detection vehicle (T/MDV) The latest version of the Husky, the 2G, has high sensitivity low metal content detectors, ground penetrating radar, powerful air blowers and a robotic arm. This extra equipment has caused the design of Husky to evolve to take a second crew member. The Husky 2G was voted one of the US Army's Top 10 most innovative advances in Army technology.[1]
