In the spring of 1949, Robinson turned to Hall of Famer George Sisler, working as an advisor to the Dodgers, for batting help. At Sisler's suggestion, Robinson spent hours at a batting tee, learning to hit the ball to right field.[157] Sisler taught Robinson to anticipate a fastball, on the theory that it is easier to subsequently adjust to a slower curveball.[157] Robinson also noted that "Sisler showed me how to stop lunging, how to check my swing until the last fraction of a second".[157] The tutelage helped Robinson raise his batting average from .296 in 1948 to .342 in 1949.[157] In addition to his improved batting average, Robinson stole 37 bases that season, was second place in the league for both doubles and triples, and registered 124 runs batted in with 122 runs scored.[87] For the performance Robinson earned the Most Valuable Player Award for the National League.[87] Baseball fans also voted Robinson as the starting second baseman for the 1949 All-Star Gameâ€”the first All-Star Game to include black players.[158][159]
