In July 2010, Molly is thrilled when her neighbour Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver) expresses an interest in buying their house, much to Tyrone's despair. However, whilst Eileen and Owen Armstrong (Ian Puleston-Davies) are examining the house, Molly has a health scare and nearly collapses. At the hospital the doctors tell her that her collapse was caused by stress. Molly changes her mind about moving and decides to remain in Weatherfield.
