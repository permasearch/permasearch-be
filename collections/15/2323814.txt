In the Moone Boy episode "Godfellas", the character Martin Moon is shown to be named by his grandfather after San Martin De Porres. Humorously, his grandfather is unable to actually remember any of San Martin's accomplishments, and simply refers to him as "One of the black ones" when asked about him.
