Pater is perhaps the most frequent epithet of Janus, found also in the composition Ianuspater. While numerous gods share this cultic epithet it seems the Romans felt it was typically pertinent to Janus.[72] When invoked along with other gods, usually only he is called pater.[73] For Janus the title is not just a term of respect; principally it marks his primordial role. He is the first of the gods and thus their father: the formula quasi deorum deum corresponds to diuum deus of the carmen Saliare.[74] Similarly, in the expression duonus Cerus, Cerus means creator and is considered a masculine form related to Ceres.[75] Lydus gives Πατρίκιος (Patricius) and explains it as autóchthon: since he does not give another epithet corresponding to Pater it may be inferred that Lydus understands Patricius as a synonym of Pater.[76] There is no evidence connecting Janus to gentilician[clarification needed] cults or identifying him as a national god particularly venerated by the oldest patrician families.[77]
