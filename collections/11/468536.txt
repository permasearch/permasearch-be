While Chris packs to leave, he finds photos of Rose in prior relationships with black men, contradicting her claim that Chris is her first black boyfriend; the collection also includes pictures of Rose with Walter and Georgina. Chris is blocked from leaving by the Armitage family, including Rose. He tries to attack Jeremy, but Missy hypnotizes him. Chris awakens strapped to a chair in the basement. A video presentation featuring Rose's grandfather Roman explains that the family transplants the brains of white people into black bodies; the consciousness of the host remains in the "sunken place", conscious but powerless, and the operation is largely painless. Hudson tells Chris he wants his body so he can gain Chris's sight and artistic talents.
