Nudge is 11 years old (12 in Fang, Angel, and Nevermore), has brown skin, and has wild, curly, long, dark brown hair. Described as Max's best supporter and the peacemaker, she likes Max over Fang and can't live without her. Her wings are often said to be tawny-brown, almost cream. Her real name is revealed to be Monique, and she managed to track down who she believes to be her mother because of the resemblance in skin tone, but never meets her because she is attacked by Ari. She is a "motormouth" as said by Max several times in the books. The Flock calls her the Nudge Channel because when she's awake it's "all Nudge, all the time." She likes fashion, especially about hair, clothes, and make-up. Nudge can hack into computers with her ability to sense leftover emotions, also called psychometric, and she can draw metal towards her by will, like a magnet. Of the flock, Nudge is the one who most longs for the normality of the lives of other kids their age; in MAX, when Jeb offers the Flock to stay at a day and night school, Nudge wants to stay and get her wings cut off.
