There have been three different music videos for the song. The first, accompanying the Australian release of the song, was directed by Catherine Caines and Chris Bentley, and was shot in black and white. This version features Darren Hayes and Daniel Jones performing on what appears to be a space vessel, whilst a female passenger watches. A version of the video accompanied by a dance remix of the track was also released.[5]
