Successful participation, especially in federal elections, requires large amounts of money, especially for television advertising.[24] This money is very difficult to raise by appeals to a mass base,[25] although in the 2008 election, candidates from both parties had success with raising money from citizens over the Internet,[26] as had Howard Dean with his Internet appeals. Both parties generally depend on wealthy donors and organizationsâ€”traditionally the Democrats depended on donations from organized labor while the Republicans relied on business donations.[citation needed] This dependency on donors is controversial, and has led to laws limiting spending on political campaigns being enacted (see campaign finance reform). Opponents of campaign finance laws cite the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech, and challenge campaign finance laws because they attempt to circumvent the people's constitutionally guaranteed rights. Even when laws are upheld, the complication of compliance with the First Amendment requires careful and cautious drafting of legislation, leading to laws that are still fairly limited in scope, especially in comparison to those of other countries such as the United Kingdom, France or Canada.
