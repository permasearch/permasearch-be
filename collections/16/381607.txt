Brooks Koepka duplicated his Saturday score of 66 to win by two strokes ahead of runner-up Tiger Woods, who fired a 64 in the best final round of his career in a major. Koepka became the fifth American player to win three majors before the age of 29, joining Jack Nicklaus, Jordan Spieth, Tom Watson and Woods.
