Julie finds an article mentioning Susie's father, Ben Willis, and realizes it is Ben they ran over, moments after he had killed David to avenge his daughter. She then goes to the docks to tell Ray, but he refuses to believe her. Julie notices Ray's boat is called Billy Blue and runs away before Ray can explain that he went to see Missy to relieve his conscience. Ben appears, knocks Ray out, and invites Julie to hide on his boat. Looking around, she finds photos and articles about her friends and her, and pictures of Susie. Ben's boat leaves the docks, as Ray regains consciousness and steals a motorboat to rescue Julie, who is being chased all around Ben's boat. Ray ultimately uses the rigging to sever Ben's hook-carrying hand and send him overboard. When the police question them, they deny knowing why Ben attempted to kill them, but they are relieved not to have actually killed anybody the previous summer, and reconcile.
