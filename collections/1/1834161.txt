"Hot Girl" introduced the recurring role of Katy, portrayed by Amy Adams. Katy would appear in two more episodes: "The Fire" and "Booze Cruise". Adams remarked that she thoroughly enjoyed her work on the show.[6] In an interview with Advocate.com, she said that The Office "was the best work experience. I loved that show and that cast so much. I don't know if they believe me, but every time I see them I'm like, 'Oh my gosh, I'll do anything to come back.'"[6] Several years after she left the show as a recurring character, B. J. Novak wanted to write her a cameo in the seventh season episode "Threat Level Midnight", but she was unavailable for filming.[7] "Hot Girl" was one of two first season episodes, the other being "Health Care", that did not contain commentary by members of the cast and crew on the season DVD.[5]
