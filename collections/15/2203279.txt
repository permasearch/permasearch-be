Misdiagnosis does sometimes occur. In a highly influential[15] study from the 1960s, Eliot Slater demonstrated that misdiagnoses had occurred in one third of his 112 patients with conversion disorder.[16] Later authors have argued that the paper was flawed, however,[17][18] and a meta-analysis has shown that misdiagnosis rates since that paper was published are around 4%, the same as for other neurological diseases.[9]
