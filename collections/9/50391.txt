In 1958 post-war Britain, Stevens, the butler of Darlington Hall, receives a letter from Miss Kenton, a recently-divorced former colleague employed as the housekeeper some twenty years earlier. Lord Darlington has died a broken man, his reputation destroyed after he was exposed as a Nazi sympathizer, and his stately country manor has been sold to a retired United States Congressman, Mr Jack Lewis. Stevens is granted permission to borrow his Daimler, and he sets off to the West Country to meet Miss Kenton.
