The two nations cooperated closely in World War II,[80] as both nations saw new levels of prosperity and a determination to defeat the Axis powers.

Roosevelt were determined not to repeat the mistakes of their predecessors.[81] They met in August 1940 at Ogdensburg, issuing a declaration calling for close cooperation, and formed the Permanent Joint Board on Defense (PJBD).
