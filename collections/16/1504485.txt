Sleep timing depends greatly on hormonal signals from the circadian clock, or Process C, a complex neurochemical system which uses signals from an organism's environment to recreate an internal dayâ€“night rhythm. Process C counteracts the homeostatic drive for sleep during the day (in diurnal animals) and augments it at night.[19][16] The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a brain area directly above the optic chiasm, is presently considered the most important nexus for this process; however, secondary clock systems have been found throughout the body.
