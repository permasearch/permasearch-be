Chris marshals his people to search for Omar but he eludes them and remains a thorn in the Stanfield Organization's side. Omar then robs a money pick-up and wounds a Stanfield soldier.[16][17] Omar also robs a Marlo stash house, where he kills an enforcer named Manny and later kills Savino Bratton.[18][19] Omar calls for Marlo to face him in the streets and attacks his reputation at every opportunity but Chris prevents this information from reaching Marlo. Omar is ultimately killed by Kenard.[14][15] Omar's possessions include a list of Stanfield personnel which is passed to Freamon and allows him to make the connection between Marlo and Cheese.[14][15]
