Anchored by Judy Woodruff, the program's weekday broadcasts run one hour in length and are produced by Washington, DC PBS station WETA-TV. From August 2013 to October 2016, Woodruff and then-co-anchor Gwen Ifill were the first and only all-female anchor team of a national nightly news program on broadcast television.[2] Since its launch in September 2013, 30-minute, Saturday and Sunday editions of the program (titled as PBS NewsHour Weekend) have been anchored by Hari Sreenivasan and produced by New York City PBS station WNET.[3]
