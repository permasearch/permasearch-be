The decision on which edition should be used is for the cricket authority which runs the particular competition.[27] The ICC Playing Handbook[28] requires the use of the Professional Edition for internationals.[29] This also applies to most countries' national competitions.[27] At lower levels of the game, where use of a computer cannot always be guaranteed, the Standard Edition is used.[30]
