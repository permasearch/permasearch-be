The submandibular space is a fascial space of the head and neck (sometimes also termed fascial spaces or tissue spaces). It is a potential space, and is paired on either side, located on the superficial surface of the mylohyoid muscle between the anterior and posterior bellies of the digastric muscle.[1] The space corresponds to the anatomic region termed the submandibular triangle, part of the anterior triangle of the neck.
