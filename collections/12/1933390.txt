The parasitism is not necessarily entirely detrimental to the host species. A 16-year dataset was used in 2014 to find that parasitized crows' nests were more successful overall (more likely to produce at least one crow fledgling) than cuckoo-free nests. The researchers attributed this to a strong-smelling substance secreted by cuckoo chicks when attacked that repels predators, and commented "Interactions that have been clearly classified as 'parasitic' or 'mutualistic' might be more complex. Perhaps we need to look more closely at these interactions before giving species such tags or labels".[29]
