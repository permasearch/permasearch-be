Wichita State's rivalry with Tulsa dates back to the 1930–31 season.[18] The two schools were in the Missouri Valley Conference from 1945 to 1996. Beginning in the 1996–97 season, this series continued as an out-of-conference rivalry and has been most recently continuously played since the 2010–11 season, after being played in the 1996–97, 1997–98, and 2000–01 to 2004–05 seasons.[19][20][21] As of the 2014–15 season, Wichita State leads the series 66–61 following a five-game winning streak since the series resumed in 2010. Tulsa ended WSU's 5 game winning streak with a 10 point win in Tulsa. WSU has won two since then, one at home and one on the road in a close three point game![22]
