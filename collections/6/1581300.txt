The border states of Maryland (November 1864)[16] and Missouri (January 1865),[17] one of the Confederate states, Tennessee (January 1865),[18] and the new state of West Virginia (February 1865),[19] abolished slavery just prior to the end of the Civil War (May 1865). In the District of Columbia, slavery was abolished in 1862.[20] However, slavery persisted in Delaware,[21] Kentucky,[22] and 10 of the 11 of the former Confederate states, until the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution abolished slavery throughout the United States on December 6, 1865, ending the distinction between slave and free states.[23]
