Interstate 295 (abbreviated I-295) in New Jersey and Delaware is an auxiliary Interstate Highway, designated as a bypass around Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The route begins at a junction with I-95 south of Wilmington, Delaware, and runs to another junction with I-95 north of Trenton, New Jersey. The highway heads east from I-95 and crosses the Delaware River from Delaware to New Jersey on the Delaware Memorial Bridge concurrent with U.S. Route 40 (US 40). Upon entering New Jersey, the two routes split and I-295 runs parallel to the New Jersey Turnpike for most of its course in the state. After a concurrency with US 130 in Gloucester County, I-295 has an interchange with I-76 and Route 42 in Camden County. The freeway continues northeast toward Trenton, where it intersects I-195 and Route 29 before bypassing the city to the east and ending at US 1 in Lawrence Township, where the road becomes I-95 southbound.
