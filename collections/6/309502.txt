Sometimes described as one of the "most powerful yet unknown" government agencies,[5][6] OFAC has been in existence since 1950, and plays an increasingly significant role as a foreign policy lever of the U.S. government.[original research?] The agency is empowered to levy significant penalties against entities that defy its directives, including imposing fines, freezing assets, and barring parties from operating in the U.S. In 2014, OFAC reached a record $963 million settlement with the French bank BNP Paribas, which was a portion of an $8.9 billion penalty imposed in relation to the case as a whole.[7]
