A younger incarnation of Seifer Almasy appears in Kingdom Hearts II as the leader of a group called the "Twilight Town Disciplinary Committee", which also includes similar versions of Raijin and Fujin (named "Rai" and "Fuu", respectively). Twilight Town also depicts Vivi Ornitier as an admirer of Seifer, and Setzer Gabbiani as a champion of the local "Struggle" sport.
