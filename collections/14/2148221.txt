The magazine Rolling Stone says the frontman "dyed his hair fiery red, and he's pissed at everyone: junkies, party girls, Hollywood, and most of all himself, for getting so damn famous", and that Danger Days is a total rejection of the rock infladÃ­simo celebrity. In the same vein, the song "Na Na Na (Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na)" presents a stand of criticism of consumerist culture of the United States. The magazine Chilango argues that "the letters of the album have elements of science fiction, horror and comics, which helps to create an atmosphere of pop culture that is heard along entire disk". Similarly, claims that the songs "Party Poison", "Vampire Money" and "Planetary (GO!)" show a new side of the band: a fun and partying, previously seen for a moment in the song "Teenagers".
