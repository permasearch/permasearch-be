Demonic creatures of fire and shadow, Balrogs were fallen Maiar who were loyal to Morgoth. They participated in the wars of the First Age of Middle-earth but were mostly destroyed during the War of Wrath. By the Third Age, the only known remaining Balrog was "Durin's Bane," the Balrog of Moria, who was slain by Gandalf.
