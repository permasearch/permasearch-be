Jerome "Chef" McElroy (voiced by Isaac Hayes) was one of few African American characters in South Park, and the chef at the South Park Elementary School. In the initial season, his gimmick line, as the four boys come into the cafeteria was, "Hello there, children!" They would respond with, "Hey, Chef." This was usually followed by Chef asking "How's it going?" and the boys would reply "Bad." A stereotypical character, Chef is obsessed with sex (especially with white women). In "Chef Aid", it is revealed that he committed bestiality with a goat. He is a talented singer, and has a tendency to sing wildly inappropriate songs when his muse strikes him. The children often seek him out when in need of guidance or information.  Sometimes the advice given by Chef is inappropriate, such as in South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut, Stan asks Chef how he can get Wendy to like him and he replies, "That's easy. You just gotta find the clitoris." He refers to the boys as 'children' even if there is only one of them present. He once almost married a succubus, but the boys saved him. He has not been seen since "Return of Chef" because of the departure of Hayes. In this episode, he is "killed", but is then seen being remade with a body similar to that of Darth Vader.
