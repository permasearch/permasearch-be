Launched in December 2003 Energon would retain the numbering system from Armada, as well as the creative team of Furman and Guidi. Issue 19 would pick up where Armada left off, reintroducing the main cast - as well as Unicron and the new threat of the Terrorcons. Issues 20–23 (drawn by Guidi and Joe Ng) saw the introduction of Unicron's Four Horsemen and most of the relevant cast (Prime, Hot Shot, etc.) receiving their Energon Powerlinking bodies, as well as establishing that Megatron's Spark was trapped within Unicron. It also saw the Terrorcons journey to Earth and saw the return of the principal human cast, as well as the introduction of Kicker. Issue #24, drawn by James Raiz, focused on the past relationship between Ironhide and Tidal Wave. Issue #25, again drawn by Ng, introduced the Omnicons and Snow Cat. Issues 26–29, drawn by Alex Milne, saw a full-scale Terrorcon attack on Earth, Prime aiding Megatron's rebirth and Starscream's return in his Energon form. Issue 30 saw a confrontation between Megatron and Scorponok—but the bankruptcy of Dreamwave prevented this story from being finished.
