Chestnut timber is decorative. Light brown in color, it is sometimes confused with oak wood.[85] The two woods' textures are similar.[33] When in a growing stage, with very little sap wood, a chestnut tree contains more timber of a durable quality than an oak of the same dimensions. Young chestnut wood has proved more durable than oak for woodwork that has to be partly in the ground, such as stakes and fences.[18]
