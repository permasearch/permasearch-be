There are over 5,300 known mineral species; as of March 2017[update], over 5,230 of these had been approved by the International Mineralogical Association (IMA).[2] The silicate minerals compose over 90% of the Earth's crust. Silicon and oxygen constitute approximately 75% of the Earth's crust, which translates directly into the predominance of silicate minerals.
