Daenerys Targaryen enjoys holding court at Qarth and watching her dragons grow. At a party given by her rich host Xaro Xhoan Daxos, the warlock Pyat Pree invites Daenerys to visit the "House of the Undying," while the masked Quaithe warns Ser Jorah Mormont of dangers that face Daenerys. Later, Xaro asks Daenerys for her hand in marriage in exchange for enough wealth and power to take King's Landing. Jorah vehemently opposes this, arguing that she needs to win the Iron Throne on her own rather than as a perceived foreign puppet. After questioning Jorah's motives, Daenerys eventually hears him out and agrees with him.
