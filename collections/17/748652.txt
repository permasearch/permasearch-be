The reductase of the microsomal P450 systems, Cytochrome P-450 reductase (CPR) contains both an FMN and FAD. Electrons are passed from NADPH to the FAD of CPR then to the FMN and finally to the heme cofactor of cytochromes P-450. In reductive titrations, the FMN and FAD were found to both be able to exist as neutral semiquinones. The flavins are only about 4Ã… apart, which suggests that electron transfer is direct between them.[22]
