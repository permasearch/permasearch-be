After Adolf Hitler rose to power during the great depression, he condemned his earlier smoking habit as a waste of money.[34] In later years, Hitler viewed smoking as "decadent"[35] and "the wrath of the Red Man against the White Man, vengeance for having been given hard liquor,"[34] lamenting that "...so many excellent men have been lost to tobacco poisoning."[36]
