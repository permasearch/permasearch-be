Godzilla's allegiance and motivations have changed from film to film to suit the needs of the story. Although Godzilla does not like humans,[51] it will fight alongside humanity against common threats. However, it makes no special effort to protect human life or property[52] and will turn against its human allies on a whim. It is not motivated to attack by predatory instinct: it does not eat people,[53] and instead sustains itself on radiation[54] and an omnivorous diet.[55] When inquired if Godzilla was "good or bad", producer Shogo Tomiyama likened it to a Shinto "God of Destruction" which lacks moral agency and cannot be held to human standards of good and evil. "He totally destroys everything and then there is a rebirth. Something new and fresh can begin."[53]
