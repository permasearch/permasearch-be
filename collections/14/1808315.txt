An Inspector General report resulting from a US Army investigation conducted between 3 and 8 May 1945 and titled, "American Army Investigation of Alleged Mistreatment of German Guards at Dachau," found that 21 plus "a number" of presumed SS men were killed with others being wounded after their surrender had been accepted.[97][98] In addition, 25 to 50 SS guards were estimated to have been killed by the liberated prisoners.[99] Lee Miller visited the camp just after liberation, and photographed several guards who were killed by soldiers or prisoners.[100]
