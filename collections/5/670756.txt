The Omani government decides who can or cannot be a journalist and this permission can be withdrawn at any time.[67] Censorship and self-censorship are a constant factor.[67] Omanis have limited access to political information through the media.[68] Access to news and information can be problematic: journalists have to be content with news compiled by the official news agency on some issues.[67] Through a decree by the Sultan, the government has now extended its control over the media to blogs and other websites.[67] Omanis cannot hold a public meeting without the government's approval.[67] Omanis who want to set up a non-governmental organisation of any kind need a licence.[67] To get a licence, they have to demonstrate that the organisation is "for legitimate objectives" and not "inimical to the social order".[67] The Omani government does not permit the formation of independent civil society associations.[65]
