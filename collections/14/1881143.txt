The theory of three-phase power systems tells us that as long as the loads on each of the three phases are balanced, we can consider each phase separately.[2] In power engineering, this assumption is often useful, and to consider all three phases requires more effort with very little potential advantage.[3] An important and frequent exception is an asymmetric fault on only one or two phases of the system.
