Montana had a prolific season in 1982. However, the regular season was shortened to nine games when members of the Player's Association went on strike. Although San Francisco failed to make the playoffs, Montana threw for 2,613 yards and 17 touchdowns during the year. He also set what was then an NFL record with five consecutive 300-yard passing games. Because the 49ers missed the playoffs, the team seriously considered trading him to the Baltimore Colts for the rights to the first overall pick in the 1983 NFL Draft (and thus, the rights to draft Stanford quarterback John Elway), but the 49ers reconsidered and ultimately traded their 1st round pick to the San Diego Chargers (used on Billy Ray Smith Jr.) weeks before the draft.[27]
