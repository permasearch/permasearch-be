Infections in pigs leads to poor weight gain and thus financial losses for the farmer.[1] In pigs the infection is due to Ascaris suum.[1] In horses and other equines, the equine roundworm is Parascaris equorum and the parasites are colloquially called Ascarids. A problem for young animals more than for mature ones, clinical signs include unthriftiness, potbelly, rough hair coat, and slow growth.[35]
