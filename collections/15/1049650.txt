On the eve of the election, Merkel was still favored to win a decisive victory based on opinion polls.[54] On 18 September 2005, Merkel's CDU/CSU and Schröder's SPD went head-to-head in the national elections, with the CDU/CSU winning 35.2% (CDU 27.8%/CSU 7.5%)[citation needed] of the second votes to the SPD's 34.2%.[54] The result was so close, both Schröder and Merkel claimed victory.[40][54] Neither the SPD-Green coalition nor the CDU/CSU and its preferred coalition partners, the Free Democratic Party, held enough seats to form a majority in the Bundestag.[54] A grand coalition between the CDU/CSU and SPD faced the challenge that both parties demanded the chancellorship.[54][55] However, after three weeks of negotiations, the two parties reached a deal whereby Merkel would become Chancellor and the SPD would hold 8 of the 16 seats in the cabinet.[55]
