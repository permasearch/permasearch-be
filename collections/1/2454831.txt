Trump frequently praised Russia's Vladimir Putin, calling him a strong leader, "unlike what we have in this country,"[675] "a man so highly respected within his own country and beyond,"[676] and wondered if "he will become my new best friend."[677] He continued to praise Putin throughout the campaign, comparing him favorably to Obama, hailing Russia as an ally in fighting ISIS, and downplaying any suggestion that Russia had behaved aggressively in the world.[678] He also dismissed the assertion by U.S. intelligence officials that Russia is responsible for the computer hacking of Democratic party organizations and individuals.[679] Trump called for closer relations with Russia and "has surrounded himself with a team of advisers who have had financial ties to Russia."[680]
