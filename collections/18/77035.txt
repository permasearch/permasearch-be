In 1905, Cadbury launched its Dairy Milk bar, a production of exceptional quality with a higher proportion of milk than previous chocolate bars.[9] Developed by George Cadbury Jr, it was the first time a British company had been able to mass-produce milk chocolate.[13] From the beginning, it had the distinctive purple wrapper.[13] It was a great sales success, and became the company's best selling product by 1914.[9] The stronger Bournville Cocoa line was introduced in 1906.[9] Cadbury Dairy Milk and Bournville Cocoa were to provide the basis for the company's rapid pre-war expansion.[9] In 1910, Cadbury sales overtook those of Fry for the first time.[13]
