A surgery procedure exists where the joint of the injured area will be freed in order to achieve a full range of motion without too much pain and discomfort, speeding up recovery time and allowing the person to better perform optimally. A study conducted by Jin-Young Park investigated the benefits of using capsular release to help relieve the stiffness of the shoulders that usually come whenever there is an injury in the rotator cuff. Some of the subjects had diabetes mellitus, which can also cause shoulder stiffness, impeding external rotation of the shoulders. Of the 49 subjects recruited for this trial, 21 went through only manipulation to relieve stiffness, while the other 28 underwent a capsular release surgery along with the manipulation to treat shoulder stiffness. Although, overall, no improvement in outcome was seen with regards to external rotation between the control and treatment group, the subjects that had diabetes mellitus benefited from the treatment that included the capsular release surgery.[24] Their rotator cuff function improved significantly in both forward flexion and external rotation compared to the subjects that were not diagnosed with diabetes mellitus.
