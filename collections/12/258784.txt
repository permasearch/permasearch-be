Gerard Marenghi, eventually known as Jerry Maren, was born on January 24, 1920 in Boston, Massachusetts.[5] His father, Emil Marenghi, worked at a shoe factory. He had five sisters and four brothers, who were all of average height.[6] In The Wizard of Oz, he played the green-garbed member of the Lollipop Guild (between Jakob "Jackie" Gerlich and Harry Earles), handing a lollipop to Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland). Maren was eighteen years old when he shot his scenes for The Wizard of Oz in the latter part of 1938 and early 1939. At that time he stood just three feet six inches (107 cm). He was especially chosen to be the central figure in the male Munchkin trio, and this afforded him the distinct privilege of handing the complimentary sweet to Dorothy. It was because of his unique abilities to sing and dance well that he was selected for the role.
