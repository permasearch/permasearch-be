On September 12, 2013, NASA officially confirmed that Voyager 1 had reached the interstellar medium in August 2012 as previously observed, with a generally accepted date of August 25, 2012, the date durable changes in the density of energetic particles were first detected.[61][62][63] By this point most space scientists had abandoned the hypothesis that a change in magnetic field direction must accompany crossing of the heliopause;[62] a new model of the heliopause predicted that no such change would be found.[73] A key finding that persuaded many scientists that the heliopause had been crossed was an indirect measurement of an 80-fold increase in electron density, based on the frequency of plasma oscillations observed beginning on April 9, 2013,[62] triggered by a solar outburst that had occurred in March 2012[59] (electron density is expected to be two orders of magnitude higher outside the heliopause than within).[61] Weaker sets of oscillations measured in October and November 2012[71][74] provided additional data. An indirect measurement was required because Voyager 1's plasma spectrometer had stopped working in 1980.[63] In September 2013, NASA released audio renditions of these plasma waves. The recordings represent the first sounds to be captured in interstellar space.[75]
