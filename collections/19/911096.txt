Traditional African masks are one of the elements of great African art that have most evidently influenced Europe and Western art in general; in the 20th century, artistic movements such as cubism, fauvism and expressionism have often taken inspiration from the vast and diverse heritage of African masks.[1] Influences of this heritage can also be found in other traditions such as South- and Central American masked Carnival parades.[2]
