In Bournemouth, Rattenbury's financial problems continued, causing his relationship with Alma to deteriorate. She began an affair with George Percy Stoner (19 November 1916 – 24 March 2000), their 18‑year‑old chauffeur. Stoner had been recruited through an advertisement in the Bournemouth Daily Echo, and had been living a sheltered, largely friendless life with his parents before moving into the Rattenburys' home, the 'Villa Madeira', in Manor Road.
