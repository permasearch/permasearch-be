In 1998, a gene was found to be associated with the mutation. On chromosome 19, the gene known as STK11 (LKB1)[8] is a possible tumor suppressor gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that anyone who has PJS has a 50% chance of passing the disease on to their offspring.[citation needed]
