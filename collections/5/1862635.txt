But as she got older she started to do more styles and has trained in everything except ballroom.[5] From the ages of four to thirteen, Lukasiak competed throughout the United States as part of ALDC, winning numerous titles at the regional, state, and national levels at the few small competitions that would allow filming for Dance Moms, including Junior Miss Dance Masters of America 2011.[6] Lukasiak competed on Dance Moms in many dance genres: lyrical, contemporary,[4] musical theatre, ballet, jazz, hip-hop, acro, and Bollywood.
