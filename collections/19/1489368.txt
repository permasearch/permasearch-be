Five days after the referendum, André Dallaire, a schizophrenic "Yes" supporter upset at the result, broke into Chrétien's Ottawa residence armed with a knife.[91] Dallaire attempted to find Chrétien and kill the prime minister in his bed before being discovered by Aline Chrétien, who barricaded the bedroom door.[92] Chrétien was unharmed, and Dallaire would eventually be found not criminally responsible by reason of mental defect.[93]
