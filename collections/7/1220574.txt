The modern Oreo cookie filling was developed by Nabisco's principal food scientist, Sam Porcello.[7][13] Porcello held five patents directly related to his work on the Oreo.[13] He also created a line of Oreo cookies covered in dark chocolate and white chocolate.[7][13] Porcello retired from Nabisco in 1993.[7] In the early 1990s, health concerns prompted Nabisco to replace the lard in the filling with partially hydrogenated vegetable oil.[14] Oreo cookies are popular with certain dietary restrictions, like vegans, because the cream inside the cookie is not made from any animal products,[15] however, there is a risk of cross-contamination from other dairy-containing products made in the same production areas.[16]
