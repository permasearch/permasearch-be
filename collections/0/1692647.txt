Jesus at the home of Martha and Mary (also referred to as Christ in the House of Martha and by other variant names) refers to an episode in the life of Jesus which appears only in Luke's Gospel (Luke 10:38–42), and can be read immediately after the Parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25–37).[1] Jesus visits the home of Lazarus, Martha and Mary of Bethany,[2] the latter typically conflated in Catholic medieval tradition with Mary Magdalene, though the New Testament probably means a different person.
