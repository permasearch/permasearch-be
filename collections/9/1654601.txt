In 1989, Pons and Fleischmann submitted papers to the Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry claiming that they had observed fusion in a room temperature device and disclosing their work in a press release.[98] Some scientists reported excess heat, neutrons, tritium, helium and other nuclear effects in so-called cold fusion systems, which for a time gained interest as showing promise. Hopes fell when replication failures were weighed in view of several reasons cold fusion is not likely to occur, the discovery of possible sources of experimental error, and finally the discovery that Fleischmann and Pons had not actually detected nuclear reaction byproducts.[99] By late 1989, most scientists considered cold fusion claims dead,[100] and cold fusion subsequently gained a reputation as pathological science.[101] However, a small community of researchers continues to investigate cold fusion[100][102][103][104] claiming to replicate Fleishmann and Pons' results including nuclear reaction byproducts.[105][106] Claims related to cold fusion are largely disbelieved in the mainstream scientific community.[107] In 1989, the majority of a review panel organized by the US Department of Energy (DOE) found that the evidence for the discovery of a new nuclear process was not persuasive. A second DOE review, convened in 2004 to look at new research, reached conclusions similar to the first.[108]
