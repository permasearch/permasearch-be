Octavian could not rely on his limited funds to make a successful entry into the upper echelons of the Roman political hierarchy.[34] After a warm welcome by Caesar's soldiers at Brundisium,[35] Octavian demanded a portion of the funds that were allotted by Caesar for the intended war against the Parthian Empire in the Middle East.[34] This amounted to 700 million sesterces stored at Brundisium, the staging ground in Italy for military operations in the east.[36]
