In middle age, and at his prime as a lecturer, Ruskin was described as slim, perhaps a little short,[156] with an aquiline nose and brilliant, piercing blue eyes. Often sporting a double-breasted waistcoat, a high collar and, when necessary, a frock coat, he also wore his trademark blue neckcloth.[157] From 1878 he cultivated an increasingly long beard, and took on the appearance of an "Old Testament" prophet.
