Lyrically, "Thy Will" is a plea for explanation from God about difficulties facing the narrator.[4] Written by Scott after experiencing a miscarriage in 2015, the song finds her learning to accept her circumstances and move forward knowing that God has a plan.[2] The hook, "thy will be done," was derived from Scott's own prayers around the time of her loss.[3]
