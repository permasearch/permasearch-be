Politically, republicanism is officially supported by the Labor Party and the Greens, and is also supported by some Liberal Party members of the Australian parliament including leader and prime minister Malcolm Turnbull. In a referendum in 1999, Australian voters rejected a proposal to establish a republic with a parliamentary appointed head of state.
