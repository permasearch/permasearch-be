In 1531, King Henry VIII acquired the Hospital of St James (later St James's Palace)[6] from Eton College, and in 1536 he took the Manor of Ebury from Westminster Abbey.[7] These transfers brought the site of Buckingham Palace back into royal hands for the first time since William the Conqueror had given it away almost 500 years earlier.[8]
