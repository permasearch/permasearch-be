The derby was first nationally televised by ESPN in 1993 on a same-day delayed basis,[11] with the first live telecast in 1998. Although two hours are scheduled in programming listings for the telecast, it has rarely ever been contained to the timeslot and consistently runs three to four hours. Chris Berman has gained notoriety for his annual hosting duties on ESPN, including his catchphrase, "Back back backâ€¦Gone!". Berman starts this phrase when the ball is hit, and does not say "Gone!" until the ball lands.
