In Australia, the "Clapham omnibus" expression has inspired the New South Wales and Victorian equivalents, "the man on the Bondi tram" (a now disused tram route in Sydney, New South Wales),[11] and "the man on the Bourke Street tram" (Melbourne, Victoria).[12] In Western Australia, the equivalent is "the man on the Prospector to Kalgoorlie".[citation needed]
