Carragher was one of three players to have a penalty saved by Portugal's Ricardo Pereira, as England yet again succumbed to a penalty shoot-out exit in the quarter-finals. Carragher, who had been brought on as a substitute for Aaron Lennon late in the game, scored with his first attempt but was forced to re-take his penalty by the referee, who had not blown his whistle.
