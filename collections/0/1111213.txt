The Russian conquest of Siberia was accompanied by massacres due to indigenous resistance to colonization by the Russian Cossacks, who savagely crushed the natives. At the hands of people like Vasilii Poyarkov in 1645 and Yerofei Khabarov in 1650 some peoples like the Daur were slaughtered by the Russians to the extent that it is now considered to have been genocide.[52] The Daurs initially deserted their villages since they heard about the cruelty of the Russians the first time Khabarov came.[53] The second time he came, the Daurs decided to do battle against the Russians instead but were slaughtered by Russian guns.[54] The indigenous peoples of the Amur region were attacked by Russians who came to be known as "red-beards".[55] The Russian Cossacks were named luocha (羅剎), after Demons found in Buddhist mythology, by the Amur natives because of their cruelty towards the Amur tribes people, who were subjects of the Qing.[56] The Russian proselytization of Eastern Orthodox Christianity to the indigenous peoples along the Amur River was viewed as a threat by the Qing.[57]
