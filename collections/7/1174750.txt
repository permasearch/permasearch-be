Jack Benny co-star and cartoon voice artist Mel Blanc would sometimes pay homage to Nelson by working "EEE-Yeeeeeeeeesssss" into one of his voice portrayals. Other performers have done the same. For example, in an episode of the sitcom Three's Company ("Doctor In The House", Season 6), Ralph Furley (Don Knotts) consults with a doctor who is actually Jack Tripper (John Ritter) disguised in a surgeon's mask. When Furley calls out to the doctor in his office, Jack responds with Nelson's famous "Y-e-e-e-s?" catchphrase. Jack also responds with "EEE-Yeeeeeeeeesssss" to a caller looking to make a reservation at Jack's new restaurant in the Season 7 episode "Opening Night".[citation needed]
