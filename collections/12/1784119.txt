I am dreaming Dear of you, day by day Dreaming when the skies are blue, When they're gray When the silv'ry moonlight gleams, Still I wander on in dreams In a land of love, it seems, Just with you  Chorus: Let me call you "Sweetheart," I'm in love with you Let me hear you whisper that you love me too Keep the love-light glowing in your eyes so true Let me call you "Sweetheart," I'm in love with you  Longing for you all the while, More and more; Longing for the sunny smile, I adore Birds are singing far and near, Roses blooming ev'rywhere You, alone, my heart can cheer; You, just you  Chorus
