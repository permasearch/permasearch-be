A segment of US 17 between Ridgeland and Point South once contained a four-lane divided section in the vicinity of some 1941-built bridges over the Tullifinny River and its tributary the Harbor River.[8][9] From 1971 to 1975, portions of that segment were relocated onto Interstate 95. The northbound lane was closed, and today is used for a fishing pier, a parking lot of a church, and a private home.
