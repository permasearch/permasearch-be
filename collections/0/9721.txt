Google Glass is a brand of smart glasses – an optical head-mounted display designed in the shape of a pair of eyeglasses. It was developed by X (previously Google X)[9] with the mission of producing a ubiquitous computer.[1] Google Glass displayed information in a smartphone-like, hands-free format.[10] Wearers communicated with the Internet via natural language voice commands.[11][12]
