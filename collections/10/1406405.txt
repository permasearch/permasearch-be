The Dutch have a long history of reclamation of marshes and fenland, resulting in some 3,000 polders[1] nationwide. By 1961 6,800 square miles (18,000Â km2), about half of the country's land, was reclaimed from the sea.[2] About half the total surface area of polders in north-west Europe is in the Netherlands. The first embankments in Europe were constructed in Roman times. The first polders were constructed in the 11th century.
