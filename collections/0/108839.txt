The south coast of Jamaica at Saint Elizabeth Parish has a Lovers' Leap 1,700 feet (520Â m) above the Caribbean Sea. Lovers' Leap is named after two slave lovers from the 18th century, Mizzy and Tunkey. According to legend, their master, Chardley, liked Mizzy; so, in a bid to have her for himself, he arranged for her lover, Tunkey, to be sold to another estate. Mizzy and Tunkey fled to avoid being separated but were eventually chased to the edge of a large steep cliff. Rather than face being caught and separated, the lovers embraced and jumped over the cliff.[9] The story was used as the basis for a romantic novel.[10]
