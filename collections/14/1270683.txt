Stewart continued to write songs and record for Capitol, while touring as a solo act. It was during this time that he composed the hit "Daydream Believer" for The Monkees, which was a hit for Anne Murray as well, and the closest Stewart came to writing a "standard". He later toured with Robert F. Kennedy's ill-fated 1968 presidential campaign and met and married fellow folk singer Buffy Ford (with whom he remained until his death) and began recording a string of albums, including his signature album, California Bloodlines, as well as Willard, Cannons in the Rain, and Wingless Angels [1].
