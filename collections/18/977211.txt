On 1 May 2017, a 2017 Porsche Cayenne S Diesel set the Guinness World Record for heaviest aircraft pulled by a production car. The Cayenne towed a 285 ton Air France Airbus A380 to a distance of 42 meters, breaking the previous 2013 record of a Nissan Patrol towing a 170 ton Ilyushin Il-76 to a distance of 50 meters.[30] After the attempt Porsche repeated the test using a petrol-powered Cayenne Turbo S with 800 Nm of torque, 50 Nm less than the S Diesel, in an effort to prove the Cayenne's remarkable ability.[31]
