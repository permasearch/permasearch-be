The second type of early underextension involves restricting a word to a particular referent instead of a particular situation.  This kind of underextension is not context-bound but contextually flexible, and suggests that children are using words in a genuinely referential way.  Harris mentions examples of this type of underextension from her own research, such as the use of the word clock only to refer to wall clocks and light only to refer to ceiling lights with a shade.
