Bay’s first actual appearance in The Mummy was during the opening battle between an outnumbered team of French Foreign Legionnaires and wild Tuareg bandits, which took place in the ruins of Hamunaptra. He paid close watch on one of the soldiers: an American named Rick O’Connell, as he desperately fought the raging Tuareg. Ardeth was also the narrator for the first parts of the first two films.
