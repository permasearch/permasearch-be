The Martin Center originated in 1996[6] as a project of the John Locke Foundation (also founded by Art Pope), a nonprofit think tank concerned especially with free markets, limited constitutional government, and personal responsibility.[7] In 2003, the then-Pope Center was incorporated as a separate entity.
