The next day, the Oilers fired defensive coordinator Jim Eddy and defensive backs coach Pat Thomas.[6] Eddy was replaced by Buddy Ryan. In Houston, the game has come to be known as "The Choke".[7] "Choke City" was a Houston Chronicle front-page headline in 1994, given to the city of Houston after the Houston Rockets blew two consecutive commanding fourth-quarter leads at The Summit in the first two games of their Western Conference semifinals match-up versus the Phoenix Suns in the 1994 NBA Playoffs. The Rockets went to Phoenix down 0â€“2 in the best-of-seven series. It was feared at the time that the Rockets would follow the same fate as the Oilers did. During this era, no Houston-based professional sports team from an existing sports league (the NFL, NBA, or Major League Baseball) had won a championship. The Rockets, however, would rally to win the series and go on to win NBA championships in 1994 and 1995.
