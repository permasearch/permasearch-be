Triatomic oxygen (ozone, O3), is a very reactive allotrope of oxygen that is destructive to materials like rubber and fabrics and is also damaging to lung tissue.[6] Traces of it can be detected as a sharp, chlorine-like smell,[5] coming from electric motors, laser printers, and photocopiers. It was named "ozone" by Christian Friedrich Schönbein, in 1840, from the Greek word ὠζώ (ozo) for smell.[7]
