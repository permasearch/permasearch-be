The division of labour is the specialization of individual labour roles. It is often associated[by whom?] with increasing output and trade.[9] According to Adam Smith, the division of labor is efficient due to three reasons: occupational specialization, savings from not changing tasks, and machines taking the place of human labor. Occupational specialization leads to increased productivity and distinct skill. Also, Smith argued that human and physical capital must be similar or matched; if the skill of workers were matched with technological improvements, there would be a major increase in productivity.
