The process of boiling peanuts also draws antioxidants from the shells. The boiled peanuts have four times the antioxidants of raw or roasted peanuts.[6] Boiled peanuts have also been studied as a potential way to treat people with peanut allergies since boiling peanuts denatures proteins that trigger allergic reactions. In one study, boiled peanuts were given in increasing amounts to four patients over time. Some, but not all, patients were able to start eating raw peanuts. Use of boiled peanuts as a treatment method is not yet recommended. [7][unreliable medical source?]
