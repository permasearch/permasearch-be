Evidence of the NEO scales' stability in different countries and cultures can be considered evidence of its validity. A great deal of cross-cultural research has been carried out on the Five-Factor Model of Personality. Much of the research has relied on the NEO PI-R and the shorter NEO-FFI. McCrae and Allik (2002)[29] edited a book consisting of papers bearing on cross-cultural research on the FFM. Research from China,[30][31] Estonia, Finland,[32] the Philippines, France,[33] German-speaking countries,[34] India,[35] Portugal,[36] Russia,[37] South Korean,[38] Turkey,[39] Vietnam,[40] and Zimbabwe[41] have shown the FFM to be robust across cultures.
