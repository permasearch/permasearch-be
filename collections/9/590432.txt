Oceanic megafaunas'bio-diversities, such as of marine mammals, sea turtles, and larger fish drastically decreased in modern time not only by pollution but also mainly by direct hunting, most extensively Japanese industrial whaling,[19] illegal mass operations by Soviet with supports from Japan.[20] and fewer species survived to today although being still in serious perils. Those include spotted seals, and cetaceans such as minke whales, killer whales,[21] false killer whales, and finless porpoises, but nonetheless all the remnants of species listed could be in very small numbers. Historically, large whales were very abundant either for summering and wintering in the Yellow and Bohai Seas. For example, a unique population of resident fin whales and gray whales[22] were historically presented,[23] or possibly hosted some North Pacific right whales[24][25] and Humpback whales (3 whales including a cow calf pair was observed at Changhai County in 2015[26][26][27]) year-round other than migrating individuals, and many other migratory species such as Baird's beaked whales.[28] Even blue whales, Japanese sea lions, dugongs (in southern regions only),[29] and leatherback turtles used to breed or migrate into Yellow and Bohai seas.[30]
