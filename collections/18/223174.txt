William "Bill" Boss (Dieter Laser), a psychopathic prison warden, watches the end of The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence) with his accountant, Dwight Butler (Laurence R. Harvey). Bill says that he hates the films as his feet are massaged by his assistant, Daisy (Bree Olson). Daisy replies that she enjoyed them. In response, Bill sucks his finger and inserts it into Daisy's vagina, telling her that women should not be allowed to voice their opinions. Dwight interrupts, attempting to pitch a "brilliant idea" to fix the prison's horrible retention and violence rates, but he is interrupted by a phone call.
