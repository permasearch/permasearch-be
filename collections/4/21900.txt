A Gamow-Teller transition is a beta decay in which the spins of the emitted electron (positron) and anti-neutrino (neutrino) couple to total spin     S = 1   {\displaystyle S=1}  , leading to an angular momentum change     Δ J = 0 , ± 1   {\displaystyle \Delta J=0,\pm 1}   between the initial and final states of the nucleus (assuming an allowed transition). In this case, the nuclear part of the operator is given by
