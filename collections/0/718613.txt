Aviation historian Charles Harvard Gibbs-Smith stated a number of times[119][120] that the Wrights' legal victory would have been "doubtful" if an 1868 patent of "a prior but lost invention" by Matthew Piers Watt Boulton of the UK had been known in the period 1903–1906.[112][121][122] The patent, titled Aërial Locomotion &c, described several engine improvements and conceptual designs and included a technical description and drawings of an aileron control system and an optional feature intended to function as an autopilot.[123][124] In fact, this patent was well-known to participants in the Wright-Curtiss lawsuit. A U.S. federal judge who reviewed previous inventions and patents and upheld the Wright patent against the Curtiss company reached the opposite conclusion of Gibbs-Smith, saying the Boulton patent "is not anticipatory".[125]
