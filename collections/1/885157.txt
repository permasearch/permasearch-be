M appeared in every James Bond comic book released from 1962 to 1995. With the relaunch of the series in 2015 by Dynamite Entertainment, M is once again Bond's superior. In a notable departure from both the original novels and the movies, M is black instead of white,[60] and his identity is revealed to be none other than Miles Messervy when he was referred to by his first name in Hammerhead.[61] M is scheduled to have his own one-shot comic book in which his backstory is explored while dealing with his past that comes back to haunt him, delivered by creators Declan Shalvey and P.J. Holden.[62]
