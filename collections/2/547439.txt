eFileTexas.gov is the official electronic court filing (e-filing) system.[17] Each county maintains (or does not maintain) their own docket management and retrieval systems,[18] similar to PACER for the federal government. There is no longer an officially published reporter. West's Texas Cases (a Texas-specific version of the South Western Reporter) includes reported opinions of the Supreme Court, the Court of Criminal Appeals, and the Courts of Appeals.[19][20] The Texas Reports includes Supreme Court opinions until July 1962, and the Texas Criminal Reports includes Court of Criminal Appeals opinions until November 1962.[20] There is no systematic reporting of decisions of trial courts.[19] Court opinions can generally be freely accessed on the web from the various courts' websites, with appellate opinions generally being available from 1997â€“2002 onwards.[21]
