Note that anyone involved with a rookie candidate (such as a teammate or car owner) may not serve on that year's panel and will be replaced by another person in that category. In case of an ineligible Series Champion, it is the next preceding year's Series Champion. In 2002, 2000 champion Bobby Labonte served on the Cup rookie panel as NASCAR disqualified 2001 champion Jeff Gordon from the position because of his equity ownership in candidate Jimmie Johnson's No. 48 car.
