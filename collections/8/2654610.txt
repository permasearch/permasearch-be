The song has been covered by many artists, including Jamaican singer Tinga Stewart (1977), Mike Anthony (1982), Sade (1984, on her debut album Diamond Life), Joan Osborne, Steve Winwood (2003) and Maria Muldaur (2009). MC Hammer re-interpreted the song on his 1991 album Too Legit to Quit.[5] In 1990, a "Stand Up For Love" re-recording of the song was done by Thomas. Mike Anthony, an American DJ/producer based in Belgium at the time, recorded his discofied version of the song in early 1982 but while it had reached the Belgian and Dutch charts, he was sued by the owners of the original Timmy Thomas recording for using elements from the original recording. A judge ordered a re-recording of the song with all the original parts removed. This ruling marked one of the first court cases in which the use of original samples in new recordings played a role, as a precursor to the many court cases in the 1990s and 2000s.
