Avicenna is a Latin corruption of the Arabic patronym Ibn Sīnā (ابن سينا‎),[19] meaning "Son of Sina", a rare Persian masculine given name of uncertain etymology.[citation needed] However, Avicenna was not the son,[20] but the great-great-grandson of a man named Sina. His full name was Abū ʿAlī al-Ḥusayn ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn al-Ḥasan ibn ʿAlī ibn Sīnā[21] (أبو علي الحسين بن عبد الله بن الحسن بن علي بن سينا).
