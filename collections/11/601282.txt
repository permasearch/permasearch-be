Kurosawa (Japanese: 黒澤 明[note 1]) was born on March 23, 1910, in Ōimachi in the Ōmori district of Tokyo. His father Isamu (1864-1948), a member of a former samurai family from Akita Prefecture, worked as the director of the Army's Physical Education Institute's lower secondary school, while his mother Shima (1870-1952) came from a merchant's family living in Osaka.[1] Akira was the eighth and youngest child of the moderately wealthy family, with two of his siblings already grown up at the time of his birth and one deceased, leaving Kurosawa to grow up with three sisters and a brother.[1][2]
