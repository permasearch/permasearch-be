The Watergate scandal was a major political scandal that occurred in the United States during the early 1970s, following a break-in by 4 Cuban Americans and 1 American at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington, D.C. on June 17, 1972. What escalated matters was President Richard Nixonâ€™s administration attempt to cover-up its involvement. After the 5 burglars were caught and the conspiracy was discovered, Watergate was investigated by the U.S. Congress; meanwhile Nixon's administration resisted its probes, which led to a constitutional crisis.[1]
