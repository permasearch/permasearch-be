An amendment to the rules in 2008 gave the undefeated team of the season in the UAAP (the team that won all elimination round games) a bye up to the finals possessing an automatic 1â€“0 lead in a best-of-5 series, or the thrice to beat advantage. This has since been adopted by the NCAA in 2009 and abolished in 2016, when the undefeated team has a final berth, but played in a common best-of-three format
