The ideas were concretized at an early stage during the writing of The Lord of the Rings, beginning with a clearer image of the defeat of Sauron and of the acquisition of the One Ring by "Isildor" son of Elendil,[68] and followed by the slow development of the Númenórean heritage. First to be introduced were their northern descendants—the "Rangers",[69] and the southern people appeared when Tolkien pondered in 1939 over the course of the narrative following the Council of Elrond. As he later recalled, Tolkien thought about "adventures" that the Company would meet on their way to Mordor and considered employing "Stone-Men" as one of them; other preserved notes mention a "city of stone and civilized men", its siege and a "Land of Ond".[14] The name was based upon an already existing stem of Elvish languages, (g)ond with the meaning 'stone'.[12]
