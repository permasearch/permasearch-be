For over 45 years, the Close Up Foundation has dedicated itself to inform, inspire, and empower young people to exercise their rights and accept the responsibilities of citizenship in a democracy. The Close Up Washington experience uses the nation’s capital as a living classroom where students explore the famous monuments, world-renowned museums and institutions that define America’s past and present. By the end of program, students return to their home communities inspired to engage as citizens and to help make the world a better place.
