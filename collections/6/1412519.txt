Piet Levy of Milwaukee Journal Sentinel gave Neon Steeple a positive review, comparing the music to Avicii's "Wake Me Up" saying "Crowder sticks to folktronica, which blends the warm-hearted, rustic feel of folk with a little cinematic, synthesizer atmosphere."[19] In addition, Levy said "If these songs were less explicitly religious, they'd likely do well on mainstream radio."[19] Jesus Freak Hideout gave three reviews of the album, which were done by Ryan Barbee, Scott Fryberger and Mark Rice. Respectively, their ratings were five stars, four-and-a-half stars and four stars out of five. Barbee stated Crowder is back and "better than ever."[4] Fryberger wrote that "Crowder is no stranger to experimentation, and he pulls it off amazingly with Neon Steeple."[14] Rice said that "Neon Steeple brings forth some of the most creative Crowder concepts yet and excecutes [sic] it to a T". He called the release "everything we could have hoped from Crowder's first endeavor apart from his former band."[15] Christian Music Review's April Covington rated Neon Steeple a perfect five stars, writing that she was "amazed" by Crowder's "crazy, awesome style" of music.[10]
