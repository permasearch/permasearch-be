Customers can be very impatient. This is why after a few days of a restaurant, an entertainer is introduced. When an entertainer is sent to a table with customers, this will make them happy and give them more patience while they wait to be served. Happier customers also leave bigger tips. In the first Delicious there are chocolates instead of an entertainer, and in Delicious: Emily's Holiday Season, newspapers are used instead of an entertainer in the Snuggford Hotel. In Delicious: Emily's Honeymoon Cruise and Delicious: Emily's New Beginning, the entertainer has to be bought in the shop. In Delicious: Emily's Home Sweet Home, some entertainers are automatically hired and some have to be bought in the shop. After Delicious: Emily's New Beginning, players are unable to see a red heart showing up next to ecstatic customers.
