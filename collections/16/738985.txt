Although It has been noted that the Catholic Church played a role in the decline of the Irish Language, the church did make certain efforts to encourage the Irish language and find common ground through religion. The Old Testament was translated into Irish and came out around 1685 in order to reach out to the Irish speaking community. Bishop Bedell influenced the print and publishing of the Old Testament. The New Testament was also translated into Irish by an Archbishop of the church. Currently, modern day Irish speakers in the church are pushing for language revival.[15]
