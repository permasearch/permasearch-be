Organized by Fyre Media founder Billy McFarland and rapper Ja Rule as a luxury music festival to promote the Fyre music booking app,[1] the event was promoted on Instagram by "social media influencers" including Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid, Emily Ratajkowski, and other models, many of whom did not initially disclose they had been paid to do so, in violation of federal law.[1] It experienced problems related to security, food, accommodations and artist relations, and was indefinitely postponed after some festival-goers had already arrived, finding tents and prepackaged sandwiches instead of the luxury villas and gourmet meals they had been promised in exchange for the thousands of dollars they had paid for admission.[2]
