The 2009 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Municipal Solid Waste report classified directories as the smallest contributor of paper and paperboard products to the solid waste stream, representing only 0.3% â€“ significantly less than all other paper product categories such as newspapers, magazines and books.[23] In 2010, the EPA stopped measuring directories separately from newspapers, indicating the minor impact of directories on municipal waste.[24]
