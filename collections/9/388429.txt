Less Than Zero was Ellis's first attempt at a proper novel, following much roman à clef juvenilia. Its first draft was, reportedly, incredibly emotional and overwrought, and in the third-person. Ellis's creative writing teacher, novelist Joe McGinniss, advised that he return to the first-person style of roman à clef (which Ellis was hesitant to do) and Ellis stripped it back, from there evoking the minimalist style for which it became famous.[1]
