Fireheart met Princess when she was heavily pregnant in Fire and Ice. When her kittens were born, she let Firestar have her firstborn kit to be raised as a warrior with him to ThunderClan, where Bluestar named him Cloudkit. Firestar does not possess any significant character flaws and is fully committed to the warrior code. Only sometimes will he bend the rules to help his Clan. Firestar is fiercely loyal not only to his Clan, but also to his many friends and allies that he meets along the way, regardless of their affiliation. He respects the rules of his superiors, but also has the insight to look beyond them in order to properly judge a questionable situation. As a result, he often breaks the traditional rules of the Clan (a trend started by his very inclusion into the Clan, being of house cat, or kittypet origins) in order to help his friends or rectify a situation he believes to be right. He is primarily responsible, along with his friend Graystripe, for several feats that have ensured the well-being of all the Clans, such as retrieving WindClan after they were driven out of their camp in Fire and Ice,[8] and hunting prey for RiverClan when they were damaged and forced to move out of their territory in a flood. In A Dangerous Path, he professes his long-time love for Sandstorm, who is revealed to love him back.[9] He struggled with feelings for Spottedleaf, who died in Into the Wild. As a warrior, Fireheart earned Bluestar's disapproval for frequently helping the other Clans.
