WPCH-TV is carried on most Canadian cable, satellite, fiber and IPTV providers, often being carried as part of one of the main specialty channel tiers. The station first became available in Canada in the mid-1980s (as WTBS), when the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) permitted Canadian pay television providers to begin carrying the Atlanta station, and other U.S. superstations, as premium channels packaged with Canadian pay services, such as the services now known as The Movie Network and the now-defunct Movie Central.[75] In late 1997, many service providers moved the station from a pay service to a new third tier of specialty channels.[76]
