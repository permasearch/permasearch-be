In the 1960s, the influx of Cubans fleeing Castro led the area to become a hotbed of counter-revolutionary activity.[8] Arriving residents expected their stay in Miami would be temporary as Castro would be deposed. By 1970, the neighborhood was more than 85 percent Cuban. Rather than return to Havana, where Castro remained in power, Cuban Americans began residing in neighborhoods across Miami. Little Havana, however, remained a landing point for new immigrants and a stronghold for Cuban-owned businesses.
