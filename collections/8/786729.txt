Handy had mixed feelings about this music, which he regarded as rather primitive and monotonous,[16] but he used the "Southern cross' the Dog" line in his 1914 "Yellow Dog Rag", which he retitled "Yellow Dog Blues" after the term blues became popular.[17] "Yellow Dog" was the nickname of the Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad.
