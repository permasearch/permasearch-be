United States policy concerning the ICC has varied widely.  The Clinton Administration signed the Rome Statute in 2000, but did not submit it for Senate ratification. The George W. Bush Administration, the U.S. administration at the time of the ICC's founding, stated that it would not join the ICC.  The Obama Administration subsequently re-established a working relationship with the Court as an observer.[4]
