In 2005, the Hershey Company introduced a line of cajeta-flavored confections styled "Cajeta Elegancita", targeted at Mexican-food aficionados living in the United States. The marketing decision made headlines when it was discovered the word is a risqué term for the vulva in Argentinian and Uruguayan parlance.[1] That same year, Nestlé released a "cajeta"-flavored Nesquik in Mexico.
