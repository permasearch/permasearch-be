Outside of Nate's apartment, Nate tells Dan (Penn Badgley) about his parents' divorce and their conversation is interrupted by Rufus (Matthew Settle) calling Dan about Serena, who has been hospitalized because of a potentially fatal overdose. Back in Hudson, Jenny receives news from Rufus about Serena's overdose and consequently drives Jenny's guilt, not realizing that Juliet had gone too far in her plans of destroying Serena, and Jenny sets off for New York. Vanessa, unaware that Serena is hospitalized, finds herself alone when she arrives at the van der Woodsen apartment and receives a text from Jenny implying that their plan to ruin had gone too far.
