Blue Bell introduced its flagship flavor, Homemade Vanilla, in 1969[3] and was the first company to mass-produce the flavor Cookies 'n Cream.[22] Although the company at one time made Cookies 'n Cream from Nabisco's Oreo cookies, buying ordinary retail packages, today it bakes its own cookies.[12] As of 1997, Blue Bell Homemade Vanilla was the best-selling single flavor of ice cream in the United States,[6] and in 2001, Forbes named Blue Bell the best ice cream in the country.[23]
