The series is filmed on the French island of Guadeloupe in the Lesser Antilles, mainly in the commune of Deshaies (which doubles for the town of Honoré on the fictional island of Saint Marie), with the help of the Bureau d’accueil des tournages de la Région Guadeloupe.[18] The site of the Honoré police station is a church hall in Deshaies with the priest's office appearing as the incident room.[19]
