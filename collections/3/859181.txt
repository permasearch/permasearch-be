In addition to the main show, a 9-part companion program, titled The Jury Villa, was released online through tenplay. The web series follows the last nine castaways to be voted off and become members of the Tribal Council Jury, where they interact with one another and discuss the game in the titular villa. Episodes began airing after episode 17 and were uploaded following the airing of subsequent episodes.[20][21]
