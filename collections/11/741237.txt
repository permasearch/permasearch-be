Pi is a fundamental constant of nature. Archimedes discovered that the area of the circle equals the square of its radius times pi. Archimedes was the first to accurately calculate pi by using polygons with 96 sides both inside and outside a circle then measuring the line segments and finding that pi was between        223 71      {\displaystyle {\tfrac {223}{71}}}   and        22 7      {\displaystyle {\tfrac {22}{7}}}  . A Chinese calculation used polygons with 3,000 sides and calculated pi accurately to five decimal places. The Chinese also found that        355 113      {\displaystyle {\tfrac {355}{113}}}   was an accurate estimate of pi to within 6 decimal places and was the most accurate estimate for 1,000 years until arabic numerals were used for arithmetic.
