The Tiger Paw logo was introduced at a press conference on July 21, 1970. It was created by John Antonio and developed by Helen Weaver of Henderson Advertising in Greenville, South Carolina, from a mold of a Bengal tiger sent to the agency by the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago.[2][3] The telltale hook at the bottom of the paw is a sign that this is the official licensed trademark for the university.[4]
