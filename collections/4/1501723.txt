The zero lower bound problem refers to a situation in which the short-term nominal interest rate is zero, or just above zero, causing a liquidity trap and limiting the capacity that the central bank has to stimulate economic growth. This problem returned to prominence with the Japan's experience during the 90's, and more recently with the subprime crisis. The belief that monetary policy under the ZLB was effective in promoting economy growth has been critiqued by economists Paul Krugman, Gauti Eggertsson, and Michael Woodford among others. Milton Friedman, on the other hand, argued that a zero nominal interest rate presents no problem for monetary policy. According to Friedman, a central bank can increase the monetary base even if the interest rate vanishes; it only needs to continue buying bonds.[4] (Note: The quote from footnote #3 may be misleading. Friedman was talking about Japan in 1989, when Japan's very tight monetary policy produced deflation which resulted in a zero interest rate. Friedman wasn't exactly advocating the "quantitative easing" that's been the Fed's strategy from 2008 to 2014. (7/30/2014))
