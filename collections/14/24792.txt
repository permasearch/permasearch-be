Disgusted with Kilmer and not feeling a strong need to win, Mox starts calling his own plays on the field without Kilmer's approval and takes his group of friends and teammates, including Lance, out to a strip club on the night before a game, which they subsequently lose due to poor play from still being hungover. He also chides his father, Sam, screaming at him, "I don't want your life!" Sam had been a football player at West Canaan under Kilmer and although Kilmer dismissed him as having no talent nor courage, he still respected and obeyed him. When Kilmer becomes aware that Mox has earned a full academic scholarship to Brown, he threatens him that if he continues to disobey and disrespect him, he will alter his transcripts in order to reverse the decision on his scholarship.
