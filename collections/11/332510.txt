Before the series premiere, a group of students from Howard University College of Medicine created a Change.org petition to prevent the series from airing. The petition stated that the series "heavily associates Black females in medicine with materialism, cat fights, and unprofessionalism".[101] It goes on to detail the rising difficulty in obtaining residency positions as African American women and how the series' representation of those physicians would only make the task tougher.[102][103][104]
