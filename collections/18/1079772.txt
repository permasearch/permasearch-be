Of the 300 original members of the CAMCO personnel, 9 were Chinese-Americans recruited from America's Chinatowns.  All 9 were trained at Allison Engineworks in Indianapolis, Indiana: all were P-40 mechanics.  Upon arrival in Kunming, 2 other Chinese-Americans were hired, a Ford Motor truck specialist and a doctor.  Total original Chinese-Americans were 11.  Prior to July 4, 1942, 3 of the P-40 mechanics resigned.  The official AVG roster lists the original 8.[citation needed]
