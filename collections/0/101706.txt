Ibuprofen was derived from propionic acid by the research arm of Boots Group during the 1960s.[47] Its discovery was the result of research during the 1950s and 1960s to find a safer alternative to aspirin.[7][48] It was discovered by a team led by Stewart Adams and the patent application was filed in 1961.[7] Adams initially tested the drug as treatment for his hangover.[49] The drug was launched as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis in the United Kingdom in 1969, and in the United States in 1974. Later, in 1983 and 1984, it became the first NSAID (other than aspirin) to be available over the counter (OTC) in these two countries.[7][48] Dr. Adams was subsequently awarded an OBE in 1987. Boots was awarded the Queen's Award for Technical Achievement for the development of the drug in 1987.[7]
