In Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, Gordon Gekko is released from jail, revealing that sometime after the film, he was arrested for insider trading and securities fraud. Poor, and no longer respected in the corporate world, he becomes an author and lecturer. He promoted his book, Is Greed Good?, contradicting what he said in 1985, possibly having a change of heart when he was arrested. His daughter Winnie blames him for her problems in life, including the suicide of her brother Rudy (who appeared in Wall Street as a toddler) and the divorce of him and his wife Kate. Winnie's fiancÃ©, Jake, sees Gordon as a father figure, albeit still unscrupulous. During the film, Gordon regains most of his fortune when he takes Winnie's $100 million and founds a financial services company in London (his company from the first film, Gekko & Co., got shut down and bankrupted when he was arrested). However, when he predicted the financial crisis of 2008, he traded smartly and became a billionaire. Seeing no more reason to be evil, he deposits the $100 million into the fusion research account and asks to be forgiven by Winnie. A year later, Gekko attends his grandson's first birthday party, having finally been accepted by Winnie and Jake as a father and grandparent.
