Johan Wippsson of Melodic gave a more critical review, writing that "Fall Out Boy is not the band that will save rock and roll". He added that "like many other bands, they have added some more electronic elements, which makes Save Rock and Roll a bit too well produced and non-organic."[48] Andy Baber of musicOMH called the album both the group's "softest" and the group's "least memorable."[49] At The Oakland Press, Gary Graff found that the "11-song set has more in common with Rihanna than the Ramones, which will undoubtedly polarize those faithful".[50]
