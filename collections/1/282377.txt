The Force Awakens, the first film in the sequel trilogy, takes place approximately 30 years after the events of Return of the Jedi. It includes new characters, as well as characters from the original trilogy, in search of Luke Skywalker with the help of Han Solo, and Princess Leia along with Chewbacca, C-3PO, and R2-D2.[45][46] The Force Awakens, like the subsequent two films, is based on an original screenplay and not a storyline from the expanded universe.[47]
