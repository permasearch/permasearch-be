A mycorrhiza is the symbiotic association between a green plant and a fungus. The plant captures the energy coming from the sun by means of its chlorophyll and supplies it to the fungus, and the fungus supplies water and mineral nutrients taken from the soil to the plant. Mycorrhizas are located in the roots of the plant. Most plant species form mycorrhizal associations, though some families like Brassicaceae and Chenopodiaceae cannot. There is fossil evidence that early land plants formed arbuscular mycorrhizal associations.[3] Different forms for the association are detailed in the next section. The most common is the arbuscular type that is present in 70% of plant species, including many crop plants such as wheat and rice.[4]
