In the third season, Earl is in the state prison, but continues to do good deeds despite not having his list. He meets Frank, with whom he had rented the trailer in which Joy and Darnell now live, while Randy gets a job as a prison guard to be close to Earl. Meanwhile, Joy gives birth to Liberty and Ray Ray's child. Earl's good deeds attract the attention of the state warden Jerry, who offers Earl a reduction in prison time for helping him resolve his issues. When Earl is about to leave, Jerry revokes Earl's reductions as he would lose such a productive helper, but Earl eventually gains the upper hand and forces Jerry to honor his early release. After leaving prison, Earl loses his confidence in the list; he has spent years and the last of his lottery winnings doing good things, but has nothing lasting to show for it, and is insistent that karma should have given him some kind of lasting reward by now. He reverts to his pre-list ways, doing cruel and illegal things until Frank's former girlfriend Billie Cunningham hits him with her car and sends him into a coma, and is subsequently hit herself. Randy is able to revive Earl by working on the list. Earl finds Billie and marries her, thinking she is karma's reward for his years of effort. When Earl and Billie argue over the list, and when Earl chooses the list over her, Billie goes into a rampage where she undoes his good deeds. However, when Billie hides in the Amish-like "Camdenite" settlement, she has a change of heart. She divorces Earl and gives him the rest of her insurance settlement money.
