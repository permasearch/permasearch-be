Although Utica's population is predominantly European American, it has diversified since the 1990s. New immigrants and refugees have included Bosnians (displaced by the Bosnian War), Russians, Burmese, Vietnamese, and Latinos.[107] More than 15 languages are spoken in the city.[108] Utica has a low cost of living but its industrial and economic decline have posed difficulties for people trying to make a new start.[109]
