As in the first world war, Sweden remained officially neutral during World War II, although its neutrality during World War II has been disputed.[58][59] Sweden was under German influence for much of the war, as ties to the rest of the world were cut off through blockades.[58] The Swedish government felt that it was in no position to openly contest Germany,[60] and therefore made some concessions.[61] Sweden also supplied steel and machined parts to Germany throughout the war. However, Sweden supported Norwegian resistance, and in 1943 helped rescue Danish Jews from deportation to Nazi concentration camps. The Swedish government also unofficially supported Finland in the Winter War and the Continuation War by allowing volunteers and materiel to be shipped to Finland.
