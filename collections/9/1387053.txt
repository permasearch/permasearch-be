In addition to full High Court justices, other qualified persons such as retired judges, Circuit Judges from the county courts, and barristers are appointed to sit as Deputy Judges of the High Court to hear particular cases, and while sitting are addressed as though they were full High Court Judges. Many trials in London are conducted by judges known (whether male or female) as "Masters of the High Court" who have almost identical national trial jurisdiction as full High Court Judges but who do not hear committals to prison, criminal cases, or judicial review and do not travel 'on circuit' to outlying courts.
