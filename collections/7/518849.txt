Phosphor bronze is used for ships' propellers, musical instruments, and electrical contacts.[24] Bearings are often made of bronze for its friction properties.  It can be filled with oil to make the proprietary Oilite and similar material for bearings. Aluminium bronze is very hard and wear-resistant, and is used for bearings and machine tool ways.[25]
