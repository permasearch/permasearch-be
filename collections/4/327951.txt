In 1914, Brazil belonged to regional group called the ABC nations (which also included Argentina and Chile). These three nations made up the richest and most influential nations in South America at the time. That year, the ABC nations intervened in a diplomatic dispute between the United States and Mexico who were on verge of war over the Tampico Affair and the subsequent occupation of Veracruz by US forces. The ABC nations meet with representatives of the United States and Mexico in Niagara Falls, Canada to ease the tension between the two nations and to avoid war, which afterwards did not occur. Between 1910 - 1920, diplomatic relations between both nations were severed during the Mexican revolution. Diplomatic relations were re-reestablished in 1920 when Brazil recognized the new Mexican government.[3] In 1922, diplomatic missions in each other's capitals were upgraded to embassies, respectively.[3]
