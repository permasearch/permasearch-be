On 13 February 2006, Britain's Channel 4 broadcast a documentary as part of its Dispatches series, "Ryanair caught napping". The documentary criticised Ryanair's training policies, security procedures and aircraft hygiene, and highlighted poor staff morale. Ryanair denied the allegations[28] and claimed that promotional materials, in particular a photograph of a stewardess sleeping, had been faked by Dispatches.[29]
