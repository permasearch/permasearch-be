In 2008 it was announced that Molloy would replace Peter Helliar on the panel of Channel 10's Before the Game, an AFL themed show, after Helliar had discontinued his position post-2007.  On the show, his views as a keen supporter of the Richmond Football Club (Tigers) were often made clear. Molloy is one of the club's more prominent supporters and as well as appearing on the Before the Game, he has in the past appeared in a club membership advertising campaigns.  In June 2008, Molloy made comments on the show regarding Nicole Cornes, the wife of former Adelaide coach Graham Cornes, in which he suggested she had slept with footballer Stuart Dew. Nicole Cornes sued the Ten Network for defamation, and was awarded A$85,000 in July 2011.[6] Molloy remained with Before the Game until it was axed at the end of the 2013 AFL season.[7]
