Accessibility to healthcare is very important in preventing and treating HIV/AIDs. It can be affected by health insurance which is available to people through private insurers, Medicare and Medicaid which leaves some people still vulnerable.[22] Historically, African Americans have faced discrimination when it comes to receiving healthcare. During the time of slavery, slave owners would get medical attention for slaves because they were deemed as property, while slaves that the slave owners believed were not able to recover were sent to be experimented on. In the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century, universities dug up African American bodies to autopsy, and some night doctors would snatch people off the streets to examine. African Americans have been experimented on and exploited for centuries. The Tuskegee Syphilis study experimented vulnerable men in the South who had syphilis. They kept treatment from these men to see what would happen. Henrietta Lacks was also exploited when researchers took her cancerous cells and grew them to experiment on them.[23]
