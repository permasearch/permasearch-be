The 1976 World Snooker Championship was held at two venues; half the draw was held in Middlesbrough and half in Manchester, which also hosted the final. Alex Higgins won three close matches to reach the final, where he met Ray Reardon. Reardon led 24–15 at the start of the last day and, winning 3 of the first 4 frames, took the title 27–16, his fourth successive title.[90] There were a number of problems during the tournament including the standard of the tables.[91] This was the first year the championship was sponsored under the cigarette brand Embassy.
