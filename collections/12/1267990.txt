Otis is the boyfriend of Patricia and a neighbor of Hershel Greene. He accidentally shoots and almost kills Carl while out hunting for a deer. Otis remains at the farm while the Greenes leave to join Rick at the prison. Otis later follows, and is saved from zombies by the newly arrived Michonne. He rejoins the group (though ends his relationship with Patricia after learning of her part in Dexter's attempted coup). Later, when the prison is temporarily overrun by zombies, Otis is attacked by zombies and killed. When Rick and his group return from Woodbury, Otis has turned into a walker. Rick shoots him in the head.
