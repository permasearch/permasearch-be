However, the term has different definitions in different contexts. For example, it could refer to the money that a company gets from potential investors, in addition to the stated (nominal or par) value of the stock, which coincides with the definition of additional paid-in capital, or paid-in capital in excess of par. One should be aware of the use of the term and the abbreviation, which can confuse.
