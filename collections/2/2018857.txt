Manual external defibrillators require the expertise of a healthcare professional.[10][11] They are used in conjunction with an electrocardiogram, which can be separate or built-in. A healthcare provider first diagnose the cardiac rhythm and then manually determine the voltage and timing for the electrical shock. These units are primarily found in hospitals and on some ambulances.  For instance, every NHS ambulance in the United Kingdom is equipped with a manual defibrillator for use by the attending paramedics and technicians.[citation needed] In the United States, many advanced EMTs and all paramedics are trained to recognize lethal arrhythmias and deliver appropriate electrical therapy with a manual defibrillator when appropriate.[citation needed]
