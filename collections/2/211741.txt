Co-operatives were brought to Latin America and developed there by 1902.[55] Substantially independent efforts to develop employee-owned enterprises or co-operatives have occurred as responses to crises, such as the systemic IMF-based default in Argentina in 2001[56] In Brazil, the World Social Forum process lead to the articulation of Solidarity Economics, a modern, activist formulation of co-operativism, with the MST landless worker's movement demonstrating enormous courage and social entrepreneurship.[57][58] In Venezuela, the late Hugo ChÃ¡vez's administration began to incentivize co-operatives, resulting in their rapid and extensive development there.[59][60]
