Mrs. Call has a heart condition that acts up, requiring her to get surgery in Los Angeles, so Tammy tags along. Since there are no guest quarters in the hospital, Tammy gets a job there as a nurse's assistant. Peter Fonda plays Tammy's love interest, Dr. Mark Cheswick, and Adam West has a small part as Dr. Eric Hassler. This is the final entry in the canonic film series, and Sandra Dee's last appearance as Tammy.
