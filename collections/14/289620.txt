On 3 March 1924, the first President of the Turkish Republic, Mustafa Kemal Atat端rk, as part of Atat端rk's Reforms, constitutionally abolished the institution of the caliphate.[13] Its powers within Turkey were transferred to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, the parliament of the newly formed Turkish Republic. The title was then claimed by Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca of Hejaz, leader of the Arab Revolt, but his kingdom was defeated and annexed by ibn Saud in 1925.
