Visayan coffins called longon were made out of hardwood made out of a single tree trunk, which was fitted and pegged with a lid cut out of the same tree and sealed with resin.[20] Persons of prominence and datus could be buried in a coffin with decorative carvings, and the carvings often executed by the future occupant himself.[20] Poor Visayans were buried wrapped in banana leaves or simple caskets made out of thin boards or bamboo.[21]
