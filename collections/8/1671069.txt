The staff of MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) was built around the nucleus that had escaped from the Philippines with him, who became known as the "Bataan Gang".[173] Though Roosevelt and George Marshall pressed for Dutch and Australian officers to be assigned to GHQ, the heads of all the staff divisions were American and such officers of other nationalities as were assigned served under them.[164] Initially located in Melbourne,[174] GHQ moved to Brisbane—the northernmost city in Australia with the necessary communications facilities—in July 1942,[175] occupying the Australian Mutual Provident Society building (renamed after the war as MacArthur Chambers).[176]
