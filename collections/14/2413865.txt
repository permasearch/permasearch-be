Cocaine is a powerful nervous system stimulant.[22] Its effects can last from 15 or 30 minutes to an hour. The duration of cocaine's effects depends on the amount taken and the route of administration.[23] Cocaine can be in the form of fine white powder, bitter to the taste. When inhaled or injected, it causes a numbing effect. Crack cocaine is a smokeable form of cocaine made into small "rocks" by processing cocaine with sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and water.[24][9] Crack cocaine is referred to as "crack" because of the crackling sounds it makes when heated.[9]
