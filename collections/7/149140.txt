The post-production department began work during filming and continued until weeks before the film was released in 2005. Special effects were created using almost all formats, including model work, CGI and practical effects. The same department later composited all such work into the filmed scenesâ€”both processes taking nearly two years to complete. Revenge of the Sith has 2,151 shots that use special effects, a world record.[35]
