Brewers Retail Inc. (doing business as The Beer Store), is a Canadian privately owned chain of retail outlets selling beer and other malt beverages in the province of Ontario, Canada, founded in 1927. Owned at its inception by a consortium of Ontario-based brewers, it currently operates as a unique open retail and wholesale system jointly owned by 30 Ontario-based brewers.[2] Under this ownership model, all qualified brewers are free to list their products without discrimination and set their own selling prices.[3] These prices are subject only to basic LCBO price approval which must comply with legislated minimum and uniform pricing requirements.[4]
