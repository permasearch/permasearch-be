During his years co-writing with Bennett Salvay, Frederick occasionally received work with other TV producers. In 1986, he and Salvay wrote the theme song to the short-lived CBS sitcom Better Days, a Lorimar series from producers Jeff Freilich, Stuart Sheslow and Arthur Silver. The Better Days title track has the distinction of being the first TV theme written by the two that Frederick performed vocals on (predating his performance of "Everywhere You Look" on Full House). Later, they wrote a more saccharine-tinged theme for the just-as-short-lived spring 1988 ABC comedy Family Man (no relation to the similarly titled Miller-Boyett series of two years later), which Frederick also performed.
