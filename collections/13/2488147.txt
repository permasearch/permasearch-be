The film was a critical success, holding a 92% "Fresh" rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes.[21] Some critics pointed to The Bear's adult handling of the wildlife film genre, which is often dismissed as belonging solely to children's films.[22] While positively reviewing the film, critic Roger Ebert wrote that The Bear "is not a cute fantasy in which bears ride tricycles and play house. It is about life in the wild, and it does an impressive job of seeming to show wild bears in their natural habitat" and that scenes from the film, especially those "of horseplay and genuine struggles â€“ gradually build up our sense of the personalities of these animals".[23]
