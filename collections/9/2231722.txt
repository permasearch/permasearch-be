At the age of sixteen, Khan was involved in the experimental process of making a 40-minute silent film, Paranoia, which was directed by his school friend Aditya Bhattacharya.[30] The film was funded by the filmmaker Shriram Lagoo, an acquaintance of Bhattacharya, who provided them with a few thousand rupees.[31] Khan's parents did not want him to make films, wishing that he would instead pursue a "steady" career as an engineer or doctor.[30] For that reason, the shooting schedule of Paranoia was a clandestine one.[32] In the film, he played the lead role alongside actors Neena Gupta and Victor Banerjee, while simultaneously assisting Bhattacharya.[31] He said that the experience of working on it encouraged him to pursue a career in film.[33]
