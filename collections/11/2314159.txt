The Six Nations is an annual competition involving the European teams England, France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales.[152] Each country plays the other five once. After the initial internationals between England and Scotland, Ireland and Wales began competing in the 1880s, forming the Home International Championships.[152] France joined the tournament in the 1900s and in 1910 the term Five Nations first appeared.[152] However, the Home Nations (England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales) excluded France in 1931 amid a run of poor results, allegations of professionalism and concerns over on-field violence.[153] France then rejoined in 1939â€“1940, though World War II halted proceedings for a further eight years.[152] France has played in all the tournaments since WWII, the first of which was played in 1947.[152] In 2000, Italy became the sixth nation in the contest and Rome's Stadio Olimpico has replaced Stadio Flaminio, as the venue for their home games since 2013.[154] The current Six Nations champions are England.
