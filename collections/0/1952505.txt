Irish scholars had a considerable presence in the Frankish court, where they were renowned for their learning.[6] Among them was Johannes Scotus Eriugena, one of the founders of scholasticism.[7] Eriugena was the most significant Irish intellectual of the early monastic period, and an outstanding philosopher in terms of originality.[6] He had considerable familiarity with the Greek language, and translated many works into Latin, affording access to the Cappadocian Fathers and the Greek theological tradition.[6]
