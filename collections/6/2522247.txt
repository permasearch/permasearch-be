In Australia belt rankings for Seniors are, in ascending order: white, yellow, orange, green, blue, brown and finally black. Belt rankings for Juniors follow the same ranks and colours (up to and including brown), but have either 1, 2 or 3 white bars (depending upon age) at each end of the belt, as follows: If the judoka is aged up to 10 (Mon), there are to be 3 white bars. Between 10 and 13 (Yonen), there are 2 bars. Finally, for 13 to 16 years of age (Shonen), there is a single bar.[9]
