The film was made as a co-production between DreamWorks Animation and Oriental DreamWorks, a Shanghai-based studio, founded in 2012 as a partnership between DreamWorks Animation and Chinese companies. One third of the film was made in China, and the rest in the United States, at DWA.[19][20] This was the first time that any major American animated feature film had been co-produced with a Chinese firm.[21] The filmmakers worked closely with SAPPRFT to ensure the film's release in China.[22] The film's co-production status in China allowed the production companies to circumvent the country's strict import quota and take a greater share of box-office revenue than imported films.[20][23] To ensure the film's success in China, in addition to the English version, the Chinese version of the film was also fully animated, making them the only versions that will have the characters' lips synchronized with their voices.[4]
