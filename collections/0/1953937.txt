In reality, this model is not so simplistic; there is multiple redundancy in the active folklore process. The performer has heard the tale multiple times, he has heard it from different story tellers in multiple versions. In turn, he tells the tale multiple times to the same or a different audience, and they expect to hear the version they know. This expanded model of redundancy in a non-linear narrative process makes it difficult to innovate during any single performance; corrective feedback from the audience will be immediate.[53] "At the heart of both autopoetic self-maintenance and the 'virality' of meme transmission… it is enough to assume that some sort of recursive action maintains a degree of integrity [of the artifact] in certain features … sufficient to allow us to recognize it as an instance of its type."[54]
