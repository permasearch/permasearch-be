Although the two states had agreed to build the Weehawken–Manhattan tunnel, there were disagreements on who would fund and construct the tunnels.[15]:58[40] The Port Authority and the two states' tunnel commissions both wanted to build the tunnel, but the Port Authority believed the tunnel would cost $95.5 million while the two states' tunnel commissions thought the tunnel would only be $66.9 million. Ole Singstad, chief engineer for both states' tunnel commissions, believed the distance between the two existing Hudson River vehicular crossings, the Holland Tunnel and George Washington Bridge, was large enough that the Weehawken–Manhattan tunnel would carry 10 million vehicles in its first year. By contrast, the Port Authority believed that the tunnel would only carry 7 million vehicles in its first year.[15]:59[41] Another funding issue arose after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, which caused several potential funding sources to be depleted.[15]:58
