Fe3O4 is used as a catalyst in the Haber process and in the water gas shift reaction.[19] The latter uses an HTS (high temperature shift catalyst) of iron oxide stabilised by chromium oxide.[19] This iron-chrome catalyst is reduced at reactor start up to generate Fe3O4 from Î±-Fe2O3 and Cr2O3 to CrO3.[19]
