In 2008, work on the third film in The Cheetah Girls franchise, titled The Cheetah Girls: One World was in works. According to Disney, the plot would involve the Cheetah Girls going to India to star in a Bollywood production.[30] Like The Cheetah Girls 2, it was filmed on location in a foreign country. In an interview, Bailon stated the movie would film for a three-month period, in India, and that she had been doing research for the film.[31] She also stated that "all of the original cast will be back".[31] However, Raven-Symon√© later confirmed that she would not return for this film, as she was busy with her fourth studio album and filming movies such as College Road Trip.[32] The movie premiered to over 6.2 million viewers, and reached 7 million viewers in its final half-hour. This still failed to meet the ratings of the first two and was the series' lowest-rated premiere.[33] In the UK, its premiere night scored 412,000 on Disney Channel UK, making it #1 of the week, and received 182,000 on Disney Channel UK +1, also #1 on that channel for the week, totalling 594,000.[34] Bailon recorded two solo songs for the films soundtrack album, "What If" and "Stand Up".[35]
