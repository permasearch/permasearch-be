During the Tiananmen Square protest of 1989, Chinese student demonstrators in Beijing built a 10 m (33 ft) image called the Goddess of Democracy, which sculptor Tsao Tsing-yuan said was intentionally "dissimilar" to the Statue of Liberty to avoid being "too openly pro-American." (See article for a list of replicas of that statue.)
