Stock ducks would be chosen from ducklings hatched in March, with a typical breeder keeping six males and twenty laying females at any given time.[13] The females would be kept for around a year before mating, typically to an older male. They would then generally be replaced, to reduce the problems of inbreeding.[14] Stock ducks were allowed to roam freely during the day, and would swim in local ponds which, although privately owned, were treated as common property among the duck breeders;[13] breeders would label their ducks with markings on the neck or head.[14] The stock ducks would forage for greenery and insects, supplemented by greaves (the residue left after the rendering of animal fat).[14] As ducks lay their eggs at night, the ducks would be brought indoors overnight.[14]
