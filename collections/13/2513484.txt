The Liberal Republican Party of the United States was an American political party that was organized in May 1872 to oppose the reelection of President Ulysses S. Grant and his Radical Republican supporters in the presidential election of 1872. The party emerged in Missouri under the leadership of Senator Carl Schurz, and soon attracted other opponents of Grant. The party opposed Grant's Reconstruction policies and sought civil service reform, but was unsuccessful in its efforts to deny Grant re-election and disappeared after the 1872 election.
