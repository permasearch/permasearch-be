George is often annoyed by his stories about Cuba and his expressions, earning comical, sarcastic remarks. Originally, Vic strongly disapproved of Angie marrying George (In "A Kiss is Just a Kiss," it was revealed that as he walked Angie down the aisle on her wedding day he told her to leave George), even saying "when you make waffles, you always toss out the first one"; he later said he tailored his message to the moment as he told his other daughter "don't let this one go". He eventually accepts George as a good match for his daughter, as his son and other daughter's marriages ended in failure while Angie is still married. His wife, Angie's mother, Emilina, cheated on him by having a pro-longed affair and they divorced early in season 3. (Vic says he learned of it as, "Last week I went to her dermatology clinic to surprise her. And I walked in on her checking a man for moles in a place where sun damage is not a possibility!").
