Doubling the cube is the construction, using only a straight-edge and compass, of the edge of a cube that has twice the volume of a cube with a given edge. This is impossible because the cube root of 2, though algebraic, cannot be computed from integers by addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and taking square roots.  This follows because its minimal polynomial over the rationals has degreeÂ 3. This construction is possible using a straightedge with two marks on it and a compass.
