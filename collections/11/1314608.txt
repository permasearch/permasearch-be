Tourism is the most significant industry in central Florence. From April to October, tourists outnumber local population. Tickets to the Uffizi and Accademia museums are regularly sold out and large groups regularly fill the basilicas of Santa Croce and Santa Maria Novella, both of which charge for entry. Tickets for The Uffizi and Accademia can be purchased online prior to visiting.[43] In 2010, readers of Travel + Leisure magazine ranked the city as their third favourite tourist destination.[44] In 2015, CondÃ© Nast Travel readers voted Florence as the best city in Europe.[45]
