In 2016, the Green Party came close to gaining statewide ballot access, closer than the other six new parties, but still fell short of getting the required amount of signatures.[16] The party, in collaboration with the Stein/Baraka presidential campaign, helped garner more write-in votes for Jill Stein than any presidential write-in candidate has ever received in North Carolina.[17] After a change to state law, the Green Party gained official standing and ballot access in 2018.[18] Shortly thereafter, the Constitution Party also collected enough signatures to qualify, pending official action by the State Board of Elections.[19]
