Pakistan as late as early 2017 faced energy shortfalls of over 4,500MW on a regular basis[18] with routine power cuts of up to 12 hours per day,[19] which has shed an estimated 2â€“2.5% off its annual GDP.[19] The Financial Times noted that Pakistan's electricity shortages are a major hindrance to foreign investment, and that Chinese investments in Pakistani infrastructure and power projects will lead to a "virtuous cycle" that will make the country more attractive for foreign investment in a variety of sectors.[241] Poor availability of electricity is considered by the World Bank to be a main constraint to both economic growth and investment in Pakistan.
