In British English, traditional usage favours railway station or simply station, even though train station, which is often perceived as an Americanism, is now about as common as railway station in writing; railroad station is not used, railroad being obsolete there.[1][2][3] In British usage, the word station is commonly understood to mean a railway station unless otherwise qualified.[4]
