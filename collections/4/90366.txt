The tournament also saw a shift in location of first round games from Greensboro, North Carolina to Greenville, South Carolina. Greensboro originally was awarded First and Second Round games, but the games were relocated due to NCAA objections over North Carolina's passage of HB2. This was also the first time a South Carolina venue hosted the tournament in 15 years, after the state removed the Confederate battle flag from the South Carolina State House grounds in July 2015 and the NCAA implemented a policy of not hosting championship games in the state in response to the display in 2002.
