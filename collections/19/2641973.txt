Increasingly dramatic fluctuations in California weather have been observed in the 21st century. In 2015, California experienced its lowest snowpack in at least 500 years; the 2012–15 period was the driest in at least 1200 years.[16][17][18][19][20][21] However, the winter of 2016–17 was the wettest ever recorded in Northern California, surpassing the previous record set in 1982–83. In February, Shasta, Oroville and Folsom Lakes were simultaneously dumping water into the ocean for flood control. Lake Oroville flowed over the emergency spillway for the first time in 48 years, after the main spillway was damaged resulting in the temporary evacuation of 200,000 people.[22] The combined inflow to Shasta, Oroville and Folsom Lakes on February 9 was 764,445 acre feet (0.942929 km3). Two days later, the combined flood control release was 370,260 acre feet (0.45671 km3).[23] This water would have been worth $370M at Los Angeles County municipal rates.[24]
