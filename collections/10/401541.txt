Continents affect the climate of the planet drastically, with supercontinents having a larger, more prevalent influence. Continents modify global wind patterns, control ocean current paths and have a higher albedo than the oceans.[2] Winds are redirected by mountains, and albedo differences cause shifts in onshore winds. Higher elevation in continental interiors produce cooler, drier climate, the phenonmenon of continentality. This is seen today in Eurasia, and rock record shows evidence of continentality in the middle of Pangaea.[2]
