The Alumni Association sponsors several events, usually large extravaganzas involving huge amounts of coordination, such as the 70-year-old Spring Sing, organized by the Student Alumni Association (SAA). UCLA's oldest tradition, Spring Sing is an annual gala of student talent, which is held at either Pauley Pavilion or the outdoor Los Angeles Tennis Center. The committee bestows the George and Ira Gershwin Lifetime Achievement Award each year to a major contributor to the music industry. Past recipients have included Stevie Wonder, Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, James Taylor, Ray Charles, Natalie Cole, Quincy Jones,[174] Lionel Richie, and in 2009, Julie Andrews.[175] The Dinner for 12 Strangers is a gathering of students, alumni, administration and faculty to network around different interests.[176] The "Beat 'SC Bonfire and Rally" occurs the week before the USC rivalry football game.
