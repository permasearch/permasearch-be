Later, the Meherrin migrated south from Virginia & were settled on a reservation in northeast North Carolina. Due to early maps, the Iroquoian Nottoway may have also existed more on the Virginia-North Carolina border before migrating a little more northwest. They are noted as the Mangoag on a map by John Smith from 1606. [20] Following the Meherrin were a small group of Tuscaroras who remained in the region after the Tuscarora War of 1722 sent most of their people north to live among the Iroquois. This tribe has since been referred to as the Coharie. [21]
