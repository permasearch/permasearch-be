The United Nations urged the country to move towards inclusive national reconciliation, the restoration of democracy, and full respect for human rights.[13] In December 2008, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution condemning the human rights situation in Burma and calling for Aug San Suu Kyi's releaseâ€”80 countries voting for the resolution, 25 against and 45 abstentions.[14] Other nations, such as China and Russia, have been less critical of the regime and prefer to co-operate on economic matters.[15][16]
