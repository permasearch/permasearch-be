Suffering from recurrent fever and a tremor (possibly malaria) since his voyage,[107] Cabral withdrew to Santarém in 1509. He spent his remaining years there.[12][101] Only sketchy information is available as to his activities during that time. According to a royal letter dated 17 December 1509, Cabral was party to a dispute over a transaction involving property which belonged to him.[100][108] Another letter of that same year reported that he was to receive certain privileges for an undisclosed military service.[16][100] In 1518, or perhaps previously, he was raised from fidalgo to knight in the King's Council and was entitled to a monthly allowance of 2,437 reais.[109] This was in addition to the annual allowance granted to him in 1497, and still being paid.[16] Cabral died of unspecified causes, most probably in 1520. He was buried in the São João Evangelista chapel of the Convento da Graça in Santarém.[110]
