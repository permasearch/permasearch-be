Despite Minnesota's cold winters, only the mall's entrances and some below ground areas are heated. Heat is allowed in through skylights above the central amusement park area. The majority of the heat is produced by lighting fixtures, other electric devices, and people in the mall.[14] In fact, even during the winter, air conditioning systems may still be in use during peak hours to ensure a comfortable shopping environment.[15] Although the common areas are unheated, the individual stores do have heating systems.[16]
