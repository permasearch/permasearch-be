The Outer Banks offers a multitude of fishing options for tourists as well as locals.[19] There has been a long history of fishing in the Outer Banks, dating back to the end of the 17th century.[20] Pirates ravaged the coast for the majority of the 1600s, but once they were ridden, the local settlers used fishing as their lifeline.[20] Then, in the mid-19th century, large-scale commercial fishing erupted, mostly due to the construction of the Albemarle and Chesapeake Canal, which simplified shipping methods for fishermen.[20] Saltwater fishing became the cash-crop of the Outer Banks, and blossomed it into a popular tourist destination.[20] In modern times, tourists will flock to the area just for the abundance of fishing opportunities.[19] Anglers, otherwise known as fishermen, have a wide range of fishing methods, some of these methods date back to when the first settlers arrived, to choose from in the Outer Banks.[20]
