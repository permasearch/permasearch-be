As the Gold Rush progressed, local banks and gold dealers issued "banknotes" or "drafts"—locally accepted paper currency—in exchange for gold,[116] and private mints created private gold coins.[117] With the building of the San Francisco Mint in 1854, gold bullion was turned into official United States gold coins for circulation.[118] The gold was also later sent by California banks to U.S. national banks in exchange for national paper currency to be used in the booming California economy.[119]
