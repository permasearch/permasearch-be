Copper (II) and rhodium (II) salts tend to give vinylogous Wolff rearranged products, and CuSO4 and Rh2(OAc)4 are the most commonly used catalysts.[44] This is because they promote metal carbene formation, which can add to the olefin to form a cyclopropane, which can reopen via a retro [2 + 2] to form a formally 1,3-shifted ketene (vis-Ã -vis a normal Wolff rearranged ketene), which can be trapped by a nucleophile to give the vinylogous Wolff product.[45]
