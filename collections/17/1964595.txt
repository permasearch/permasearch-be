Nassau County is immediately east of New York City, within the New York metropolitan area. The county is one of the four counties that occupy Long Island, together with Suffolk County to its immediate east and Queens and Kings counties to the west, which correspond, respectively, to the New York City boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn. Two cities, three towns, 64 incorporated villages, and more than 60 unincorporated hamlets are located within the county. There are 56 public school districts within the county.[5] Post office districts and school districts use the same names as a city, hamlet, or village within them, but each sets the boundaries independently.[6]
