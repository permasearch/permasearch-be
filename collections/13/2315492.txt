A page table is the data structure used by a virtual memory system in a computer operating system to store the mapping between virtual addresses and physical addresses.  Virtual addresses are used by the program executed by the accessing process, while physical addresses are used by the hardware, or more specifically, by the RAM subsystem. The page table is a key component of virtual address translation which is necessary to access data in memory.
