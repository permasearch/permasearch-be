Students who attend LSMSA live in dorms, away from their families, much like college students. The dormitories are single-sex: girls in Caddo Hall and boys in Prudhomme Hall. At Caddo and Prudhomme, students of the other sex are only allowed in the dormitory lobbies unless accompanied by an SLA (Student Life Advisor). Caddo Hall was renovated during the spring semester of 2011 and the girls lived in Varnado Hall for that time.
