in which the coefficients      c  i j     {\displaystyle c_{ij}}    are not allowed to depend on the underlying coefficients      β  j     {\displaystyle \beta _{j}}  , since those are not observable, but are allowed to depend on the values      X  i j     {\displaystyle X_{ij}}  , since these data are observable.  (The dependence of the coefficients on each      X  i j     {\displaystyle X_{ij}}   is typically nonlinear; the estimator is linear in each      y  i     {\displaystyle y_{i}}   and hence in each random     ε ,   {\displaystyle \varepsilon ,}   which is why this is "linear" regression.)  The estimator is said to be unbiased if and only if
