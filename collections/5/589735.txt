Unlike a button or menu item in a GUI, a command line is typically self-documenting, stating exactly what the user wants done.  In addition, command lines usually include many defaults that can be changed to customize the results.  Useful command lines can be saved by assigning a character string or alias to represent the full command, or several commands can be grouped to perform a more complex sequence – for instance, compile the program, install it, and run it — creating a single entity, called a command procedure or script which itself can be treated as a command. These advantages mean that a user must figure out a complex command or series of commands only once, because they can be saved, to be used again.
