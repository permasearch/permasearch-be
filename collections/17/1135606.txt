Greece lacked a consolidated, centralized economy in the modern sense of the word. There was a relative absence of contemporary phrases to describe overarching systems of commerce and trade organization, and economics was primarily understood in terms of the localized management of necessary goods.[1] However, economist Murray Rothbard notes that ancient Greek philosophers were concerned with questions that would today fall under the discipline of economic theory.[2]
