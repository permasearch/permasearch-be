After leaving office, one President, William Howard Taft, served as Chief Justice of the United States. Two Presidents, John Quincy Adams (serving in the House) and Andrew Johnson (serving in the Senate), have served in Congress after being President. John Quincy Adams is the only former President to be elected to federal office after serving as president; when Andrew Johnson served as a Senator, state legislatures appointed the Senators.
