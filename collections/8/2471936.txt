When T has units of seconds,      f    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle f}   has units of hertz. Comparison of the two series reveals that       ω = 2 π f T    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle \omega =2\pi fT}    is a normalized frequency with units of radians per sample. The value ω=2π corresponds to      f =   1 T      {\displaystyle \scriptstyle f={\frac {1}{T}}}   Hz.  And now, with the substitution       f =   ω  2 π T    ,    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle f={\frac {\omega }{2\pi T}},}    Eq.1 can be expressed in terms of the Fourier transform, X(•):
