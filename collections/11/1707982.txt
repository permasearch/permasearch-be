The     ( n âˆ’ 1 ) d   {\displaystyle (n-1)d}   orbitals that are involved in the transition metals are very significant because they influence such properties as magnetic character, variable oxidation states, formation of coloured compounds etc. The valence     s ( n s )   {\displaystyle s(ns)}   and     p ( n p )   {\displaystyle p(np)}   orbitals have very little contribution in this regard since they hardly change in the moving from left to the right in a transition series. In transition metals, there is a greater horizontal similarities in the properties of the elements in a period in comparison to the periods in which the d-orbitals are not involved. This is because in a transition series, the valence shell electronic configuration of the elements do not change. However, there are some group similarities as well.
