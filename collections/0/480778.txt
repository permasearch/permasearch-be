Her sole recording with Warpaint before she left the group to focus on her acting career was the 2008 EP, Exquisite Corpse. When asked about pursuing a musical career as a solo artist following her work with the band, Sossamon responded that although she writes a lot of songs by herself, "it just requires focus and discipline in a way that I need to have for other things right now".[89] Despite her musical work, Sossamon has clarified she rarely calls herself a musician, as she does not "practice or play nearly as much as the great ones do. Most of my days and thoughts are taken up by stories, feelings, and pictures. Music is present in them, too, but always having to do with a picture. When I work with musicians, I actually just see them as actors or performers in general that day. I donâ€™t separate them from the duties they are to perform that day".[142]
