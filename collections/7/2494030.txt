In the gospels, Jesus affirmed the commandment against adultery[51] and seemed to extend it, saying, “But I say to you, anyone who looks on a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.”[52] However, some commentators, including St. Thomas Aquinas, say that Jesus was making the connection with the commandment, “You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife.”[53] He taught his audience that the outward act of adultery does not happen apart from sins of the heart: "From within people, from their hearts, come evil thoughts, unchastity, theft, murder, adultery, greed, malice, deceit, licentiousness, envy, blasphemy, arrogance, folly. All these evils come from within and they defile.” [54]
