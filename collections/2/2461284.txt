In 1969 Campbell joined Hee Haw on CBS-TV as a chief writer and on-air talent. His regular characterizations included the Barber, in which he performed his Spoonerism stories and his "That's Bad/That's Good" routines; the Doctor as "Doctor Campbell" with Gunilla Hutton as "Nurse Goodbody"; and, "Justus O'Peace," his version of the classic "Judge" routine of Pigmeat Markham. One of his most well-known segments was the "Where Oh Where" song ("PFFT! You Was Gone") in which he would perform a short verse of original comedy followed by the standard "Where oh where are you tonight" chorus which would conclude with him and a singing partner, often Gordie Tapp, blowing a raspberry at one another or at the camera.
