Hydrogen is industrially produced from steam reforming, which uses fossil fuels such as natural gas, oil, or coal.[30] The energy content of the produced hydrogen is less than the energy content of the original fuel, some of it being lost as excessive heat during production. Steam reforming leads to carbon dioxide emissions, in the same way as a car engine would do.
