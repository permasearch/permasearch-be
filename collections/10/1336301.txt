From 1920 to 1942, there was a rank designated "private/specialist" (or simply, "specialist") that was graded in six classes (the lowest being sixth class and the highest being first class). They were considered the equal of a private first class (Pfc.), but drew additional specialist pay in relationship to the specialist level possessed on top of their base Pfc. (grade six) pay. The classes only indicated competency, not authority, and a private/specialist did not outrank a Pfc.
