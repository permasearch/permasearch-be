The music video for "Young and Beautiful" was set to be released on April 22, 2013,[12] but was officially released on 10 May 2013.[13] Directed by Chris Sweeney, the video's production was helmed by Adam Smith and Jacob Swan-Hyam, with Sophie Muller shooting the footage.[14] Flanked by a full-string orchestra, Del Rey sings Dan Heath's Orchestral version of her song in 1920s art deco fashion.[13] She is shown singing the song in a dark room with glittery diamond-tears on her cheek which look like tattoos.[15][16] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard magazine described the video as "somber" and the singer's look as "especially demure". Lipshutz concluded that "the clip ends without ever reaching any kind of conclusion -- much like the rhetorical question 'Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?' at the heart of the song."[15] Spin's Marc Hogan described it as "elegantly conceived, but succeed[s] only as much as the music does".[16]
