Filming for the season began on November 13, 2017, in New York City.[16] A week of filming for the season in March 2018 took place in the town of Windham, New York, with set photos revealing that the town was representing Fagan Corners, Vermont,[17] the hometown of Karen Page in the comics.[18] The production paid for the renovation of a local store to portray a diner for the series, and used the town's emergency helicopter pad. Additional filming locations for the week included nearby ski areas and a country club.[17] Filming for the season was completed by mid-June 2018.[19]
