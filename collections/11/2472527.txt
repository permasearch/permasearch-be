A 2013 article in National Geographic noted 19,121 people above a base camp and 6,206 Everest summits up to the year 2012.[33] An example of statistics is that first German woman to summit mount Everest and survive, was Helga Hengge in 1999.[34] However, the first German (from West Germany) to make it to the summit was Hannelore Schmatz but she died on descent, getting down to about 8300 meters altitude.[10] Fatalities may include people who died on Mount Everest that were not trying to summit (such as Everest Base Camp trekkers), or may have been climbing something else on the Everest massif such as Lhotse.
