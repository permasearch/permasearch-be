In Paris in 1901 a large Van Gogh retrospective was held at the Bernheim-Jeune Gallery, which excited André Derain and Maurice de Vlaminck, and contributed to the emergence of Fauvism.[267] Important group exhibitions took place with the Sonderbund artists in Cologne in 1912, the Armory Show, New York in 1913, and Berlin in 1914.[271] Henk Bremmer was instrumental in teaching and talking about Van Gogh,[272] and introduced Helene Kröller-Müller to Van Gogh's art; she became an avid collector of his work.[273] The early figures in German Expressionism such as Emil Nolde acknowledged a debt to Van Gogh's work.[274] Bremmer assisted Jacob Baart de la Faille, whose catalogue raisonné L'Oeuvre de Vincent van Gogh appeared in 1928.[275][note 15]
