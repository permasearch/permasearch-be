Mad Max's landscape consists of canyons, caves, deserts, and abandoned wastelands. The game's world is divided into several regions, with each having its own backstory and landscape. Unique landmarks and ruins can be discovered in each region. Side activities such as races, time trials,[19] invading enemy fortresses, and eliminating enemy convoys can be found in each region. A region's threat level is lowered by completing these activities, facilitating its navigation.[17] Each region has a boss, who can be found and defeated in their base.[20] Some of the game's strongholds are friendly, and eliminating hostile strongholds gives Max additional quests and rewards.[21] These strongholds can be upgraded, offering Max different benefits such as helping Max to collect scraps when the game is turned off, or restoring Max's health and shotgun ammo upon visits.[22] Max can ascend in a hot-air balloon (permanently attached to the ground) to look for new objectives and locations. After seeing the objectives through binoculars, they are highlighted on the map.[7] Max can be guided by Chumbucket in strategically completing his objectives.[23][24] Max is accompanied by a dog companion called Dinki-Di, who can help players detect land mines.[25] Max has limited climbing abilities, and objects that he can climb are highlighted in yellow.[22]
