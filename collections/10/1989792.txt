Beginning in the late 1990s, conservative Southern whites began to shift to the Republican Party. The election of Guy Hunt as governor in 1986 marked the shift of the white majority to becoming a Republican stronghold in Presidential elections; its voters also leaned Republican in statewide elections. The Democratic Party still dominated local and legislative offices, but total Southern white Democratic dominance had ended.[8] In terms of organization, the parties are about evenly matched.[9]
