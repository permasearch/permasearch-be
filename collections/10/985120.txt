Evidence from physiological, pharmacological and neuroimaging studies suggest serotonin may play a role in anorexia. While acutely ill, metabolic changes may produce a number of biological findings in people with anorexia that are not necessarily causative of the anorexic behavior. For example, abnormal hormonal responses to challenges with serotonergic agents have been observed during acute illness, but not recovery. Nevertheless, increased cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (a metabolite of serotonin), and changes in anorectic behavior in response to tryptophan depletion(a metabolic precursor to serotonin) support a role in anorexia. The binding potential of 5-HT2A receptors and 5-HT1A receptors have been reportedly decreased and increased respectively in a number of cortical regions. While these findings may be confounded by comorbid psychiatric disorders, taken as a whole they indicate serotonin in anorexia.[70][71] These alterations in serotonin have been linked to traits characteristic of anorexia such as obsessiveness, anxiety, and appetite dysregulation.[72]
