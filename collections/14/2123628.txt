Long-term human exposure to high-levels of microwaves is recognized to cause cataracts according to experimental animal studies and epidemiological studies. The mechanism is unclear but may include changes in heat sensitive enzymes that normally protect cell proteins in the lens. Another mechanism that has been advanced is direct damage to the lens from pressure waves induced in the aqueous humor.
