The contract is referred to as a separation agreement and is a legally binding written agreement voluntarily signed by two spouses (either married or common law) who have separated. In Ontario, a separation agreement is unenforceable unless made in writing, signed by the parties and witnessed. This written agreement usually resolves all issues arising from the separation, including custody and access, child support, spousal support and the division of property. One issue a separation agreement cannot resolve is the actual divorce itself.[1]
