During the outbreak's onset, Sasha and her older brother stayed in a bunker in their neighbor Jerry's backyard. After 7 months, they ran out of supplies, after which Sasha and Tyreese met a family of survivors: Allen, Donna, and Ben, and then joined a larger group of survivors, which numbered 25 members at one point. After their camp was overrun, they wandered for 6 weeks under Tyreese's leadership until they found the prison.
