FMIC discontinued the low-end bolt-neck Electromatic models of the late 1990s and early 2000s. The renewed Electromatic Hollowbody line became successful, from the 5125â€“5129 series (with U.S.-made DeArmond 2000 pickups) and the similar 5120 series. The 5120, a single-cutaway model inspired by the 6120, became the best-selling guitar in Gretsch history. The double-cutaway 5122 model, introduced in 2008 and inspired by the 6122 Country Gentleman, filled out the Korean-built Electromatic Hollow line.
