Shooting of the two films was marred by Donner's bad relationship with the Salkinds, with Richard Lester acting as mediator.[3] With the film going over-budget, the filmmakers decided to temporarily cease production of II and move that film's climax into the first film.[2][3] Despite Superman's success, Donner did not return to finish Superman II,[3] and it was completed with Lester, who gave the film a more tongue-in-cheek tone. The Salkinds also cut Brando for financial reasons,[2] while John Williams quit as composer due to turning his attention to other projects.[2] Superman II was another financial and critical success, despite stiff competition with Raiders of the Lost Ark in the same year. In 2006, after receiving many requests for his own version of Superman II, Richard Donner and producer Michael Thau produced their own cut of the film and released it on November 28, 2006. The new version of the film received positive response from critics[5] and the stars of the original film.
