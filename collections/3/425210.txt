However, Clyde (1939)[27] and Kailash (1978)[28] believed that the mane could defend part of the lion's neck, in a fight against the tiger, and this had been reported. When the Shimlan tiger fought Atlas, it tried biting Atlas' neck, but it could not, due to the mane blocking its teeth, and interfering with its respiratory system.[38] According to Heptner and Sludskii (1997), Barbary and Cape lions had the "most luxuriant and extensive manes" among lions, with "tresses on flanks and abdomen." As for the Indian lion, which has a smaller mane than its African cousins,[3][64] apart from African lions that have weak manes or are maneless,[184] during the fight reported by St. Landry Democrat (1887),[102] The Eaton Democrat (1887),[103] The Iola Register (1887),[104] The Milan Exchange (1887),[105] and The Sydney Mail (1889),[13] from The Sun (New York) (1889), though the tiger could bite the lion's body, it was not mentioned to have bitten the lion's neck.
