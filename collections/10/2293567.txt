Roar was shot in the dense mangrove forest showcasing the animal-man conflict and the film has aerial visuals of the Sundarbans and over 800 shots with special effects. Director Kamal Sadanah said "We spent four months doing the test shoots and we shot with trained tigers from Los Angeles and Thailand and composited these sequences with the ones taken at Sundarbans with VFX". He concluded saying that he had to take up an online course in visual effects along with his producer Abis Rizvi.[7]
