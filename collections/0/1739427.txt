In the knee the tibia forms one of the two articulations with the femur, often referred to as the tibiofemoral components of the knee joint.[4][5] This is the weightbearing part of the knee joint.[2] The tibiofibular joints are the articulations between the tibia and fibula which allows very little movement.[citation needed] The proximal tibiofibular joint is a small plane joint. The joint is formed between the undersurface of the lateral tibial condyle and the head of fibula. The joint capsule is reinforced by anterior and posterior ligament of the head of the fibula.[2] The distal tibiofibular joint (tibiofibular syndesmosis) is formed by the rough, convex surface of the medial side of the distal end of the fibula, and a rough concave surface on the lateral side of the tibia.[2] The part of the ankle joint known as the talocrural joint, is a synovial hinge joint that connects the distal ends of the tibia and fibula in the lower limb with the proximal end of the talus. The articulation between the tibia and the talus bears more weight than between the smaller fibula and the talus.[citation needed]
