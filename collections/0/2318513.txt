Grandparents have different functions in child development. Not only do they provide instrumental support such as picking grandchildren from school or feeding them, but they also offer emotional support.[22] Furthermore, grandparents protect children from being impacted by negative circumstances, such as harsh parenting, poor economic status, and single-parent families.[23][24] In addition to providing support, grandparents can also help grandchildren with their schoolwork or teach them values that are integral to their society.[22]
