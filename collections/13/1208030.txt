Reviewers lauded Injustice 2's story and presentation. Eurogamer's Wesley Yin-Poole praised the game's narrative and visuals, describing them as "impressive" and a "significant step up" from Injustice: Gods Among Us.[72] Yin-Poole commended the story mode on a technical level, praising the motion capture, action choreography, voice acting, and facial animations.[72] Destructoid's Nick Valdez shared similar views, stating that the visuals were "leagues above the first title".[86] Valdez also complimented the game's improved writing and "more engaging narrative".[86] Metro claimed it had "probably the best single-player experience ever in a fighting game".[79] In contrast, while Game Revolution's James Kozanitis said the visuals were "absolutely jaw-dropping" and "set a new high bar for the [fighting game] genre", he lambasted the story campaign, which he labeled as "poorly written" and "contrived".[74]
