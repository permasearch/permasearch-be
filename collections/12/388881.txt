When the Inter-Allied Conference at San Remo adjourned in April 1920, the definition of Palestine had not been discussed.

He observed that the failure to establish a western-based territorial element or frame of reference had clouded discussions and cited the claim that Transjordan had been detached from Palestine as a non-sequitur.[68]
