The triangle proof can be reformulated as an application of Green's theorem in flux-divergence form (i.e. a two-dimensional version of the divergence theorem), in a way that avoids all mention of trigonometry and the constant Ï€. Consider the vector field      r  = x  i  + y  j    {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} =x\mathbf {i} +y\mathbf {j} }   in the plane. So the divergence of r is equal to two, and hence the area of a disc D is equal to
