Tollett begins to book artists for each festival as early as the previous August. In addition to agent pitches and artists discovered online, the lineup is culled from acts booked by Goldenvoice for their other 1,800 shows each year. Tollett uses the promoter's ticketing figures for insight into who to book, saying: "There are AEG shows all across the country, and I see all their show lists and ticket counts. So I see little things that are happening maybe before some others, because they don't have that data."[95] The booking process takes approximately six months.[7] According to the Los Angeles Times, booking fees for most artists playing the festival allegedly start at $15,000 and extend into the "high six figures." Top-billed artists for 2010 were expected receive over $1 million.[96] Billboard's sources estimate that non-headline acts can earn anywhere from $500 to $100,000.[95] According to a 2017 profile on Tollett in The New Yorker, that year's headlining performers would receive $3–4 million.[7]
