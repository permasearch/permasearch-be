Joyce Kilmer's reputation as a poet is staked largely on the widespread popularity of this one poem.  "Trees" was liked immediately on first publication in Poetry: A Magazine of Verse;[28] when Trees and Other Poems was published the following year, the review in Poetry focused on the "nursery rhyme" directness and simplicity of the poems, finding a particular childlike naivety in "Trees", which gave it "an unusual, haunting poignancy".[29] However, the same review criticized the rest of the book, stating "much of the verse in this volume is very slight indeed."[29]
