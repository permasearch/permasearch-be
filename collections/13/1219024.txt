Safa (Arabic: ٱلـصَّـفَـا‎, Aṣ-Ṣafā) and Marwah (ٱلْـمَـرْوَة,[51] Al-Marwah) are two hills, now located in the mosque. In Islamic tradition, Abraham's wife Hagar ran between these hills, looking for water for her infant son Ishmael until God eventually revealed her the Zamzam. Muslims also travel back and forth seven times during the ritual pilgrimages of Hajj and Umrah as a remembrance to her sacrifice. Safa – from which the ritual walking (Arabic: سَـعِى‎, saʿy) begins – is located approximately 0.5 miles (0.80 kilometres) from the Kaaba. Al-Marwah is located about 100 m (330 ft) from the Kaaba. The distance between Safa and Marwah is approximately 450 m (1,480 ft).[citation needed]
