Propaganda did not develop a negative connotation until it was used in Nazi propaganda for World War II.[87] Even though Germany's World War I propaganda was considered more advanced than that of other nations, Adolf Hitler said that propaganda had been under-utilized and claimed that superior British propaganda was the main reason for losing the war.[87][88][89] Nazi Germany created the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda in March 1933, just after Nazis took power.[90] The Nazi party took editorial control over newspapers, created their own news organizations and established Nazi-controlled news organizations in conquered regions.[91][92] The Nazi party used posters,[93] films,[94] books[95] and public speakers[96] among other tactics.
