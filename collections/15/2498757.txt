With a law adopted in 1969, California became the first U.S. state to permit no-fault divorce.[6]  California's law was framed on a roughly contemporaneous effort of the non-governmental organization National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, which began drafting a model of no-fault divorce statute for states to consider in 1967.[7]
