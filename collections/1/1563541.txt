The character of Chad's introduction would cause trouble for the romantic pairing of Will Horton (Dylan Patton) and Mia McCormick (Taylor Spreitler).[2] According to the actor, Chad is extremely sincere about getting custody of the baby from Nicole which is why he turns down her sexual advances. He refuses to let Mia "whose been lying to him this whole time get in his way." However, Deidrick commented that when Chad turns down Nicole, he is not "acting [his] age."[29] Though he suspects Mia and Nicole are hiding something, Deidrick explained that Chad is completely blindsided when he finds the specifics.[5] Of Chad's reaction to the baby reveal Deidrick said, "There's nothing that can really prepare you for something like that." However, what hurts the most is that Chad has spent so much time trying to win Mia back, and his love for her is actually "sincere." According to Deidrick, it is a "slap in the face," to learn that Mia has been lying about such a huge part of their lives.[6] For Chad, the revelation allows him to see Mia's true colors.[5] Deidrick stated that "[T]here's always going to be tension" between Chad and Mia but Deidrick maintained that despite her lies, Chad feels sorry what Mia has gone through and tries to stay by her side. "It's a very hard situation." Of his character during the storyline, Deidrick described Chad as a "kid who doesn't know what to do and he's a fighting all these feelings." Deidrick previewed that the reveal about the baby switch would put everything "into place."[29] The actor admitted that the baby storyline kept him very isolated due to the significant age differences between himself and the rest of his teenage costars. When asked about a future love interest, Deidrick mentioned Gabriela Rodriguez who had recently been introduced to the canvas as Gabi Hernandez (Gabriela Rodriguez) but didn't believe a romantic pairing would work due to the age difference.[29]
