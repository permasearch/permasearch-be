LaBeouf stated that, during his first meeting with Stone, the director was "really expedient about killing any ego or conceit on my part", saying not to worry because Tom Cruise was not an actor when he first worked with him either, which LaBeouf considered a knife to his heart.[7] LaBeouf said that he did not know what a credit derivative is or what a CP, LP, or LVC were, commenting "You gotta know ticker names."[8] He also said that he has "no concept" of the "ins and outs of the financial world"[8] and, as part of getting into character, he chose to stay thin to be like hedge funders.[9] To prepare for the film he traded with different firms, playing with up to $1 million and became so interested in trading that he began studying for the Series 7 Exam.[7]
