The traditional view is that these coagulants result in bitterness and low yield in cheese especially when aged for a long time. Over the years microbial coagulants have improved a lot largely due to the characterization and purification of secondary enzymes responsible for bitter peptide formation/non-specific proteolytic breakdown in cheese aged for long periods. Consequently, it has become possible to produce several high quality cheeses with microbial rennet. [6]
