Meanwhile on the main highway, Connie and Curtis are chased by a truck, but they make it crash off the side of the road. Curtis suggests that they should call the police from the Truck Stop, only to find the trucks surrounding the stop. The two try to drive into the parking lot through a gap between the trucks, but the car is hit and flips over. Bill rushes out to help them and Hendershot uses M72 LAW rockets stored in a bunker hidden under the diner and destroy many of the trucks. That night, the survivors hear one of the victims outside is still alive and Bill and Curtis sneak out to help him by climbing through the sewers. Deke has been hiding from the trucks just outside the truck stop and Bill and Curtis rescue him from a truck. The next morning, a Caterpillar D7G bulldozer and a M274 Mule drive through the diner. Hendershot uses the rocket launcher to blow the bulldozer away. The Mule fires its post-mounted M60 machine gun into the building, killing several including the waitress when she rants at them. The Mule then demands, via sending morse code signals through its horn, that the humans pump the truck's diesel for them in exchange for keeping them safe; the survivors soon realize they have become enslaved by their own machines. Robinson suggests they escape to a local island just off the coast, on which no vehicles or machines are permitted.
