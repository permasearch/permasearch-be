The paradox suggested by Veronique, "My nose grows now", or in future tense: "will be growing", leaves room for different interpretations. In the novel Pinocchio's nose continues to grow as he lies: "As he spoke, his nose, long though it was, became at least two inches longer."[3] So logicians question if the sentence "My nose will be growing" was the only sentence that Pinocchio spoke, did he tell a lie before he said "My nose will be growing", or was he going to tell a lieâ€”and how long would it take for his nose to start growing?[2]
