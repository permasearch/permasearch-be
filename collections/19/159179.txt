Many theories—though none proven—abound about the origin of the name "Cherokee". It may have originally been derived from the Choctaw word Cha-la-kee, which means "people who live in the mountains", or Choctaw Chi-luk-ik-bi, meaning "people who live in the cave country".[14] The earliest Spanish transliteration of the name, from 1755, is recorded as Tchalaquei.[15] Another theory is that "Cherokee" derives from a Lower Creek word, Cvlakke ("chuh-log-gee").[16] The Iroquois Five Nations based in New York have historically called the Cherokee Oyata’ge'ronoñ ("inhabitants of the cave country").[17]
