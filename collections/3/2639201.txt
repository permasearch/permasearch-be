While touring with his Believe Tour throughout 2012 and 2013, Justin Bieber managed to write new songs everyday. According to his manager, Scooter Braun, the writing process had him "writing one to two songs a day for the entire tour and [...] label[ing] them by the city he wr[o]te them in."[4] In January 2013, Bieber confirmed he was writing for a new album,[5] as well as American R&B singer R. Kelly that confirmed he was working with Bieber on the album.[6] Meanwhile, in June of the same year, he confirmed a new album, the rest of the Believe Tour and a movie for 2013.[7] In July, Braun gave an interview for MTV News, where he discussed the album, claiming: "For this project, we want to do things a little bit differently. And there are more songs than 10 or 12, so if you have more music and you have more things you want to express, you gotta think out the box, and [think like] ’How do I get this out there in a unique way where it gets directly to my fans and I can express myself through music directly to them?’ And I think that’s what it’s about when you have people who are incredibly creative, things happen."[8] In August, Bieber confirmed he was working with American rapper Future. It was also reported he was working with Juicy J, Ludacris and Big Sean.[9] In December, he also confirmed he was working with Chance the Rapper and Lil' Wayne.[10]
