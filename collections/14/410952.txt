Halley is classified as a periodic or short-period comet; one with an orbit lasting 200 years or less.[38] This contrasts it with long-period comets, whose orbits last for thousands of years. Periodic comets have an average inclination to the ecliptic of only ten degrees, and an orbital period of just 6.5 years, so Halley's orbit is atypical.[28] Most short-period comets (those with orbital periods shorter than 20 years and inclinations of 20â€“30 degrees or less) are called Jupiter-family comets. Those resembling Halley, with orbital periods of between 20 and 200 years and inclinations extending from zero to more than 90 degrees, are called Halley-type comets.[38][39] As of 2015[update], only 75 Halley-type comets have been observed, compared with 511 identified Jupiter family comets.[40]
