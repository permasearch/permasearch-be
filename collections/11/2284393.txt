Areito is a Cuban record label founded in 1964 as the primary imprint of EGREM, which is based in Havana.[1] Areito is named after the recording studio from which the vast majority of its catalog stems, which in turn was named after the TaÃ­no ritual of the same name. Prior to the nationalization of the Cuban music industry in 1961, the studio was property of the Panart record label. Since the 1960s, Areito/EGREM has been the main music company in Cuba, managing most of the recording, manufacture and distribution of albums, EPs and singles in the country. Areito's counterpart in eastern Cuba is Siboney.[1]
