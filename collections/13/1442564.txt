This was the first major since the 2002 US Open where Spaniard David Ferrer (world number eight) did not participate in as he withdrew with an elbow injury that occurred in the lead up tournament at the 2015 Queen's Club Championships.  This ended Ferrer's streak of 50 consecutive Grand Slam appearances.
