Eventually rulers from Thebes reunified the Egyptian nation in the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055â€“1650 BC). These Theban pharaohs initially promoted their patron god Monthu to national importance, but during the Middle Kingdom, he was eclipsed by the rising popularity of Amun.[125] In this new Egyptian state, personal piety grew more important and was expressed more freely in writing, a trend which continued in the New Kingdom.[37]
