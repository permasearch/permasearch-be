"The popular wisdom", according to Zinn and Eitzen, sees the family structures of the past as superior to those today, and families as more stable and happier at a time when they did not have to contend with problems such as illegitimate children and divorce. They respond to this, saying, "there is no golden age of the family gleaming at us in the far back historical past."[55] "Desertion by spouses, illegitimate children, and other conditions that are considered characteristics of modern times existed in the past as well."[56]
