"People Are Strange" was composed in early 1967 after guitarist Robby Krieger and a depressed Jim Morrison had walked to the top of Laurel Canyon.[3] The band's drummer, John Densmore, recalled the song's writing process in his book Riders on the Storm.[4] He and Doors guitarist Robby Krieger, who had then been roommates, were visited by Jim Morrison, who was acting "deeply depressed."[4] At the suggestion of Krieger, they took a walk along Laurel Canyon. Morrison returned from the walk "euphoric" with the early lyrics of "People Are Strange."[4] Krieger, intrigued by the new lyrics, was convinced that the song was a hit upon hearing the vocal melody.[4]
