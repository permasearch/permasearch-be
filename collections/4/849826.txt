Gorillaz performed "Dirty Harry" at the 2006 Brit Awards in London, and the band were nominated for Best British Group, and Best British Album (Demon Days).[12] Plans were unveiled for Gorillaz to go on a "holographic" world tour in 2007 and 2008.[34] The cartoon members would be shown as virtual characters on stage using Musion Eyeliner technology, giving them a lifelike appearance on stage. The virtual characters were first used at the 2005 MTV Europe Music Awards on 3 November 2005[35] and again at the 2006 Grammy Awards on 8 February 2006 with the addition of Madonna, where the band played a pre-recorded version of "Feel Good Inc."[36]
