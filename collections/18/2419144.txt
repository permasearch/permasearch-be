An earlier mention of a Hans Island expedition is in Elisha Kent Kane's Arctic Explorations: The Second Grinnell Expedition, 1853, ’54, ’55, (published 1857), in pages 317–319. Thus the year 1853 is now often cited as the date of the discovery and naming of the island, including in a  letter by the Danish Ambassador to Canada in the Ottawa Citizen on July 28, 2005.
