The Tashelhit language is considered to be the most widely spoken as it covers the whole of the Region Souss-Massa-Dr√¢a, and is also spoken in the Marrakech-Tensift-El Haouz and Tadla-Azilal regions. Studies done in 1990 show around 3 million people, concentrated in the south of Morocco, speak the language.[21]
