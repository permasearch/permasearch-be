German and German-American celebrations, such as Oktoberfest, Rhenish Carnival, German-American Day and Von Steuben Day are held regularly throughout the country. One of the largest is the German-American Steuben Parade in New York City, held every third Saturday in September. There are also major annual events in Chicago's Lincoln Square neighborhood, a traditional a center of the city's German population, in Cincinnati, where its annual Oktoberfest Zinzinnati[159] is the largest Oktoberfest outside of Germany[160] and in Milwaukee, which celebrates its German heritage with an annual German Fest.[106] Many of the immigrants from Germany and other German-speaking countries came to Pennsylvania to what was then "Allegheny City" (now part of the North Side of the City of Pittsburgh). So many German speakers arrived, the area became known as "Deutschtown" and has been revived as such.[161][162] Within Deutschtown and since 1854, The Teutonia MÃ¤nnerchor has been promoting and furthering German cultural traditions.[163]
