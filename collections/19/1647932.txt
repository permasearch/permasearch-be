In the frequent case where X and Y are subsets of the real numbers (or may be identified to such subsets), an element     ( x , y ) âˆˆ G   {\displaystyle (x,y)\in G}   may be identified with the point of coordinates x, y in the Cartesian plane. Marking these points provides a drawing, generally a curve, that is also called the graph of the function. For example the graph of the square function
