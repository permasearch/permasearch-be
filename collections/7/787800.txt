Take 1 opened with a verse, starting "Living is easy with eyes closed", instead of the chorus, which starts the released version. The first verse also led directly to the second, with no chorus between. Lennon's vocals were automatically double-tracked from the words "Strawberry Fields Forever" through the end of the last verse. The last verse, beginning "Always, no sometimes", has three-part harmonies, with McCartney and Harrison singing "dreamy background vocals".[27][57] Onto this take 1, Harrison also overdubbed slide guitar parts over the choruses,[57] played on the Mellotron's guitar setting[58] and using the instrument's pitch control to achieve the slide effect.[60] This version was soon abandoned; it went unreleased until a new mix was included on the Anthology 2 compilation in 1996,[61] although the harmony vocals were cut from the track.[57][58]
