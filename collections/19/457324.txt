This river was known to the ancient Indians in Sanskrit as Sindhu, which is literally interpreted to mean "large body of water, sea, or ocean".[5] The Proto-Iranian sound change *s > h occurred between 850–600 BCE, according to Asko Parpola,[6] causing its Avestan name to become Hendu,[7] From Iran, the name passed to the Greeks as Indós ("Ἰνδός") and to the Romans as Indus.  The Persian name for the river was Darya,[8] which similarly has the connotations of large body of water and sea.
