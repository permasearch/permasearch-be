Today, there are several major races held regularly along the clipper route.  The Volvo Ocean Race is a crewed race with stops which sails the clipper route every four years.  Two single-handed races, inspired by Chichester and the Golden Globe race, are the Around Alone, which circumnavigates with stops, and the Vend√©e Globe, which is non-stop.
