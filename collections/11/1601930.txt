The Detroit market also faced challenges from its close proximity to Canada, which had no subscription television services. Canadians who dabbled in electronics soon learned how to manufacture their own decoder boxes and sold them for a flat fee of $75, allowing unlimited access to ONTV's programming. While WXON tried several times to re-scramble the signal – particularly before showings of big-name films such as The Wiz and Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope – their efforts ultimately failed, as the boxes easily found their way into the Detroit market from across the Canada–United States border in nearby Windsor, Ontario (hobbyists on the American side made and sold boxes as well, charging up to $150).
