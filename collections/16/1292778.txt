Built in 1564, it was gradually extended until it closed off the western end of the Louvre courtyard and displayed an immense fa√ßade of 266 metres. Since the destruction of the Tuileries, the Louvre courtyard has remained open and the site is now the location of the eastern end of the Tuileries Garden, forming an elevated terrace between the Place du Carrousel and the gardens proper.
