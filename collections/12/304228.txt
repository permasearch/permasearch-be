At the spot where his father was killed on I-580, Jax reminisces about his experiences with the club and his hopes for his sons. His helmet and riding glasses rest on the ground. A passing officer, informed of the APB on Jax, orders him off the bike, but Jax shoots at him before pulling off. He leads a caravan of policemen on motorcycles and in patrol cars on a very long chase down I-580 until he spies a semi-trailer truck heading towards him on the opposite side. The trailer's logo is Papa's Goods. Removing his hands from the handlebars, spreading them outward like a bird or crucified man, and closing his eyes with a small smile, Jax slams into the front of the semi, killing himself and dying in a manner similar to his father, on the same highway. The last words said in the episode are the trucker's as he slams on his brakes in a fruitless attempt to avoid Jax: Jesus!. In a shot reminiscent of the pilot's opener, of the homeless woman Jax encountered earlier that day who was eating bread and drinking wine, and of the Blessed Sacrament, two crows are shown eating bread by the side of the road that fly away together after Jax's blood flows around the bread. Jax's final words "I love you dad", followed by the quote: "Doubt thou the stars are fire; doubt that the sun doth move; doubt truth to be a liar; but never doubt I love" from Shakespeare's Hamlet.
