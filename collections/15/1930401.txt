One such approach involves introducing a many-valued logic according to which "If     A   {\displaystyle A}   then     B   {\displaystyle B}  " has the truth value     I   {\displaystyle I}  , meaning "Indeterminate" or "Inappropriate" when     A   {\displaystyle A}   is false.[39] In such a system, contraposition is not automatically allowed: "If     A   {\displaystyle A}   then     B   {\displaystyle B}  " is not equivalent to "If       B ¯     {\displaystyle {\overline {B}}}   then       A ¯     {\displaystyle {\overline {A}}}  ". Consequently, "All ravens are black" is not equivalent to "All non-black things are non-ravens".
