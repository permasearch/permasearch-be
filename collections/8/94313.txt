The first recorded instance of asylum seekers arriving in Australia via unauthorised boat occurred in April 1976. Fleeing South Vietnam after the Communist Party victory of 1974, an estimated 2,000 "Vietnamese boat people" followed from 1976â€“1982. The sporadic arrival of unauthorised boats was a cause of concern for the Australian people.[24] The initial controversy regarding asylum seekers in Australia was mostly because of family reunions.[23] Employment and security concerns were also raised with the Waterside Workers Federation calling for strikes on the matter.[5] This led to the first detention of boat people. In response, the government of Malcolm Fraser authorized the immigration of more than 50,000 Vietnamese from Indian Ocean refugee camps. At the time, the "open door" immigration policy enjoyed bipartisan support.[24]
