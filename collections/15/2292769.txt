The 2000 season was considered a make-or-break year for Fassel. The conventional wisdom was that Fassel needed to have a strong year and a playoff appearance to save his job. After back-to-back losses at home against the St. Louis Rams and Detroit Lions, the Giants fell to 7–4,[147] and their playoff prospects were in question. At a press conference following the loss to Detroit, Fassel guaranteed that "[t]his team is going to the playoffs."[148] The Giants responded, winning the next week's game against Arizona and the rest of their regular season games to finish the season 12–4[147] and earn a bye and home-field advantage as the NFC's top seed.
