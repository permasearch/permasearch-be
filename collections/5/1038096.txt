Meanwhile, Fiona is cursed with an untreatable cancer due to a new Supreme rising. She tries, in vain, to regain her youth and cure herself. Voodoo priestess and the Salem witches' rival, Marie Laveau (Angela Bassett), has gained immortality by dealing with a voodoo spirit, Papa Legba (Lance Reddick). Fiona frees Marie's immortal prisoner, 19th-century slave killer Delphine LaLaurie (Kathy Bates), who becomes the Academy's maid. She struggles to adjust to the modern world due to her inherent racism. Fiona believes Madison is the next Supreme and slits her throat; Spalding helps cover it up. Zoe discovers Spalding's secrets and kills him, turning him into a ghost that haunts the Academy. Cordelia is blinded in an acid attack by witch hunters, one of whom is her husband. Myrtle is framed by Fiona, with Queenie's help, and is burned at the stake.
