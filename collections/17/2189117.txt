After a seven-day trial District Court judge Heather Perrin became the first judge in the history of the State to be convicted of a serious criminal offence. On the 20 November 2012 the jury at Dublin's Circuit Court found her guilty of deception by unanimous decision after 3 and 1/2 hours of deliberation. The crime was committed a month before she was appointed to the judiciary while she was still a practising solicitor.[13][14] She subsequently resigned as a judge.[15]
