Archaeological finds show that Sierra Leone has been inhabited continuously for at least 2,500 years,[1] populated by successive movements of peoples from other parts of Africa.[2] The use of iron was introduced to Sierra Leone by the 9th century, and by the end of the 10th century agriculture was being practiced by coastal tribes.[3]
