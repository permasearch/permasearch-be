In contradiction to the testimony of Allsup and Jennings, Dion has since said that Holly approached him along with Valens and The Bopper to join the flight, not Holly's bandmates. In a 2009 interview called "The Winter Dance Party", Dion claimed that Holly called him, Valens, and Richardson into a vacant dressing room during Frankie Sardo's performance and said "I've chartered a plane, we're the guys making the money [we should be the ones flying ahead]...the only problem is there are only two available seats." According to Dion, it was Valens, not Richardson who had fallen ill, so Valens and Dion flipped a coin for the seat. In his interview, no mention is made of Jennings or Allsup being invited on the plane. Dion claims that he won the toss, but ultimately decided that since the $36 fare (equivalent to US$300 in today's money)[12] equaled the monthly rent his parents paid for his childhood apartment, he could not justify the indulgence.[13]
