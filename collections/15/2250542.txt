The "All Good Things" video, directed by Gabriel Coss and Israel Lugo,[11] was filmed in Puerto Rico and shot back-to-back with the video for "Say It Right", the album's third single in North America.[12] It features a love story between Furtado and a male model, and Furtado is seen walking along a beach and into a forest, where she finds a dinner table hanging upside-down from a tree. There are accompanying shots of the model finding, and subsequently hanging from, the table. The video includes flashbacks to when Furtado and the model were eating at the table, and it ends with them holding each other under a stream of water. Furtado said that the video is "very tropical and romantic" and reminded her of videos for Sarah McLachlan singles: "it has that element of art to it. It's kind of like cinema."[12]
