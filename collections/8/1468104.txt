In the second film, Polly begins a relationship with Will's former head of sixth form, Mr Gilbert. Originally, when she is seen on Skype, Will becomes suspicious on seeing that she has laid two bowls for breakfast, although she pretends that Will's grandmother is staying. Then, at the end of the film, Polly announces to Will that she and Mr Gilbert have entered into a relationship (he adds that they have been having sexual intercourse and that he is looking forward to "going diving") and that they are soon to be married, to Will's horror as Mr Gilbert is to become his new stepfather.
