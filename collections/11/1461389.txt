In the late 1980s, the USFWS relocated about 140 Californian sea otters to San Nicolas Island (SNI) in southern California, in the hope of establishing a reserve population should the mainland be struck by an oil spill. To the surprise of biologists, the San Nicolas sea otters mostly swam back to the mainland.[112] By 2005, only 30 sea otters remained at San Nicolas,[113] although they were slowly increasing as they thrived on the abundant prey around the island.[112] The plan that authorized the translocation program had predicted the carrying capacity would be reached within five to 10 years.[114] The spring 2016 SNI count was 104 sea otters, continuing a 5-year positive trend of over 12% per year.[110]
