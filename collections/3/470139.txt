Elimination: The blue team nominated Robyn, but could not choose between Brian and Clemenza, so Ramsay also nominated Brian, Clemenza and Justin. Clemenza and Justin were given black jackets before Robyn was given the final black jacket and Brian was eliminated for giving up easily in service and not having a more serious attitude.
