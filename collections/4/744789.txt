It is built on the steep slope of the caldera and the houses and restaurants are built into niches carved into the caldebra on the seaward side. There are narrow passageways and a central square.[6] The sun light hours in this village are much longer than in the Fira town. Its paths are very narrow and hence gets congested during the tourist season.[6][2] The idyllic surroundings of the town have a complex of white washed, blue domed churches and charming, traditional Cycladic houses and cave houses that are carved into the rock face  on top of the cliff. It is set in a location which provides excellent views of the sunset over the caldera.[2][14] To the southwest, the Bay of Armeni, reachable from the town on foot or by mule, was once an important boat-building centre. Small repairs are now done on a single wharf. Excursion boats for trips around the island and ferries to Therasia leave from here. The harbour of Ammoudi on the western side of the town is reached by steep stairs north of Fort Londsa; there are a few tavernas and a pebble beach.[6][2]
