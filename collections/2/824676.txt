In January, You've got the Love entered the Australian singles ARIA Charts at number 50, and remained within the top 50 for a large amount of time. In February and March, it was consistently increasing positions, where it eventually reached a peak of number 30. Due to popular television shows like Domestic Blitz and MasterChef Australia using it in commercials, the song rapidly climbed to number 17, on the 4th of April, and to its highest peak of number nine on 11 April. It hasn't been released as a physical single, and has relied solely on digital sales, where it has peaked at number five.
