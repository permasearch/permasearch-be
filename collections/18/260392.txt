For Shakespeare's 450th birthday Scott Stroman adapted the play into a stage musical of the same name, premiered in London, England by Highbury Opera Theatre in June 2014. www.highburyoperatheatre.com Stroman's version edits Shakespeare's original text, removing subplots and combining characters to make room for the jazz-influenced music, which also alludes to the music of William Byrd.  In addition to the songs existing in the play he sets some sections of dialogue as songs (All the World's a Stage, What 'Tis to Love, Married Tomorrow), borrows songs from other plays (O Mistress Mine, Sigh No More, Fear No More) and creates a musical prologue (Crabbed Age and Youth, from The Passionate Pilgrim).
