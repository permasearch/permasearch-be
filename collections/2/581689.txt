Patrick Mulkern from Radio Times also gave the episode a lower rating, rewarding it a 2 stars out of 5. He felt that the worst part of the episode was the poor decision in getting a companion to fire a gun at the Doctor, how the viewers saw "nothing that would push her to such an extreme act", and stating the act as something that could not be "rationalised or condoned". He described the actors as being "blocked awkwardly" and how they appeared uncomfortable in the situation, though he complimented their acting overall throughout the episode.[15]
