Tolkien first began working on the stories that would become The Silmarillion in 1914,[9] intending them to become an English mythology that would explain the origins of English history and culture.[10] Much of this early work was written while Tolkien, then a British officer returned from France during World War I, was in hospital and on sick leave.[11] He completed the first story, "The Fall of Gondolin", in late 1916.[12]
