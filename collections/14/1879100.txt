These tables show that when      S = 0    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle S=0}   then      Z = A    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle Z=A}   but when      S = 1    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle S=1}   then      Z = B    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle Z=B}  . A straightforward realization of this 2-to-1 multiplexer would need 2 AND gates, an OR gate, and a NOT gate. While this is mathematically correct, a direct physical implementation would be prone to race conditions that require additional gates to suppress.[5]
