The US release of the DVD attracted controversy as the result of the design for the DVD's cover. The artwork placed actor Chris O'Dowd prominently in the foreground, with the four female stars appearing in the background and coloured with a blue wash. The decision was described as both sexist and racist, with O'Dowd describing the decision as "ill-judged, insensitive and everything the film wasn't".[33][34][35][36] Anchor Bay expressed regret for any "unintentional upset caused" and said different artwork was being considered for future orders.[37]
