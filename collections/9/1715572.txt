The Japanese market "Bluebird Maxima" received either four-door hardtop sedan or pillared sedan bodywork and a 2.0-liter V6 engine (with an available turbocharger). It received the smaller V6 engine so that it would comply with Japanese Government dimension regulations that tax larger vehicles. The station wagon bodywork was not available in the home market, with the hardtop exclusive to Nissan Bluebird Store Japanese dealerships.
