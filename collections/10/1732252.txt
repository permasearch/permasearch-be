Efron has said that he would "flip out" if he got a "B" and not an "A" in school, as well as that he was a class clown.[11] His father encouraged him to begin acting when Zac was eleven years old.[4] Efron subsequently appeared in theater productions at his high school,[12] worked in the theater The Great American Melodrama and Vaudeville,[6] and began taking singing lessons.[4] He performed in shows such as Gypsy; Peter Pan; or, The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up; Little Shop of Horrors; and The Music Man. He was recommended to an agent in Los Angeles by his drama teacher, Robyn Metchik (the mother of actors Aaron Michael Metchik and Asher Metchik).[13][14] Efron was later signed to the Creative Artists Agency.[15]
