The 2001 film Ghosts of Mars was originally intended to be another Plissken film entitled "Escape From Mars," but when Escape From L.A. did not do well at the box office, the screenplay was rewritten and the character of Desolation Williams took Plissken's place as the lead, played by Ice Cube.[5][better source needed]
