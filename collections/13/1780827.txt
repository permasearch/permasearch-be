The inquiry into the disaster, chaired by Sir Oliver Popplewell and known as the Popplewell Inquiry,[35] led to the introduction of new legislation to improve safety at the UK's football grounds. Among the main outcomes of the inquiry were the banning of new wooden grandstands at all UK sports grounds, the immediate closure of other wooden stands deemed unsafe and the banning of smoking in other wooden stands.
