Credit rating agencies generate revenue from a variety of activities related to the production and distribution of credit ratings.[190] The sources of the revenue are generally the issuer of the securities or the investor. Most agencies operate under one or a combination of business models: the subscription model and the issuer-pays model.[49] However, agencies may offer additional services using a combination of business models.[190][191]
