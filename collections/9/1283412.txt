Juveniles begin to court at a very early age, but may not bond for another two or three years. Aerial acrobatics, demonstrations of intelligence, and ability to provide food are key behaviors of courting. Once paired, they tend to nest together for life, usually in the same location.[59] Instances of non-monogamy have been observed in common ravens, by males visiting a female's nest when her mate is away.[70]
