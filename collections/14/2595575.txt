"Ascension" featured guest appearances from Steve Railsback, Nicholas Lea, Steven Williams and Sheila Larken.[1] David Duchovny provided his own stunts in this episode,[5] including being dangled in the aerial lift, shot in a single day at Grouse Mountain in North Vancouver, British Columbia. The backdrop for Barry's drive was done in a neighbouring mountain, Mount Seymour.[6] The tagline for this episode is "Deny Everything", replacing the usual phrase "The Truth is Out There."[7]
