Modern rodeos in the United States are closely regulated and have responded to accusations of animal cruelty by instituting a number of rules to guide how rodeo animals are to be managed.[2] The PRCA has 60 rules that specifically regulate the proper care and treatment of rodeo livestock; these guidelines must be followed by all rodeo participants in sanctioned rodeos.[3] In 1994, a survey of 28 sanctioned rodeos was conducted by on-site independent veterinarians. Reviewing 33,991 animal runs, the injury rate was documented at 16 animals or 0.047 percent, less than five-hundredths of one percent or one in 2000 animals.[4]
