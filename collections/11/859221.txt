At Saanapu, the tribe had an argument about sleeping arrangements after Kylie decided to sleep in the bed as opposed to outside or next to the fire like she usually did and refused to move. This caused the rest of the tribe, especially Matt and Jennah-Louise, to become infuriated at her and even contemplate voting her off because of it. At Vavau, Conner was angry at Kate for detracting from their alliance to vote Andrew off and tried to ensure that the next target would be Phoebe. Kate gave an emotional reassurance to Conner that her move was not an attempt to save Phoebe and Kristie but purely an action against Andrew to strengthen their tribe, and apologised for not discussing it more with him.
