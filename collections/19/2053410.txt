Ultimately, both defenses failed, and Dippolito was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison.[57] However, the state's Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered a new trial in 2014, finding that the judge at the first trial erred by not doing enough to ensure that jurors weren't improperly exposed to pretrial publicity. The appeals court found that the judge should have questioned the jurors individually, rather than as a group, regarding how much they knew about the case. It also found that the judge should have dismissed the entire jury when one prospective juror revealed she'd read about the poisoning.[58] She was later released on an appeal to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, pending a retrial on May 23, 2016.[59] On August 17, 2016, the appeals court rejected her appeal without comment.[60]
