A 2016 study found no evidence that the low share of women in the U.S. House of Representative was due to gender discrimination by voters.[116] According to the author of the study, "these results suggest that the deficit of female representation in the House is more likely the result of barriers to entering politics as opposed to overt gender discrimination by voters and campaign donors."[116]
