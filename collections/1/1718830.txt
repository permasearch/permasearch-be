The show takes a 25-year leap and focuses on Devi and Adhiraj's daughter Devika, who is alive and looks just like Devi. Maasa asks Devika to pose as Devi and Adhiraj's daughter in order to get Adhiraj's properties, not knowing she is in fact their daughter. In Adhiraj's will, it states that Adhiraj's child has to have been married for at least six months in order to obtain his money and properties.
