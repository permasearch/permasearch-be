However, by 1536 Bryan was working with Thomas Cromwell to bring about his cousin's downfall as queen.[12] It was at this time that Cromwell coined Sir Francis' unfortunate sobriquet in a letter to the Bishop of Winchester, referring to his abandonment of Anne.[3] After Boleyn's death, Bryan became chief Gentleman of the Privy chamber,[13] but was removed from this post in 1539 when Cromwell turned against his former allies.[14] Sir Francis returned to favour following Cromwell's demise, becoming vice-admiral of the fleet, and then Lord Justice of Ireland during the reign of Edward VI. He died suddenly at Clonmel, Ireland in 1550.[1]
