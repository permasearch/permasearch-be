Immediately after Spider-Man 2's release, Ivan Raimi wrote a treatment over two months,[12] with Sam Raimi deciding to use the film to explore Peter learning that he is not a sinless vigilante, and that there also can be humanity in those he considers criminals.[8] Harry Osborn was brought back as Raimi wanted to conclude his storyline.[8] Raimi felt that Harry would not follow his father's legacy, but be instead "somewhere between."[13] Sandman was introduced as an antagonist, as Raimi found him a visually fascinating character.[8] While Sandman is a petty criminal in the comics, the screenwriters created a background of the character being Uncle Ben's killer to increase Peter's guilt over his death[14] and challenge his simplistic perception of the event.[8] Overall, Raimi described the film as being about Peter, Mary Jane, Harry, and the Sandman,[15] with Peter's journey being one of forgiveness.[16]
