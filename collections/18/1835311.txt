John Wesley Hardin is depicted as an outspoken drunk, always hanging out in the Crow Town bar. In actuality, he was arrested for his crimes in 1877, approximately twenty years before the series' setting, and served a 27-year sentence until 1894. After his release, he moved to El Paso, Texas where he was shot and killed the following year by John Selman.
