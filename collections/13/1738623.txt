The 10-episode season began with 30 young male vocalists competing to become a member of the new five-piece boy band. Each week, the boys would rotate into different groups and perform, at the end, the "architects" would put either two or three boys up for elimination and through live voting, a boy would be saved by America. At the end of the season, the final five remaining boys would form the boy band and receive a recording contract with Hollywood Records[2] After a 24-hour voting period the week before, it was announced at the final live show on August 24, 2017 that Tutton, Perez, Ramos, Calderon, and Conor were the winning members and formed In Real Life. There, they premiered their debut single, "Eyes Closed". In Real Life performed live on Total Request Live in November 2017,[3] Good Morning America in December 2017,[4] on Live with Kelly and Ryan and Jimmy Kimmel Live in February 2018,[5] and performed "How Badly" on Despierta Am√©rica in April 2018. In 2018, the band released the singles "Tattoo (How 'Bout You)" and "How Badly".
