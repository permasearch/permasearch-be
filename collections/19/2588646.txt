The Fellowship then passed under the mountains through the caverns of Moria, where Gandalf was lost, and Aragorn became their new guide. At the borders of the Elven realm of Lothlórien, Boromir was unnerved by the thought of entering—he pleaded with Aragorn to find another way "though it led through a hedge of swords", citing stories of elvish witchcraft, and the "strange paths" they had been taking which had already caused them to lose Gandalf.  Once in Lórien, Boromir was greatly disturbed by the Elven Lady Galadriel's testing of his mind; he told Aragorn "not to be too sure of this lady and her purposes." On parting, Galadriel gave Boromir a golden belt and an Elven-cloak.
