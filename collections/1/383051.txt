Breeds developed due to a need for "form to function", the necessity to develop certain characteristics in order to perform a particular type of work.[167] Thus, a powerful but refined breed such as the Andalusian developed as riding horses with an aptitude for dressage.[167] Heavy draft horses developed out of a need to perform demanding farm work and pull heavy wagons.[168] Other horse breeds developed specifically for light agricultural work, carriage and road work, various sport disciplines, or simply as pets.[169] Some breeds developed through centuries of crossing other breeds, while others descended from a single foundation sire, or other limited or restricted foundation bloodstock. One of the earliest formal registries was General Stud Book for Thoroughbreds, which began in 1791 and traced back to the foundation bloodstock for the breed.[170] There are more than 300Â horse breeds in the world today.[171]
