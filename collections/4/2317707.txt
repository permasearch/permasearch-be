A fourth batch appeared in stores in late December 2010, removing the limited edition logo from the packaging. At the same time, Sierra Mist, a drink that debuted in 1999 and had always been made with high fructose corn syrup, also had a sugar-based formula released under the name "Sierra Mist Natural", which was called Sierra Mist (with real sugar) from 2013 to 2016, when it was replaced with Mist Twst. Sierra Mist (with real sugar) has since replaced the HFCS-based Sierra Mist as the primary Sierra Mist formula.
