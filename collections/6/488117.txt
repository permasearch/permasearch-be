In seasons 5 and 6, Cam experiences frequent trouble with Michelle over such teenage issues as Michelle's new boyfriend, smoking, and school. When Michelle decides to go to a small state school to be with her boyfriend, Cam reluctantly agrees but secretly fills out an application in Michelle's name for a more prestigious university, much to the disapproval of her colleagues. When Michelle's relationship with her boyfriend falls apart, Cam reveals that she had successfully, but dishonestly, gotten Michelle into the better school. To her credit, Michelle interprets this as a test of her own honesty, and decides to spend a year working and applying for the next academic year.
