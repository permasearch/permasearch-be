To keep their new Airborne Interception radar technology secret, the British Ministry launched a propaganda campaign to attribute the new successes of their now AI-equipped night fighter aces not to technology, but instead to an excessive diet of carrots.[9]  The misinformation pointed to the Vitamin A in carrots, which is used by the eye's photorecetpor cells.  While it is true that nutritional deficiencies of Vitamin A affect night vision[10], this misinformation may have propagated the worldwide myth that carrots let people see better in the dark.
