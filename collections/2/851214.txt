Sirius XM Weather & Emergency was a free satellite radio channel dedicated to providing critical, updated information before, during and after natural disasters, weather emergencies and other hazardous incidents as well as AMBER Alerts to listeners across North America. The channel was also affiliated with The Weather Channel. It was normally a low bitrate channel, but bitrate was raised in case of widespread emergencies. The channel number, 247 on XM, is a reference to the term 24/7, the old name of the channel XM Emergency Alert.
