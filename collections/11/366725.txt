At the rehearsal dinner, Anna's bandmates come to try to convince "Anna" to sneak off to the audition, but they are caught by security. Ryan surprises Tess and Anna by giving "Anna" permission to go. He explains that he just wants the kids to accept him, and he urges "Tess" to go support the band, finally winning her over. Since Tess can't play, Anna unplugs her guitar, and plays while Tess mimes along and enjoys doing so. Jake is in the audience, and he realizes that Anna is the one for him. Tess also realizes how fun music is, and promises to treat Anna's band with more respect. Back at the rehearsal dinner, Tess tells Anna to ask Ryan to postpone the wedding, so that Anna will not have to go through marrying him in Tess's body. Instead, she proposes a toast where she finally accepts him because of how happy he makes Tess. This is the final act of selfless love needed to break the spell, and another earthquake has them switch back to their own selves. On the wedding day, Tess and Ryan marry, and she and Anna finally make up after such long conflict by saying "I love you" to each other. Also, Anna and Jake start dating with Tess's approval. Anna's band also plays at the reception. Pei-Pei's mother attempts to give Harry and Grandpa Alan the body switching fortune cookies when they argue, but her daughter confiscates them in the nick of time (by tackling them to the ground).
