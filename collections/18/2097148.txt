Freestyle Motocross (FMX), a relatively new variation of supercross, started out by the South African champion, Marco Urzi, does not involve racing and instead it concentrates on performing acrobatic stunts while jumping motocross bikes. The winner is chosen by a group of judges. The riders are scored on style, level of trick difficulty, best use of the course, and, frequently, crowd reactions. FMX was introduced to the XÂ Games and mainstream audiences in 1999.
