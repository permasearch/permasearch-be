Locking a pagefile size can be problematic if a Windows application requests more memory than the total size of physical memory and the pagefile, leading to failed requests to allocate memory that may cause applications and system processes to fail. Also, the pagefile is rarely read or written in sequential order, so the performance advantage of having a completely sequential page file is minimal. However, a large pagefile generally allows use of memory-heavy applications, with no penalties beside using more disk space. While a fragmented pagefile may not be an issue by itself, fragmentation of a variable size page file will over time create a number of fragmented blocks on the drive, causing other files to become fragmented. For this reason, a fixed-size contiguous pagefile is better, providing that the size allocated is large enough to accommodate the needs of all applications.
