There are two basic three-phase configurations: wye (Y) and delta (Î”). As shown in the diagram, a delta configuration requires only 3 wires for transmission but a wye (star) configuration may have a fourth wire. The fourth wire, if present, is provided as a neutral and is normally grounded. The "3-wire" and "4-wire" designations do not count the ground wire used above many transmission lines, which is solely for fault protection and does not carry current under non-fault conditions.
