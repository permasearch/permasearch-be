Initially, Leandro Locsin designed the church for the Ossorio family, who were planning to build a chapel in Negros. Unfortunately, the plans for the chapel were scrapped when Frederic Ossorio, the head of the family, left for the United States. However, in 1955, Father Delaney commissioned Locsin to design a chapel that was open and could easily accommodate 1,000 people. The Church of Holy Sacrifice became the first circular chapel with the altar in its center in the country, and the first to have a thin shell concrete dome. This was his first major architectural commission.
