Patricia's direct effects in Texas were limited to southern areas of the state. Moisture associated with the hurricane streamed ahead of its circulation and interacted with a frontal boundary over the region.[66] Antecedent rains saturated the region and produced severe flooding, with cars flooded and a train derailed.[67] Fears arose that the collective effects of these storms would produce deadly floods, similar to those in May earlier in the year; however, no deaths resulted.[68] Houston received 9.38 in (238 mm) of rain during a 24-hour span from October 24–25,[69] and a brief tornado caused minor damage near the city.[70] Rain fell at rates of 1 to 2 in (25 to 51 mm) per hour in southern Hidalgo County, leading to damaging flash floods. An estimated 10 to 12 in (250 to 300 mm), or more, accumulated across the Progreso–Weslaco area. Several feet of water rendered roads impassible, stranded cars, and affected more than 500 homes. Twenty-six water rescues were conducted in the area. Damage was estimated at $50 million.[71] Several roads in and around Corpus Christi were inundated,[72] including part of Interstate 37.[73] Two hours of "blinding rains" flooded the majority of eastern Willacy County, prompting multiple water rescues, and leaving $2.5 million in damage.[74] Remnant moisture then moved north and northwest through the Great Lakes, Appalachia and Mid-Atlantic states, and Florida Pandhandle before exiting the nation.[75][76]
