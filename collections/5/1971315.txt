Sheldon meets the middle-aged Dr. Lorvis who tracked down a flirty pharmaceutical sales rep, Penny. Leonard explains to him that Penny is his fiancÃ©e, so he walks away looking sad. Sheldon invites him inside for a hot beverage. He is a celebrity urinary specialist with a huge memorabilia collection which he invites the men to see. After Sheldon teases that the Penny-Leonard relationship is doomed to fail, Dr. Lorvis locks them in his basement to go after Penny again. He falls for Amy and then Bernadette. Penny explains to him that he is acting creepy, and cannot chase every woman that is nice to him. The women march him back to let the men out, who are too busy playing Donkey Kong to notice. Earlier Bernadette tells the girls that she has been picked as one of the fifty most beautiful scientists for an article in a magazine. The magazine cancels the article because Amy wrote an email of complaint about the article since they would not have written about handsome male scientists and are objectifying women. Bernadette claims Amy is jealous because she cannot express her sexuality. Bernadette returns to apologize when she gets hit on by Dr. Lorvis.
