Argentina had diplomatic conflicts with Brazil and Chile in the 1880s. In this context, the writer and diplomat Vicente Quesada coined the concept of a "Great Argentina", a country encompassing all the territories of the former viceroyalty, which would likely have failed because of British and Brazilian plans to have the territory break into smaller sovereign states, the mistakes of the Argentine diplomacy and the perspectives of the Unitarian party, that preferred a smaller country centered around Buenos Aires. The idea was soon taken by other historians, school textbooks, historical atlas, essays, etc. The purpose of reconstructing the broken country was pointed as a highly desirable goal, but without considering military expansionism as an acceptable option; only a political union achieved by diplomatic means. It was also used to promote Argentine patriotism during the Great European immigration wave to Argentina.[2]
