"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough" and "Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)" were to be used as an interlude segment for the backup dancers to show off their moves, with Jackson appearing at the end. "Dirty Diana" was to feature a female dancer who would use acrobatic feats to lure Jackson onto a bed, before tying him to it. The bed would then be covered in silk flames, giving Jackson cover to slip backstage and change for "Beat It". "We Are the World" and "Heal the World" were to be performed as a medley.
