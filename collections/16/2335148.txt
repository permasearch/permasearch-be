SQL Server Compact shares a common API with the other Microsoft SQL Server editions.[4] It also includes ADO.NET providers for data access using ADO.NET APIs, and built-in synchronization capabilities,[2] as well as support for LINQ and Entity Framework. Future releases will unify the synchronization capabilities with Microsoft Synchronization Services.[5] Unlike other editions of Microsoft SQL Server, SQL CE runs in-process[5] with the application which is hosting it. It has a disk footprint of less than 2 MB and a memory footprint of approximately 5 MB.[2] SQL CE is optimized for an architecture where all applications share the same memory pool.[6] Windows Store apps for Windows 8 cannot use SQL Server Compact edition, or any other edition of SQL Server.[7]
