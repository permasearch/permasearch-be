The 1997 Rowan Atkinson film Bean features the painting as a plot element. An American is buying the painting in order to return it to the United States. But Bean ruins the painting by using lacquer thinner after sneezing on it and then drawing a cartoon face on it. He surreptitiously replaces the painting with a poster from the museum shop.[18]
