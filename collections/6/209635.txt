Although the organization's mission had originally been focused on Europe, in July 1948 CARE opened its first non-European mission, in Japan.[4] Deliveries to China and Korea followed, which CARE described as aid to areas "implicated by WWII".[10]:p.119 In 1949 CARE entered the developing world for the first time, launching programs in the Philippines. Projects in India, Pakistan, and Mexico began soon after.[6] 1949 also marked CARE's first expansion into non-food aid with the development of "self-help" packages containing tools for farming, carpentry, and other trades.[4] In 1953, because of its expansion to projects outside Europe, CARE changed the meaning of its acronym to "Cooperative for American Remittances to Everywhere".[4]
