Although narrowly defeated in the vote to be acquired by Pabst, McGimsey and fellow members of Pearlâ€™s board still pushed for change in the company.  The predominant theme throughout was growth.  The acquisition of Pearl by a larger company was no longer considered, but then how could the company really grow and hope to compete with industry leaders such as Anheuser-Busch, Miller, and Pabst?  Pearl considered expanding the San Antonio brewery to increase production, but after researching the idea, Pearl realized expanding the brewery could only gain them a nominal production increase and ultimately would not be worth the overall investment.
