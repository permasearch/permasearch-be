Red-highlighted genes are frequently reduced or silenced by epigenetic mechanisms in various cancers.  When these genes have low or absent expression, DNA damages can accumulate.  Replication errors past these damages (see translesion synthesis) can lead to increased mutations and, ultimately, cancer. Epigenetic repression of DNA repair genes in accurate DNA repair pathways appear to be central to carcinogenesis.
