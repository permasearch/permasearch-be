The pictorial satire of William Hogarth is a precursor to the development of political cartoons in 18th-century England.[90] The medium developed under the direction of its greatest exponent, James Gillray from London.[91] With his satirical works calling the king (George III), prime ministers and generals (especially Napoleon) to account, Gillray's wit and keen sense of the ridiculous made him the pre-eminent cartoonist of the era.[91]
