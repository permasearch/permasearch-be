In 1982 Russell Kyle of Glasgow's Evening Times described Our Tune as "dial-a-depression".[12] But although some bemoaned the feature's mawkish nature, Our Tune helped to establish Simon Bates as a household name in the United Kingdom.[9] A spin-off album featuring songs chosen by listeners was released in 2006,[9][13] while to celebrate ten years of Our Tune, in 1990 Arrow Books published a paperback of Our Tune stories co-authored by Simon Bates.[6][14] The feature disappeared from Radio 1 after Bates resigned from the network in 1993.[15]
