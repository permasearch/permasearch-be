Bedrooms — There are ten second-floor rooms in addition to servants' quarters in the back of the first floor. The two most often depicted were David Collins' room, and Victoria Winters' (David's governess') room. Both rooms were in the same hallway, with a door that led to the west wing (normally kept locked).
