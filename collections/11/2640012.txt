A gold IRA or precious metals IRA is an Individual Retirement Account in which physical gold or other approved precious metals are held in custody for the benefit of the IRA account owner. It functions the same as a regular IRA, only instead of holding paper assets, it holds physical bullion coins or bars. Precious metals IRAs are usually self-directed IRAs, a type of IRA where the custodian allows more diverse investments to be held in the account. Gold self-directed IRAs can include other types of retirement accounts such as, Roth IRAs, SEP IRA, SIMPLE IRA, HSA, Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), and 401(k)s.
