Thailand is trying to implement teaching in the Malay language in one school in each state but with the Thai alphabet. There is no contradiction in the policy of education in Thailand to allow the use of Jawi scripture as foreign language education in Thailand allows for English and French to be taught using the Latin alphabet, while the Japanese and Chinese languages are taught using their own letters. None of the above-mentioned languages (except Jawi) is taught using the Thai script.
