Lt. Ed Tucker (Robert John Burke), representing 1 Police Plaza, asks Benson to take the Lieutenant's exam in order to officially take command of SVU before the NYPD appoints another officer to the position.[36] She passes the Lieutenant's exam with flying colors, and is officially promoted to Lieutenant after some politicking by her boss, Deputy Chief William Dodds (Peter Gallagher). Benson had wanted Fin as her second-in-command, but Chief Dodds arranges for the politically unsavvy Benson to be assigned a Sergeant who does know how to play the game â€“ his own son, Mike (Andy Karl).[37]
