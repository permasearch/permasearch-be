In 2001, DaimlerChrysler commissioned development of a TJ successor under the "JK" program code for the third generation Jeep Wrangler. Design work began almost immediately in 2001, with Mark Moushegian winning an internal design competition against Dan Zimmerman (later responsible for 2005 Jeep Hurricane Concept) by the second quarter of 2003. In January 2004, the JK design was frozen at 31 months ahead of production and work began on a conceptual preview.
