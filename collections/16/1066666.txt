The Medallion is an amulet that is owned by a cloaked creature called a Wraith. In Storybrooke, Mr. Gold seeks vengeance against Regina for abducting Belle and telling him she had died. Despite swearing on Belle's request that he would not kill Regina, he brands her with the medallion, marking her for death and summonning the wraith to hunt down his prey. The wraith is almost successful in taking Regina's soul, but is interrupted by Emma, Mary Margaret and David who send it through a portal using Jefferson's hat. However, Emma and Mary Margaret are also taken with it.[26]
