Wild was born into a working class family in a small town in Lancashire (now Greater Manchester), called Royton, near Oldham. Wild moved to Hounslow, in Middlesex, with his parents and his older brother Arthur in 1960 at the age of eight, where he got a job helping the milkman, which paid about five shillings.
