The schema congruity theory suggests that the storage of new information and retrieval of memory is majorly influenced by past expectations.[9] Schemas are a human's personal cognitive representations of the environment that guide their perceptions, thoughts and actions.[9] Schemas go through constant change as a human experiences and learns new information. Nonetheless, the new information is firstly evaluated on the basis of existing schemas. Relating the theory to consumer evaluation of products, a consumer already possesses pre-existing schemas from past experiences with certain brands and therefore new products are evaluated based on the existing schema the consumer has with the certain brand. This theory is quite similar to the categorisation theory; however, the schema congruity theory places emphasis on the consumer's past experiences with the brand which is influenced by the surrounding environment.
