Teams wore green-colored caps and jerseys, undershirts and socks May 27, May 28 and May 29, Memorial Day in the United States. The Blue Jays didn't wear them on May 27 and 28, but did May 29, even though Memorial Day is not a holiday in Toronto, the province of Ontario, or anywhere in Canada. The Rockies wore them again on July 9, which was Military Appreciation Day.
