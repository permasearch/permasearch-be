Entering 2010, the Tigers parted ways with Curtis Granderson and Edwin Jackson as part of a three-way trade with the New York Yankees and Arizona Diamondbacks; in return they picked up outfield prospect Austin Jackson and pitchers Phil Coke, Max Scherzer and Daniel Schlereth. Key losses included Plácido Polanco, Fernando Rodney and Brandon Lyon, who all left via free agency. Key signings included a five-year contract extension for ace Justin Verlander, and the acquisitions of All-Star closer José Valverde and two-time World Series champion Johnny Damon. Austin Jackson made the Tigers opening day roster, and was American League Rookie of the Month for April.[25] 2010 also saw the debut of Brennan Boesch, who was named the AL Rookie of the Month for May and June.[26][27]
