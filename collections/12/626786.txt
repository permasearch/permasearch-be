In "Remember When," Paulie and Tony leave for Miami to lie low while the FBI investigate the old case of Tony's first murder victim, Willie Overall. On the trip and in Miami, Paulie begins to reminisce about the old days, at which point he brings up Pussy Bonpensiero and Ralph Cifaretto and how they all four went out to dinner the night Tony whacked Willie. Tony begins to grow somewhat suspicious of Paulie's idiosyncrasies and inclination to divulge information to other people, and Tony questions him several times about the joke Ralph made about Ginny Sacrimoni's weight. Eventually, Overall's murder is blamed on the deceased Jackie Aprile, Sr., so Tony takes Paulie on a fishing trip to celebrate. Paulie has serious misgivings about going to sea with Tony due to the boat trip that was used to lure Pussy to his death. On the boat, Paulie continues to deny informing Johnny Sack of Ralph's joke about his wife. While Tony seriously considers murdering Paulie, he ultimately decides to spare his life. Seemingly out of "gratitude", Paulie sends Carmela a $2,000 espresso machine to replace her broken one. The overly expensive gift from Paulie causes Carmela to exclaim "what is wrong with that man," but Tony defends him, saying it was people like Paulie who allow Tony and Carmela to live the way they do.
