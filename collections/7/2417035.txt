The Canadian side of Lake Erie has 480 producing gas wells in the lake.  Gas production in Canadian Lake Erie waters dates back to 1913; more than 2000 wells have been drilled to the Clinton Sand, up to a few miles from the US side of the lake; the same formation produces gas from many onshore wells on the US side, but there are no wells in the US portion of the lake.[22]  The province of Ontario, where the offshore wells are located, allows gas wells, but not oil wells, in offshore Lake Erie.[23][24][25]  Ontario allows oil production from below the lake only from wells drilled directionally from onshore surface locations; a number of such directional wells are producing oil from beneath Lake Erie in the Goldsmith/Lakeshore Field.[26]
