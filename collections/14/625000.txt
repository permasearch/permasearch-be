The five-door "Sportback" model was introduced in June 2004. The A3 Sportback is 80 mm (3 in) longer than the base three-door body, and includes improved rear cabin space and a larger luggage compartment (370 litres). It also received the new "single frame" front grille originally introduced in the A8 W12, which was later adopted across the whole A3 range.
