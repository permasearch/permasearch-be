When London comes back from Peru, she brings back a lot of artifacts, including an ancient necklace and a mummy, which Esteban says is cursed. Zack and Cody want to see the mummy, so they sneak into the suite to see it, but accidentally push it out of the window. As a result, Zack disguises Cody as the mummy until Zack can get the real one. However, Maddie and Esteban feel the mummy should go back where it came from, so they dress up one of Maddie's old dolls to look like the mummy and switch with the one on display (which is really Cody). Eventually, they all find out the original mummy is a fake.
