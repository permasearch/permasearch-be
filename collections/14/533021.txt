The underground pedestrian mall and ramp system, connecting the three blocks between 48th and 51st streets, was finished in early May.[367] At the time of the mall's opening, 22 of the 25 retail spaces had been leased,[341] and three more buildings were ready for occupancy that month.[367] The underground concourse contained a post office, payphones, and several public restrooms.[368] The complex was starting to attract large crowds of visitors, especially to Radio City Music Hall or one of the other exhibition and performance spaces.[369] Despite this seeming success in the face of the Depression, construction was considered to be behind schedule: all the buildings had originally been set for completion by mid-1935, yet the central parts of the northern and southern blocks were still undeveloped.[341]
