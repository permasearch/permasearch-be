The Avalanche vehicles were fitted exclusively with the 5.7-litre LS1 V8 engine rated at 270 kilowatts (360 hp) of power and 475 newton metres (350 lb⋅ft) of torque, mated to a four-speed 4L65-E automatic gearbox. Permanent all-wheel drive was calibrated to deliver 62 percent of the power to the rear wheels, thereby maintaining a rear wheel drive feel to the handling of these vehicles.
