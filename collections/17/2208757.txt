On Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Ives was asked a question about reducing gun violence. "The problem is the gun violence in this city of Chicago, predominantly," Ives said at a public candidate forum. "And you know how you're going to solve it? Fathers in the home." The Ives campaign later doubled down on the comment, explaining in a statement released to the media that "many have advocated the same idea, including President Obama." In a blog post, the Better Government Association wrote that PolitiFact technically ruled her claim false, but also wrote that Ives was quoting Obama's 2008 Father's Day speech, quoting, "We know the statistics â€” that children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of schools and 20 times more likely to end up in prison." The blog post also wrote, "In his 2008 speech, Obama drew a link between children from fatherless homes and those who stray into crime."[63]
