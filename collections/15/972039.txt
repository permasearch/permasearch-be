In the 1840s fossils of brachiopods and trilobites from the Silurian period were discovered at Woolshed Creek near Duntroon. At the time, these were the oldest fossils discovered in Australia, though this record has now been far surpassed.[12] Other specific geological places of interest include the State Circle cutting and the Deakin anticline.[13][14]
