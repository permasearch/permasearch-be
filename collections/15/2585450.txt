The original MacBook, available in black or white colors, was released on June 28, 2006, and used the Intel Core Duo processor and 945GM chipset, with Intel's GMA 950 integrated graphics on a 667 MHz front side bus. Later revisions of the MacBook moved to the Core 2 Duo processor and the GM965 chipset, with Intel's GMA X3100 integrated graphics on an 800 MHz system bus.[9] Sales of the black polycarbonate MacBook ceased in October 2008, after the introduction of the aluminum MacBook.
