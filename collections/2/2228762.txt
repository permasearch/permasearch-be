Bacteriophages were first discovered by the English scientist Frederick Twort in 1915 and Félix d'Hérelle in 1917. In the late 1930s, T.L. Rakieten proposed either a mixture of raw sewerage or a lysate from E.coli infected with raw sewerage to the two researchers Milislav Demerac and Ugo Fano. These two researchers isolated T3, T4, T5, and T6 from E.coli. Also, in 1932, the researcher J.Bronfenbrenner had studied and worked on the T2 phage, at which the T2 phage was isolated from the virus.[3] This isolation was made from a fecal material rather than from sewerage. At any rate, Delbruck was involved in the discovery of the T even phages. His part was naming the bacteriophages into Type 1(T1), Type 2 (T2), Type 3 (T3), etc.
