National Day (Arabic: اليوم الوطني‎; Al Yawm Al Watani") is celebrated on 2 December each year in the United Arab Emirates.[1] It marks the UAE's Union Day between the seven emirates which was followed by the joining of the seventh emirate, Ras Al Khaimah, in 1972. The National day of UAE does not stand for the nationalisation from the British Protectorate Treaties which declared in 1968, it is the anniversary of the federal unification of the seven emirates in 1971 which combined to form the modern-day country, headed by Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the federation's first president. Grand celebrations are held across the country to mark the event.
