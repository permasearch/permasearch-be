Due to the high temperatures involved in smelting itself, oxygen in the air may dissolve into the molten iron while it is being poured.  Slag, a byproduct left over after the smelting process, is used to further absorb impurities such as sulfur or oxides and protect steel from further oxidation. However, it can still be responsible for some oxidation.
