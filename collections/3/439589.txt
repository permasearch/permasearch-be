King Features Syndicate distributed a newspaper strip of the Lone Ranger from September 1938 to December 1971. Fran Striker himself initially scripted the feature, but time constraints soon required him to quit, replaced by Bob Green, later followed by Paul S. Newman and others.[45] The original artist was Ed Kressy, but he was replaced in 1939 by Charles FlandersÂ (fr) who drew the strip until its conclusion.[46]
