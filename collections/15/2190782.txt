Lennon was later quoted as saying that "I should have tried to get my original idea, the monks singing. I realise now that's what I wanted."[42] The Beatles experimented further with tape loops. Later examples include "Carnival of Light", an unreleased piece recorded during the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band sessions;[43] the Sgt. Pepper track "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!"; and "Revolution 9", released on The Beatles.[44] Take one of "Tomorrow Never Knows" was included on the Anthology 2 compilation in 1996.[42]
