In 1998, Diaz starred in There's Something About Mary, as the titular role of a woman living in Miami having several men vying for her affections. SPLICEDwire found Diaz to be "in a tough spot as Mary [but] strikes an amazingly nimble balance between her character's endearing preciousness and the movie's twisted humor",[36] and Austin Chronicle remarked: "As the Mary at the center of it all, Diaz certainly exudes that irresistible “something” expressed in the title. In films such as My Best Friend's Wedding and A Life Less Ordinary, Diaz has shown herself to be a good comic sport who is game for just about anything. Here, it's no stretch to understand why, at the end of the movie, some half-dozen suitors have converged in her living room to throw themselves at her feet".[37] The sleeper hit was the highest-grossing comedy of 1998 in North America as well as the fourth-highest-grossing film of the year; it made US$176 million in the US and US$369 million worldwide.[38] She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in the category of Best Actress – Musical or Comedy.[6] Diaz also starred in the critically panned comedy Very Bad Things (1998).
