While Jack is away on a family reunion in Colorado, Milton (with help from Julie) and Jerry (with help from Eddie) run for class president against each other and Frank of the Black Dragons. Meanwhile, Rudy asks Kim to help him direct the community play of Romeo and Juliet featuring Bobby Wasabi and Joan (whom Rudy was forced to hire by Bobby after she and Bobby discuss about a Peacock parked on the loading bay). In the end the Black Dragons and Wasabi Warriors (Sans Jack) battle during the play, making the critic (an elderly man who bad mouthed his own daughter's ballet recital) extremely pleased.
