On 30 July 1996, for a world transfer record-breaking £15 million (equivalent to £25 million today) Shearer joined his hometown club and league runners-up Newcastle United, managed by his hero Keegan.[6][30][31] Shearer made his league debut away at Everton, on 17 August 1996,[32] and maintained his form during the rest of the season, finishing as Premier League top-scorer for the third consecutive season with 25 goals in 31 Premier League games,[25][33][34] as well as winning another PFA Player of the Year accolade,[23] despite a groin injury forcing him to miss seven matches. Perhaps his best performance of the season came on 2 February 1997,[35] when Newcastle went into the final 15 minutes of the game 3–1 down at home to Leicester City in the league, only for Shearer to win them the game 4–3 by scoring a late hat-trick.[36]
