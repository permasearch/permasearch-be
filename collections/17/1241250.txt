In response to the criticism of social media driving eating disorders, platforms such as Instagram, have banned the use of ‘thinspiration’ and ‘thinspo’ related hashtags. Other solutions include transformation photos, and the promotion of  hashtags such as #SelfLove and #BodyPositivity[67]. Transformation photos are side-by-side images displaying an individual’s fitness or weight-loss progress. Although, it aims to “serve as inspiration for people looking to change themselves physically or live healthier lives”[67], some users have utilised this technique to showcase the level of deceptiveness within social media. Likewise, in an effort to actively help those suffering from eating disorders, Eating Disorder Hope launched the Pro-Recovery Movement. The project involved hosting of live Twitter chat encouraging sufferers to celebrate self-love and a positive body image, through recovery subject matters[68]. Other organizations such as ProjectHEAL, introduced a campaign called #WhatMakesMeBeautiful[69], with the aim of celebrating different talents, personalities, and other non-appearance related attributes that also make one beautiful[68]. This movement was especially successful among the eating disorder community; hence, emphasising the “need for social media movements that celebrate self-love and looking at beauty through a different lens”[68].
