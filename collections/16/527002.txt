Historically, the UFC has also aired preliminary fights prior to the main fight cards, either on television via Spike, FX, and Fuel TV, or online via Facebook and YouTube. Beginning in August 2013, starting with UFC Fight Night: Shogun vs. Sonnen, the UFC began airing non-PPV events on either Fox Sports 1 or Fox Sports 2.[3] In January 2014, as part of the organization's global expansion, the UFC began airing various international events exclusively on their subscription-based digital network, UFC Fight Pass.[4]
