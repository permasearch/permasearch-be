Veterinary understanding of skunks is rather limited, since scientists have not conducted as much research on skunks as they have on more common pets. Skunks do not always respond to medicines the same way as cats or dogs. As a result, there is considerable disagreement about how best to treat them. Some veterinarians say they are related to hamsters and treat them as such. However, hamsters are from the Rodent order while Skunks are in the family Mephitidae of the order Carnivora. This is the same order as cats, dogs, and ferrets.
