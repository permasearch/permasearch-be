Some of the most important responsibilities of the Secretary of State involve registry of businesses and corporations, monitoring banks, and other commercial activities. However, unlike many other U.S. Secretaries of State, the Delaware Secretary of State is not in charge of administering elections in Delaware. The Delaware Department of Elections is a separate agency from the Department of State.
