The Jeopardy! staff used different means to notify Watson and the human players when to buzz,[27] which was critical in many rounds.[26] The humans were notified by a light, which took them tenths of a second to perceive.[29][30] Watson was notified by an electronic signal and could activate the buzzer within about eight milliseconds.[31] The humans tried to compensate for the perception delay by anticipating the light,[32] but the variation in the anticipation time was generally too great to fall within Watson's response time.[26] Watson did not attempt to anticipate the notification signal.[30][32]
