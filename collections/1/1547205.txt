More recently, several theoretical frameworks have been suggested in immunology, including "autopoietic" views,[147] "cognitive immune" views,[148] the "danger model" (or "danger theory"),[143] and the "discontinuity" theory.[149][150][151] The danger model, suggested by Polly Matzinger and colleagues, has been very influential, arousing many comments and discussions.[152][153][154][155]
