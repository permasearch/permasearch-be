Imagine four separate objects in the space above a planet, positioned in a diamond formation. The four objects follow the lines of the gravitoelectric field,[6] directed towards the celestial body's centre. In accordance with the inverse-square law, the lowest of the four objects experiences the biggest gravitational acceleration, so that the whole formation becomes stretched into a line.
