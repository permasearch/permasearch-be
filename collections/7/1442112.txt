Boyce is the son of Noreen Boyce (nÃ©e Hollenbeck) and former McDonnell Douglas Aircraft Corporation, Director of Security, Charles Eugene Boyce. He, along with three brothers and five sisters, were raised in the affluent community of Rancho Palos Verdes located in Southern California. In 1974 Boyce was hired at TRW, a Southern California aerospace firm in Redondo Beach, California. Due to his father's prestigious position at McDonnell Douglas, Boyce was able to obtain employment. Within months, Boyce was promoted to a highly sensitive position in TRW's "Black Vault" (classified communications center) with a top secret security clearance, where he worked with National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) transmissions.[1]
