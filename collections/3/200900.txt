After 10 years of living in peace and safety, Caesar still reigns strongly over the apes. Now middle-aged and raising a teenage son, Caesar leads his apes on a hunting expedition. He attempts to teach his son, Blue Eyes how to hunt without getting hurt but this doesn't go to plan. Blue Eyes, who continuously ignores his father's orders, wanders off and is attacked by a bear. Caesar, seeing his son in trouble rushes to help him but he too struggles with the bear. He calls for his friend Koba who spears the bear in the back, between the shoulder blades, killing it. Caesar emerges from under the bear's corpse and attempts to check Blue Eyes' injuries only to be brushed off.
