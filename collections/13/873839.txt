In 2005, St. George was ranked the second fastest-growing metropolitan area in the United States, beat only by Greeley, Colorado. This trend continued through 2010, when growth slowed substantially due to the economic recession. Growth has since rebounded and St. George was declared the fifth fastest-growing metropolitan area in the United States in 2015.[2][3]
