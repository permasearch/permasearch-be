The southern end of the island was virtually unused by settlers and visitors until the 19 century when the army installed a gun mount on the southern end during the Spanishâ€“American War that looked over St. Andrews sound toward Little Cumberland. Homes and motels were built by the Jekyll Island Authority along the northern beaches of the island for use by whites, as Georgia had segregated facilities. Segregated facilities in the southern area were used chiefly by African Americans until after 1964, when the federal Civil Rights Act ended legal racial segregation. The multiple parallel dunes on the southernmost tip are a result of sand from the eroding north beaches traveling southward and being deposited in a recurved spit.[3]
