Art was often used as propaganda in Europe, often to point out political scandals but also to spread patriotism in times of need.[citation needed] More specifically, caricature was often used to satirize these events and people and bring attention to the artists' perspectives.[citation needed] Although censorship laws changed based on the stability of the monarchy and their opinions of the citizens, Britain was one of the European countries with the least amount of censorship in this area. During the French Revolution, Britain was in fact the only country where such propaganda was free and legal. The most famous British caricaturists at the time included Isaac Cruikshank, James Gillray, and Thomas Rowlandson. Although all three caricaturists had different perspectives and opinions, they were the frontrunners in the push towards patriotism of the United Kingdom when the UK faced attack from Napoleon.[68]
