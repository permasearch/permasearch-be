Traditionally, Hinduism identifies three m캐rga (ways)[65][note 7] of spiritual practice,[66] namely J침캐na, the way of knowledge; Bhakti, the way of devotion; and Karma yoga, the way of selfless action. In the 19th century Vivekananda, in his neo-Vedanta synthesis of Hinduism, added R캐ja yoga, the way of contemplation and meditation, as a fourth way, calling all of them "yoga."[67][note 8]
