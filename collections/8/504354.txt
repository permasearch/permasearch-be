In association football knock-out competitions or competition stages, teams play an extra 30 minutes, called extra time, when the deciding leg (or replay of a tie) has not produced a winner by the end of regulation or full-time. It follows a short break where players remain on or around the field of play and comprises two straight 15-minute periods, with teams changing ends in between. Although Laws of the Game states that extra time is one of the approved methods on deciding winner, competitions are not bound to adopting extra time, and each competition are free to choose any one or more methods designated in Laws of the Game on deciding winner.
