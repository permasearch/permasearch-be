In Hungary, dubbing is almost universally common. Almost every foreign movie or TV show released in Hungary is dubbed into Hungarian.[17] The history of dubbing dates back to the 1950s, when the country was still under communist rule.[18] One of the most iconic Hungarian dubs was of the American cartoon The Flintstones, with a local translation by József Romhányi.[19] The Internetes Szinkron Adatbázis (ISzDB) is the largest Hungarian database for film dubs, with information for many live action and animated films.[20] On page 59 of the Eurobarometer, 84% of Hungarians said that they prefer dubbing over subtitles.[12]
