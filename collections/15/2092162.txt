Following the Salon d'Automne of 1905 which marked the beginning of Fauvism, the Salon des Indépendants of 1906 marked the first time all the Fauves would exhibit together. The centerpiece of the exhibition was Matisse's monumental Le Bonheur de Vivre (The Joy of Life).[17] Critics were horrified by the flatness, bright colors, eclectic style and mixed technique of Le Bonheur de Vivre.[17] The triangular composition is closely related to Paul Cézanne's Bathers; a series that would soon become a source of inspiration for Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.[18][19]
