The architects charged with the restoration of Williamsburg chose to reconstruct the first capitol based on superior documentation of its design and its unique architecture compared to the second Capitol.[2][3]  Later architectural historians have since shown that parts of the reconstruction were embellished or conjectural, being based more on contemporary architectural ideas than actual historic evidence (chiefly foundations.) However, the reconstructed Capitol is now itself valued as a Colonial Revival interpretation and work of architecture.[3]
