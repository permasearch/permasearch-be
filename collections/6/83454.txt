Henry Jackman, the composer for Puss in Boots, utilized folk instruments of traditional Latin music. Inspired by Spanish composer Manuel de Falla, Jackman blended guitars and Latin percussion with an orchestral sound influenced by Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel.[22] Mexican guitar duo Rodrigo y Gabriela contributed to Jackmanâ€™s score, and two of their songs, Diabolo Rojo and Hanuman were included in the soundtrack.[23] Lady Gaga's song "Americano" was also featured in the film.[24][25] The soundtrack for the film, featuring the original score by Jackman, was released on October 24, 2011, by Sony Classical.[26]
