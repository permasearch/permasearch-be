Exo Survival was first introduced as Advanced Warfare's cooperative game mode.[17] Considered to be a new version of the Survival Mode from Modern Warfare 3,[18] Exo Survival allows up to four players to engage in a wave-based match against A.I.-controlled enemies.[19] Players can choose from four different classes of Exo, which grant different abilities and score-streaks. Weapons and score-streaks can be upgraded throughout each match. After a certain number of rounds, players are given objectives to perform, such as defending a location, or collecting intel from fallen enemies. Completing the objectives grant players bonus upgrade points; not completing them result in the players being punished, such as having their Exo suits temporarily disabled or activating hostile security turrets.[20] Exo Survival is played on the game's multiplayer maps, with a total of 13 maps divived into four tiers. Each tier can be unlocked by playing the previous tier and survive a specific number of rounds.[20]
