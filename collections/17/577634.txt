Groot first appeared in Tales to Astonish #13 (November 1960), and was created by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby.[2] "Groot" is the Dutch word for "large", possibly referring to his stature and ability to grow in size.[3] He appeared again in The Incredible Hulk Annual #5 (Oct. 1976), alongside five other monsters from Marvel's anthology horror comics of the late 1950s and early 1960s. In The Sensational Spider-Man #âˆ’1 (July 1997), Groot was featured in a nightmare of the young Peter Parker.
