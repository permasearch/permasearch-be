Carla is the eldest of the four daughters. As is common for the oldest sibling, she is somewhat seen as the mediator between the four sisters in the novel. "As the therapist in the family Carla likes to be the one who understands everything"[30] and "has a tendency to lace all her compliments with calls to self-improvement".[31] However to her sisters, this creates a somewhat dominating character at times reminiscent of their mother.[31] Her criticism goes farther when she writes an autobiographical paper calling her mother mildly anal-retentive.[32] In Carlaâ€™s first and perhaps most prominent story in the novel, "Trespass", as she is walking home from school in New York, a man exposes himself to her and attempts to lure her into his car. Alvarez uses Carla's character to display the language difficulties faced with only having "classroom English",[14] and how communication barriers affect immigrants.
