Due to the large Mexican-American population in the Southwestern United States, and its proximity to Mexico, Mexican food there is believed to be some of the best in the US. Cubans brought Cuban cuisine to Miami, and today, cortaditos, pastelitos de guayaba, and empanadas are common mid-day snacks in the city. Cuban culture has changed Miami's coffee drinking habits, and today a caf√© con leche or a cortadito is commonly had, often with a pastelito (pastry), at one of the city's numerous coffee shops.[185] The Cuban sandwich developed in Miami, and is now a staple and icon of the city's cuisine and culture.[186]
