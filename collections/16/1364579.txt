The Worldwide Tanker Normal Freight Scale, often referred to as Worldscale, is established and governed jointly by the Worldscale Associations of London and New York.[49] Worldscale establishes a baseline price for carrying a metric ton of product between any two ports in the world.[52] In Worldscale negotiations, operators and charterers will determine a price based on a percentage of the Worldscale rate.[52] The baseline rate is expressed as WS 100.[52] If a given charter party settled on 85% of the Worldscale rate, it would be expressed as WS 85.[52] Similarly, a charter party set at 125% of the Worldscale rate would be expressed as WS 125.[52]
