Thota Tharani was the film's art director,[9] and also designed the costumes used in the film.[12] Regarding the designing of the Vettaiyapuram palace, he watched both Manichitrathazhu and Apthamitra to get the basic idea of the film's plot. Manichitrathazhu was shot in a palace in Kochi. Vasu wanted Tharani to make the sets more colourful and grand and did not want the realistic look of the original film. Tharani designed Chandramukhi's room and placed a corridor in it, which was quite different from the original and its Kannada remake. The corridor resembled those commonly seen in palaces in Kerala.[12] Sidney Sladen did additional costume designing in the film.[13]
