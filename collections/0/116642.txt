In 1985, the United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued OMB Circular A-128, “Audits of State and Local Governments,” to help recipients and auditors implement the new Single Audit. In 1990, OMB administratively extended the Single Audit process to non-profit organizations by issuing OMB Circular A-133, “Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and Other Non-Profit Organizations” which superseded OMB A-128. These new guides and provisions standardized the Single Audit in the United States to include all states, local governments, non-profit organizations, and institutions that receive federal funds from the US government.[2][5][6] On December 26, 2013, OMB issued the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, which standardized compliance and audit requirements for government entities, non-profit organizations and institutions of higher education.[7]
