It is predicted that the lunar distance will continue to increase until the Earth and Moon become tidally locked. This would occur when the duration of the lunar orbital period equals the rotational period of Earth. The two bodies will then be at equilibrium, and no further rotational energy will be exchanged. Models predict that 50Â billion years would be required to achieve this configuration,[24] which is significantly longer than the expected lifetime of the solar system.
