In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, a special clef was used for violin music, particularly that published in France. For this reason it is known as the French clef or French violin clef although it was more commonly used for flute music.[2] The G-clef is placed on the first line of the stave and is identical to the bass clef transposed up two octaves.
