In 1816, Fran√ßois Magendie discovered that dogs fed only carbohydrates (sugar), fat (olive oil), and water died evidently of starvation, but dogs also fed protein survived, identifying protein as an essential dietary component.[33] William Prout in 1827 was the first person to divide foods into carbohydrates, fat, and protein.[34] During the 19th century, Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Justus von Liebig quarrelled over their shared belief that animals get their protein directly from plants (animal and plant protein are the same and that humans do not create organic compounds).[35] With a reputation as the leading organic chemist of his day but with no credentials in animal physiology,[36] Liebig grew rich making food extracts like beef bouillon and infant formula that were later found to be of questionable nutritious value.[37] In the 1860s, Claude Bernard discovered that body fat can be synthesized from carbohydrate and protein, showing that the energy in blood glucose can be stored as fat or as glycogen.[38]
