Patients can become entirely edentulous (without teeth) for many reasons, the most prevalent being removal due to dental disease typically relating to oral flora control, i.e., periodontal disease and tooth decay. Other reasons include pregnancy, tooth developmental defects caused by severe malnutrition, genetic defects such as dentinogenesis imperfecta, trauma, or drug use.
