Åžehzade Ahmet (voiced by Tamer Hassan) appears in Assassin's Creed: Revelations.  Ahmet (1465-1512) was the eldest living son of Bayezid II and brother to Selim I. Sharing many characteristics with his father, he was believed to be the perfect candidate for the sultan's heir, even more so when he served as governor of Amasya. However, many of the Ottoman Empire (The Janissaries in particular) deem him to be an unfit ruler in times of war and times of peace. Furthermore, they do not see him as a traditional Sultan and thus do not support him. He sets up the unsuccessful ambush and capture of Prince Suleiman by Byzantine Templars, intending to have him rescued, subsequently making Ahmet appear to be a brave hero. His plans fail, but while Ezio is away in Cappadocia, Ahmet takes Sofia Sartor hostage and demands Ezio exchanges the Masyaf key for her. After the exchange, Ahmet flees the city and Ezio follows him with Sofia. After Ezio catches up with him, Ahmet's brother Selim arrives. Selim proclaims his authority as the new Sultan and kills his own brother by strangling him and then tossing him off a cliff. (Sehzade is the Turkish form of the title "Prince" and refers to a son or male-line descendant of an Ottoman Sultan).
