While the boys were getting sober, Princess arrived at the Salazars to surprise the family for breakfast. Alex invited Chad over, which made the whole moment awkward, especially for Bobbie. The following day, as Tristan was about to leave overseas for business, he tells Bobbie that by the time he gets back, she should now be willing to marry him. Alex, who overheard the incident, gave a comment with which Bobbie dismissed. Later on, Alex went to see Chad and asked him to marry her. Chad disagreed with the idea.
