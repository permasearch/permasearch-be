The book's early Saturday morning release in Israel was criticised for violating Shabbat. Trade and Industry Minister Eli Yishai commented "It is forbidden, according to Jewish values and Jewish culture, that a thing like this should take place at 2Â am on Saturday. Let them do it on another day."[64] Yishai indicated that he would issue indictments and fines based on the Hours of Work and Rest Law.[65]
