In 2001, Costas was hired by HBO to host a 12-week series called On the Record with Bob Costas.[38] On the Record with Bob Costas was similar to the format of the old Later program as they both concentrated on in-depth interviews. In 2005, On the Record with Bob Costas was revamped to become Costas Now, a monthly issue oriented sports program that occasionally employed a town hall style format.
