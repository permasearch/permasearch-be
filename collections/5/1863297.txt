Stefan (Paul Wesley) gives Elena (Nina Dobrev) jewelries filled with vervain that he made for her, family and friends to protect them. At the same time, the doorbell rings, Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) opens the door and a delivery guy (Dillon Casey) is at the door. He invites him in and calls Elena to pay him. As the delivery guy walks away, he pulls his hoodie back on revealing that he is the vampire Elena hit with her car.
