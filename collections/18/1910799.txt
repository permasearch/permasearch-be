Boot throwing, or welly wanging, has been a competitive sport in New Zealand and Britain for many years, although not one that is taken very seriously.  Wellington boots are the heavy rubber boots worn by most farm workers and many other outdoor workers.   A competition to see who can throw a boot, or "welly", the furthest is a feature of many Agricultural Field Days in the rural communities. The town of Taihape in the central North Island is particularly identified with this sport; they claim to be the Gum Boot Throwing Capital of New Zealand. They hold an annual competition (Gumboot Day) in the main street and award a Golden Gumboot as the trophy. See also Wellie wanging in Yorkshire, England.
