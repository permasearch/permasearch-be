There are also taxi scams present in India, whereby a foreign traveller, who is not aware of the locations around Indian airports, is taken for a ride round the whole airport and charged for full-fare taxi ride while the terminal is only few hundred yards away.[65] Overseas Security Advisory Council in a report mentioned the process about how to avoid taxi-scam.  This crime is known in other areas of the world as "long-hauling".[65]
