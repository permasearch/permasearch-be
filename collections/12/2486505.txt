The Chief Engineer, commonly referred to as "The chief",  or just "chief", is responsible for all operations and maintenance that have to do with all machinery and equipment throughout the ship. He may be paid on par with the captain, although he is never responsible for the action of ship. The chief engineer cannot assume command and the command always rests with the Captain of the ship, unless it is clearly mentioned within the safety management system.[citation needed]
