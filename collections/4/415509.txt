Pornography and homosexual relations were decriminalized in the 1960s and 1970s in some states, either by legislative action or by a number of court decisions striking down anti-obscenity and anti-sodomy laws, and in 1973 the American Medical Association removed homosexuality from its index of mental disorders. In 1967, the Hays Code, a censorship guideline imposed on the motion picture industry since the 1930s, was lifted and replaced by a new film content rating system, and by the 1970s, there was a surge in sexually-explicit movies and social commentary coming from Hollywood.
