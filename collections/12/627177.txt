From 2006, the New York Times and the 20/20 television program have published reports on a "black market" in Chinese cadavers and organs,[15][16] sparking a Congressional inquiry,[17] an investigation by NY Attorney General Andrew Cuomo,[18] and the resignation of Premier's CEO Arnie Geller.[19] As the result of the Cuomo investigation and subsequent settlement in 2008,[20] the front page of the exhibition website displays a disclaimer about the presumed origin of the bodies and fetuses, saying that it "relies solely on the representations of its Chinese partners" and "cannot independently verify" that the bodies do not belong to executed prisoners.[21] Both the human rights activist Harry Wu[22] and the director of the Human Rights in China advocacy group have objected to the exhibit on these grounds.[22]
