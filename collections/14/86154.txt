Bolic (ボリック, Borikku) is a high-ranking member of the Path of Peace (安寧道, An'neidō), a religion that opposes the Empire. However, he is actually an agent working on behalf of the Prime Minister. Bolic is dispatched to kill the current high priest so that he will become the next leader and control it for the Empire's sake. Bolic uses his position and drugs to discreetly control the Path's members, turning them into his playthings. Esdeath, the Jaegers and the Four Rakshasa Demons were ordered to protect him, which resulted in intense battles when Night Raid came to kill him. These battle results in the deaths of Seryu and Susanoo. He is easily killed by Akame while Esdeath is occupied by Leone, Susanoo, Najenda and Tatsumi.
