Parts of the Philippine Islands were known to Europeans before the 1521 Spanish expedition around the world led by Portuguese-born Spanish explorer Ferdinand Magellan (the Portuguese conquered Malacca City in 1511 and reached Maluku Islands in 1512 ). Magellan landed on the island called Homonhon, claiming the islands he saw for Spain, and naming them Islas de San LÃ¡zaro.[100] He established friendly relations with some of the local leaders especially with Rajah Humabon and converted some of them to Roman Catholicism.[100] In the Philippines, they explored many islands including the island of Mactan. However, Magellan was killed during the Battle of Mactan against the local datu, Lapu-Lapu.
