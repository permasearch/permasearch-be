A tandem of nine-amino-acid transactivation domains (9aaTAD) was identified in the AD1 and AD2 regions of transcription factor p53.[28] KO mutations and position for p53 interaction with TFIID are listed below:[29] The competence of the p53 transactivation domains 9aaTAD to activate transcription as small peptides was reported.[30]
