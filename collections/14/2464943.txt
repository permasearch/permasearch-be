His predecessor John Adams angrily counter-attacked the press and vocal opponents by passing chilling Alien and Sedition Acts. Jefferson, by contrast, worked tirelessly to overturn what he viewed as tyrannical limits on free speech and free press, except for when he asked Thomas McKean, governor of Pennsylvania, to have Federalist newspapermen indicted for libel, claiming that it was necessary to prevent licentious abuses of free speech.[10] He later lamented the anguish caused by his political enemies; however, he never denied the charges made by them, including those in Notes on Virginia, and he never gave up his fight for “Republican principles” to shield the common man from state or religious oppression.[11]
