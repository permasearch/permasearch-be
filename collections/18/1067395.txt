Practitioners and donors from the charitable side of microfinance frequently argue for restricting microcredit to loans for productive purposesâ€”such as to start or expand a microenterprise. Those from the private-sector side respond that, because money is fungible, such a restriction is impossible to enforce, and that in any case it should not be up to rich people to determine how poor people use their money[citation needed].
