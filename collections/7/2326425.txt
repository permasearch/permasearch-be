In September Captain John P. Bankhead received orders to take command of Monitor, relieving commander Thomas Stevens, and was sent to Hampton Roads to take charge of the vessel.[145] Shortly after command was passed on to Bankhead Monitor's engines and boilers were condemned by a board of survey which recommended that they be overhauled completely.[146] On 30 September the ironclad was sent to the Washington Navy Yard for repairs[147][148] arriving there on 3 October 1862.[149]
