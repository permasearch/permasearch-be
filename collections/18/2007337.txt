The design competition started out by identifying four firms which would participate in the contest. The competition officially began in January 2003, with firms from New York City, Amsterdam, and Los Angeles/Zurich as finalists.  The winner, Los Angeles/Zurich-based AngÃ©lil / Graham / Pfenninger / Scholl, was announced on March 26, 2003.[30]  In November, PATI chose Doppelmayr CTEC to design, fabricate and install the tram. The first public review of the project's status was November 2003.
