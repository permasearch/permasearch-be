MTV's James Montgomery compared the video to the visual of "Still Into You"—the second single of Paramore. He wrote, "That clip was a revelation, the beginning of a bold new chapter for the band, and [the video for "Ain't It Fun"] keeps that winning streak alive. Montgomery went on to call it "blissed out and buzzy, born of a brilliant concept, and an absolute blast to watch".[71] Fuse's Nicole James surmised that the world records were "adorable", while Steff Yotka of Nylon deemed them "crazy, funny, weird" and concluded that they "make for a truly excellent viewing experience"[72][73] On the critical side, Mish Way—writing for Vice—opined that the video's concept did not relate to the song's theme. Way dubbed the clip a "major fuck-up" but called Williams an "irresistible charm".[74]
