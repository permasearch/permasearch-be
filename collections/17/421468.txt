Mammals are noted for their large brain size relative to body size, compared to other animal groups. Recent findings suggest that the first brain area to expand was that involved in smell.[140] Scientists scanned the skulls of early mammal species dating back to 190â€“200 million years ago and compared the brain case shapes to earlier pre-mammal species; they found that the brain area involved in the sense of smell was the first to enlarge.[140] This change may have allowed these early mammals to hunt insects at night when dinosaurs were not active.[140]
