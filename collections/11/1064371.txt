Many metals that form hexafluorides also can form pentafluorides. For instance, uranium, which has a well-known hexafluoride, also forms two different pentafluoride structures. The room-temperature (alpha) form has the same linear chain structure as bismuth pentafluoride. As a molecular (gas) species, UF5 has a square pyramidal structure.
