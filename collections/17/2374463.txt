The Oakland Press's Gary Graff rates the album a B submitting: "Bryan has found his lane, and he doesn't mess with it on 'Kill The Lights,' a characteristically likable collection of friendly come-ons, lost love laments and sentimental odes to gravel roads and car rides to the nearest big town...It's solid from start to finish, refining what fans know and, mostly, love about Bryan's music and ensuring that his career lights will continue to shine for the foreseeable future."[12] Dave Heaton rates the album a seven for PopMatters espousing: "So bro-country this is, in that the women are shadows and might be figments of the man’s imagination."[13] Entertainment Weekly's Madison Vain rates the album a B asserting: "Considering Crash's success, messing with the formula on Kill the Lights would be a calculated risk. And Lights is nothing if not calculating."[9] The magazine Nash Country Weekly's Bob Paxman rates the album a B claiming: "Kill the Lights isn't consistently pleasing, but it does represent a progression and evolution from Luke’s previous material."[10] The Plain Dealer's Chuck Yarborough rates the album a B– claiming: "It's a new phase. And a welcome one."[18] Glenn Gamboa from Newsday rates the album a B+ surmising: "Experimenting is good, but sometimes sticking to what you know is even better."[19]
