Non-human mammals play a wide variety of roles in human culture. They are the most popular of pets, with tens of millions of dogs, cats and other animals including rabbits and mice kept by families around the world.[217][218][219] Mammals such as mammoths, horses and deer are among the earliest subjects of art, being found in Upper Paleolithic cave paintings such as at Lascaux.[220] Major artists such as Albrecht DÃ¼rer, George Stubbs and Edwin Landseer are known for their portraits of mammals.[221] Many species of mammals have been hunted for sport and for food; deer and wild boar are especially popular as game animals.[222][223][224] Mammals such as horses and dogs are widely raced for sport, often combined with betting on the outcome.[225][226] There is a tension between the role of animals as companions to humans, and their existence as individuals with rights of their own.[227] Mammals further play a wide variety of roles in literature,[228][229][230] film,[231] mythology, and religion.[232][233][234]
