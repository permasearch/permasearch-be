On March 11, 1965, NHL President Clarence Campbell announced that the league would expand to twelve teams from six through the creation of a new six-team division for the 1967–68 season.[1] In response to Campbell's announcement, a partnership of nine men, led by Walter Bush, Jr. and John Driscoll, was formed to seek a franchise for the Twin Cities area of Minnesota.[2][3] Their efforts were successful, as the NHL awarded one of its six expansion franchises to Minnesota on February 9, 1966.[3] In addition to Minnesota, the five other franchises were awarded to Oakland, California, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and St. Louis.[3] The expansion fee for all six new clubs was $2 million for each team ($15.1 million in 2017 dollars).[4] The "North Stars" name was announced on May 25, 1966, following a public contest.[3] The name is derived from the state's motto "L'Étoile du Nord", which is a French phrase meaning "The Star of the North".[5] Months after the naming of the team, ground was broken on October 3, 1966, for a new hockey arena in Bloomington, Minnesota.[3] The home of the North Stars, the Metropolitan Sports Center, was built in 12 months at a cost of US$7 million ($52.8 million in 2017 dollars).[2] The arena was ready for play for the start of the 1967–68 NHL season, but portions of the arena's construction had not been completed.[6] Spectator seats were in the process of being installed as fans arrived at the arena for the opening home game on October 21, 1967.[6]
