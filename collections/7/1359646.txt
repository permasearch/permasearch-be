For Honor is an action fighting game set during a medieval, post-apocalypse fantasy setting.[2] Players can play as a character from three different factions, namely the Iron Legion, the Chosen, and the Warborn. The three factions represent knights, samurai, and vikings, respectively.[3] Each faction had four classes at launch, with two more being added at the beginning of every season of the Faction War. Each faction's warriors speak their respective languages in game. The knights speak classical and modified Latin, the vikings speak Icelandic, and the samurai speak Japanese. The Vanguard class is described as "well-balanced" and has excellent offense and defense. The Assassin class is fast and efficient in dueling enemies, but the class deals much less damage to enemies. The Heavies are more resistant to damages and are suitable for holding capture points, though their attacks are slow. The last class, known as "Hybrids", are a combination of two of the three types, and is capable of using uncommon skills.
