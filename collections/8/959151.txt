When the film was released in 2009, Naʼvi had a growing vocabulary of about a thousand words, but understanding of its grammar was limited to the language's creator.[1] However, this has changed subsequently as Frommer has expanded the lexicon to more than 2200 words[2] and has published the grammar, thus making Naʼvi a relatively complete, learnable and serviceable language.
