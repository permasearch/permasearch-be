As of 2016, there are two different musical theater parodies of the series. In 2015, the inaugural American edition of Red Nose Day featured the comedy sketch Coldplay's Game of Thrones: The Musical, a mockumentary regarding a failed musical theatre adaptation of the television show by the British band Coldplay, featuring many castmembers of Game of Thrones such as Peter Dinklage, Kit Harington, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Emilia Clarke, Alfie Allen and Iwan Rheon.[21] An unrelated Game of Thrones: The Musical, developed by Really Spicy Opera, appeared at the Minnesota Fringe Festival in August 2016 and will appear at the 2017 Oahu and Maui Fringe Festivals.[22]
