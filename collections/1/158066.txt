Although he rarely started for the Lakers (in 1987â€“88 he played in 104 of the 106 games the Lakers played, all from the bench), Thompson proved more than a capable back up for the aging Abdul-Jabbar (and later Vlade Divac) and also played at power forward, forming a good relationship with Magic Johnson and helping the Lakers win consecutive titles in 1987 and 1988 while reaching the Finals in 1989. Mychal Thompson retired in 1991.
