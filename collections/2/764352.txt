68: Tamaki reminisces on how stupidly he has acted towards Haruhi, particularly his insistence on treating her like a daughter. He remembers how his father's actions to choose love broke up his family and he's scared that he will do the same to his Host Club family. This reminds him of how Hikaru said that their bond won't be easily broken. Mori later also tells him to be honest with himself and know that everyone in the Host Club trusts him.  At the curry challenge, Kanoya has a difficult task to make a curry out of terrible ingredients, but as a cook's daughter she gets back her confidence and does well. In the final 'truth' challenge Kanoya admits that she misses her dad and Haruhi encourages her to be honest with her family about her feelings. Haruhi also tells off Tamaki for keeping secrets from the Host Club and lets him know that they all want to support him â€“ whatever it is! Tamaki realises that, despite being scared of losing his friends, he is ready to tell Haruhi how he feels.
