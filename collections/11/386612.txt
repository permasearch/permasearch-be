Although the symbol 토 is sometimes used for standard gravity, 토 (without a suffix) can also mean the local acceleration due to local gravity and centrifugal acceleration, which varies depending on one's position on Earth (see Earth's gravity). The symbol 토 should not be confused with G, the gravitational constant, or g, the symbol for gram. The 토 is also used as a unit for any form of acceleration, with the value defined as above; see g-force.
