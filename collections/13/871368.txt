In an interview for The New Gay, Perry describes the song to be about girls. She defends the lyrics, saying that "When we're young, we're very touchy-feely. We have slumber party sing-a-longs, we make up dance routines in our pajamas. We're a lot more intimate in a friendship than guys can be. It's not perverse but just sweet..."[9] The song was partially inspired by Scarlett Johansson.[10] Perry also stated that the lyrics were inspired by her friendship with a girl as a teenager, commenting that "I did kiss her. I was totally obsessed with her. She was beautiful â€” porcelain skin, perfect lips."[11] While Perry hasn't explicitly revealed the main person behind the inspiration of the song, Miley Cyrus has claimed it's about her.[12]
