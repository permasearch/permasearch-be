Few traces of the once great Roman city are visible today aside from the massive fortification walls that snake up the mountains to the east of the modern city, several aqueducts, and the Church of St Peter (St Peter's Cave Church, Cave-Church of St. Peter), said to be a meeting place of an Early Christian community.[61] The majority of the Roman city lies buried beneath deep sediments from the Orontes River, or has been obscured by recent construction.
