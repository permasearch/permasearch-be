The Janata government then brought about the 43rd and 44th Amendments in 1977 and 1978 respectively, to restore the pre-1976 position to some extent.[4] Among other changes, the amendments revoked the 42nd Amendment's provision that Directive Principles take precedence over Fundamental Rights, and also curbed Parliament's power to legislate against "antinational activities".[17] However, the Janata Party was not able to fully achieve its objective of restoring the Constitution to the condition it was in before the Emergency.
