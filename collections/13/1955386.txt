SAS 99 defines fraud as an intentional act that results in a material misstatement in financial statements. There are two types of fraud considered: misstatements arising from fraudulent financial reporting (e.g. falsification of accounting records) and misstatements arising from misappropriation of assets (e.g. theft of assets or fraudulent expenditures). The standard describes the fraud triangle. Generally, the three ‘fraud triangle’ conditions are present when fraud occurs. First, there is an incentive or pressure that provides a reason to commit fraud. Second, there is an opportunity for fraud to be perpetrated (e.g. absence of controls, ineffective controls, or the ability of management to override controls.) Third, the individuals committing the fraud possess an attitude that enables them to rationalize the fraud.
