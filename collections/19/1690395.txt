The tension reached a boiling point in mid-1975, when rumours began circulating of possible power seizures from both independence parties.[33] In August 1975, UDT staged a coup in the capital city Dili and a small-scale civil war broke out. Ramos-Horta describes the fighting as "bloody", and details violence committed by both UDT and Fretilin. He cites the International Committee of the Red Cross, which counted 2,000â€“3,000 people dead after the war.[34] The fighting forced the Portuguese government onto the nearby island of Atauro.[35] Fretilin defeated UDT's forces after two weeks, much to the surprise of Portugal and Indonesia.[36] UDT leaders fled to Indonesian-controlled West Timor. There they signed a petition on 7 September calling for East Timor's integration with Indonesia;[37] most accounts indicate that UDT's support for this position was forced by Indonesia.[38]
