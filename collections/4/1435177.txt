The final episode, "The Ghost Talks" (actually released as the 21st to be filmed) contained extended flashbacks of Hopkirk alone solving a case—Jeff being out of town—before his death. This was necessitated by Mike Pratt having been injured in a fall from a drainpipe while trying to get into his locked flat. Pratt broke both his legs, rendering him bedridden in a real hospital bed (Pratt also had a nurse in attendance) on the set of a hospital room for duration of filming for that episode. Jeff's incapacity in the episode was explained by his having fallen off a balcony while in pursuit of a safe-cracker.
