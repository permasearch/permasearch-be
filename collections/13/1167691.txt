Over the next four hundred years Jerusalem's prominence diminished as Arab powers in the region jockeyed for control.[156] Jerusalem was captured in 1073 by the Seljuk Turkish commander Atsız.[157] After Atsız was killed, the Seljuk prince Tutush I granted the city to Artuk Bey, another Seljuk commander. After Artuk's death in 1091 his sons Sökmen and Ilghazi governed in the city up to 1098 when the Fatimids recaptured the city.
