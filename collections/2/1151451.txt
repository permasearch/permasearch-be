The prayer incorporates two passages from Saint Luke's Gospel: "Hail, the Lord is with thee."[1] and "Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb." And "full of grace" from John 1:14.[2] In mid-13th-century Western Europe the prayer consisted only of these words with the single addition of the name "Mary" after the word "Hail", as is evident from the commentary of Saint Thomas Aquinas on the prayer.[3]
