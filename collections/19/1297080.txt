Since 2003, Rowe played locally in his hometown at open mics, bars and cafes.[10] He began playing with percussionist Marco Haber, who played on a few tracks on his first album "27". Shortly thereafter they began playing under the name Mudfunk and recorded a live album, Live at the Grind, as well as a single of "Wrong Side of the Bed." The latter would be re-recorded for Sean's solo album, Magic, without Haber and with different instrumentation. He recorded his album, Magic, at Collar City Sound and released it through Collar City Records on April 21, 2009.[1][6] In 2009, Rowe was asked to open for Noah and the Whale in the United Kingdom.[1] Soon after, Sean signed with ANTI- Records, which re-released Magic on February 22, 2011,[11] and released The Salesman and the Shark on August 28, 2012. On March 4, Sean played his new release, "Downwind", on Jimmy Kimmel Live. The movie The Accountant with actor Ben Affleck (2016) features Sean Rowe's song "To Leave Something Behind"
