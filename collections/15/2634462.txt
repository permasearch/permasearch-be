Natchitoches Regional Airport serves cities (via FBO) such as Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Dallas, Houston, Little Rock, Monroe, and Shreveport. It is adjacent to Northwestern State University; together they offer state-of-the-art flight training. The airport is under renovation to become one of the country's most advanced non-towered airports.
