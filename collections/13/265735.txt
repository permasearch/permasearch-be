Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) has been appointed best man at the wedding and proceeds to plan a series of "good surprises" ("Guten Pranken") for Dwight during his bachelor party, which consists of most of the current and former male employees. At the bachelor party, the group has Dwight fire a bazooka and receive a lap dance from Elizabeth the Stripper (Jackie Debatin), though Dwight thinks she is their waitress and remains oblivious. At the bachelorette party, with the current and former female employees plus Angela's sister Rachael (Rachael Harris), the group is shocked to see that the stripper hired for entertainment is Meredith Palmer's (Kate Flannery) son Jake (Spencer Daniels). Angela is then kidnapped by Dwight's cousin Mose (Michael Schur). After hearing about Angela's kidnapping, Dwight and the male employees visit the bar that Kevin owns, where Dwight, at Jim's insistence to bury the hatchet, is forced to apologize to Kevin and confirm that his firing was not personal but based solely on his job performance, which cheers him up. The two decide to make amends. Mose then leads Dwight and Jim out to his car where Angela is stuck in the trunk and finally let out.
