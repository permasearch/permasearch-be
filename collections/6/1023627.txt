Sea of Thieves is a pirate-themed action-adventure cooperative multiplayer game played from a first-person perspective.[2][3] The game features cross-platform play between Windows-based personal computers and Xbox One video game consoles.[4] A group of players travel and explore an open world via a pirate ship and assume different roles such as steering, hoisting sails, navigation, and firing cannons.[3][5] Players embark on quests, collect loot and engage in combat with other players.[5] Sea of Thieves is a shared game world, which means groups of players will encounter each other regularly throughout their adventures.[3] The game has a cartoonish art style and an exaggerated physics engine that allow players to perform stunts, like being shot out of ship cannons.[4][6]
