The Home and Away opening titles sequence was initially used to introduce the regular characters in the show. The sequences often featured the characters in couple shots or with family and friends, and showed them in familiar settings around Summer Bay such as the beach.[143] The titles for the show's earlier years featured black brush stroke cutouts around the character shots.[143] 2004 saw Home and Away introduce new picture frame-style opening titles, with characters shown posing in and out of large picture frames in front of beach backgrounds.[143] In January 2007, the show debuted new opening titles along with a new version of the theme song.[141][143] The picture-frame style was still used, but this time the titles featured framed pictures of the characters.[141][143] In 2009, the opening was reduced to 15 seconds and the characters were removed from the titles for the first time in Home and Away's history. They were replaced by a large photo collage showing various locations around Summer Bay.[144] The decision to remove the cast and shorten the titles was due to time restrictions.[134][151] Since then, many viewers in Australia and the UK have wanted the full-length title sequence with the cast to return.[134][151]
