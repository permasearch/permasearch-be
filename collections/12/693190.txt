Because Queen Mary 2's propulsion machinery is electrically decoupled from her propellers, her propulsion arrangement may arguably be more accurately described as "CODLAG electric" (by analogy with turbo-electric and diesel-electric);[citation needed] however "integrated electric propulsion" is the term of art. The diesel engines and gas turbines drive electric generators, which provide the power to drive four 21,500 kW (28,800 hp) Alstom electrical motors located inside the podded propulsors (and thus entirely outside the vessel's hull).[14] Unusually, Queen Mary 2's gas turbines are not housed along with her diesels in the engine room deep in her hull, but instead are in a soundproofed enclosure directly beneath the funnel. This arrangement allowed the vessel's designers to supply the oxygen-hungry turbines with air intakes without having to run air ducts the height of the ship, which would have wasted valuable interior space.[14]
