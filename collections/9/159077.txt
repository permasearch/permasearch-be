The film was written by Bennet Tramer and directed by Don Barnhart. Due to budget constraints, the much of the film was shot in Santa Monica, with only location shots that could not easily be faked were shot in Hawaii. The shooting schedule in Hawaii turned out to be massive, even after Engel and Barnhart scouted the location. Real-life lifeguards were hired as extras during beach scenes to ensure the safety of the cast.[7][18]
