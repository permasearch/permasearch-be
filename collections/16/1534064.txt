I've actually found the lyrics annoying. I understand the sentiment that they are talking about and that's cool, but they clearly don't understand the phrase 'knock on wood'. I actually wandered over here to see if there was a controversy section similar to Alanis' Ironic and was surprised to find no mention at all.
