A karahi (/kəˈraɪ/; Hindi: कड़ाही kaṛāhī, Urdu: کڑاہی‎‎; also kadai, korai, karai, kadhi, kadahi, kadhai or cheena chatti) is a type of thick, circular, and deep cooking-pot[1] (similar in shape to a wok) that originated in the Indian subcontinent. It is used in Indian, Afghanistan, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, and Nepalese cuisine. Traditionally made out of cast iron, karahi look like woks with steeper sides. Today they can be made of stainless steel, copper, and non-stick surfaces, both round and flat-bottomed.
