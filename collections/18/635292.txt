Moulin made the call for reporting officers to retreat from the 71st and Normandie area entirely at approximately 5:50 pm.[5][40] They were sent to an RTD bus depot at 54th and Arlington[47] and told to await further instructions. The command post formed at this location was activated at approximately 6:00 pm, but once set up had no cellular phones or computers other than those in squad cars. It had insufficient numbers of telephone lines and handheld police radios to assess and respond to the situation.[47] Finally, the site had no televisions, which meant that as live broadcasts of unrest began, command post officers did not see any of the coverage for themselves.[48]
