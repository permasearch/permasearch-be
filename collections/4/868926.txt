A Petri dish (sometimes spelled "Petrie Dish" and alternatively known as a Petri plate or cell-culture dish), named after the German bacteriologist Julius Richard Petri,[1][2] is a shallow cylindrical glass or plastic lidded dish that biologists use to culture cells[3] – such as bacteria – or small mosses.[4]
