Connecticut legislated lethal injection as its sole method of execution in 1995.[2] The last person executed by electrocution was Joseph "Mad Dog" Taborsky in May 1960.[3] Connecticut's "Old Sparky" has not been tested since it was moved from Wethersfield to the Northern Correctional Institution in Somers in 1962, and prison officials claim the prison's electrical system cannot handle it.[4]
