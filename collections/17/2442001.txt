The song's lyrics include "I'm gonna put my body first/And love me so hard 'til it hurts" and "I'm gonna touch the pain away/I know how to scream my own name"; the music video, released one week later, features Steinfeld wearing a leotard emblazoned with "self service".[5] This prompted many fans and media outlets to dub the song an "ode to masturbation".[6][7][8] Steinfeld said the lyrics are intended to be interpreted by the listener, "but for me it's an empowerment record and itâ€™s ultimately about taking care of yourself and indulging yourself, whether that be emotionally or physically or with material things."[9] According to musicnotes.com, the song is written in G minor, and has a tempo of 120 beats per minute.[10]
