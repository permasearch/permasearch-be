The same incongruity marks Girodet's Danae (1799) and his Quatre Saisons, executed for the king of Spain (repeated for CompiÃ¨gne), and shows itself to a ludicrous extent in his Fingal (Leuchtenberg collection, St. Petersburg), executed for Napoleon in 1802. This work unites the defects of the classic and romantic schools, for Girodet's imagination ardently and exclusively pursued the ideas excited by the varied reading of both classic and modern literature, and the impressions he received from the external world afforded him little stimulus or check; he consequently retained the mannerisms of his master's practice whilst rejecting all restraint on choice of subject.[4]
