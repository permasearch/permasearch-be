The state of Odisha sustained the most catastrophic damage associated with Cyclone BOB 03, which was considered the state's severest cyclone of the 20th century.[5] The damage was compounded by the earlier impact of a very severe cyclonic storm that struck nearby areas just 11 days earlier.[5] Twelve Odishan districts suffered severe damage, reporting complete breakdown of essential services: Balasore, Bhadrak, Cuttack, Dhenkanal, Jagatsinghpur, Jajpur, Keonjhar, Kendrapada, Khurda, Puri, Mayurbhanj, and Nayagarh. Among these, the blocks of Erasma and Kujang in Jagatsinghpur were the worst affected. In total, 12.9 million people were affected by the storm; estimates for the storm's death toll vary significantly, though the India Meteorological Department indicated that around 9,887 were killed, with an additional 40 persons missing and 2,507 others injured. The majority of these deaths occurred in Jagatsinghpurm where 8,119 were killed.[1] The Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters's EM-DAT disaster database indicates that 10,915 people were killed.[14] However, other estimates suggested that the death toll may have been as high as 30,000.[2] The storm's effects damaged 1.6 million homes across 14,643 villages and 97 blocks.[1] In turn, 2.5 million people were marooned.[5] A total of 18,420 km2 (7,110mi2) of crop land was impacted, and 444,000 livestock casualties were also reported.[1] The sugar cane crop was destroyed alongside other kharif and rabi crops.[15] About 2 million tonnes (2.2 million tons) of the winter rice crop was destroyed.[16] Total damage caused by the destructive cyclone amounted to US$4.4444 billion.[17]
