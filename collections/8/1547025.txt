The results of this study indicate that the taxi drivers' (experts') recall of streets was higher in both the route order condition and the map order condition than in the two random conditions.[6] This indicates that the experts were able to use their prelearned spatial knowledge to organize the information in such a way that they surpassed STM and WM capacity limitations.[6] The organization strategy that the drivers employed is known as chunking.[6] Additionally, the comments made by the experts during the procedure point towards their use of route knowledge in completing the task.[6] To ensure that it was in fact spatial information that they were encoding, the researchers also presented lists in alphabetical order and semantic categories.[6] However, the researchers found that it was in fact spatial information that the experts were chunking, allowing them to surpass the limitations of both visuo-spatial STM and WM.[6]
