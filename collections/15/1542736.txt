Following the death of Habyarimana, and the start of the genocide, Dallaire liaised repeatedly with both the Crisis Committee and the RPF, attempting to re-establish peace and prevent the resumption of the civil war.[192] Neither side was interested in a ceasefire, the government because it was controlled by the genocidaires, and the RPF because it considered it necessary to fight to stop the killings.[173] UNAMIR's Chapter VI mandate rendered it powerless to intervene militarily,[131] and most of its Rwandan staff were killed in the early days of the genocide, severely limiting its ability to operate.[173]
