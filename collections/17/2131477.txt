The United States Shipping Company planned in 1903 to reorganize as the Bethlehem Steel and Shipbuilding Company, this would be the second company to use the name Bethlehem Steel. However, the United States Shipbuilding Company was not reorganized as the Bethlehem Steel and Shipbuilding Company and instead a new plan was drawn up for a new company to be formed to replace the United States Shipbuilding Company and this new company would take the "Bethlehem Steel and Shipbuilding Company" name. The new plan would be executed in 1904 but the new company did not take the "Bethlehem Steel and Shipbuilding Company" name. Instead, the new company which would replace the United States Shipping Company took the name Bethlehem Steel Corporation.[12]
