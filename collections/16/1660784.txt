The airport has officially been named after the popular Surinamese politician and former Prime Minister of Suriname Johan Adolf Pengel, but is locally still common named Zanderij. This is parallel to the small village and savannah where it is situated. The airport now has one runway of approximately 3.5Â km and sees an average of 100.000 passengers yearly, mainly on transatlantic flights between Paramaribo and Amsterdam from KLM and Surinam Airways and some regional flights to Belem, Georgetown, Cayenne, Miami and the Caribbean, also with Caribbean Airlines and Insel Air, besides Surinam Airways.
