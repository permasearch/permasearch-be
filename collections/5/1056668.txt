Tina Jordan of Entertainment Weekly expected the book to appeal to both fantasy and thriller fans alike. She predicted that if a sequel is written it will, however, take place in a fantasy setting.[3] Lindsey Losnedahl of the Las Vegas Review-Journal claimed that the book is more a sequel to the Sword of Truth series than a completely new direction. "But Iâ€™m still waiting to see what Goodkind can do outside of the Rahl world, maybe 'The Law of Nines' is just a small step in getting there."[5]
