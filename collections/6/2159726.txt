People who live in large cities have a higher rate of COPD compared to people who live in rural areas.[40] While urban air pollution is a contributing factor in exacerbations, its overall role as a cause of COPD is unclear.[9] Areas with poor outdoor air quality, including that from exhaust gas, generally have higher rates of COPD.[11] The overall effect in relation to smoking, however, is believed to be small.[9]
