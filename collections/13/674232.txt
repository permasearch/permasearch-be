The video finishes with Bowie retreating into a dark wardrobe. In the scenes featuring the wardrobe, Bowie is wearing a diagonally striped suit referencing the back cover of the 1991 CD reissue of the Station to Station album, where he is pictured sitting on the floor drawing the kabbalistic Tree of Life.[17][18] The Tree of Life is also referenced in the Station to Station lyrics, a "magical movement from Kether to Malkuth".[19][20]
