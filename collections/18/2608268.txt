HTML uses a different syntax for code points. Character codes may be specified after ampersand (&) and the number sign (#), and are followed by the semicolon (;). The number can be either in decimal or in hexadecimal. Preceding zeros may be omitted. If the input is in hexadecimal, the number is preceded by an "x". Some characters can also be used by "entity name". Example: The HTML code of the copyright sign U+00A9 (or &copy;) can be: &#169; (decimal input) &#xa9; (hexadecimal input) &copy; (entity name)
