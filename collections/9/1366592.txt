The period gave ancient Greek art ornamental motifs and an interest in animals and monsters that continued to be used for centuries, and were spread to Roman and Etruscan art.  Monumental and figurative sculpture in this style may be called Daedelic, after Daedalus, who was according to legend the founder of Greek sculpture. The period is characterized by a shift from the prevailing Geometric style to a style with different sensibilities, which were inspired by the East. The new style reflected a period of increased cultural interchange in the Aegean world, the intensity of which is sometimes compared to that of the Late Bronze Age.
