The planners of the nation with their prudence planned to set up a loco building factory in the eastern part of a country. In the late 1930s, a committee consisting of M/s Humphries and Shrinivasan was constituted to consider the possibility of establishing a locomotive manufacture unit and its economic facilities. The initial project at Chandmari, a place south to Kalyani in the state of West Bengal, could not mature due to partition, which inevitably necessitated a change of site. This present site at Chittaranjan was chosen after a fresh survey and for this the approval of Railway board was obtained in 1947. Chittaranjan Locomotive Works (CLW) started producing locomotives from the year 1950, the same year the township was formally established! Starting with steam engines, CLW now produces state of the art Electrical engines capable of running at 160 km/h and upgradable up to 225 km/h.
