Saguaros have a relatively long lifespan, often exceeding 150 years. They may grow their first side arm any time from 75–100 years of age, but some never grow any arms. A saguaro without arms is called a spear.  Arms are developed to increase the plant's reproductive capacity, as more apices lead to more flowers and fruit.
