Gottschall Rockshelter (a horizontally shallow cave), located in Muscoda, Wisconsin, contains about forty pictographs. Robert J. Salzer began to excavate the site in 1982, eight years after it had been rediscovered.[72] He identified Panel 5 to be of special interest, since it is a composition containing several figures that seem to be engaged in a single action.[73] Panel 5 is dated with a good measure of confidence to the tenth century A.D.[74] At the outset, Robert L. Hall, the leader in the field, pointed out to Selzer that one of the figures in Panel 5 appeared to have attributes associated with the Red Horn mythology.
