In 1977, The Sword of Shannara was simultaneously released as a trade paperback[Note 1] by Ballantine Books and hardback[Note 2] by Random House.[17][18] The Brothers Hildebrandt, who had previously done illustration work for the work of Tolkien, was asked to make the cover. Greg Hildebrandt remembers the Del Reys as being "obsessed with the project. It was their baby."[19] The novel was a commercial success, becoming the first fantasy fiction novel to appear on The New York Times trade paperback bestseller list.[15][20][21]
