Following the events of "The Other", Spider-Man permanently had some of his abilities increased, including his healing. During Marvel's "Civil War" (after "The Other"), he is ambushed by the Rhino and is injured. However, he heals completely by the end of the issue without medical attention and mentions to Aunt May that he knew he had "always been a fast healer, but lately it seems even more so." During "Civil War", Spider-Man is heavily beaten and drugged, suffering multiple fractures and blood loss at the hands of the Jack O' Lantern but his injuries heal almost completely by the next issue. However, like many superhuman powers, the effectiveness of Spider-Man's abilities varies based on the author and the needs of the story.[volume & issue needed]
