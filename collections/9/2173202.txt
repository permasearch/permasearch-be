After coming out as a lesbian,[26] Patty exclaims "you could see it from space!". There had been many previous hints of her sexuality; she was seen visiting a burlesque house,[29] once remarked, "There goes the last lingering thread of my heterosexuality" after a nude Homer ran past her screaming[30] and she was seen hiding in a closet with Smithers on a parade float during a gay pride parade.[31] In another nod to Patty's sexuality being obvious, Homer sarcastically quipped, "Here's another bomb for ya, Marge: I like beer!" when Marge was shocked at the revelation.
