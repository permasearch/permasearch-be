Henry John Temple was born in his family's Westminster house to the Irish branch of the Temple family on 20 October 1784. Henry was to become The 3rd Viscount Palmerston upon his father's death in 1802. His family derived their title from the Peerage of Ireland, although the 3rd Viscount would almost never visit Ireland. His father was The 2nd Viscount Palmerston (1739–1802), an Anglo-Irish peer, and his mother was Mary (1752–1805), a daughter of Benjamin Mee, a London merchant.[2] From 1792 to 1794, the young future Lord Palmerston accompanied his family on a long Continental tour. Whilst in Italy Palmerston acquired an Italian tutor, who taught him to speak and write fluent Italian.[3] The family rarely visited their huge country estate in the north of County Sligo in the West of Ireland.
