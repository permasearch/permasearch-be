The Identity and Passport Service was renamed HM Passport Office on 13 May 2013 in an effort to reflect the agency's departure from its association with the scrapped National Identity Register and ID cards. The government stated in the press release that "The inclusion of 'Her Majesty's' in the title recognises that passports are the property of the Crown, bear the royal coat of arms and are issued under the royal prerogative."[6]
