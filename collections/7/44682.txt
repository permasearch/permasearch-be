Córdoba reached the coast of Yucatán. The Mayans at Cape Catoche invited the Spanish to land, and the conquistadors read the Requirement of 1513 to them, which offered the natives the protection of the King of Spain, if they would submit to him.

Later, the two prisoners, being misled or misinterpreting the language with information given to the Spanish conquistadors that there was plenty of gold up for grabs.[3] On the western side of the Yucatán Peninsula, the Spanish were attacked at night by Maya chief Mochcouoh (Mochh Couoh), a battle in which fifty men were killed. Córdoba was mortally wounded and only a remnant of his crew returned to Cuba.[27]:15–26
