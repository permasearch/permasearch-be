Major League Baseball implemented the “competitive balance tax” in 1997 to keep a competitive balance in the league. At the beginning of each year, a threshold is set by the Commissioner's Office of Major League Baseball that limits how much a team can spend on their players. In Major League Baseball, the “competitive balance tax” allows teams to go over the threshold, but at a premium. The goal of this is to encourage big spending but to still maintain balance in competition. Major League Baseball's tax has undergone several changes since 1997.[1]
