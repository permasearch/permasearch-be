Scared and unsure of what it is doing to her, she tries to recruit Felix to help, but he has found his biological half-sister Adele. She is a disbarred lawyer whose father admitted to having an affair with a British dancer when he died. Felix's mother died when he was little and the two found each other. Not admitting to the danger she's in, Sarah and Felix coldly dismiss each other. Tracking down Dizzy, she and Art try and reverse track the man in the video. Sarah ends up in a dental clinic thinking they can remove the Maggot-Bot, and a hygienist mistakes her for Beth. The hygienist says she can remove it but is actually a Neolutionist who deflected Beth before, and says the test subjects are lucky to have the Maggot-Bots. Sarah is saved by Ferdinand who kills the hygienist and tells her Susan Duncan is alive. Reconnecting with Siobhan and Felix, they work with Ferdinand who wants to protect Rachel. Sarah tries to get MK to reverse track Rachel's online message but MK disconnects when she hears about Ferdinand. Telling Dizzy they are clones, the two break into MK's trailer and learn MK is Veera from Helsinki. Realizing she has lured Ferdinand to Beth's, she is barely able to convince Veera not to kill him, but Veera refuses to help the still living clones and departs with Ferdinand's money.
