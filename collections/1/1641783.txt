Whatever the nature of his Dream, a young man has the developmental task of giving it greater definition and finding ways to live it out.  It makes a great difference in his growth whether his initial life structure is consonant with and infused by the Dream, or opposed to it.  If the Dream remains unconnected to his life it may simply die, and with it his sense of aliveness and purpose.[18]
