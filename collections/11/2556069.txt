When Toole was unable to resume his position at Dominican in January, the school had to hire another professor.[118] This greatly upset his mother and on January 19, 1969 they had a horrible final argument.[119] He stopped by the house the next day to pick up some things and spoke only to his father, as Thelma was out at the grocery store. He left home for the final time and withdrew $1500 from his saving account.[119] After a week she called the police, but without any evidence to his whereabouts, they took a report and waited for him to surface.[120] Thelma became convinced that Toole's friends the Rickels knew where he was and called them repeatedly, even though they denied knowing where he had gone.[120]
