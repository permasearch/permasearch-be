The development of Unorthodox Jukebox started when Mars wanted to create something unforeseen with the follow-up of his debut album.[9] He began not only by not allowing himself to "get boxed in to any one genre" during the recording sessions for the album, but also by showing the influences of several other music styles "by having the autonomy and luxury of walking into the studio and claim [he feels] like doing a hip-hop, R&B, soul or rock record". Due to the music variety, the singer refused to "pick a lane" for Unorthodox Jukebox.[9] As Mars had a lot of time to create the album, something that didn't happen during his debut,[11] he reportedly had the possibility to develop a musically outstanding product that displayed his music taste and completely revealed his artistry.[8] Because he had been a composer of pop and radio-friendly songs for a long time, it ultimately influenced the style of his debut; however, he didn't have the chance to craft the "sounds and sonics" he wanted to.[8] As a result, Mars hoped to "let loose" and discuss darker, more risquÃ© subject matter, while drawing on the "danger" embraced by pop artists such as Michael Jackson and Prince.[14]
