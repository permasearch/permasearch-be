China has the largest network of high-speed railways in the world and in 2015 it encompassed 19,000 kilometres (12,000 miles) of high-speed rail or 60% of the world's total.[103][104] It is also the world's busiest with an annual ridership of over 1.44 billion in 2016.[38] According to Railway Gazette, the trains between Shijiazhuang and Zhengzhou East have the fastest average operating speed in the world at 283.7 km/h (176.3 mph) as of August 2013[update].[105] The improved mobility and inter connectivity created by these new high speed rail lines has generated a whole new high speed commuter market around some urban areas. Commutes via high speed rail to and from surrounding Hebei and Tianjin into Beijing have become increasingly common, likewise are between the cities surrounding Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou.[106][107]
