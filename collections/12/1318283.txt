In 2008, 18-year-old Joey Logano was scheduled to run several late-season races in preparation for running the full 2009 season. Logano drove the No. 02 (reverse of the 20), with an inverted Home Depot scheme of teammate Tony Stewart's.[61] He was scheduled to make his Sprint Cup debut at Richmond International Raceway,[61] but qualifying was rained out by Hurricane Hanna. The 02 attempted again at Loudon and at Atlanta, but qualifying was rained out in both races as well, leading Logano to make his debut in JGR-affiliated Hall of Fame Racing's No. 96 at Loudon and miss the Atlanta race.[62] Logano made the race in his fourth attempt with Gibbs at Texas,[62] starting last and finishing 40th, several laps down.
