There are different size classes of wind turbines. The smallest having power production less than 10 kW are used in homes, farms and remote applications whereas intermediate wind turbines (10-250 kW ) are useful for village power, hybrid systems and distributed power. The world's largest wind turbine, an 8-MW turbine located at the Burbo Bank Extension wind farm in Liverpool Bay, United Kingdom, was installed in 2016.[7] Utility-scale turbines (larger than one megawatt) are used in central station wind farms, distributed power and community wind.[8]
