In July 2013, Somerset House hosted an exhibition dedicated to the food of Ferran AdriÃ  and elBulli. The exhibition looked back over the evolution of the restaurant's laboratory and kitchen.[25] Multimedia displays examined the methods behind the creation of signature dishes and original sketches and hand written notes of the recipe creations were on display with plasticine models of the dishes that were served.[26]
