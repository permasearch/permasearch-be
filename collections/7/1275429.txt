Coppola had a certain amount of personal affinity with the short-lived legacy of Preston Tucker. His father, Carmine Coppola, had been one of the original investors in Tucker stock and purchased one of the cars off the production line.[16] Coppola included the involvement of Preston Tucker's children, grandchildren and members of the Tucker Estate during the development of Tucker in the late 1970s, as well as during filming in 1987.[17] Coppola and Lucas acknowledged that they purposely intended to portray Tucker in an entirely sympathetic way.[5] Both filmmakers each owned two Tuckers,[18] although Lucas eventually sold one of his cars in September 2005 for $385,500.[12] The Tucker Automobile Club made up of a legion of Tucker owners and collectors pronounced in their trade journal, TACA, that the "basic theme of the movie is quite accurate..." although "the film compresses time and often takes artistic license with facts in order to more effectively present the story."[18]
