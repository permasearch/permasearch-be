Irises are perennial plants, growing from creeping rhizomes (rhizomatous irises) or, in drier climates, from bulbs (bulbous irises). They have long, erect flowering stems which may be simple or branched, solid or hollow, and flattened or have a circular cross-section. The rhizomatous species usually have 3â€“10 basal sword-shaped leaves growing in dense clumps. The bulbous species have cylindrical, basal leaves.
