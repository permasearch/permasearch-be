In warm-blooded animals, such as brown rats, sheep, and dogs, T. gondii has also been shown to be sexually transmitted,[54][55][56] and it is hypothesized that it may be sexually transmitted in humans, although not yet proven.[57]  Although T. gondii can infect, be transmitted by, and asexually reproduce within humans and virtually all other warm-blooded animals, the parasite can sexually reproduce only within the intestines of members of the cat family (felids).[28]   Felids are therefore the definitive hosts of T. gondii; all other hosts (like human or other mammals) are intermediate hosts.
