The Florida–Tennessee football rivalry, sometimes referred to as the "Third Saturday in September",[1] is an American college football rivalry between the Florida Gators football team of the University of Florida and Tennessee Volunteers football team of the University of Tennessee.  The Gators and Vols first met on the gridiron in 1916, and have competed in the same conference since Florida and Tennessee joined the now-defunct Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association in 1910 and 1895, respectively.  However, a recognized rivalry did not develop until the early 1990s due to the infrequency of earlier meetings; in the first seventy-six years (1916–91) of the series, the two teams played just twenty-one times.
