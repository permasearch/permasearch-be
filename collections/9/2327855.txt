Vine (/vaÉªn/) was a short-form video hosting service where users could share six-second-long looping video clips. The service was founded in June 2012, and American microblogging website Twitter acquired it in October 2012, just before its official launch. Users' videos were published through Vine's social network and could be shared on other services such as Facebook and Twitter. Vine's app could also be used to browse through videos posted by other users, along with groups of videos by theme, and trending, or popular, videos. Vine competed with other social media services such as Instagram and Mobli.
