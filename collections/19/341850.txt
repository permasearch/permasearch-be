Huston later changed his opinion of the Hollywood Ten. In a 1952 letter, he told a colleague: "It was a long time afterward that I discovered the real reasons behind the behavior of the 'Ten' in Washington, and when I did I was shocked beyond words. It seems that some of them had already testified in California, and that their testimony had been false. They had said they were not Communists and now, to have admitted it to the press would have been to lay themselves open to charges of perjury ... And so, when I believed them to have engaged to defend the freedom of the individual, they were really looking after their own skins. Had I so much as suspected such a thing, you may be sure I would have washed my hands of them instantly. But, as I said before, the revelation was a long time coming."[21]
