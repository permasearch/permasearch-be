The Silicon Valley of India is a nickname of the Indian city of bangalore . It was named so because Bangalore is on the Mysore Plateau, the area is also sometimes referred to as "Silicon Plateau". The name signifies Bangalore's status as a hub for information technology companies in India and is a comparative reference to the original Silicon Valley (San Francisco Bay Area, California), the major hub for information technology companies in the United States and in the world. One of the earliest mentions of this sobriquet occurred in late 2012 by CNN.[1] The more prevalent application of the nickname Bangalore began in the 1990s[2] based on a concentration of firms specializing in research and development (R&D), electronics and software production.
