Brand-new Riverfront Stadium had been open for only two weeks on July 14, 1970 when Rose was involved in one of the most infamous plays in All-Star Game history. Facing the California Angels' Clyde Wright in the 12th inning, Rose singled and advanced to second on another single by the Los Angeles Dodgers' Billy Grabarkewitz. The Chicago Cubs' Jim Hickman then singled sharply to center. Amos Otis' throw went past Cleveland Indians catcher Ray Fosse, as Rose barreled over Fosse to score the winning run. Fosse suffered a fractured and separated shoulder, which initially went undiagnosed until the following year.[9] Fosse continued to hit for average (he finished the season at .307), but with diminished powerâ€”he had 16 home runs before the break but only two after. He played through the 1979 season, but never approached his first-year numbers.[10] The collision also caused Rose to miss three games with a bruised knee.[9]
