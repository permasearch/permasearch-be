Before the event aired live on pay-per-view, The Hurricane and Rosey defeated La Résistance (Sylvain Grenier and Robért Conway) in a dark match. The first match was between the team of Eugene and William Regal and Christian and Tyson Tomko for the World Tag Team Championship. Eugene executed a dropkick on Tomko to retain the title.[22][23]
