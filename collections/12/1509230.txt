In 1971, Professor Michel F. Lechat, an epidemiologist at the UniversitÃ© catholique de Louvain, initiated a research programme to study health issues in disaster situations. Two years later he established CRED as a non-profit institution with international status. Since 1980, CRED has been a World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre.
