In Alien Force and Ultimate Alien, Cannonbolt's armor is more curved, the stripe on his torso is gone, his eyes are now green, and the Omnitrix symbol is on his chest. While Ben possessed the Ultimatrix, he was able to evolve Cannonbolt into Ultimate Cannonbolt with his abilities advanced while his now-metallic armor has cylindrical studs that turn into spikes when he goes into his ball form. Ben first used Ultimate Cannonbolt in "Too Hot to Handle" to hold Kevin and P'andor, allowing Kevin to seal P'andor back into his suit.
