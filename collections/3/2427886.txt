The Sierra Madre Oriental mountains in eastern Mexico are a southern extension of the Rocky Mountains.[36][37] The Sierra Madre Oriental spans about 1,000Â km (600 miles). Mexico's Gulf Coastal Plain lies to the east of the range, between the mountains and the Gulf of Mexico coast. The Mexican Plateau lies to the west of the range.
