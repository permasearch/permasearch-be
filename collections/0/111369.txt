During one of their sessions, Lecter gives Mason PCP and tells him to peel off his own face with a piece of broken mirror. In a state of drug-induced euphoria, Mason complies, and afterwards feeds the pieces to his dogs, except for his nose, which he himself eats. Lecter then tells Mason to demonstrate autoerotic asphyxiation; Mason hangs himself and breaks his neck. He survives the ordeal, but is left disfigured – losing his lips, nose, cheeks, eyelids and left eye – and paralyzed from the neck down.
