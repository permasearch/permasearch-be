Brewster had a four-episode arc between 2008 and 2009 on the NBC television series Chuck, as Jill Roberts, the title character's ex-girlfriend from Stanford. She returned to the role of Mia Toretto in Fast & Furious (2009), the fourth film of The Fast and the Furious franchise.[29] On the growth of her character over the course of the series, Brewster explained in an interview with AskMen.com: "In the first one I’m more of a wallflower and it's much more of a girlfriend-type role, but in [the new movie] I’m more of a woman. She’s far more tough. I deal with the repercussions of living in my brother’s world."[30] The film earned negative reviews upon its premiere, but was a box office success, grossing US$363 million globally.[31]
