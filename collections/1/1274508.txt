Later in the year, Greg's mom lets him know that Rachel has been moved into a hospice, which Greg originally believes to be for more treatment, before learning that she is in hospital to die, which only depresses him further. Taking pity on him, Madison invites him to the prom. However, after dressing up in a tuxedo, he decides not to go to pick up Madison but instead goes to the hospital where Rachel is receiving hospice care. During the journey to the hospital, Greg is asked by the limo driver if he loves Rachel, a question he finds himself unable to answer. To the hospital, he brings his iPhone and a portable projector and places a courisage around Rachelâ€™s wrist before running the film he made for Rachel on the front wall of her room, lying beside her as they did when they watched his other films. Rachel is moved to tears by the movie. However, while viewing the film, she falls into a coma, dying a few hours later.
