Lena descends into the hole in the floor and finds Ventress, who has also begun to mutate. Ventress tells Lena the forces at work will eventually encompass "everything", before disintegrating into a fiery nebulous structure that absorbs a drop of blood from Lena's face and creates a humanoid being. Lena attacks it, and attempts to escape the lighthouse but the being stops her, mirroring her movements and knocking her out. The struggle resumes when Lena awakens, the being gradually transforming into an identical copy of her. Lena exploits  its behavior to place a phosphorus grenade in its hands and activates it before fleeing. The being is set ablaze, flames engulf the lighthouse, the various constructs in the area collapse, and the Shimmer dissipates to nothing.
