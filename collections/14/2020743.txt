Producer Anthony Hinds purchased the rights to Matheson's novel for Hammer Productions. Matheson wrote a script, but the British censors would not allow its production, so Hinds sold the script to Robert Lippert. Lippert originally told Matheson that Fritz Lang was to direct, but eventually Sidney Salkow was chosen. To save money, the film was shot in Italy with a predominantly Italian cast and crew.[3]
