Australian literature grew slowly in the decades following European settlement though Indigenous oral traditions, many of which have since been recorded in writing, are much older.[299] 19th-century writers such as Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson captured the experience of the bush using a distinctive Australian vocabulary. Their works are still popular; Paterson's bush poem "Waltzing Matilda" (1895) is regarded as Australia's unofficial national anthem.[300] Miles Franklin is the namesake of Australia's most prestigious literary prize, awarded annually to the best novel about Australian life.[301] Its first recipient, Patrick White, went on to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1973.[302] Australian winners of the Booker Prize include Peter Carey, Thomas Keneally and Richard Flanagan.[303] Author David Malouf, playwright David Williamson and poet Les Murray are also renowned literary figures.[304][305]
