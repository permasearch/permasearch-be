In normal circumstances, absent telomerase, if a cell divides recursively, at some point the progeny reach their Hayflick limit,[19] which is believed to be between 50â€“70 cell divisions. At the limit the cells become senescent and cell division stops.[20] Telomerase allows each offspring to replace the lost bit of DNA allowing the cell line to divide without ever reaching the limit. This same unbounded growth is a feature of cancerous growth.[21]
