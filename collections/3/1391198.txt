The Nahuatl words (aztecatl [asˈtekat͡ɬ], singular)[8] and (aztecah [asˈtekaʔ], plural)[8] mean "people from Aztlan,"[9] a mythical place of origin for several ethnic groups in central Mexico. The term was not used as an endonym by Aztecs themselves, but it is found in the different migration accounts of the Mexica, where it describes the different tribes who left Aztlan together. In one account of the journey from Aztlan, Huitzilopochtli, the tutelary deity of the Mexica tribe, tells his followers on the journey that "now, no longer is your name Azteca, you are now Mexitin [Mexica]".[10]
