Spooge (played by David Ury) is a drug addict who steals meth from Skinny Pete at knifepoint.[37] Jesse later accosts Spooge in the latter's home as Jesse attempts to retrieve the stolen drugs and/or cash payment. Spooge attempts to repay Jesse by breaking open an ATM he has stolen from a convenience store. While attempting to drill into the machine from the bottom, he begins verbally abusing his girlfriend (played by Dale Dickey), who tips the ATM, crushing Spooge's head and killing him instantly. Jesse's associates and rivals attribute Spooge's death to Jesse for a short period, until the woman confesses to the murder. Spooge had a son, whose complete neglect caused Jesse to call 911 and leave the phone line open to allow police to trace the call.[57]
