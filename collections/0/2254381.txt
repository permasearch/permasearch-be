Week 6: In Springfield, Illinois, the two teams were only allowed to collect $5 bills as the form of payment, requiring all dishes to be priced at either $5, $10, or $15. The final stop was in Chicago, Illinois. The final challenge was to sell 50 dishes customized to each neighborhood in Chinatown, Little Italy, and Greektown. After selling all 150 dishes (120 dishes in Pho Nomenal Dumplings' case), they had to be first across the finish line at Buckingham Fountain.
