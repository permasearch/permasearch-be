After moving to Charlottesville, The Judge Advocate General's School was initially located in Clark Hall with the University of Virginia Law School, then behind Clark Hall in what is now called Kerchof Hall.[5] In 1975, the school relocated to the university's North Grounds, moving at the same time as the law school. The building, and the adjacent law school building, were designed by Hugh Stubbins & Associates with Rawlings, Wilson, and Fraher.[6] An addition to the building, designed by Bohlin, Powell, Larkin, and Cywinski in collaboration with Johnson, Craven, and Gibson, was completed in 1991.[6]
