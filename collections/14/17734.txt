Soyuz spacecraft used for crew rotation also serve as lifeboats for emergency evacuation; they are replaced every six months and have been used once to remove excess crew after the Columbia disaster.[255] Expeditions require, on average, 2,722Â kg of supplies, and as of 9 March 2011[update], crews had consumed a total of around 22,000 meals.[4] Soyuz crew rotation flights and Progress resupply flights visit the station on average two and three times respectively each year,[256] with the ATV and HTV planned to visit annually from 2010 onwards.[citation needed] Cygnus and Dragon were contracted to fly cargo to the station after retirement of the NASA Shuttle.[257][258]
