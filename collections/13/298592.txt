The pneumatic thermostat was invented by Warren Johnson in 1895[9] soon after he invented the electric thermostat. In 2009, Harry Sim was awarded a patent for a pneumatic-to-digital interface[10] that allows pneumatically controlled buildings to be integrated with building automation systems to provide similar benefits as direct digital control (DDC).
