Influenza viruses bind through hemagglutinin onto sialic acid sugars on the surfaces of epithelial cells, typically in the nose, throat, and lungs of mammals, and intestines of birds (Stage 1 in infection figure).[74] After the hemagglutinin is cleaved by a protease, the cell imports the virus by endocytosis.[75]
