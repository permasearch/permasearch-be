The album represents a departure from the country music of Swift's previous albums, and is described by the singer as her "first documented official pop album."[4] Contrasting her previous endeavors, the production of 1989 consists of drum programming, synthesizers, pulsating bass, processed backing vocals, and guitars. 1989 received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics and it was ranked as one of the best albums of 2014 by several publications, including Billboard, Time, and Rolling Stone.
