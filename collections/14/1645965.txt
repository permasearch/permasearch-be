John Bettis has said that Richard Carpenter kept calling him, raving about the guitar solo.  He was wondering why Richard was going on about the solo until he heard it.  The lyricist said he cried when he first heard the song because he had never heard an electric guitar sound like that.  He said Tony Peluso "had a certain almost cello sounding guitar growl that worked against the wonderful melancholia of that song". He went on to say the "way it growls at you, especially at the end" was unbelievable.[5]
