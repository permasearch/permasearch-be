The maiden issue of The Torres Torch, the official school paper, was published in 1930. In 1937, the school formally occupied the Constabulary Barracks in Gagalangin, where it is located today. With the outbreak of World War II in 1941, the school ceased operation, and the buildings were redeployed as garrisons. During this period, all school records were destroyed.
