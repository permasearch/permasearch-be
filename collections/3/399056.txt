In June 2001, Kentucky Bluegrass was laid on the field,[6] at half the height of most NFL field's 2-inch (51 mm) grass. The field is heated from below, using a mixture of antifreeze and hot water, to keep the field at around 62 °F (17 °C) in order to keep the grass growing year-round.[31] The field was re-surfaced multiple times, until the synthetic-enhanced Desso GrassMaster was installed in 2003.[58] Debate continued over the surface after players began slipping during game play. Despite this players and coaches of Pitt, the Steelers, and their opponents supported keeping the current turf.[59]
