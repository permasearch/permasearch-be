Most outlaw motorcycle clubs do not allow women to become full-patch members.[38] Rather, in some 1%er clubs, women have in the past been portrayed as submissive or victims to the men,[39] treated as property, forced into prostitution or street-level drug trafficking, and often physically and sexually abused,[40] their roles as being those of obedient followers and their status as objects. These women are claimed to pass over any pay they receive to their partners or sometimes to the entire club.[41] This appears to make these groups extremely gender segregated.[42] This has not always been the case, as during the 1950s and 1960s, some Hells Angels chapters had women members.[43]
