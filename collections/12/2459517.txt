The native inhabitants of Utapau can be divided into two distinct species. The taller, more highly evolved Pau'ans have deeply lined, ash-colored faces, gaunt builds, and wear thick, tightly fitting clothes. The smaller Utai make up the working class. They have rounded faces with distended eyes, and have a short, stocky build.
