Women's suffrage in Canada occurred at different times in different jurisdictions. By the close of 1918, all the Canadian provinces except Quebec had granted full suffrage to women. Municipal suffrage was granted in 1884 to property-owning widows and spinsters in the provinces of Quebec and Ontario; in 1886, in the province of New Brunswick, to all property-owning women except those whose husbands were voters; in Nova Scotia, in 1886; and in Prince Edward Island, in 1888, to property-owning widows and spinsters. In 1916, full suffrage was given to women in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia.[1] Women in Quebec did not receive full suffrage until 1940.[2]
