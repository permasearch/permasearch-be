Photinus pyralis, known by the common names common eastern firefly[2] and big dipper firefly,[3] is the most common species of firefly in North America.[4] P. pyralis is a flying and light-producing beetle with a light organ on the ventral side of its abdomen. This organism is sometimes incorrectly classified as Photuris pyralis, which likely results from mistaking the similar-sounding genus Photuris.
