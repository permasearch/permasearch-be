Many people with hepatitis will prefer bed rest, though it is not necessary to avoid all physical activity while recovering.[14] A high-calorie diet is recommended.[14] Many people develop nausea and cannot tolerate food later in the day, so the bulk of intake may be concentrated in the earlier part of the day.[14] In the acute phase of the disease, intravenous feeding may be needed if patients cannot tolerate food and have poor oral intake subsequent to nausea and vomiting.[14]
