Doctors in the United Kingdom are taught that the tempo of the tune is the rate at which to apply cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Alternative tunes used for this purpose include "Nellie the Elephant", Queen's "Another One Bites The Dust" and the Bee Gees' hit "Stayin' Alive" which have the same tempo.[89][90][91]
