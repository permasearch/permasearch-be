Flash forward to a scene of 7-yr old Isabelle playing by the ocean. Dixon arrives, and Vaughn and Sydney greet him, with Sydney carrying a toddler son named Jack. Dixon asks Sydney for some help in an assignment, but Vaughn suggests discussing this after dinner. Meanwhile, Isabelle finds wooden building blocks -- the same ones that were used in the Project Christmas tests. Isabelle assembles the blocks effortlessly and successfully, but then knocks them down nonchalantly and runs out with Sydney, Vaughn and Dixon for a walk by the beach.
