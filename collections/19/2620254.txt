A week later Haggen filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and began the process of closing all but a few dozen 'core' stores in the Pacific Northwest.[80][81]  Albertsons would buy back 33 of the stores being sold at auction.[82]  In January 2016, Albertsons settled the lawsuit, agreeing to pay $5.75 million to Haggen, and subsequently reached an agreement to acquire the remaining 29 'core' Haggen stores located in Washington and Oregon for $106 million, the deal being approved on March 29, 2016.[77] As part of the deal, 15 stores would still operate under the Haggen banner, with the rest converted to Albertsons locations.
