Boyle's paternal grandparents were Irish immigrants, and his mother was of mostly French and British Isles descent.[5][6] He was raised Catholic and attended St. Francis de Sales School and West Philadelphia Catholic High School For Boys. After graduating high school in 1953, Boyle spent three years as a seminarian with the De La Salle Brothers, a Catholic teaching order. He lived in a house of studies with other novices and earned a BA from La Salle University in Philadelphia in 1957, but left the order because he did not feel called to religious life.[7]
