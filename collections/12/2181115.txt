The article on the Morrill tariff contains a lengthy section on its relation to the origins of the Civil War. Yet I see that it is barely mentioned in this article. I'd like to encourage editors of these two articles to find some agreement on its importance and on the best place to have a long review its influence. Cheers, -Willmcw 00:48, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)
