Although set in the San Francisco Bay Area, Monk is for the most part shot elsewhere except for occasional exteriors featuring city landmarks. The pilot episode was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia, with some location shooting in San Francisco, and the subsequent season one episodes were shot in the Toronto, Ontario, area.[28] Most of the episodes from seasons two through six were filmed in the Los Angeles, California, area, including on-stage at Ren-Mar Studios for seasons two through five and at Paramount Studios for season six. These include the sets for Monk's apartment, the police station and Stottlemeyer's office, Dr. Kroger's office and Natalie's house.[29] In season two, episode eight, a building for the Toronto Star can also be seen in a cut scene.
