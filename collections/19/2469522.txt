At the end of the battle, the victorious Pandava brothers argued among themselves as to who was responsible for their victory. Krishna suggested that Barbarika's head, which had watched the whole battle should be allowed to judge. Barbarika's head suggested that it was Krishna alone who was responsible for the victory. Barbarika replies, â€œAll I could see were two things. One, a divine chakra spinning all around the battle field, killing all those who were not on the side of Dharma. The other was the draupadi who has taken her original form of Goddess Mahakali, who spread out her tongue on the battle field and consumed all the sinners as her sacrifice". Listening to this, Pandavas realized that it was Lord Narayana and Goddess Parvati (Mahakali) who actually cleaned up the world from Adharma, and the Pandavas were mere instruments.
