Lil Wayne's third album 500 Degreez, released in 2002, followed the format of his previous two, with significant contributions from the Hot Boys and Mannie Fresh. While being certified gold like its predecessor,[22] it also failed to match the success of his debut.[7] The title was a reference to the recently estranged Hot Boys member Juvenile's recording, 400 Degreez.[24] The lead single was "Way of Life" which failed to match the success of his previous singles. After the release of 500 Degreez, Wayne was featured on the single "Neva Get Enuf" by 3LW.[25]
