A 2017 study of mtDNA polymorphisms from Minoan remains published in the journal Nature concluded that the Minoans were genetically closely related with the Mycenaean Greeks, and that both are closely related, but not identical, to modern Greek populations. The same study also stated that at least three-quarters of DNA of both the Minoans and the Myceneans came from the first Neolithic-era farmers that lived in Western Anatolia and the Aegean Sea.[134] [135].
