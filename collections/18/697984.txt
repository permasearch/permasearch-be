By the mid 1700s the French settlers were well established with a population around 70,000, mainly due to natural increase.[3][4] The European population had grown slowly under French rule.[98][99][100] The British Thirteen Colonies to the south along the Atlantic coast grew in population from natural increase and more new settlers from Europe. By 1760, almost 1.6 million people lived in the British colonies, a ratio of approximately twenty-three to one compared to New France.[101] The population of the New England colonies in 1760, was just shy of 450,000, a ratio 6.5 to 1.
