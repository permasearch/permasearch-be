Price eventually caught the CORE station wagon heading west toward Union, Mississippi, on state highway 492. Soon he stopped them and escorted the three civil right workers north on Highway 19, back in the direction of Philadelphia. The caravan turned west on County Road 515 (also known as Rock Cut Road), and stopped at the secluded intersection of County Road 515 and County Road 284 (32°39′40.45″N 89°2′4.13″W﻿ / ﻿32.6612361°N 89.0344806°W﻿ / 32.6612361; -89.0344806). There all three were shot by Jordan and Roberts. Chaney was also beaten before his death.
