Tim Hortons' international presence includes outlets in the United States and one that was on a military base outside Kandahar, Afghanistan,[67][68][69] although this latter outlet was principally intended for Canadian Armed Forces and allied military personnel. Two more outlets are located in military bases at Fort Knox, Kentucky,[70] and Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia.[71] TDL Group recorded $1.48Â billion in sales in 2005[72] and Tim Hortons' products have become available in Ireland and Scotland at some SPAR convenience stores as of 2006[73] and Tesco supermarkets.[74] Tim Hortons' other international expansions include a small outlet at the Dublin Zoo. Tim Hortons also made a deal with the Spar convenience store chain in the UK and Ireland, resulting in Tim Hortons coffee and doughnuts being sold at small self-service counters in 50 Spar stores as of April 30, 2007.[75] It also has a partnership with Tops Markets in the United States.[76]
