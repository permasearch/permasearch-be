From 1979 until 2008, the tournament was sponsored by Stella Artois, and thus called the Stella Artois Championships.[12] In 2009 the tournament was renamed the Aegon Championships following a comprehensive sponsorship deal between Lawn Tennis Association and Aegon, which also led to renaming of Birmingham and Eastbourne grass court events.[13] In 2018, Fever-Tree began sponsoring the tournament â€“ their first title sponsorship of a sporting event.
