Folk rock singer Tim Roseâ€™s slower version of the song (recorded in 1966 and claimed to be Rose's arrangement of a wholly traditional song)[8] inspired the first single by the Jimi Hendrix Experience.[7] The ex-bassist for the Animals, Chas Chandler, who was now focusing on managing other acts, had also seen Rose performing the song at the Cafe Wha? in New York City and was looking for an artist to record a rock version of "Hey Joe".[39][40] Chandler discovered Jimi Hendrix, who had also been playing at the Cafe Wha? in 1966 and performing an arrangement of "Hey Joe" inspired by Rose's rendition.[40] Chandler decided to take Hendrix with him to England in September 1966, where he would subsequently turn the guitarist into a star.[39] Rose re-recorded "Hey Joe" in the 1990s, re-titling it "Blue Steel .44"[41] and again claimed the song as his own arrangement of a traditional song.
