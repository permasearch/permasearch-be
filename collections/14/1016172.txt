Around the start of the 20th century American explorer Theodore M. Davis had the excavation permit in this valley. His team (led mostly by Edward R. Ayrton) discovered several royal and non-royal tombs (including KV43, KV46 and KV57). In 1907 they discovered the possible Amarna Period cache in KV55. After finding what they thought was all that remained of the burial of Tutankhamun (items recovered from KV54 and KV58), it was announced that the valley was completely explored and that no further burials were to be found. Davis's 1912 publication, The Tombs of Harmhabi and TouatÃ¢nkhamanou closes with the comment, "I fear that the Valley of Kings is now exhausted."[46]
