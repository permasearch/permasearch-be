Philip also had a highly spirited black colt that no one could ride.  The Oracle of Delphi stated whoever could ride this horse would conquer the world, but despite many attempts neither Philip nor any of his generals could mount the horse.  His son, Alexander, later to be called the Great, succeeded as he realized that the horse was afraid of his own shadow.  Philip gave the horse Bucephalus to Alexander, who took the steed on his conquest of Asia.
