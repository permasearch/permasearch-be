3. Fred and Rose West; in February 1994, police call at the Gloucester home of 52-year-old builder Fred West, investigating the disappearance of his daughter Heather, who was last seen alive in 1987 at the age of 16. They were already familiar with Fred West, having investigated him 18 months earlier for the alleged rape of another teenage daughter. Within weeks, police find the bodies of Heather West and seven other women and girls buried at the house. Fred is charged with the murders, and by the end of April the police have also arrested his wife Rosemary and charged her with the murders. Police had also discovered that Fred's first wife Rena and eight-year-old daughter Charmaine had both disappeared in the early 1970s without being reported missing. Rena's body was soon found buried in a local field, and Charmaine's was buried at the West's previous home in Midland Road, Gloucester. Fred was eventually charged with a total of 12 murders, and Rose with 10 murders. Fred committed suicide on remand at Winson Green Prison in Birmingham on 1 January 1995, and Rose went on trial that autumn at Winchester Crown Court. She was found guilty of all 10 murders and sentenced to life imprisonment with a recommendation that she should never be released. At Rose's trial, police heard from a former lodger of the Wests, who told of the sexual abuse that she had suffered at their hands - and for which they had actually both been convicted - two decades earlier. During police questioning, Fred West admitted that he had committed around 30 murders since the 1960s, but police have so far been unable to establish a link between the Wests and any other unsolved murders or disappearances, even though the tabloid media have been to speculate over the years that various other missing women may have fallen victim to the pair.
