Under Nicolás de Ovando y Cáceres' governorship, the Indians were made to work in the gold mines, "where they were grossly overworked, mistreated, and underfed," according to Pons.  By 1503, the Spanish Crown legalized the distribution of Indians to work the mines as part of the encomienda system.  According to Pons, "Once the Indians entered the mines, hunger and disease literally wiped them out."  By 1508 the Indian population of about 400,000 was reduced to 60,000, and by 1514, only 26,334 remained.  About half were located in the mining towns of Concepcion, Santiago, Santo Domingo, and Buenaventura.  The repartimiento of 1514 accelerated emigration of the Spanish colonists, coupled with the exhaustion of the mines.  In 1516, a smallpox epidemic killed an additional 8,000, of the remaining 11,000 Indians, in one month.  By 1519, according to Pons, "Both the gold economy and the Indian population became extinct at the same time."[40][20]:191–192
