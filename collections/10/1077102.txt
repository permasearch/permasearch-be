In September 2004, Paige began a weekly Sunday afternoon radio show, Elaine Paige on Sunday,[44] between 1 and 3 PM on BBC Radio 2, featuring music from musical theatre and film.[69] The 400th edition was broadcast on Sunday 29 July 2012. In an unfavourable review, the show was described by Elisabeth Mahoney of The Guardian as "a chilly, alienating listening experience" and a "rare wrong move" on the part of Radio 2.[70] Lisa Martland of The Stage agreed that "it is by far the music that brings me back to the programme ... and not her lightweight presenting style".[71] However, the show regularly attracts 3 million listeners,[34] and interviews are also featured each week.[72] Paige also focused on television appearances, playing Dora Bunner in the 2005 ITV adaptation of Agatha Christie's A Murder Is Announced in the Marple series, before performing a guest role as a post mistress in Where the Heart Is.[73] The episode of Marple was watched by 7.78 million viewers.[74]
