Beth Johnson of Entertainment Weekly was also favorable, noting the song to feature a "silky groove". Johnson also observed: "Considering the dustbins filled with movie stars' vanity discs, why expect this actress' recording debut to be hit-bound? Well, surprise, surprise."[2] Elysa Gardner of the Los Angeles Times described the track as an "exotic hip hop" workout.[31] Vibe magazine writer Dream Hampton called the song "sweet" and "upbeat", and commented on Lopez's "strong" vocals.[32] Brian McCollum of the Rome News-Tribune called "If You Had My Love" one of the year's most "infectious" singles.[33] Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush praised it as a "silky-smooth", "confident" song that "established her as more than just an actress who was 'dabbling' in music [...] Her voice may be thin, but she chose a song that worked with her vocal limitations. It's [a] semi-synthy, mid-tempo, contempo R&B pop that's flawlessly executed."[34] A reporter from the International Business Times called the song "radio-friendly".[35] In a review of Lopez's remix album J to tha Lâ€“O! The Remixes (2002), Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine praised the Dark Child remix of "If You Had My Love," which utilized a "delectable" interpolation of Michael Jackson's "Liberian Girl".[36]
