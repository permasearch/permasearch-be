Sloths move only when necessary and even then very slowly. They usually move at an average speed of 4 m per minute, but can move at a marginally higher speed of 4.5 m (15 ft), if they are in immediate danger from a predator. While they sometimes sit on top of branches, they usually eat, sleep, and even give birth hanging from branches. They sometimes remain hanging from branches even after death. On the ground, the maximum speed of sloths is 3 m per minute. Sloths are surprisingly strong swimmers and can reach speeds of 13.5 m (45 ft) per minute.[28] They use their long arms to paddle through the water and can cross rivers and swim between islands.[29] Sloths can reduce their already slow metabolism even further and slow their heart rate to less than a third of normal, allowing them to hold their breath underwater for up to 40 minutes.[30]
