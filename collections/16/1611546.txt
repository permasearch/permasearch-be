Between seasons, a severe financial crisis then struck and the original company formed in 1898 was 'wound up'. A new limited company named 'Portsmouth City Football Club Limited' was promptly formed to take over from "The Portsmouth Football and Athletic Company" and the club was saved after substantial guarantees were offered by the new board of directors, especially by Mr George Lewin Oliver, who had been also been a founding member and director of the original 1898 company. George Oliver succeeded to become Portsmouth chairman in 1912.[13]
