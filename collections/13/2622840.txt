The Commission employs 25,000[26] people and the Parliament employs about 6,000 people.[27] Because of this concentration, Brussels is a preferred location for any move towards a single seat for Parliament.[28][29] Despite it not formally being the "capital" of the EU, some commentators see the fact that Brussels enticed an increasing number of Parliament's sessions to the city, in addition to the main seats of the other two main political institutions, as making Brussels the de facto capital of the EU.[30] Brussels is frequently labelled as the 'capital' of the EU, particularly in publications by local authorities, the Commission and press.[31][32][33][34][35][36] Indeed, Brussels interprets the 1992 agreement on seats (details below) as declaring Brussels as the capital.[31]
