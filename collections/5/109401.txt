When the Bureau of Investigation (BOI) was established in 1908, its head was called the Chief of the Bureau of Investigation.[13] It was changed to the Director of the Bureau of Investigation in the term of William J. Flynn (1919â€“1921), and to its current name when the BOI was renamed FBI in 1935.
