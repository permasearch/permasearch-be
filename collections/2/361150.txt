Ik Oankar, iconically represented as ੴ in the Sri Guru Granth Sahib (although sometimes spelt out in full as ਏਕੰਕਾਰੁ) is the statement of singularity in Sikhism, that is 'there is one God'.[103][104] The phrase is a compound of the numeral one (ik) and onkar, states Doniger, canonically understood in Sikhism to refer to "absolute monotheistic unity of God".[105] Ik Oankar has a prominent position at the head of the Mul Mantar and the opening words of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib.[105]
