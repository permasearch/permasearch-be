Gallia Belgica (Belgic Gaul) was a province of the Roman empire located in the north-eastern part of Roman Gaul, in which Belgium is situated today. In 50BC after the conquest by Julius Caesar during his Gallic Wars, it became one of the three main provinces of Gaul (known as the Tres Galliae the other two being Gallia Aquitania and Gallia Lugdunensis).[1] An official Roman province was later created by emperor Augustus in 22 BC.
