Some languages include the functionality of the standard C library in their own libraries. The library may be adapted to better suit the language's structure, but the operational semantics are kept similar. The C++ language, for example, includes the functionality of the C standard library in the namespace std (e.g., std::printf, std::atoi, std::feof), in header files with similar names to the C ones (cstdio, cmath, cstdlib, etc.). Other languages that take similar approaches are D, Perl, Ruby and the main implementation of Python known as CPython. In Python 2, for example, the built-in file objects are defined as "implemented using C's stdio package",[37] so that the available operations (open, read, write, etc.) are expected to have the same behavior as the corresponding C functions. Rust has a crate called libc which allows several C functions, structs, and other type definitions to be used.[38]
