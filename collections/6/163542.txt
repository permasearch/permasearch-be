Following the announcement, initial impressions from technology and watch industry observers were varied; the watch was praised by some for its "design, potential capabilities and eventual usefulness",[79] while others offered criticism of these same aspects.[79] Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen said he "can't wait" to try it,[80] and Steve Jobs' biographer Walter Isaacson described it as "extremely cool" and an example of future technology that is "much more embedded into our lives".[81] However, Evan Dashevsky of PC Magazine said it offered nothing new in terms of functionality compared to the Moto 360, except the customizable vibration notifications.[82] In November 2014, Apple Watch was listed by Time as one of the 25 Best Inventions of 2014.[83]
