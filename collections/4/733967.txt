The back of the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL is made from aluminum with a thin "premium coating" of plastic and has a top section made from glass to provide wireless transmissivity.[5] Unlike the original Pixel XL, which was simply an enlarged version of the Pixel design with no other changes, the Pixel 2 XL's external design differs from its smaller sibling, employing a taller 18:9 P-OLED display instead of the Pixel 2's 16:9 AMOLED.
