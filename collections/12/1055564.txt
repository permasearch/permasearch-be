To assure their selection to the U.S. Olympic team, wrestlers must claim a top spot of each division at the 2016 Olympic Trials (April 8 to 10) in Iowa City, Iowa. Among them were London 2012 gold medalist Jordan Burroughs and World champions Helen Maroulis, Kyle Snyder and Adeline Gray. On May 11, 2016, Frank Molinaro, who finished third in men's freestyle 65Â kg at the final meet in Istanbul, had been awarded a final Olympic spot on the U.S. wrestling team after doping violations were discovered among the qualifiers.[120]
