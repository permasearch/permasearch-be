In addition, the transatlantic broadcast from Wembley Stadium suffered technical problems and failed during The Who's performance of their opening song "My Generation", immediately after Roger Daltrey sang "Why don't you all fade..." (the last word "Away" was cut off when a blown fuse caused the Wembley stage TV feed to temporarily fail).[2] The broadcast eventually returned as the last verse of Pinball Wizard was played. John Entwistle's bass wouldn't work at the start, causing an awkward delay or over a minute before they could start playing. The band played with Kenney Jones on drums and it was their first performance since disbanding after a 1982 'farewell' tour. The Who's performance, including an at times chaotic but blistering version of "Won't Get Fooled Again", was described as "rough but right" by Rolling Stone, but they would not perform together again until the 1988 BPI Awards.[26]
