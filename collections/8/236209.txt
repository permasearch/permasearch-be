The gasoline-powered part of the RX 400h engine system was a 3.3-liter 3MZ-FE V6, very similar to the one found in the RX 330. It produced 211 PS (155 kW; 208 hp) and 288 N⋅m (212 lbf⋅ft).[48] The gasoline engine was aided by a maximum of two additional electric motors, one driving the front wheels, producing 167 PS (123 kW; 165 hp) and 333 N⋅m (246 lbf⋅ft) and connected to the CVT gearbox,[48] and the other driving the rear wheels, producing 68 PS (50 kW; 67 hp) and 130 N⋅m (96 lbf⋅ft).[48] The whole system, called Lexus Hybrid Drive (also Hybrid Synergy Drive), produced a maximum of 272 PS (200 kW; 268 hp).[48] With Lexus Hybrid Drive, under normal driving conditions, only the front motor and gasoline engine were used. The rear motor was only used under full-throttle acceleration or when the front wheels lost traction.[42] An Ni-MH battery was responsible for powering the motors,[42] and charged by generators during deceleration or sharp cornering.[44] Standard features included an Electronically Controlled Brake and Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management stability control system.
