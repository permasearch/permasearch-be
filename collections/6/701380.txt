Isaak Babel said, after reading War and Peace, "If the world could write by itself, it would write like Tolstoy."[33] Tolstoy "gives us a unique combination of the 'naive objectivity' of the oral narrator with the interest in detail characteristic of realism. This is the reason for our trust in his presentation."[34]
