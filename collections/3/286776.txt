German Americans were sometimes accused of being too sympathetic to the German Empire. Former president Theodore Roosevelt denounced "hyphenated Americanism", insisting that dual loyalties were impossible in wartime. A small minority came out for Germany, or ridiculed the British. About 1% of the 480,000 enemy aliens of German birth were imprisoned in 1917â€“18. The allegations included spying for Germany, or endorsing the German war effort.[108] Thousands were forced to buy war bonds to show their loyalty.[109] One person was killed by a mob; in Collinsville, Illinois, German-born Robert Prager was dragged from jail as a suspected spy and lynched.[110] The war saw a phobia of anything German engulf the nation. Sauerkraut was rechristened "liberty cabbage", for example.[111]
