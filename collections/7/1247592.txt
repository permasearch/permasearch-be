Some controversy surrounded the use of the word in Wagner's own circle: Wagner never authorised the use of the word leitmotiv, using words such as "Grundthema" (basic idea), or simply "Motiv".  His preferred name for the technique was Hauptmotiv (principal motif), which he first used in 1877;[1] the only time he used the word Leitmotiv, he referred to "so-called Leitmotivs".
