A Broadway revival opened on 31 July 2016.[13] Nicole Scherzinger, who played Grizabella in the 2014 West End revival, had originally agreed to reprise the role on Broadway, but her desire to return as a judge on The X Factor led her to withdraw.[14] Leona Lewis was cast to replace her[15] and was ultimately succeeded by Mamie Parris in October 2016.[16] The Broadway revival closed on December 30, 2017.
