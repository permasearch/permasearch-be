Women's music (or womyn's music or wimmin's music) is the music by women, for women, and about women.[173] The genre emerged as a musical expression of the second-wave feminist movement[174] as well as the labour, civil rights, and peace movements.[175] The movement was started by lesbians such as Cris Williamson, Meg Christian, and Margie Adam, African-American women activists such as Bernice Johnson Reagon and her group Sweet Honey in the Rock, and peace activist Holly Near.[175] Women's music also refers to the wider industry of women's music that goes beyond the performing artists to include studio musicians, producers, sound engineers, technicians, cover artists, distributors, promoters, and festival organizers who are also women.[173] Riot grrrl is an underground feminist hardcore punk movement described in the cultural movements section of this article.
