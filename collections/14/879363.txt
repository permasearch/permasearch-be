Since the introduction by the League of equalisation policies of a salary cap and draft in 1987,[1] every team currently competing in the Australian Football League (except for Gold Coast, which has not yet qualified for a finals series) has made a preliminary final. This has had a significant impact on the spread of premierships: since 1987, thirteen clubs have won a premiership, compared with only five clubs in the twenty-three seasons between 1967 and 1989.[2] Essendon and Carlton have won the most VFL/AFL premierships, with a total of 16 each. Of the teams currently competing in the Australian Football League, only Fremantle, Gold Coast and Greater Western Sydney are yet to win a premiership.
