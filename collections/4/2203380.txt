DTPA is also used as a complexing agent for gadolinium in MRI contrast enhancement. The requirement in this case is that the complex be very strong, as Gd3+ is very toxic. The large stability constant of the octadentate ligand ensures that the concentration of free Gd3+ is almost negligible, certainly well below toxicity threshold.[31] In addition the ligand occupies only 8 of the 9 coordination sites on the gadolinium ion. The ninth site is occupied by a water molecule which exchanges rapidly with the fluid surrounding it and it is this mechanism that makes the paramagnetic complex into a contrast reagent.
