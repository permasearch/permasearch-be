In the Book of Jonah, a work of Jewish literature probably written in the fourth century BC, the central figure, a prophet named Jonah, is swallowed by a giant fish after being thrown overboard by the crew of the ship he is travelling on.[89][90][91] The fish later vomits Jonah out on shore after three days.[89][90][91] This book was later included as part of the Hebrew Bible, or Christian Old Testament,[92][93] and a version of the story it contains is summarized in Surah 37:139-148 of the Quran.[94] Early Christians used the ichthys, a symbol of a fish, to represent Jesus,[87][88] because the Greek word for fish, ΙΧΘΥΣ Ichthys, could be used as an acronym for "Ίησοῦς Χριστός, Θεοῦ Υἱός, Σωτήρ" (Iesous Christos, Theou Huios, Soter), meaning "Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour".[87][88] The gospels also refer to "fishers of men"[95] and feeding the multitude. In the dhamma of Buddhism, the fish symbolize happiness as they have complete freedom of movement in the water. Often drawn in the form of carp which are regarded in the Orient as sacred on account of their elegant beauty, size and life-span.
