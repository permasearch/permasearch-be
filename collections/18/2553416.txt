The story was written by Jean Chalopin and Bernard DeyriÃ¨s, and is very loosely based on the novel The King's Fifth by Scott O'Dell. The series chief director was Hisayuki Toriumi.[5] The producers were Max Saldinger and Atsumi Yajima (NHK).[5] The musical score was composed by Haim Saban and Shuki Levy in the Western version (Nobuyoshi Koshibe in the Japanese version[5]). Shingo Araki was involved with the series as an animator and some episodes were directed by Toyoo Ashida and Mizuho Nishikubo.
