A woman's arm was seriously injured by an explosion that protesters claimed was part of a concussion grenade but which police suggest may have been an exploding propane canister. The victim's father stated in a press conference that his daughter had seen a police officer throw the explosive device directly at her as she was backing away.[92] The Morton County Sheriff's Department denied using concussion grenades, and reported that protesters were throwing expended propane canisters at police during this period.[93][94][95][96][97][98][99] Law enforcement, including the ATF and FBI, are investigating the incident.[100]
