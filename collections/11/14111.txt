Sabrina's heck-raising cousin Amanda is sent to live in the Mortal Realm for a year. Rather than have her stay at the Spellmans', Hilda and Zelda arrange for Sabrina to help get Amanda into a special school called Witchright Hall for maladjusted young witches. Charles Shaughnessy guests as James Hexton, headmaster of the school and Zelda's former love interest. (Shaughnessy had appeared earlier in the season as Alec, Hilda's love interest.)
