In 1972 "Montana Edition", owned by Hans R. BeierleinÂ (de), bought the rights to the song for 5,000 Deutschmark, first for the territory of the former West Germany, then in the former East Germany, then worldwide. East Germany paid Montana Edition 20,000 DM every year for its rights to play the music. Pierre De Geyter died in 1932, causing the copyrights to expire in 2002.[6] Luckhardt's German text is public domain since 1984.
