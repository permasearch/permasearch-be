The pitch in Croke Park is a soil pitch that replaced the Desso GrassMaster pitch laid in 2002. There had been several complaints by players and managers that the pitch, which was installed in 2002, was excessively hard and far too slippery, so the decision was taken to replace it with traditional soil pitch.[8]
