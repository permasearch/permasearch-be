Nodule growth is one of the slowest of all known geological phenomena, on the order of a centimeter over several million years.[10] Several processes are hypothesized to be involved in the formation of nodules, including the precipitation of metals from seawater (hydrogenous), the remobilization of manganese in the water column (diagenetic), the derivation of metals from hot springs associated with volcanic activity (hydrothermal), the decomposition of basaltic debris by seawater (halmyrolitic) and the precipitation of metal hydroxides through the activity of microorganisms (biogenic[11]). Several of these processes may operate concurrently or they may follow one another during the formation of a nodule.
