Echocardiography is the main diagnostic tool for LVT. A distinct mass is visible in the left ventricle. Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging are effective, but less common ways to detect LVT, due to their costs and risks.[1] It is possible to assess whether a thrombus will become an embolus through echocardiography. Mobility and protrusion of the thrombus are two characteristics associated with increased embolic potential.[8]
