Neither school has had sustained excellence at the same time. The only time both schools met as ranked teams was in 1995, when the University of Kansas came into the game 7–0 and ranked #6 in the AP Poll, while Kansas State University was 5–1 and ranked #14. Kansas State beat KU 41–7 in that game. KU leads the all-time series 64–46–5 after the 2017 game, but the rivalry has run in Kansas State's favor since the Governor's Cup series began in 1969, with Kansas State holding a 29–19–1 lead. The University of Kansas disputes the series record because it does not acknowledge its forfeit of a 1980 victory.[57]
