Historicist buildings made their presence felt on the cityscape until the 1920s sampled by public buildings such as the Staatskanzlei or the City Hall. One of the youngest buildings of that era is the Hygiene Museum, which is designed in an impressively monumental style, but employs plain fa√ßades and simple structures. It is often attributed, wrongly, to the Bauhaus school.[citation needed]
