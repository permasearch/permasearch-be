Today was launched on the BBC's Home Service on 28 October 1957 as a programme of "topical talks" to give listeners a morning alternative to light music. It was named by Isa Benzie who together with Janet Quigley were the programme's founders. Benzie volunteered to lead the programme and she served as its first de facto editor.[6] It was initially broadcast as two 20-minute editions slotted in around the existing news bulletins and religious and musical items. In 1963 it became part of the BBC's Current Affairs department, and it started to become more news-orientated. The two editions also became longer, and by the end of the 1960s it had become a single two-hour-long programme that enveloped the news bulletins and the religious talk that had become Thought for the Day in 1970.[7] Radio 4 controller Ian McIntyre cut it back to two parts in 1976â€“78 (creating a gap which was filled by Up to the Hour), but it was swiftly returned to its former position.
