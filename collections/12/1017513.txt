During their time in the house, HouseGuests were given weekly tasks to perform.[3] The HouseGuests would wager a portion of their weekly shopping budget on the task, and would either win double their wagered fund or lose the wagered fund depending on their performance in the task.[21] The HouseGuests were required to work as a group to complete the task, with the format of the tasks varying based on the amount of remaining HouseGuests. Should the HouseGuests run out of the food provided for them, an emergency ration was available to them. HouseGuests were also required to make visits to the Red Room during their stay in the house, where they were able to share their thoughts and feelings on their fellow HouseGuests and the game.[58] The format of the series was mainly seen as a social experiment, and required HouseGuests to interact with others who may have differing ideals, beliefs, and prejudices.[59][60] While a competition, the series allows viewers to witness the relationships formed in the house and the behavior of the HouseGuests.[61] Nina Tassler, president of entertainment at CBS, stated "You're talking about people from very disparate walks of life and confining them in a house for a finite period of time [...] you have to recognize yes, this is that show. It is a social experiment."[62] Though locked in the house, the HouseGuests were free to quit the game, though would not be allowed entry back into the house.[63] Should a HouseGuest break the rules of the game, they could be expelled from the house, and unable to return.[64][65]
