"Shakin' All Over" is a song originally performed by Johnny Kidd & the Pirates.[1] The song was written by frontman Johnny Kidd, and his recording of it reached number one on the UK Singles Chart in August 1960.[2]  Kidd's original recording was not a hit outside of Europe, and in other parts of the world "Shakin' All Over" is much better known in versions by other artists. In 1964, a local band from Plattsburgh, New York called the Twiliters recorded a live version of it. It did well in New England but did not chart nationally. The first North American cover of the song by The Guess Who was released in the spring of 1965 and reached #1 in Canada,[3] #22 in the US and #27 in Australia. In Australia, Normie Rowe's 1965 version reached #1 as a double A-side with "Que Sera Sera" and became one of the biggest-selling Australian singles of the decade.
