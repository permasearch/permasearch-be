The earliest known kickstand was designed by Albert Berruyer in 1869, and since then kickstands have been independently reinvented many times.[1] It was mounted below the handlebars, so was much longer than more recent designs. A shorter model was patented by Eldon Henderson in 1926.[1] In the 1930s, a "smaller, more convenient" kickstand was developed by Joseph Paul Treen.[2]
