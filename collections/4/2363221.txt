In the cold open of "Classy Christmas", when Michael is trying to decide what everyone should do in the Christmas group photo, Kevin suggests the men and women be separated, and the men should stand in a "why I oughta" pose, while the women stand in a "let's go shopping" pose, but his idea is quickly rejected. In the episode, Kevin shows that he is not impressed that Angela's boyfriend is a state senator, and it is hinted Kevin does not know what a comptroller is. When Pam asks for volunteers to come with her to buy a Christmas tree, Kevin declines, saying he doesn't want to get dirty in case any girls show up at the party, leading Pam to berate him to stop thinking that, since no one ever invites other women. When Holly arrives, Kevin is obviously upset that she ate half of the maple candies she brought for the office. After Holly confronts the staff over who threw her Woody doll in the trash, Kevin comes up with the theory that, since Toy Story is about toys coming alive when nobody's around, Woody came alive and threw himself in the garbage.
