Other manhole shapes can be found, usually squares or rectangles. Nashua, New Hampshire, may be unique in the United States for having triangular manhole covers that point in the direction of the underlying flow. In 2011, the city was gradually phasing out the triangles,[9] which were made by a local foundry, because they were not large enough to meet modern safety standards and a manufacturer for larger triangles could not be found.[10] Some manhole covers in Hamilton, Bermuda, are triangular, and hinged. Some triangular water-main covers also exist in San Francisco.[11]
