Applicants who view the selection process more favorably tend to be more positive about the organization, and are likely to influence an organization’s reputation.[160][168] whereas, in contrast, anxious or uncomfortable during their interview may view an organization less favorably, causing the otherwise qualified candidates not accepting a job offer.[160] If an applicant is nervous, they might not act the same way they would on the job, making it harder for organizations to use the interview for predicting someone’s future job performance.[160]
