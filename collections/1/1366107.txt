It took them eight games to get to the All-Ireland final in 2017. A bad start turned into a rollercoaster, and after their loss to Galway would need extra time in two matches to ultimately end up in the final. After a quick concession of a goal to Dublin, Mayo took grip of the final and were in control for most of the first half, leading by a point at half time. However Dublin bounced back and a late free deep into extra time would see Dublin edge out winners, on a score line of 1-17 to 1-16, beating Mayo by a point for the second year in a row.
