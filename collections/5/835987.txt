Human Blade is a superhero with rotating fan blades for hands and has a weakness for electricity. In "Future Tense", Skylar hired Human Blade to make smoothies for the superheroes so that they would stop hating her for having been used as the Annihilator's servant. This didn't work because Alan used Surge to charge Human Blade, which resulted in Lizard Man's tail and Solar Flare II's pony tail getting chopped off.
