This system provides an energy density comparable to lithium-ion batteries, while simultaneously increasing the stability of the activated fuel from several minutes to more than a year and allowing for large numbers of cycles without significant degradation.[3]Â Further research is being done in search of even more improvement by examining different possible combinations of substrates and photoactive molecules.
