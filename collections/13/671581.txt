Blyton was a nature writer early in her career, and the books are strongly atmospheric, with a detailed but idealised presentation of the rural southern English landscape. The books present children exploring this landscape without parental supervision as natural and normal. Pete Cash of the English Association has noted that the children "are allowed to go off on their own to an extent that today would contravene the Child Protection Act (1999) and interest Social Services."[1]
