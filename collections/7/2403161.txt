The Andrades took advantage of this family´s prestige and titles using the Freire coat of arms since the Andrades did not belong to any order of chivalry. In turn the Freires tapped into a new source of wealth, it was a mutually beneficial alliance Members of the Freire family gave rise powerful noblemen in Portugal during the time of the reconquista. King Pedro I entrusted his son John who later became D. João I( John I) King of Portugal, to Don Nuno Freire de Andrade the master of the Order of Christ which was the converted Order of the Temple by King Pedro´s farther King Dinis I of Portugal since the Templars had been extinct by Papal bull in 1318. Although an exception was made of the Templar´s holdings in the Kingdoms of Aragon, Castile, Portugal and Mallorca in other kingdoms throughout Europe such as France and England the Templar´s property was transferred to the Hospitallers. In the event, the three kings principally concerned –Edward II of England, James II of Aragon and above all Philip IV of France-though they publicly agreed to the Pope´s plans for the Temple´s riches, all ensured that a portion remained in their hands and or the hands of their vassals. In the case of Portugal with King Dinis I this was no different although in this case the Templars were merely converted to the Order of Christ in 1318, some of the vassals to gain recognition with this were precisely the Freires. Again in this case there was an exception regarding the other kingdoms since they were already part of the Templars and the Hospitallers.
