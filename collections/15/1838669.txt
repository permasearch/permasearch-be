Although Black Sabbath went through many line-ups and stylistic changes, their core sound focuses on ominous lyrics and doomy music,[21] often making use of the musical tritone, also called the "devil's interval".[20] While their Ozzy-era albums such as Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (1973) had slight compositional similarities to the progressive rock genre that was growing in popularity at the time,[188] standing in stark contrast to popular music of the early 1970s Black Sabbath's dark sound was dismissed by rock critics of the era.[58] Much like many of their early heavy metal contemporaries, the band received virtually no airplay on rock radio.[189]
