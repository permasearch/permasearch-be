On May 15, 2013, Soaps In Depth reported through their website that Samantha Logan, of the recently defunct ABC primetime series, 666 Park Avenue had been cast in the role of Taylor.[52] Taylor comes to Port Charles to spend the summer with her big brother Felix (Marc Anthony Samuel) and immediately for TJ Ashford (Tequan Richmond). The duo's relationship will help to expand the already existing triangle between TJ, Molly Lansing (Haley Pullos), and Rafe Kovich (Jimmy Deshler) into a quadrangle.[53] Of the character's introduction, head writer Ron Carlivati commented, "Not everything can be a triangle."[52] Carlivati revealed to Soaps In Depth that Molly, Rafe and TJ would be featured heavily in the summer and the story would address whether TJ and Molly could work through their issues or if Molly would choose Rafe. However, Taylor's introduction will "turn the whole thing upside down."[54] In September 2013, the role was recast with actress Pepi Sonuga.[51] Actress Brytni Sarpy, who would go on to play Valerie Spencer, first auditioned for the role of Taylor.[55]
