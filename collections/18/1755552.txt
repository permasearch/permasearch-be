According to the ICN, it is possible to use a name formed by replacing the termination -aceae in the name of an included family, in this case preferably Pinaceae, by the appropriate termination, in the case of this division â€‘ophyta. Alternatively, "descriptive botanical names" may also be used at any rank above family. Both are allowed.
