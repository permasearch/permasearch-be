Students politics in this campus was highly influenced by the partition of Bengal and communal riots during and after the Independence (1946-1947).[8] Between 1946 and 1952, medicos of this college stood for communal harmony and worked hard in the refugee colonies. During 1952, some of the ex-students of the college, among them Bidhan Chandra Roy who later became the second Chief Minister of West Bengal, took a major responsibility in the establishment of Students' Health Home for the welfare of students.[8][9]
