Originally confined to the United States,[8] the use of the words fag and faggot as epithets for gay men has spread elsewhere in the English-speaking world, but the extent to which they are used in this sense has varied outside the context of imported US popular culture. In the UK and some other countries, the words queer, homo, and poof are much more common as pejorative terms for gay men. The word faggot in the UK typically refers to a kind of meatball, while fag is most commonly used as a slang term for "cigarette".
