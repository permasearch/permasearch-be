The Hitchiti language, one of the many languages spoken by the Muscogee tribe, was spoken in Georgia and Florida during the Colonial Period by tribes including the Hitchiti, Chiaha, Oconee, Sawokli, Apalochicola, and Miccosukee. Based on the amount of place names derived from the language, scholars believe it could have spread over a much larger area than Georgia and Florida during colonial times.[3]
