The American eelâ€™s complex life history begins far offshore in the Sargasso Sea in a semelparous and panmictic reproduction.[26][27][28] From there, young eels drift with ocean currents and then migrate inland into streams, rivers and lakes. This journey may take many years to complete with some eels travelling as far as 6,000 kilometers. After reaching these freshwater bodies they feed and mature for approximately 10 to 25 years before migrating back to the Sargasso Sea in order to complete their life cycle.[5]
