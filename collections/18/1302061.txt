The official Star Wars canon includes all the movie episodes, the television shows Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels, and any books, comics, and video games published after April 2014. These stories are coordinated by the Lucasfilm Story Team to be consistent with both each other and the upcoming films.
