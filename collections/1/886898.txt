Alliances are the groups or parties of the game, which can include up to 30 players and be private or open. Alliances allow players to gain alliance crystals and to access alliance quests. These alliances can be created with 5,000 battle chips or 100 units. Alliances can also take part in Alliance Events, such as "Rank Up", "Duel Skirmish" or "Summoner Advancement", each granting player rewards. Members of an alliance can assist one another in quests, and alliance members are ranked in relation to each other. The alliance leader is able to choose which members become officers, who are able to remove players from their alliance. In "Alliance Wars", two alliances compete head-to-head. An upcoming feature, "Bases", will allow an Alliance to fight to defend a part of a Battlerealm they claim as their own.
