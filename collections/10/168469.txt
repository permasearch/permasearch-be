The first engine to bear the Power Stroke name, the 7.3L Power Stroke V8 is the Ford version of the Navistar T444E turbo-diesel V8. Introduced in 1994 as the replacement for the 7.3L IDI V8, the Power Stroke/T444E is a completely new engine, with only its bore and stroke dimensions common with its predecessor (resulting in its identical 444 cubic-inch displacement). In line with the IDI diesel, the Power Stroke was offered in one-ton versions of the Ford F-Series/Ford Econoline product ranges.
