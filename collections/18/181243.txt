Puss in Boots (voiced by Antonio Banderas in the English, Spanish, and Italian version of the films, Eric Bauza in The Adventures of Puss in Boots, vocal sounds and purrs were provided by Frank Welker, and Andr√© Sogliuzzo in the video games and commercials) is Shrek's sidekick. Loosely based on the fairytale character Puss in Boots as well as being a kind of parody of Zorro, he is a smooth-talking cat with a Spanish accent, usually wearing a cavalier's hat, a belt with a sword, a small black cape, and small Corinthian boots. Puss first appears in Shrek 2, much like Dragon in the first film. He often overpowers his enemies by distracting them with his "cute kitten" looks. He also exhibits common cat behavior such as coughing up hairballs and chasing spotlights, usually resulting in his defeat or capture. He does not appear in the first film or 4D ride, though he does make a non-speaking cameo in the musical.
