The [Marbury v. Madison] decision is a masterwork of indirection, a brilliant example of Marshall's capacity to sidestep danger while seeming to court it. [...] The danger of a head-on clash with the Jeffersonians was averted by the denial of jurisdiction: but, at the same time, the declaration that the commission was illegally withheld scotched any impression that the Court condoned the administration's behavior. These negative maneuvers were artful achievements in their own right. But the touch of genius is evident when Marshall, not content with having rescued a bad situation, seizes the occasion to set forth the doctrine of judicial review. It is easy for us to see in retrospect that the occasion was golden [...] but only a judge of Marshall's discernment could have recognized it.
