On 11 February 2006, celebrity couple Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen and his wife Jackie took on the game show to raise money for their chosen charity - The Shooting Star Children's Hospice. Having reached the final question of the quiz, they were asked "Translated from the Latin, what is the motto of the United States?", to which the Bowens answered with "In God, We Trust", only to learn that the question's correct answer was "One Out of Many" - the English translation for the Latin E pluribus unum.[38] However, Celador later admitted that the question had been ambiguous and not fair to the pair - although E pluribus unum is considered the de facto motto of the United States, it was never legally declared as such; In God, We Trust is the official motto of the country since 1956, although it is not translated from any form of Latin. Following this revelation, the production company invited the Bowens back to tackle a new question, with their original winnings reinstated; the couple chose not to risk the new question, and left with Â£500,000 for their charity.[38]
