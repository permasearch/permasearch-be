In the summer of 2010, Marjanović signed a three-year contract with CSKA Moscow, on the insistence of Duško Vujošević.[2] However, after Vujošević got fired, Marjanović lost his place in CSKA's senior men's first team. On December 31, 2010, he was loaned to Žalgiris, until the end of the 2010–11 season.[3]
