Instant mashed potatoes have substantially more sodium than fresh potatoes, and much less dietary fiber. In other respects they are similar to mashed fresh potatoes in their nutritional qualities, about two-thirds starch by dry weight, with smaller amounts of protein, dietary fiber, and vitamins. The largest difference is the loss of vitamin C, although some products may be enriched to compensate. One hundred grams of unenriched instant mashed potatoes provides 11% [1] of the Dietary Reference Intake of vitamin C, compared to 18% [2] provided by the fresh potato version.
