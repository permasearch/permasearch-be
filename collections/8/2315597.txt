Chronic hives can be difficult to treat and lead to significant disability. Unlike the acute form, 50â€“80% of people with chronic hives have no identifiable triggers. Fortunately, 50% of people with chronic hives will experience remission within 1 year.[36] Overall, treatment is geared towards symptomatic management. Individuals with chronic hives may need other medications in addition to antihistamines to control symptoms. Patients who experience hives with angioedema require emergency treatment as this is a life-threatening condition.
