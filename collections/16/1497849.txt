CSS was first proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994.[17] At the time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN.[18] Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time, and discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1)[19] being released in 1996. In particular, Bert Bos' proposal was influential; he became co-author of CSS1 and is regarded as co-creator of CSS.[20]
