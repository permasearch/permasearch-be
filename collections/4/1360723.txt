As of 27 March 2012, Japan had only one out of 54 nuclear reactors operating; the Tomari-3, after the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa 6 was shut down.[37] The Tomari-3 was shut down for maintenance on 5 May, leaving Japan with no nuclear-derived electricity for the first time since 1970, when the country's then only two reactors was taken offline five days for maintenance.[8] On 15 June 2012, approval was given to restart Ōi Units 3 and 4[38] which could take six weeks to bring them to full operation. On 1 July 2012 unit 3 of the Ōi Nuclear Power Plant was restarted. This reactor can provide 1,180 MW of electricity.[39][40] On 21 July 2012 unit 4 was restarted, also 1,180 MW.[41] The reactor was shut down again on 14 September 2013, again leaving Japan with no operating power reactors.[42]
