An October 2016 story in the Süddeutsche Zeitung reports that Finnish operator TVO is calling on Siemens to take financial responsibility for the completion of Unit 3 of the Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant in Finland, because its project partner, the French Areva Group, is being broken up by the French government. Unit 3 has a history of delays and its future profitability is in doubt.[14][15]
