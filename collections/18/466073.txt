The Guardian follows a vision they experienced and encounter a shard of the Traveler in a hidden forest within the EDZ. Ghost interfaces with the shard and its Light is restored. In doing so, Ghost is successful in restoring the Guardian's Light as well. After completing a series of missions for Hawthorne and Devrim Kay, an EDZ scout, to restore long range communications, Hawthorne intercepts a distress call from Commander Zavala, urging any surviving guardians to make their way to Saturn's moon Titan to assist in mounting a counter-offensive. It is shown that Ghaul has captured the Speaker, and wishes to carry favor with the Traveler, having taken an interest in harnessing and learning the power of the Light.
