Calletano uses the tape as leverage to facilitate Furillo's return to command Hill Street. Washington - with Garabaldi and Belker and with Goldblume's approval - follows William Mullins all day until he slips up: when he refuses to surrender after committing an armed robbery, he is shot dead by the detectives after firing at them.

The episode title comes from a minor storyline about a legal battle between a man whose genitals became caught in a whirlpool drain and the distraught therapist who didn't release the power switch until he was punched.
