Officer Carl (Christopher Michael) is a police officer that appeared in "iWant More Viewers" and "iMove Out". He arrests Spencer in "iWant More Viewers" due to a bright billboard sign that he and Freddie made, which caused a series of automobile accidents. The sign also malfunctioned and spelled out "Pee on Carl", which Officer Carl thought was targeted at him. In "iMove Out," he refuses to arrest pet photographers for vandalizing the iCarly studio because they took pictures of his daughter's bunny for free. He is also revealed to still be mad about the "Pee on Carl" incident after he told Spencer to watch his attitude because he still hasn't forgotten about it.
