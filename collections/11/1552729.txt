However, the name of beloved local comedian José Miguel Agrelot was chosen when the Coliseum was near its completion. Agrelot himself had suggested the name of Rafael Hernández Marín to be used, and when someone suggested his name instead he was both surprised and concerned. He was quoted as saying once in his radio show, Tu Alegre Despertar: "I can only hope my name won't be used, since I'd like God to keep me alive for quite some time... it would be a great honor, and I wouldn't object to it if that is what people want, but public facilities here are customarily named after dead people... I won't even dare to think about it. I'd only like the controversy over the name to stop".
