On February 22, 2007, Q*bert was released on the PlayStation 3's PlayStation Network.[52] It features upscaled and filtered graphics,[24] an online leaderboard for players to post high-scores, and Sixaxis motion controls.[25] The game received a mixed reception. Dunham and Gerstmann did not enjoy the motion controls and felt it was a title only for nostalgic players.[25][53] Eurogamer.net's Richard Leadbetter judged the game's elements "too simplistic and repetitive to make them worthwhile in 2007".[54] In contrast, Parish considered the title worth purchasing, citing its addictive gameplay.[24]
