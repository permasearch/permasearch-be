The Brooklyn Excelsiors was the first team to wear what would later become the modern baseball cap, with its distinctive rounded top and peak, in the 1860s.[11][14] By the early years of the twentieth century, this style of cap had become common, but some teams occasionally revived the flat-topped cap, such as the New York Giants in 1916 and the Pittsburgh Pirates as recently as during the 1979 World Series.[3] Over time, the peak has enlarged slightly to further protect the player's eyes from the sun.[15] More recently, players have worn hats with fold-down ear flaps in cold weather.
