The thymus was known to the ancient Greeks, and its name comes from the Greek word θυμός (thumos), meaning "anger",[25] or "heart, soul, desire, life", possibly because of its location in the chest, near where emotions are subjectively felt; or else the name comes from the herb thyme (also in Greek θύμος or θυμάρι), which became the name for a "warty excrescence", possibly due to its resemblance to a bunch of thyme.[26][27]
