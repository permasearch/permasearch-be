Penguin's Australian subsidiary released the Popular Penguins series late in 2008. The series has its own website.[56] It was intended to include 50 titles, many of which duplicate those on the Penguin Celebrations list but this was reduced to 49 titles as one of the 50, Hegemony or Survival by Noam Chomsky,[57] had to be withdrawn after its initial release as Penguin discovered they no longer held the rights to it.
