Reward/punishment: Since the blue team lost their challenge, they had to go through the garbage, separating out the recyclables. Rock was visibly angry with the Chef's decision and grumbled that, although he grew up in a poor neighborhood, he thinks this punishment is a bit extreme. Meanwhile, the red team is taken to a photo shoot for In Touch magazine. Rock is infuriated about the loss and goes off on a tirade about it, he is singled out for further punishment. He is then summoned to the photo shoot and ordered to separate the recyclables from the trash there as well. Rock felt being singled out for further punishment made him angrier, further complaining about it and boasting about how he never tells his cooks to sort through the trash.
