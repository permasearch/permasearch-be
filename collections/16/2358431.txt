There is little evidence for the use of slings as weaponry—they were normally depicted as a hunting tool.[85] In Old English, the sling was known as a liðere or liðera, and sometimes as a stæfliðere ("staff-pouch").[84] The Vita Sancti Wilfrithi (an eighth-century hagiography of Saint Wilfrid) records an event in which the saint and his companions were attacked by pagans when their ship ran aground. One of the companions launched a stone from a sling, killing the pagan priest.[70] As for hunting, however, the Bayeux Tapestry depicts a man hunting birds using a sling.[86] Underwood suggests that except for use as a last resort, the sling was not regarded as a weapon of war.[86] Furthermore, he proposed that the event recorded in Wilfrid's hagiography may not be an accurate account, but rather a reflection of the writer's desire to draw Biblical parallels.[86]
