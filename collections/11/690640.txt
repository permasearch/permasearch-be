The first link between Muse and The Streets was created when Muse bassist Christopher Wolstenholme broke his wrist playing football shortly before the 2004 V Festival and had to be replaced by then-Streets bassist Morgan Nicholls,[3] who still contributes backing vocals, keyboards and synthesizers for Muse's live performances. The two acts first shared a stage at the 2006 Reading and Leeds Festivals on 26 and 27 August, when Muse headlined the main stages.[4][5] They also both played at the 2007 Big Day Out festival,[6] before Muse chose The Streets to play at the first of their two sell out performances at Wembley Stadium on 16 June 2007.[7] In 2008, Muse announced that they were planning a collaboration with Mike Skinner with the aim of creating "England's answer to Rage Against the Machine".[8] Frontman Matthew Bellamy summed up his ambitions as "London rap-rock, just like a little one off. It might be a laugh!"
