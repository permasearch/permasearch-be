At the end of the day, Gabe shows Erin the movie they will be watching that night, Hardware, which involves a killer robot (calling it a compromise because Erin wanted to watch WALL-E).

A deflated Gabe realizes that Erin is far more excited about the movie Andy recommended her than the one he picked out.
