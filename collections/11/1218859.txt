Mohamed Salah married Maggi in 2013. Their daughter, Makka, born in 2014[109] is named in honor of the Islamic holy city.[9] Salah is Muslim and often celebrates goals by performing the sujood.[110] Liverpool fans created a chant to the tune of Dodgy's "Good Enough", saying that if Salah continued to score goals, they would convert to Islam – “If he's good enough for you, he's good enough for me, if he scores another few, then I'll be Muslim too.”[111] Salah gave his approval to the chant, and it has been cited as an example of inclusivity.[112] While Salah is devout to a degree that many other well-known Muslims sports figures are not (his wife wears a veil,[9] for example), his charm and apolitical persona have made him a popular figure in the UK.[113]
