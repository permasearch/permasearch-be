In 1989, referee Kelvin Morton awarded five penalties in a Crystal Palace v Brighton game, all awarded in a 27-minute spell - a Football League record. Palace were awarded four of the penalties, and they missed three of them but still won the match 2â€“1, with a goal from Ian Wright and a successful penalty from Mark Bright enough to earn victory against 10 man Brighton.[5] Crystal Palace earned promotion to the First Division that season, while Brighton remained a Second Division club.
