In North America prior to 1993, CDs were typically packaged in longboxes, tall cardboard cases that occupied the same amount of vertical space as an LP sleeve; while the packaging was initially used to avoid having to purchase new, smaller shelves for storing CD jewel cases, they were also popular among retailers for their ability to deter theft as a result of the boxes' larger size. Over twenty years after the official phasing out of the longbox, the packaging style still sees use in some stores today for this reason.
