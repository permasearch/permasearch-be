The accumulator contains     C P ( A )   {\displaystyle CP(A)}   during the first step and     C P ( A − B )   {\displaystyle CP(A-B)}   after adding B.  In displaying that data in the complement window, the operator sees     C P ( C P ( A ) )   {\displaystyle CP(CP(A))}   which is A and then     C P ( C P ( A − B ) )   {\displaystyle CP(CP(A-B))}   which is     ( A − B )   {\displaystyle (A-B)}  .  It feels like an addition since the only two differences in between an addition and a subtraction are the position of the display bar (direct versus complement) and the way the first number is entered (direct versus complement).
