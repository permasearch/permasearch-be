The original version of TLC was launched in 1994 and was subsequently renamed Discovery Home & Leisure and later Discovery Real Time as part of Discovery's catalogue of themed channels. Given that TLC is chasing a completely different demographic than the old TLC, Discovery is treating it as a new channel launch rather than a return.
