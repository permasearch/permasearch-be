Entertainment options increased during the preâ€“Civil War period; in early 1819, the first theatre production in St. Louis opened, including a musical accompaniment.[92] In the late 1830s, a 35-member orchestra briefly played in St. Louis, and in 1860, another orchestra opened that played more than 60 concerts through 1870.[92]
