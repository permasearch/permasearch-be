Some of the vehicles used in the movie are models from later years, especially the Mercedes-Benz G-Class (model year 2013) and the Mercedes-Benz C-Class (W205) (model year 2015) which did not exist when the attacks happened in 2012, only known to be original prototypes. The video game Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare is also featured in the film despite the fact that the game was released two years after the Benghazi attack, which appeared as demo game.
