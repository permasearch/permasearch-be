Elsa has literally frozen Storybrooke, and hopes to find her sister, Anna (Elizabeth Lail). She accompanies Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) to try to break down the wall of ice she created around Storybrooke, but her powers aren't strong enough to melt the barrier. The two, along with Hook, pay Gold a visit and to find out if he has known Anna based on the necklace Elsa found in his pawn shop. Belle uses the fake dagger to “command” Gold to tell the truth but it fails, as he knows nothing about Elsa or Anna, and wishes them the best of luck finding her. At the same time, Robin Hood (Sean Maguire), Marian, and Roland visit "Any Given Sundae," where the Snow Queen (Elizabeth Mitchell) serves them ice cream, but unknown to them she casts a spell on the ice cream cone that she gave Marian. Afterwards, the family joins the other residents at the Mayor's office, as Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin), who is still trying to balance both maternal and mayoral duties, is holding the first annual “Mayor’s Fireside Chat,” where she assures the citizens that they are no longer afraid of Regina's influence, but it appears that they want Mary Margaret to do something about the town’s snowy fiasco. Mary Margaret then tells the residents about Elsa's presence in Storybrooke and is trying to reassure everyone that she is not dangerous, only to have Marian beginning to start feeling as if something was glossing over her and she passes out. Elsa's presence has also resulted in her becoming a prime suspect, and with her heart slowly freezing, a cure must be found before Marian's heart completely freezes and kills her. The Storybrooke residents blame Elsa, who is being framed by the Snow Queen for the icy cold mayhem. With the entire town ready to go after their newest addition, Emma (who starts to question her abilities as "The Savior") and Hook decide to hide Elsa at the sheriff's office while she and David search for the real suspect.
