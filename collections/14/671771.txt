Water is an important part of human survival. Because of its cold temperature much of the earth's water comes from the polar regions. 90% of the world's water comes from the Antarctic ice cap although a lot of this water is not used.[11] Water environments are important for many species around the world. Many bacteria thrive there as well as algae and flora.
