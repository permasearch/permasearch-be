The most recent update to the zoo is the addition of Centene Grizzly Ridge, an $11.1 million, 7,000 square foot state-of-the-art habitat that replaced the bear grottos built in 1921, which were used until 2015 when they were closed for the construction of Grizzly Ridge. Grizzly Ridge opened September 15, 2017 and is now home to two orphaned grizzlies from Montana. Huckleberry, or Huck, and his sister Finley were given to the zoo by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Grizzly Ridge is the culminating project of The Living Promise Campaign, a project started in 2010 that promised to raise $120 million in order to improve the zoo. By the end of the campaign in 2014, the zoo had exceeded this goal by $14 million, which funded not only Grizzly Ridge, but also Polar Bear Point, Sea Lion Sound (a new and improved way of viewing the sea lions, including a walk-through tunnel), and improvements to other areas of the zoo such as Peabody Hall and River's Edge, among others.[6]
