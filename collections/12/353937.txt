Tie Game for First, Positive Score:  Tied players participate in a tie-breaker round, which consists of one final toss-up clue; the player who rings in and gives the correct question advances. A player cannot win by default, and must give the correct question to win. Should neither player offer a correct response, the question is thrown out and edited out of the final broadcast; only the final question that determines the winner is broadcast.  In the final, the tie-breaker is used only if there is a tie after the aggregate. The tie-breaker round would later be added into non-tournament play.
