In total, 29 players have reached the 50 home run club in MLB history and nine have done so more than once.[6] Of these, seventeen were right-handed batters, eleven were left-handed, and one was a switch hitter, meaning he could bat from either side of the plate. Four of these players (including two active members of the 50 home run club)[8] have played for only one major league team. The New York Yankees are the only franchise to have five players reach the milestone while on their roster: Ruth, Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris, Alex Rodriguez, and Aaron Judge. Ten players are also members of the 500 home run club[9] and two of them (Willie Mays and Rodriguez) are also members of the 3,000 hit club.[10] Ten players won the Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award in the same year as their 50 home run season.[11] Mantle is the only player to have earned the Major League Triple Crown alongside achieving 50 home runs, leading both leagues in batting average, home runs and runs batted in (RBI).[12][13][14] Mantle and Maris—collectively known as the M&M Boys—are the only teammates to reach the 50 home run club in the same season, hitting a combined 115 home runs in 1961 and breaking the single-season record for home runs by a pair of teammates.[15][16] Albert Belle is the only player to amass 50 or more doubles in addition to attaining 50 home runs.[17][18] Prince Fielder, at 23 years and 139 days, was the youngest player to reach the milestone while Bonds, at age 37, was the oldest.[19][20]
