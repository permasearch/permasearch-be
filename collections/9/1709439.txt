On the LE Eco, the transmission has an ECO driving mode.  The ECO driving mode makes accelerator control become non-linear to suppress the vehicle's response to choppy driving and contain acceleration from standing start to reduce fuel consumption. The accelerator pedal's communication is the same as Normal mode after 50-percent throttle.  The air conditioning operation is also controlled, with compressor power reduced, and the utilization of recirculation mode, as well as increasing the time to reach a desired temperature.[3][34]
