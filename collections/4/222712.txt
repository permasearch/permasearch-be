The film also achieved the sixteenth-highest opening-day and nineteenth-highest single-day grosses of all time.[97][98][99] For its opening weekend, the movie retained the No. 1 spot and grossed $152.5 million, breaking Alice in Wonderland's opening-weekend records for a film released in March, for any spring release, and for a non-sequel.[94][100][101][102] Its opening weekend gross was also the largest for any film released outside the summer season and the eighth-largest overall.[103] The film held the March and spring opening weekend records for four years until they were broken by Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.[104] It remained in first place at the North American box office for four consecutive weekends, becoming the first film since Avatar to achieve this.[11][105][106] On June 10, 2012 (its 80th day in theaters), it became the 14th movie to pass the $400-million-mark.[107] On April 20, 2012, Lionsgate and IMAX Corporation announced that due to "overwhelming demand", The Hunger Games would return to North American IMAX cinemas on April 27 for a further one-week engagement.[108]
