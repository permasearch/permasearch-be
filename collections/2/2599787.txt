The station is located in the latter municipality, along the Erie Railroad Graham Line off NY 211 near its exit with NY 17 and not too far from the Galleria at Crystal Run, a popular local shopping mall. However, while the mall and other large retailers such as Sam's Club are visible from the station, there is no provision for pedestrian traffic on any of the roads leading to them.
