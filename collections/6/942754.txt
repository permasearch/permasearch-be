Traditionally, Corporate Social Responsility (CSR) has been widely practiced by Indian corporates - taking the form of philanthropic activities. The new CSR legislation under section 135 of the Companies Act 2013 requires companies of a certain size to spend 2% of their net profit [8] on activities as prescribed under schedule VII, which are primarily aimed at community development. The canvas of CSR remains narrow and de-linked from the core-business activities of a company. However, the more progressive businesses view the legislation as opportunity to address the developmental challenges of India through sustainable innovations and creation of shared value. Principle 8 of the NVGs expounds on this very concept, while also acknowledging the need for community development as articulated under the new CSR law. Principle 8 of the NVGs on “inclusive and equitable growth” focuses on encouraging business action on national development priorities, including community development initiatives and strategic CSR[9] based on the shared value concept.
