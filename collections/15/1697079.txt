Rory McIlroy PGA Tour contains some new features, assists and gameplay changes. New Backswing Meter, Aiming Arc, and putt read features were added to assist players in making accurate shots. Three main swing modes are offered; "Arcade", which uses the analog sticks to swing and allows application of spin to the ball in mid-air, the traditional "3-Click", and "Tour"â€”an advanced mode similar to Arcade mode, but with no assists enabled at all and higher sensitivity.[2][5] Players can toggle individual assists to customize their experience.[6]
