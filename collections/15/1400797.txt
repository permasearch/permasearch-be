Oregon and Oregon State joined in the summer of 1964.[73][74] With the addition of the two Oregon schools, the conference was known unofficially as the Pacific Athletic Conference,[75][76][77][78][79] and then the Pacific-8 (as there already was a major conference called the Big Eight). In 1968, the AAWU formally renamed itself the Pacific-8 Conference, or Pac-8 for short. The Pac-8 did not allow a second bowl team from the conference until the 1975 season.[80]
