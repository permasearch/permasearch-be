AMPAS christened this year's telecast with a theme celebrating movie quotes.[28] In tandem with the theme, advertising agency TBWA\Chiat\Day designed the official ceremony poster featuring 75 quotes from several Oscar-nominated or winning films.[29] To stir interest surrounding the awards, filmmaker Spike Lee released a trailer featuring everyday people around New York City reciting famous film lines.[28] During the ceremony, a montage produced by director Nancy Meyers saluted the work of screenwriters and their contributions to film.[30][31]
