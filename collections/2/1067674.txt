When a clustering result is evaluated based on the data that was clustered itself, this is called internal evaluation. Those that use a gold standard are called external measures and are discussed in the next section - although when they are symmetric they may also be used as measures between two clusters for internal evaluation. These methods usually assign the best score to the algorithm that produces clusters with high similarity within a cluster and low similarity between clusters. One drawback of using internal criteria in cluster evaluation is that high scores on an internal measure do not necessarily result in effective information retrieval applications.[34] Additionally, this evaluation is biased towards algorithms that use the same cluster model. For example, k-means clustering naturally optimizes object distances, and a distance-based internal criterion will likely overrate the resulting clustering.
