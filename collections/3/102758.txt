Donald Trump, a prominent New York City real estate developer, had envisioned building a tower at 56th Street and Fifth Avenue since childhood, but he only formulated plans to develop the site in the mid-1970s, when he was in his thirties.[2] At the time, the Bonwit Teller flagship store, an architecturally renowned building built in 1929, occupied the lot.[3] The site was next to Tiffany's flagship store on 57th Street, which Trump considered the city's best real-estate property.[4] Approximately twice every year, Trump contacted Bonwit Teller's parent company, Genesco, to ask whether they were willing to sell Bonwit Teller's flagship store. Trump said the first time he contacted Genesco, "they literally laughed at me."[5] Genesco continued to decline his offers and, according to Trump, "they thought I was kidding."[2]
