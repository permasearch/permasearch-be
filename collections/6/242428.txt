Five years later, camp counselor Paul Holt hosts a counselor training camp near Crystal Lake. The camp is attended by Sandra Dier, her boyfriend Jeff, troublemaker Scott, tomboy Terry, wheelchair-bound Mark, sweet-natured Vickie, jokester Ted, and Paul's assistant Ginny, as well as other trainees. Around the campfire that night, Paul tells the counselors about the legend of Jason to scare people from entering Camp Crystal Lake. As Ted appears with a mask and a spear, Paul reassures everyone that Jason is dead and that Camp Crystal Lake is off limits. That night, Crazy Ralph wanders onto the property to warn the group but is garroted from behind a tree by Jason.
