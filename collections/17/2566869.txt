From the merger with Northwest Airlines in 2008 until April 5, 2016, Delta added more than 200 aircraft to its fleet, including A320s, A330-300s, Boeing 717s, Boeing 737-900ERs, Boeing 757-200s, and McDonnell Douglas MD-90s. The majority of these aircraft were delivered between 2013 and 2016 at a pace of about five aircraft a month.[5] During this period Delta also refurbished all mainline aircraft and all two-class regional jets with Economy Comfort seats, with international aircraft receiving Economy Comfort seats in 2011 and domestic aircraft receiving Economy Comfort seats in 2012.[6] On August 25, 2011, Delta ordered 100 Boeing 737-900ER aircraft for delivery between 2013 and 2018 as it retires older mainline jets and upgrades its fleet. The new aircraft are intended to improve the company's profitability.[7]
