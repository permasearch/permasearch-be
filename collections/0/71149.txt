Following the Cuban Revolution of 1959, bilateral relations deteriorated substantially. In 1961, the U.S. severed diplomatic ties with Cuba and began pursuing covert operations to topple the Communist regime.[1] Moreover, the U.S. imposed and subsequently tightened a comprehensive set of restrictions and bans vis-Ã -vis the Cuban regime as retaliation for the nationalization of U.S. corporations' property by Cuba. Meanwhile, several organizations, including a nearly unanimous United Nations General Assembly, have called for "an end to the United States' decades-long economic, commercial and financial embargo against Cuba."[2]
