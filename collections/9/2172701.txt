Oliver! was released on DVD for the first time by Columbia Pictures in 2005 with only two special features; a photo gallery and a behind the scenes featurette. The motion picture soundtrack (housed in a DVD case) was also released with the DVD. It was an exclusive and contained only fourteen songs from the movie. Oliver! was then released in 2013 on a Region B Blu-ray containing all the special features as the DVD release excluding the film's extra disc soundtrack. In 2013 Twilight Time released a blu-ray edition of the film available on their website but limited to 3000 copies, which has since sold out. As of 2017, Columbia Pictures has yet to release Oliver! on a Region A Blu-ray Disc.
