In 1974, "Train Kept A-Rollin'" was included on Aerosmith's second album Get Your Wings.  A 3:15 edited version of the song without the added audience noises was released as a single, but it did not appear on the record charts.  The song continues to be a highlight of the group's shows and the album version has become a staple of album-oriented rock and classic rock radio.  It has become so identified with Aerosmith, that when Jeff Beck (whose 1965 and 1966 recordings with the Yardbirds inspired Tyler and Perry) occasionally performs it, he often hears comments like "Hey, I like your angle on the Aerosmith tune".[42]
