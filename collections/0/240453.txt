On 28 October 2016, in the case of Aslam v Uber BV,[395] the Central London Employment Tribunal ruled that Uber drivers are "workers" entitled to the minimum wage, paid holiday, sick leave and other normal worker entitlements, rather than self-employed. Two Uber drivers had brought the case to the employment tribunal with the assistance of the GMB Union on 20 July 2016.[396][397][398][399] On 10 November 2016, the Employment Appeal Tribunal upheld the first tribunal's ruling. Uber indicated that it would appeal further.[400]
