Ghostbusters received criticism from social media users following word of Feig's involvement and the all-female cast, which some felt was a "gimmick".[125] On its first day of release, the first trailer for the film collected 12,000 "likes" and 13,800 "dislikes" from YouTube viewers which, according to David Griner of Ad Week made it "one of the most polarizing in recent memory".[126] By May 2016, the trailer had become the most disliked film trailer on YouTube[127] and the ninth-most-disliked YouTube video, with 280,000 likes to over one million dislikes.[128][129][130] ScreenCrush described the reaction as a campaign "to downvote [the film] into oblivion" by "a certain subset of people on the internet [with] an unhealthy fixation with hating on the Ghostbusters remake".[127][131] In one interview, Melissa McCarthy felt it was a "very, very, very tiny, tiny group of people" who were misogynistic.[132] Other reasons proposed for the negative reaction to the trailer included a lack of interest in reboots, nostalgia for the original film, and a perceived lack of humor in the trailer.[133] The film's IMDb page was also subject to vote brigading in a coordinated effort to lower its rating.[9][10]
