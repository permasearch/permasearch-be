At the beginning of the play, the protagonist Philoctetes has been abandoned on an island with a wound that would not heal. His suffering and exposure to the elements has made him animal-like, a quality he shares with other outcasts in Heaney's work, such as Sweeney.[6] He ultimately rejoins the war at Troy, which could not end without him.
