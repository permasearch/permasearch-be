The Wiener process or Brownian motion process has its origins in different fields including statistics, finance and physics.[21] In 1880, Thorvald Thiele wrote a paper on the method of least squares, where he used the process to study the errors of a model in time-series analysis.[220][221] The work is now considered as an early discovery of the statistical method known as Kalman filtering, but the work was largely overlooked. It is thought that the ideas in Thiele's paper were too advanced to have been understood by the broader mathematical and statistical community at the time.[221]
