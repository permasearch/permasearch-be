For example, consider Okun's law, which relates GDP growth to the unemployment rate. This relationship is represented in a linear regression where the change in unemployment rate (    Δ    Unemployment    {\displaystyle \Delta \ {\text{Unemployment}}}  ) is a function of an intercept (     β  0     {\displaystyle \beta _{0}}  ), a given value of GDP growth multiplied by a slope coefficient      β  1     {\displaystyle \beta _{1}}   and an error term,     ε   {\displaystyle \varepsilon }  :
