A case has been made for the use of Adrenaline (epinephrine) infusion in place of the widely accepted treatment of inotopes  for preterm infants with clinical cardiovascular compromise. Although there is sufficient data which strongly recommends Adrenaline infusions as a viable treatment, more trials are needed in order to conclusively determine that these infusions will successfully reduce morbidity and mortality rates among preterm, cardiovascularly compromised infants.[11]
