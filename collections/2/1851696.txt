Medical Center of the Rockies opened to patients on Valentine's Day 2007, to relieve crowding in Poudre Valley Hospital, and provide better access to patients from outside of Fort Collins, Larimer County, and even the state of Colorado. Poudre Valley Hospital did not close as a result of the new hospitals opening, but downgraded its trauma center from a state approved level II to an also approved level III and now focuses much more on orthopedic care, and cancer treatment than MCR.
