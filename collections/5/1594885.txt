Thomas Bulfinch has an antecedent to the interaction of Medea and the daughters of Pelias. Jason, celebrating his return with the Golden Fleece, noted that his father was too aged and infirm to participate in the celebrations.  He had seen and been served by Medea's magical powers. He asked Medea to take some years from his life and add them to the life of his father.  She did so, but at no such cost to Jason's life. Medea withdrew the blood from Aesons body and infused it with certain herbs; putting it back into his veins, returning vigor to him.[14] Pelias' daughters saw this and wanted the same service for their father.
