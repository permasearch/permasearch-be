DDR2 SO-DIMM memory modules commonly have clock speeds from 200 MHz up to 400 MHz (PC2-6400).[citation needed] 204-pin SO-DIMMs can also contain DDR3 SDRAM, with specifications such as PC3-6400, PC3-8500, PC3-10600, PC3-14900 and PC3-17000.[13] 260-pin UniDIMMs may contain either DDR3 or DDR4 SDRAM, depending on their configuration. Some SO-DIMMs also provide ECC functionality; unbuffered ECC SO-DIMMs are called SO-CDIMMs.[14]
