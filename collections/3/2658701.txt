The phylactolaemates live in all types of freshwater environment – lakes and ponds, rivers and streams, and estuaries[48]  – and are among the most abundant sessile freshwater animals.[58] Some ctenostomes are exclusively freshwater while others prefer brackish water but can survive in freshwater.[48] Scientists' knowledge of freshwater bryozoan populations in many parts of the world is incomplete, even in some parts of Europe. It was long thought that some freshwater species occurred worldwide, but since 2002 all of these have been split into more localized species.[48]
