No Watch Ben and Professor Paradox return to the point where the Ben 10 Multiverse began: when Ben Prime first acquired the prototype Omnitrix six years ago. From there the two start to go through the parallel worlds to unite the good Bens (Ben 10,000, Ben 23, Gwen 10 and Ben Prime) to fight Vilgax and the evil Bens: Eon, Albedo, Bad Ben, Benzarro, Mad Ben, and Nega Ben. After the team is put together, Paradox sends the other Tennysons who had their Omnitrices(or Biomnitrix for Ben 10,000) to fight (creating the events of the previous episode) and keeps No Watch Ben in the Event horizon. After Vilgax destroys the multiverse, No Watch Ben returns to fight him moments after his rescue and turns into Clockwork to undo the multiverse wipeout. Clockwork sends the Evil Bens back to their respective timelines, then returns the Omnitrix to Ben Prime, and the Good Bens and Gwen take turns beating Vilgax. After their combined win, No Watch Ben's Grandpa Max reveals his Plumber status to No Watch Ben and they have a talk. Ben Prime wonders about the various incarnations across time and space, and returns home to his own time.
