Copland's inspiration arrived in the form of an Edward Deming Andrews book, The Gift to be Simple - Songs, Dances and Rituals of the American Shakers, J.J. Augustin; Republished by Dover.[citation needed] Copland stated that the book's title composition jumped into him immediately upon receipt (see Winterthur archives).[citation needed] Originally, Copland did not have a title for the work, referring to it simply as "Ballet for Martha"â€”a title as simple and direct as the Shaker tune 'Tis the Gift to be Simple quoted in the music.[6] Shortly before the premiere, Graham suggested Appalachian Spring, a phrase from a Hart Crane poem, "The Dance" from a collection of poems in his book "The Bridge."
