During the episode "City of Clipsville", the Girls recall several events that have happened to them in the past. In one recollection, the Girls sped up time and became teenagers, where they also encounter the teenage Rowdyruff Boys. The behavior of the Girls and the Boys is very different to how it was when they were children; the Girls are no longer heroic crime fighters, but shopping and party loving ditzes (something which they themselves admit to after reminiscing about it). Meanwhile, the Boys are no longer wild and unruly criminals, but more like slackers. They also do not behave misogynistically towards the Girls. Conversely, both the Boys and the Girls express an almost intimate interest in each other.
