In 1938, the publication moved to the Daily Express Building, Manchester (sometimes nicknamed the 'Black Lubyianka') designed by Owen Williams on the same site in Great Ancoats Street.[18] It opened a similar building in Glasgow in 1936 in Albion Street. Glasgow printing ended in 1974[19] and Manchester in 1989 on the company's own presses.[20] Johnston Press has a five-year deal, begun in March 2015, to print the northern editions of the Daily Express, Daily Star, Sunday Express and the Daily Star Sunday at its Dinnington site in Sheffield.[21] The Scottish edition is printed by facsimile in Glasgow by contract printers, the London editions at Westferry Printers.[22]
