The death penalty was de facto abolished in Canada in 1963, and Bill C-84 was enacted in 1976 resulting in the de jure abolition of the death penalty, except for certain military offences committed by members of the Canadian Armed Forces (cowardice, desertion, unlawful surrender, and spying for the enemy) which are prosecuted under the National Defence Act. In 1998, Canada eliminated the death penalty for these military offences as well.[1]
