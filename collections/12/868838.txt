Before Anderson and Jones introduced the classification of Strepsirrhini and Haplorhini in 1984,[29] (followed by McKenna and Bell's 1997 work Classification of Mammals: Above the species level),[30] the Primates were divided into two superfamilies: Prosimii and Anthropoidea.[31] Prosimii included all of the prosimians: Strepsirrhini plus the tarsiers. Anthropoidea contained all of the simians.
