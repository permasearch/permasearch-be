In Hindu scriptures, Bharata (Sanskrit: भरत, translit. bharata, lit. 'The Cherished')[1][2] is an ancestor of the Pandavas and the Kauravas in the Sanskrit epic Mahabharata. Though the Bhāratas are a prominent community in the Rigveda,[3] the story of Bharata is first told in the Adi Parva of the Mahabharata, wherein he is the son of Dushyanta and Shakuntala.[4][5]  The story of his parents and his birth is also related in Kalidasa's famous play Abhijñānashākuntala.
