"Something There" has garnered mostly positive reviews from film and music critics. Writing for Den of Geek, Simon Brew felt that "Something There" is "where the genius of music as storytelling kicks in." In Brew's opinion, the "utterly convincing and un-mawkish" song works "because the two characters aren't on screen singing directly at each other." Brew concluded, "Everyone who makes an animated film that has a love story at the heart should watch this."[22] Filmtracks.com described "Something There" as an "affable" song.[32] Particularly praising Ashman's songwriting, Charles Solomon of the Los Angeles Times wrote that "Ashman's songs advance the plot by exploring the characters' emotions and making story points more concisely than conventional exposition." Solomon concluded, "By the end of the deceptively simple-sounding 'Something There,' the audience understands what Belle and Beast feel and how disconcerting those emotions seem."[29] O'Hara continues to cite "Something There" as her favorite of the film's songs,[38][39] elaborating, "Every time I see the Beast with that grin on his face and the bird in his hand, my heart just melts."[40]
