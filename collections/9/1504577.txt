For the signature challenge in the final, the last three bakers were tasked to make a batch of 12 small loaves. There must be three different types of loaves: four need to be intricately shaped (e.g. plaited), four need to be flavoured, and four need to be made from an alternative grain such as spelt or buckwheat. Prue set the final technical challenge and asked the bakers to make 10 ginger biscuits, half of them to be oval and half of them to be square.[28] They all need to have a great snap and be intricately iced with two complicated patterns. For the ultimate showstopper challenge, the bakers were tasked to make one large entremet. The entremet must have a minimum of five elements, one of which must be a sponge, and covered with a glaze or ganache.[29]
