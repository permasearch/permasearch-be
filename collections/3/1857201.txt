Although adoption of wine consumption is not recommended by some health authorities,[21] a significant volume of research indicates moderate consumption, such as one glass of red wine a day for women and two for men, may confer health benefits.[22][23][24] Emerging evidence is that wine polyphenols such as resveratrol[25] provide physiological benefit, whereas alcohol itself may have protective effects on the cardiovascular system.[26] More may be seen in the article Long-term effects of alcohol.
