Indonesia is a very ethnically diverse country, with around 300 distinct native ethnic groups.[221] Most Indonesians are descended from Austronesian-speaking peoples whose languages can be traced to Proto-Austronesian, which possibly originated in prehistoric Taiwan. Another major grouping are the Melanesians, who inhabit eastern Indonesia.[31][15][222] Javanese people are the largest ethnic group, comprising 40.2% of the population.[4] They are predominantly located in the central to eastern parts of Java and also significant numbers in most provinces of Indonesia. The Sundanese, Batak and Madurese are the largest non-Javanese groups.[b] A sense of Indonesian nationhood exists alongside strong regional identities.[223]
