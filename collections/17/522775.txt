On January 1, 1990, Florida hired Steve Spurrier to coach the Gators. Smith, concerned about his potential role in Spurrier's reportedly pass-first offense,[A] decided to forgo his senior year at Florida and enter the NFL draft, which for the first time in history allowed juniors to be eligible.[7] Smith returned to the university during the NFL off-season and completed his bachelor's degree in 1996.
