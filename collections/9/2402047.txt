On July 28, the Portolá party reached a major southern California river, which the soldiers called the Santa Ana River. That afternoon they felt a strong earthquake, with aftershocks jolting them over the next few days. On August 2 they traveled west out of San Gabriel Valley, through the hills to a river Crespí named El Río de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles de Porciúncula — site of the future pueblo of Los Angeles. They continued moving northwest along a route that would become El Camino Real (royal path or road) in Alta California.
