On 13 March 2018, China's CCTV incidentally showed Yicai's Liang Xiangyi apparently rolling her eyes in disgust at a long-winded and canned media question during the widely watched National People's Congress. In the aftermath, Liang's name became the most-censored search term on Weibo.[124][125] The government also blocked the search query "journalist in blue" and attempted to censor popular memes inspired by the eye-roll.[126][127]
