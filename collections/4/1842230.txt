The Regency Bill of 1789 was a proposed Act of Parliament to provide that King George III's eldest son George, Prince of Wales, would act as regent due to the King's incapacity through mental illness.  With no legislation already in place, there was no legal basis for providing a regent, and the King was in no fit state to give Royal Assent to the Act.  Parliament decided to have the Lord Chancellor (Lord Thurlow) approve the bill by fixing the Great Seal of the Realm to give Royal Assent.  However, the King recovered in time before the bill could be passed.  Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, and others thought the Act illegal; but following his recovery, the King declared that the government had acted correctly.
