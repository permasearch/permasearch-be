Later, a fully reformed Faith, having been broken out of prison to save Angel, returns to Sunnydale to help fight The First. When Buffy leads the Potentials to attack Caleb and his allies, several are killed and Xander loses an eye in the fight. The Scoobies and the Potentials begin to question Buffy's leadership skill. They mutiny against her, electing a reluctant Faith as their new leader. Spike, however, stays loyal to Buffy and informs her that he has learned of an ancient weapon, known as the Scythe, that was designed for the Slayer. While Buffy fights Caleb and finds the Scythe, Faith leads the Potentials on a mission, only to find they've been tricked as a time bomb explodes. Following the explosion, several Turok-Han attack the survivors. Buffy saves the lives of the remaining Potential Slayers and reconciles with Faith.
