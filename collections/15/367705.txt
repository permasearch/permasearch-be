The car was named the DMC-12 because of its intended price of US$12,000. Upon release in 1981, a DMC-12 had a suggested retail price of US$25,000 ($650 more when equipped with an automatic transmission); this is equivalent to approximately US$67,295 in 2017.[31].  MSRP would increase in 1982 to $29,825[32] and again in 1983 to $34,000[33].  At the outset, there were extensive waiting lists of people willing to pay up to $10,000 above the list price; however, after the collapse of the DeLorean Motor Company, unsold cars could be purchased for less than the retail price.[34]
