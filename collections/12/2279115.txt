Service: Chef's tables featured Adrienne Maloof in the red kitchen and J.J. Redick in the blue kitchen. Also in attendance were Blake Lewis and Mircea Monroe. Devin and Ryan handled the shrimp and grits appetizer. The blue team had a decent performance, their only problems being Andrew serving soggy catfish and Koop serving a raw Wellington. The red team had a rocky service; Despite Kimberly's strong performance on appetizers, Shaina struggled on meat, serving overcooked then raw chicken, while Wendy struggled with the fried catfish. After Shaina served raw wellingtons twice and Wendy serving raw catfish twice, Ramsay kicked the women out.
