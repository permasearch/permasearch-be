The official draw was held on 8 March 2018, 11:00 CET (UTC+1), at the Rennes Opera House in Rennes.[19][20][21][22][23] The teams were seeded based on their performances in previous U-20 Women's World Cups and confederation tournaments, with the hosts France automatically seeded and assigned to position A1. Teams of the same confederation could not meet in the group stage, except for UEFA with five teams so one group would contain two UEFA teams.[24]
