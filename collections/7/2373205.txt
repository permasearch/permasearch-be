As a simple example, consider the problem of finding the value of x that minimizes     f ( x ) =  x  2     {\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}}  , constrained such that      x  2   = 1   {\displaystyle x^{2}=1}  . (This problem is somewhat pathological because there are only two values that satisfy this constraint, but it is useful for illustration purposes because the corresponding unconstrained function can be visualized in three dimensions.)
