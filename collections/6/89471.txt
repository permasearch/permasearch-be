The line about Donovan and "his crystal images" refers to the mention of "crystal spectacles" in "Epistle to Dippy".[citation needed] The song[vague] is also noted for its psychedelic feedback effects, miming the volume swell on the electric guitar from Donovan's 1966 song "Sunshine Superman". The backing vocal effect in the verse,[vague] parodying the Beatles, reflects "Yellow Submarine".[citation needed]
