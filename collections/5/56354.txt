In the tenth inning, Jansen hit McCann with a pitch to put him on base with two outs. Subsequently, Springer walked on five pitches to move McCann to second base. McCann was then replaced by pinch runner Derek Fisher.[79] On the next pitch, Bregman singled in Fisher for the winning run.[80] Bregman became the third youngest player to have a walk-off hit in the World Series ever. The Astros became only the second team to come back twice from three runs down in a World Series game,[81] the other were the Toronto Blue Jays in the 15–14 win during Game 4 of the 1993 World Series. The six game tying home runs in the series to this point is the most for any World Series on record.[82] This World Series set a new record for most players to hit a home run (14 to date in the World Series).[81] With the teams combining to score 25 runs throughout the game, this was the highest scoring World Series game since the Florida Marlins defeated the Cleveland Indians 14–11 in Game 3 of the 1997 World Series.[83] Game 5 lasted five hours and seventeen minutes, making it the second longest World Series game in history by time, trailing only the 14 inning contest between the Astros and the Chicago White Sox in Game 3 of the 2005 World Series in the same ballpark, as well as the third World Series game ever to go beyond five hours of game time. This game is considered one of the greatest World Series games of all time.[84]
