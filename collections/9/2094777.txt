Many states criminalized needle possession without a prescription, arresting people as they left private needle exchange facilities.[45] In jurisdictions where syringe-prescription status presented a legal barrier, physician-based prescription programs showed promise.[46] Epidemiological research demonstrating that syringe access programs are both effective and cost-effective helped to change state and local NEP-operation laws, as well as the status of syringe possession more broadly.[47] As of 2006, 48 states authorized needle exchange in some form or allowed the purchase of sterile syringes without a prescription at pharmacies.[48]
