In the run up to the 2010 general election there were reports that the Conservatives would raise VAT if they gained power.[21][22][23] The party denied the reports.[24][25] Following the election in May 2010, the Conservatives formed a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats. In the 2010 budget, described by PM David Cameron as an "emergency budget", Chancellor George Osborne announced that the standard rate of VAT would increase from 17.5% to 20% with effect from 4 January 2011.[26][27]
