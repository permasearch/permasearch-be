Corgan insisted during this period that the band would not reform, although when Zwan broke up he announced, "I think my heart was in Smashing Pumpkins [â€¦] I think it was naive of me to think that I could find something that would mean as much to me."[64] Corgan said in 2005, "I never wanted to leave the Smashing Pumpkins. That was never the plan."[65] On February 17, 2004, Corgan posted a message on his personal blog calling Wretzky a "mean-spirited drug addict" and blaming Iha for the breakup of the Smashing Pumpkins.[66] On June 3, 2004, he added that "the depth of my hurt [from Iha] is only matched with the depth of my gratitude".[67] Iha responded to Corgan's claims in 2005, saying, "No, I didn't break up the band. The only person who could have done that is Billy."[68]
