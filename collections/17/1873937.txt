The city of Chester was an important Roman stronghold. There may have been a Christian basilica on the site of the present cathedral in the late Roman era,[4] while Chester was controlled by Legio XX Valeria Victrix.[5] Legend holds that the basilica was dedicated to Saint Paul and Saint Peter.[6] This is supported by evidence that in Saxon times the dedication of an early chapel on this site was changed from Saint Peter to Saint Werburgh.[7]
