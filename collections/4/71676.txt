While most of the collaborators on the album were just songwriters, the band also brought in vocal producers because they wanted a different perspective on how to approach the vocals.[24] Among the collaborators are Justin Parker,[25] Conner Youngblood, Jon Green,[26] blackbear,[27] Andrew Goldstein,[28] Eg White,[25] Emily Wright,[29] Andrew Bolooki, Andrew Dawson, RAC, Corrin Roddick,[20] and Ross Golan.[30] American singer Kiiara also had a seven-hour session with Linkin Park to record her vocals for "Heavy", and rappers Stormzy and Pusha T contributed to the album with original verses. In the past the band had a different approach to collaborations, as explained by Mike: "Usually it means weâ€™ve finished the song but we'll ask somebody to add something to the top of it." He added: "Generally, here's how it would work: we'd get in the room with someone, and start on something from scratch with them. We worked mostly in the same way we always write songs, but with extra firepower in the room."[31]
