The first recorded instances of high jumping competitions were in Scotland in the 19th century.[67] Further competitions were organised in 1840 in England and in 1865 the basic rules of the modern event were standardised there.[68] Athletes have a short run up and then take off from one foot to jump over a horizontal bar and fall back onto a cushioned landing area.[69] The men's high jump was included in the 1896 Olympics and a women's competition followed in 1928.
