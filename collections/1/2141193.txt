During the game against Buffalo, Hostetler was called in the game to replace Simms after Simms had suffered a foot injury. The Giants lost the game, dropping them to 11-3 on the year, but Hostetler was able to lead them to victories in their last two regular season games and their first playoff game against the Chicago Bears.
