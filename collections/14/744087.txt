Obi-Wan later tracks Grievous to Utapau. When Kenobi destroys his MagnaGuards, Grievous duels the Jedi in single combat, splitting each of his mechanical arms in half to simultaneously use four lightsabers. The Republic's Clone Troopers then arrive to engage Grievous' Droid Army. Obi-Wan disarms Grievous with the Force and pursues him when the General retreats on his wheelbike, fleeing to the hanger where his starfighter is located. The two engage in hand-to-hand combat, and Grievous easily overpowers Kenobi. Before the General can deliver the final blow, however, Obi-Wan uses Grievous' own blaster to incinerate his organs underneath his cyborg exoskeleton, killing him.
