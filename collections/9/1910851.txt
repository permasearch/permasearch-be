Rose Lalonde is portrayed as an "intellectual", both through her obsession of Lovecraftian literature and through her organizing and planning the group's movement during the story. Besides having an interest in magic, the character enjoys knitting and uses her knitting needles as her go-to weapons.[6] Rose forms a same-gendered relationship with Kanaya Maryam during Homestuck's run.
