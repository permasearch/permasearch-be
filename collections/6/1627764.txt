One possibility is that a police officer wearing this technology could become a 'roving surveillance camera'.[110] If the bodycams are equipped with biometric facial recognition technology, this could have a major impact on people's everyday lives, depending on the reliability of the technology to prevent false positives (those that are mistaken for a person on a list of suspects, for instance). Furthermore, cameras equipped with facial recognition technology heighten worries over “secret surveillance at a distance”.[111] With 117 million Americans in the FBI’s shared database according to the Georgetown Report,[111] people are fearful of the police’s ability to identify them in public and gather information about where they’ve been and where they might be going. Information about citizens whereabouts can consistently be tracked if they appear in public and it happens without their knowledge. There are more concerns about the advancement of these facial recognition technologies in body cams and the lack of government regulation over them. There is no federal law in place that directly protects Americans when it comes to the use of facial recognition technology. Only Illinois and Texas have regulations, “that requires an individual to give consent for their biometrics to be used, protecting its application in a system that it was not originally intended for”.[111]
