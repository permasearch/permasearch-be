Desktop publishing was first developed at Xerox PARC in the 1970s.[1][2] A contradictory claim states that desktop publishing began in 1983 with a program developed by James Davise at a community newspaper in Philadelphia.[3] The program Type Processor One ran on a PC using a graphics card for a WYSIWYG display and was offered commercially by Best info in 1984.[4] (Desktop typesetting with only limited page makeup facilities had arrived in 1978â€“9 with the introduction of TeX, and was extended in the early 1980s by LaTeX.) The DTP market exploded in 1985 with the introduction in January of the Apple LaserWriter printer, and later in July with the introduction of PageMaker software from Aldus, which rapidly became the DTP industry standard software. Later on, PageMaker overtook Microsoft Word in professional DTP in 1985. The term "desktop publishing" is attributed to Aldus founder Paul Brainerd,[5] who sought a marketing catch-phrase to describe the small size and relative affordability of this suite of products, in contrast to the expensive commercial phototypesetting equipment of the day.
