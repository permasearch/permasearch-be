In the United States, publicly traded entities which use LIFO for taxation purposes must also use LIFO for financial reporting purposes [3] but such companies are also likely to report a LIFO reserve to their shareholders. A number of tax reform proposals have argued for the repeal of LIFO tax provision. The "Save LIFO Coalition" argues in favor of the retention of LIFO.[4]
