The nbtstat command removes and corrects preloaded entries using a number of case-sensitive switches. The nbtstat - a < name > command performs a NetBIOS adapter status command on the computer name specified by < name> . The adapter status command returns the local NetBIOS name table for that computer as well as the MAC address of the adapter card. The nbtstat -A < IP address > command performs the same function using a target IP address rather than a name. Nbtstat is a diagnostic tool for NetBIOS over TCP/IP. It is included in several versions of Microsoft Windows. Its primary design is to help troubleshoot NetBIOS name resolution problems.[1]
