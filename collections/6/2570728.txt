Cooper and Griffin co-hosted New Year's Eve live on December 31, 2014, live from New York's Times Square. The program aired from 9:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. eastern, the longest running time ever for the duo. Don Lemon and Brooke Baldwin hosted from 12:30-1:05 a.m. eastern, ringing in the Central Time Zone's New Year from New Orleans. Griffin's antics were tame compared to previous years, as her only trick of the night was to put red and blue dye in Cooper's gray hair.
