The installed capacity of commercial solar thermal power plants (non storage type) in India is 227.5 MW with 50 MW in Andhra Pradesh and 177.5 MW in Rajasthan.[82][83] Solar thermal plants with thermal storage are emerging as cheaper (US 6.1 Â¢/kWh or Rs 3.97/KWh) and clean load following power plants to supply electricity round the clock.[84][85] They can cater the load demand perfectly and work as base load power plants when the extracted solar energy is found excess in a day.[86] Proper mix of solar thermal (thermal storage type) and solar PV can fully match the load fluctuations without the need of costly battery storage.[87][88]
