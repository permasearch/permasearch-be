Florence is believed to have the greatest concentration of art (in proportion to its size) in the world.[47] Thus, cultural tourism is particularly strong, with world-renowned museums such as the Uffizi selling over 1.93Â million tickets in 2014.[48] The city's convention centre facilities were restructured during the 1990s and host exhibitions, conferences, meetings, social forums, concerts and other events all year.
