Ernie McCoy became the second former All-American Wolverine player to coach the team.[3] Like Oosterbaan before him, he became a football and baseball coach at Michigan. He also served as assistant Athletic Director under Fritz Crisler. During his four seasons as basketball coach, Michigan's best finish was during the 1948–49 season when they finished 15–6 overall (7–5, Big Ten) and earned a third place Big Ten Conference finish. He coached Michigan's first All-Big Ten basketball players that season in Pete Elliot and captain Bob Harrison who were both selected to the first team.[17] Harrison returned the following season as the first repeat first-team All-Big Ten basketball player and Elliot was a second-team honoree.[18] McCoy served as a football scout at the same time.[17]
