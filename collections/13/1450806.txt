In the simplest case, an ESMTP server will declare a maximum SIZE immediately after receiving an EHLO. According to RFCÂ 1870, however, the numeric parameter to the SIZE extension in the EHLO response is optional. Clients may instead, when issuing a MAIL FROM command, include a numeric estimate of the size of the message they are transferring, so that the server can refuse receipt of overly-large messages.
