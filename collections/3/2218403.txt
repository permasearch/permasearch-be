The Alberta government computes an Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) from sensors in five communities in the oil sands region, operated by a "partner" called the Wood Buffalo Environmental Association (WBEA). Each of their 17 continuously monitoring stations measure 3 to 10 air quality parameters among carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen sulphide (H 2S), total reduced sulfur (TRS), Ammonia (NH 3), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone (O 3), particulate matter (PM2.5), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), total hydrocarbons (THC), and methane/non-methane hydrocarbons (CH 4/NMHC).[129] These AQHI are said to indicate 'low risk"'air quality more than 95% of the time.[130] Prior to 2012, air monitoring showed significant increases in exceedances of hydrogen sulfide (H 2S) both in the Fort McMurray area and near the oil sands upgraders.[131] In 2007, the Alberta government issued an environmental protection order to Suncor in response to numerous occasions when ground level concentration for H 2S) exceeded standards.[132] The Alberta Ambient Air Data Management System (AAADMS) of the Clean Air Strategic Alliance[133] (aka CASA Data Warehouse) records that, during the year ending on 1 November 2015, there were 6 hourly reports of values exceeding the limit of 10 ppb for H 2S, and 4 in 2013, down from 11 in 2014, and 73 in 2012.[134]
