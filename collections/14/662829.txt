At the Colored Waif's home, Armstrong developed his cornet playing skills by playing in the band with other residents. Professor Peter Davis (who frequently appeared at the home at the request of Captain Jones[26]) instilled discipline in and provided musical training to the otherwise self-taught Armstrong. Eventually, Davis made Armstrong the band leader. The home band played around New Orleans and the thirteen-year-old Louis began to draw attention for his cornet playing, including from Kid Ory, starting him on a musical career.[27]
