A non-functional fucosyltransferase FUT2 provides high protection from the most common norovirus GII.4.[67] Functional FUT2 fucosyltransferase transfers a fucose sugar to the end of the Histo-blood group ABO(H) precursor in gastrointestinal cells and saliva glands. The ABH antigen produced is thought to act as receptors for human norovirus. Homozygous carriers of any nonsense mutation in the FUT2 gene are called non-secretors, as no ABH antigen is produced. Approximately 20% of Caucasians are non-secretors due to the G428A and C571T nonsense mutations in FUT2 and therefore have strong although not absolute protection from the norovirus GII.4.[68] Non-secretors can still produce ABH antigens in erythrocytes, as the precursor is formed by FUT1.[69] Some norovirus genotypes (GI.3) can infect non-secretors.[70]
