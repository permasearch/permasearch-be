Dangers arise in higher dosages because promethazine is a depressant of the central nervous system and codeine is a respiratory depressant. When codeine is taken in very large amounts, it can cause one to stop breathing.[10] Using alcohol and other drugs alongside purple drank increases the chance of problems.[10] Fallieras stated that the concoction does not cause seizures itself but increases their likelihood in those susceptible to them.[10] The drink includes a "massive" amount of the opiate codeine, which can be addictive in high doses, and Fallieras states that "promethazine has at least anecdotally been noted to intensify the euphoric effects of codeine in the brain."[10]
