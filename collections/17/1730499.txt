Mount Fuji is the tallest volcano in Japan, and also the highest peak.[1] The mountain as it appears now is the "New Fuji volcano", which began to erupt about 10,000 years ago. Under the "New Fuji volcano" lies the "Old Fuji volcano", which was active between 100,000 years ago and 10,000 years ago, and the "Komitake volcano", which became active 700,000 years ago.
