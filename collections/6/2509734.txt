BT agreed a deal with Sony Pictures Television to offer its Sony Entertainment Television and Sony Retro programming on-demand on BT Vision from 1 March 2010.[4] The move marked Sony Entertainment Television's debut in the UK market, over a year ahead of the launch of the Sony Entertainment Television channel. Sony Entertainment Television and Sony Retro programming also appeared on TalkTalk TV during the YouView platform launch in 2012, but was later removed.
