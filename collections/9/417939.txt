Soil physics (Darcy-type model) predicts that at suctions less than one-third bar, water moves theoretically in all directions via unsaturated flow at a rate that is dependent on the square of the diameter of the water-filled pores,[333] but there is still not an adequate physical theory linking all types of waterflow in soil.[334] Preferential flow occurs along interconnected macropores, crevices, root and worm channels, which drain water under gravity.[335][336] Water is also pulled by capillary action due to the adhesion force of water to the soil solids, producing a suction gradient from wet towards drier soil[337] and from macropores to micropores.[338] Water flow (also called hydraulic conductivity) is primarily from coarse-textured soil into fine-textured soil horizons and is slowest in fine-textured soils such as clay.[339][340]
