Major Arnold Ernst Toht (Ronald Lacey) is the Gestapo agent who attempts to steal the medallion from Marion, but his hand is badly burned by it, as it had been engulfed in flames prior to his grabbing it. The scarred inscription on his hand is used by the Nazis to pinpoint the Ark's location, but as his hand lacks the code on its other side, they end up digging in the wrong area. His face melts after he is exposed to the supernatural powers of the Ark; in the novelization Toht dies when Gobler's car flies off a cliff. In a sequel comic book, Indy is confronted by his vengeful sister Ilsa.[20]
