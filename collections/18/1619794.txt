Many jurisdictions around the world use a system called Instant-runoff voting (IRV) or ranked choice voting.  Each voter would rank all (or at least some) of the available options.  If one option is ranked first by a majority of voters, it wins.  Otherwise, the option(s) obtaining the least number of votes is (are) eliminated, and the options ranked second by those voters get those votes.
