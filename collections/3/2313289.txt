The hijra community developed a secret language known as Hijra Farsi.[43] The language has a sentence structure loosely based on Hindi-Urdu[43] and a unique vocabulary of at least a thousand words.[citation needed] Beyond the Urdu-Hindi speaking areas of subcontinent the vocabulary is still used by the hijra community within their own native languages.[citation needed]
