In October 2017 a team of researchers from Masaryk University announced the ROCA vulnerability, which affects RSA keys generated by an algorithm embodied in a library from Infineon. Large number of smart cards and TPMs were shown to be affected. Vulnerable RSA keys are easily identified using a test program the team released.[34]
