Anderson is known for his use of long takes in his films, moving along considerable distances with complex pivoting movements and transitions in actors and background.[12] Of the long takes in Magnolia, the most notable may be the 2 minutes 15 seconds where character Stanley Spector arrives at the studio for a taping of What Do Kids Know?, the camera seamlessly moving through multiple rooms and hallways, transitioning to follow different characters throughout the take.[13]
