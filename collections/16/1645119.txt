The 1999 National Rugby League grand final, played on 26 September between the Melbourne Storm and the St George Illawarra Dragons, broke the rugby league world-record crowd previously set earlier in the season when 107,999 came to watch the Storm defeat the Dragons 20â€“18 to win their first NRL premiership. Storm captain Glenn Lazarus, who had previously won grand finals with Canberra (1989 and 1990), and Brisbane (1992 and 1993) retired after the game having played 254 games.
