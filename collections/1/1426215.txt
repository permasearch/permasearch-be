The Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario leadership election was scheduled for 3 months before the 2018 provincial election scheduled for June 7. It came after a turbulent year of disputed and allegedly fraudulent nominations contests across the province for local PC candidates.[4]  In two of these contests; Ottawa West—Nepean and Scarborough Centre the nominations were overturned after Brown's resignation and Brown's own nomination in Barrie—Springwater—Oro-Medonte was cancelled.[5] At the time of the leadership election Newmarket—Aurora and five others remained under active investigation by the party[6] and Hamilton West—Ancaster—Dundas remained under police investigation.[7]
