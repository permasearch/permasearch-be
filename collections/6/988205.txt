Why not simply add a new section in the article discussing the points for/against Eli's blindness, with links to references or interviews to illustrate them? The debate certainly has some encyclopedic value and would extinguish a useless edit war, unfortunately maintained by registered users. This would enable to write the plot section without mention of Eli's hypothetical blindness. â€”Preceding unsigned comment added by 86.162.27.75 (talk) 15:51, 11 May 2011 (UTC)
