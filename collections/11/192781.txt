There was widespread panic again over the American banking system due to fears over the strength of many banks in The Great Depression; more than one-third of all U.S. banks were closed by bank runs.[2] Bank runs, sudden demands by large numbers of customers to withdraw all their funds at almost the same time, brought down many bank companies as depositors attempted to withdraw more money than the bank had available as cash. Small banks in rural areas were especially affected. Written and publicly announced reassurances and tightened regulations by the government failed to assuage depositors' fears.
