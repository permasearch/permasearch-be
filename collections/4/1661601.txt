In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked the song number 265 on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, adding: "'Higher Ground' was recorded just before Wonder was involved in a near-fatal accident in August 1973 that left him in a coma. Early in Wonder's recovery, his road manager sang the song's melody into the singer's ear; Wonder responded by moving his fingers with the music."[6]
