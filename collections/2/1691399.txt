Unlike neighboring Gatlinburg and Sevierville, Pigeon Forge had remained a dry jurisdiction of the state (Tennessee is dry by default), with a few select premises opting to sell low-alcohol beers and some wines. Certain sections of Pigeon Forge, including religious leaders, oppose legalized liquor, warning of the social consequences that may follow, while others argue that the city is losing tax dollars to neighboring cities.
