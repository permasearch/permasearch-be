P. T. Barnum, who as a boy had worked as a ticket seller for Hachaliah Bailey's show, had run the Barnum's American Museum from New York City since 1841 from the former Scudder's American Museum building.[2] Besides building up the existing exhibits, Barnum brought in animals to add zoo-like elements, and a freak show.[4] During this time, Barnum took the Museum on road tours, named "P.T. Barnum's Grand Traveling American Museum".[4] The Museum burned down in July 1865.[5] Though Barnum attempted to re-establish the Museum at another location in the city, it too burned down in 1868, and Barnum opted to retire from the museum business.
