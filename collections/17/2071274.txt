As an approach, design thinking taps into innate human capacities that are overlooked by more conventional problem-solving practices.[23] The process is best thought of as a system of overlapping spaces rather than a sequence of orderly steps: inspiration, ideation, and implementation;[30]or alternatively: empathize, define, ideate, prototype and test.[31] Projects may loop back through inspiration, ideation, and implementation more than once as the team refines its ideas and explores new directions. Therefore, design thinking can feel chaotic, but over the life of a project, participants come to see that the process makes sense and achieves results, even though its form differs from the linear, milestone-based processes that organizations typically undertake.[32]
