Intrigued by the film's success with young viewers, CBS and MGM Television paid Nolan $9 million to base a television series on the film, but after debuting in 1977, the series was cancelled before the end of the season.[48] MGM also expressed interest in adapting Nolan's sequel novel Logan's World, but Saul David had opted to focus on the television series instead.[49] In the mid-1990s, Warner Bros. began development of a remake.[50] In 2000, ideas for a film remake centred on a more faithful adaptation of the novel, restoring Crazy Horse Mountain and the sky gypsies.[50]
