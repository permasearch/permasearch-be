In 2002, under the Mubarak government, Coptic Christmas (January the 7th) was recognized as an official holiday,[41] though Copts complain of being minimally represented in law enforcement, state security and public office, and of being discriminated against in the workforce on the basis of their religion.[42] Naguib Sawiris, one of Egyptians successful businessmen and one of the world's wealthiest 400 people[43] is a Copt. At the same time there is a large number of private companies shared by both Muslims and Copts.[citation needed]
