The boys have been approached by two huge companies that are interested in expanding the BTR brand a little farther. They have two options of choosing between getting their own cartoon or their own video game and seem really excited about doing the video game, but they would have to cancel the concert to Hawaii on the private jet and wear on green ball suits. After hearing about the cartoon they end up changing their minds and do the video game instead. After getting locked out of the studio, they get themselves into a big mix up with the people in downtown LA making them think that they're aliens. They finally decide to do the cartoon which turns out pretty well. Meanwhile, back at the Palm Woods while watching The Fairly OddParents, Buddha Bob ends up falling off his ladder and thinks that he's Cosmo and that he can grant wishes. It's up to Katie and Mrs. Knight to bring his memory back by calling in Dr. Hollywood and he ends up hitting Buddha Bob in his head with a frying pan.
