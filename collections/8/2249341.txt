The National Park Service (NPS) acquired the island in 1972 and declared it the Cumberland Island National Seashore. Since then, few new horses have been introduced to the island, though four Arabians were introduced in the early 1990s in the hopes of diversifying and bettering the existing population.[1] Since 1981, the NPS has been monitoring the horses and tracking their impact on the environment.[3] In 1991, an outbreak of eastern equine encephalitis killed about 40 horses, or approximately 18% of the herd.[4] The population on Cumberland Island is one of seven feral horse herds on US barrier islands.[5]
