Males generally exhibit larger home ranges than females,[11][12][13][14] which some authors suggest is due to more specific habitat requirements of females (e.g., denning or prey requirements) that limit their ability to shift home range.[12] However, unusually large home ranges were observed for 4 females in two studies (Alaska[18] and Quebec[9]). Males and females in northeastern California appeared to have approximately equal home range size.[19]
