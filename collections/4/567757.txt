Money in the Bank is the only WWE pay-per-view event with a regular theme song, as all but the first event have used "Money in the Bank" by in-house WWE composer Jim Johnston as its theme song.[2] This is in stark contrast to other pay-per-view events, which use songs sponsored by mainstream recording artists, which was the case with the first event using "Money" by I Fight Dragons.[3] Before the advent of the pay-per-view, the "Money in the Bank" song was used as the entrance music for future U.S. President Donald Trump for his numerous guest appearances on WWE television.[4]
