Amnesty International suspended Gita Sahgal, its gender unit head, after she criticized Amnesty in February 2010 for its high-profile associations with Moazzam Begg, the director of Cageprisoners, representing men in extrajudicial detention.[97][98] "To be appearing on platforms with Britain's most famous supporter of the Taliban, Begg, whom we treat as a human rights defender, is a gross error of judgment," she said.[97][99] Sahgal argued that by associating with Begg and Cageprisoners, Amnesty was risking its reputation on human rights.[97][100][101][102] "As a former Guantanamo detainee, it was legitimate to hear his experiences, but as a supporter of the Taliban it was absolutely wrong to legitimise him as a partner," Sahgal said.[97] She said she repeatedly brought the matter up with Amnesty for two years, to no avail.[103] A few hours after the article was published, Saghal was suspended from her position.[104] Amnesty's Senior Director of Law and Policy, Widney Brown, later said Sahgal raised concerns about Begg and Cageprisoners to her personally for the first time a few days before sharing them with the Sunday Times.[103]
