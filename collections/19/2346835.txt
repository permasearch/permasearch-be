The following year, the group scored highly again as their cover of "You Don't Have to Say You Love Me" peaked at No.5. Other singles by the group charted more modestly and they only charted one album, 1975's Guys 'n' Dolls.[4] In 1977 however, they scored a No.1 hit in both the Netherlands and Belgium with "You're My World", launching them on a new phase of their career.
