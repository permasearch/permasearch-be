Due to increase in people hit by trains in 2013,[224] in late 2013 and early 2014 the MTA started a test program at one undisclosed station, with four systems and strategies to eliminate the number of people hit by trains. Closed-circuit television cameras, a web of laser beams stretched across the tracks, radio frequencies transmitted across the tracks, and thermal imaging cameras focused on the station's tracks were set to be installed at that station.[225] At the unidentified station, tests have gone so well at the testing site that these track protection systems will be installed systemwide as part of the 2015â€“2019 capital program.[226]
