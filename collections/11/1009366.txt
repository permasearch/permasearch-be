At the outbreak of war in 1914, the huge number of volunteers answering the appeal of Secretary of State for War, Lord Kitchener, were formed into a New Army. The problem of providing uniforms for these recruits was acute and many trained in their civilian clothes for weeks. A highly simplified version of Service Dress was produced for them, without breast pockets, shoulder straps and other refinements. They were dark blue in colour, because the original khaki dye had been produced in Germany before the war and it had proved difficult to acquire sufficient from alternative sources. This colour gave rise to the popular name for the uniform; "Kitchener's Blues".  Around 500,000 sets of these uniforms were produced and worn during basic training.[8] Rumours that the first issue of Blues were actually postmen's uniforms are unlikely to be correct as the tunics issued by the General Post Office were of a different cut and were edged with red piping; however, some sources state that a large quantity of blue uniform cloth was acquired from Post Office stocks for this purpose.[9]
