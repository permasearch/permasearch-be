In 1963, a report on urban transport planning policy, Traffic in Towns, was produced for the UK Department of Transport by a team headed by the architect, civil engineer and planner Colin Buchanan.[59] While it advocated the construction and reorganisation of towns to accommodate the motor car and lorry, it stressed that this would have to be balanced with restrictions, in accordance with local needs. It highlighted the urgency of the problem of dealing with the expected massive growth in road traffic,[60] the damage it could cause to our towns and cities if unplanned,[61] the eventual need for demand management[62] but with implications of restricting the mass of the population from doing something they didn't see as wrong,[63] and of the inevitable need for a change in policy as the social costs increased.[64]
