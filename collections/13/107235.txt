Indians were over-represented in arrest records, that is they were arrested at higher rates than their proportion of the population.[87] They were most often arrested for drunkenness, theft, and violence.[88] Non-Indians (‘’gente de razón’’, a category that included Spaniards, mestizos, mulatos, and other mixed-race castas) were arrested for financial crimes (gambling, debt), tavern violations, family offenses, vagrancy, and disorderly conduct.[89] Indians and non-Indians were jailed separately.[90] Women were arrested less frequently than men, but they were still about a quarter of total arrests. Women were arrested for violence, mainly violence against other women.[91] An early nineteenth-century lithograph by Claudio Linati shows two Indian women fighting, each with a baby on her back.[92] Women also attacked men whom the woman knew as an acquaintance or a common law partner; less frequently they attacked their legitimate husbands.[93] One explanation for the pattern of female violence among the poor in Mexico City is that their position within the family was subordinate, that there was a pattern of male domestic violence “often growing out of a need to demonstrate virility or control over the wife”, resulting in the wife violently acting out against others outside of the nuclear family.[93] Women were also arrested for desertion at higher rates than men, mainly when the women were in their twenties. Arrest records indicate that many of these women had provincial origins and the women migrated to the capital leaving a spouse behind. Their arrests for desertion indicates their spouses wanted them reunited with the family. In trials the women often stated that nonsupport or domestic abuse was the reason they deserted.[94]
