Declaratory judgments are common in patent litigation, as well as in other areas of intellectual property litigation, because declaratory judgments allow an alleged infringer to "clear the air" about a product or service that may be a business's focal point. Take, for example, a typical patent-infringement claim. When a patent owner becomes aware of an infringer, the owner can simply wait until he pleases to bring an infringement suit.[11] Meanwhile, the monetary damages continuously accrue â€“ with no effort expended by the patent owner, apart from marking the patent number on products the patent owner sold or licensed.[12] On the other hand, the alleged infringer could do nothing to rectify the situation if no declaratory judgment existed. The alleged infringer would be forced to continue to operate his business with the cloud of a lawsuit over his head. Fortunately, the declaratory-judgment procedure allows the alleged infringer to proactively bring suit to resolve the situation and eliminate the cloud of uncertainty looming overhead.
