In the preface to his book, the Muqaddimah (1377), the Arab historian and early sociologist, Ibn Khaldun, warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed. In this criticism, he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation. Ibn Khaldun often criticized "idle superstition and uncritical acceptance of historical data." As a result, he introduced a scientific method to the study of history, and he often referred to it as his "new science".[13] His historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of state, communication, propaganda and systematic bias in history,[14] and he is thus considered to be the "father of historiography"[15][16] or the "father of the philosophy of history".[17]
