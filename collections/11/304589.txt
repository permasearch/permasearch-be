Director Christopher Nolan had met with Ledger over the years for different roles. While meeting for the part of Batman in Batman Begins, Ledger explained that he was not interested in working on such a film.[4][5] The actor reflected on his problems with portraying superheroes, saying; "I would just feel stupid and silly. I couldn't pull it off and there are other people who can perfectly, but I just couldn't take myself seriously."[1] However, later impressed with Batman Begins,[5][6] Ledger sought the part of the Joker from Nolan.[5] Impressed with Ledger's determination, Nolan cast him in the part.[7] "Heath was just ready to do it, he was ready to do something that big."[8] Casting director John Papsidera reflected on the casting choice, saying the filmmakers knew they needed somebody courageous to play the part.[9] Heath Ledger was cast before there was a script.[10]
