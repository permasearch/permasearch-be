A return to the gold standard was considered by the US Gold Commission back in 1982, but found only minority support.[96] In 2001 Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad proposed a new currency that would be used initially for international trade among Muslim nations, using the Islamic gold dinar, defined as 4.25Â grams of pure (24-carat) gold. Mahathir claimed it would be a stable unit of account and a political symbol of unity between Islamic nations. This would purportedly reduce dependence on the US dollar and establish a non-debt-backed currency in accord with Sharia law that prohibited the charging of interest.[97] As of 2013[update] the global monetary system continued to rely on the US dollar as the main reserve currency.[98]
