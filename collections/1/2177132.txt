There was a petition at coffeecrisp.org asking Nestlé to market the Coffee Crisp in all U.S. cities. According to the site, the petition succeeded,[1] and Nestlé began marketing the Coffee Crisp nationwide in late July 2006.[2] In April 2009, the marketing of the Coffee Crisp bar into the U.S. was discontinued by Nestlé Canada.[citation needed] In May 2009 Coffee Crisp was being exported into the U.S. market by British Wholesale Imports.
