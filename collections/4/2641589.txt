Thurso railway station opened in 1874. It was the most northern station on the Sutherland and Caithness Railway.[58] The station became part of the Highland Railway Company in the late 19th century[59] before being absorbed into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923.[60] and it is now part of the Far North Line.[61]
