Archer's animation style mirrors the aesthetic of Mad Men and mid-century comic art in the style of Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, among others.[55][56][12] Line work is pronounced by thick, bold outlines, in contrast to the very fine, thin line work characteristic of prime time comedies such as The Simpsons and Family Guy.[56] The Atlanta-based studio Radical Axis and Kansas City-based studio Trinity Animation were responsible for animating Archer in its early years;[55][57] the show's production base has since relocated to a set of offices in Atlantic Station.[58] Production of the comedy involves a workforce of 70 crew members from Reed's Atlanta-based company Floyd County Productions, double the number that worked on its freshman season.[59]
