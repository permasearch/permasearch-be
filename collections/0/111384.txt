Holland is a region and former province on the western coast of the Netherlands. The name Holland is also frequently used informally to refer to the whole of the country of the Netherlands. This usage is commonly accepted in other countries, and not entirely uncommon among the Dutch themselves. However, some in the Netherlands, particularly in other regions of the country, may find it undesirable[2] or misrepresentative.
