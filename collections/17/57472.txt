Mehrotra gave a thrilling solo spotlight performance (Sixth) as a psychotic killer in his act. This act reminded the audience of the common man from the movie A Wednesday! played by veteran actor Naseeruddin Shah. The act had a great social message that no one should take the law in his or her hands. Johar talked about the recent film of Rani Mukerji Hichki, where she has used her heart and head in a very balanced way. Shetty mentioned that Mehrotraâ€™s intense acts might be taking a monotonous turn. So he had helped him to improvise a bit. After receiving criticism in the last episode, he thanked the mentors for guiding him. This intense act was appreciated by the judges and audience alike and he scored a perfect ten again. Deo supported the role by playing a cop.
