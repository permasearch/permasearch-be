In the NBA and WNBA, no team can be reduced to four players, so such a player stays in the game.  If another of the five players is ejected or injured, the last player to foul out rejoins the game. In these reinsertions, the team is assessed a technical foul. In addition, any additional foul the player commits draws another technical foul. This results in one or an extra free throw for the opponents, even if the player's foul would not normally result in free throws.  (These technical fouls are not for unsportsmanlike conduct, so they do not result in ejections from the game.)
