When Sandy finally tells everyone it was Danny Zuko, Rizzo arranges a surprise reunion for the two at a pep rally, where Sandy is cheering along with high-achiever and resident swot, Patty Simcox (Susan Buckner). At the rally, Sandy catches the eye of a muscly member of the football team (Lorenzo Lamas). When Sandy and Danny are reunited, they are initially elated, but Danny soon slips back into his greaser attitude, which offends Sandy. At the same rally, Kenickie reveals his new car, a dilapidated used jalopy, and announces he has entered it into a "pinks" street race at Thunder Road.
