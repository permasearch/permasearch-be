Dishonored 2 is an action-adventure stealth game played from a first-person perspective. After playing as Empress Emily Kaldwin during the prologue, players may decide to play either as Emily or as Corvo Attano (the protagonist from the previous game).[1] Side missions unlock alternate methods of assassination, non-lethal approaches and paths to navigate the main mission.[1][2][3][4] Both characters wield swords, pistols, crossbows, a retractable blade, grenades and minesâ€”all of which are upgradable.[2] Upgrades may be purchased at black market shops found throughout the levels, and blueprints scattered across levels unlock new potential upgrades (in New Game Plus playthroughs, blueprints already acquired are converted into additional coin). Coin is required to buy these upgrades, which again may be found throughout a level or gained from other collectibles, like stealing paintings.[5] Players can choose whether to play stealthily or not, and can finish the game without taking a life.[6] Health elixirs and food consumables will restore health, while mana elixirs replenish mana.[2]
