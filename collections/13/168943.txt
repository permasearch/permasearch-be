She was later kidnapped by Cipher in order to blackmail Dom into abandoning his family and retrieve nuclear launch codes, after it was revealed that Dom had fathered a child with Elena in Letty's absence. After failing to retrieve the launch codes from Letty after an encounter in New York City, Dom returned to the base of operations to find Elena tied to a chair, with Cipher holding Dom's son. As punishment for Dom being unable to shoot Letty to retrieve the launch codes, Cipher ordered one of her henchmen, Rhodes, to execute Elena by shooting her head and body in cold blood. She is a main character in Fast Five and a supporting character in Fast & Furious 6, Furious 7 and The Fate of the Furious.
