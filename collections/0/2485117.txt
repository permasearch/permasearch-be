According to Gary Hollywood, who plays Dino, on a radio interview, a Mrs. Brown's Boys Christmas Special for the year 2013 will be recorded in May 2013, due to a busy schedule of UK touring and the potential of filming the Mrs. Brown film (due for cinematic release in June 2014) from September to November 2013.[18] On 30 January 2013, the BBC announced that two Christmas specials had been commissioned for 2013.[19] In October 2013 The Mrs Brown's Boys Mother of all boxsets was re-released.
