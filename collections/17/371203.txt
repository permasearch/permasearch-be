The girls learn that long ago The Traveler gave Mama P, Ms. Silvers, and grandma each a morbium root seed; morbium makes any recipe a thousand times more powerful. Mama P says hers is long gone, but the girls realize that Ms. Silvers's was in the charm bracelet they returned to her. Hannah takes a piano lesson from Ms. Silvers to try to recover the seed, but things go wrong: Kelly's brother breaks a lamp while under Kelly's care, Darbie's school project goes wrong, and Ms. Silvers catches Hannah and kicks her out.
