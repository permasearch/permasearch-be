According to review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a "Certified Fresh" rating of 67%.[34] Roger Ebert panned the film, saying the concert footage was poorly lit and monotonous, with little use made of the crowds. Review partner Gene Siskel was more sympathetic, praising the music and finding the footage of the Harlem gospel choir particularly moving.[35] Joanou called the picture "pretentious".[36]
