The first show announced was Oxegen 2010 which took place in Ireland in July.[59] The band announced that they would play songs from the new album in their headline performance at the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2010, with Win Butler noting "We're really looking forward to playing the new songs live... [it's] like an inventor emerging from his basement after a year's work."[60]
