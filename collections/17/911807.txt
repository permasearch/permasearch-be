where     f (  q  i   , D )   {\displaystyle f(q_{i},D)}   is      q  i     {\displaystyle q_{i}}  's term frequency in the document D,      |  D  |    {\displaystyle |D|}   is the length of the document D in words, and avgdl is the average document length in the text collection from which documents are drawn.      k  1     {\displaystyle k_{1}}   and b are free parameters, usually chosen, in absence of an advanced optimization, as      k  1   âˆˆ [ 1.2 , 2.0 ]   {\displaystyle k_{1}\in [1.2,2.0]}   and     b = 0.75   {\displaystyle b=0.75}  .[1]      IDF  (  q  i   )   {\displaystyle {\text{IDF}}(q_{i})}   is the IDF (inverse document frequency) weight of the query term      q  i     {\displaystyle q_{i}}  . It is usually computed as:
