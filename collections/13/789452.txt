Unlike many other states of the period, Genoa gambled the majority of their economic interest on the Spanish monarchy—bankers invested their money in the crown and farmers of Spanish revenue, while Genoa’s merchants and nobles settled in Spain (Naples and Sicily) marrying local nobility and monopolizing majority of the trade. As long as New Spain was sending silver and gold to Seville, Genoa could flourish. Genoa became a large credit market as the capital of Italian cities was all drained towards Genoa.[19] A multitude of small investors, Genoese and others, obtained from the Crown long-term securities (juros de resguardo) as collateral for their loans; the contracts specified that these securities would be sold if the Crown did not repay the loans. In essence, the Genoese bankers had worked out an interest rate swap. Furthermore, the Crown sold silver spot in Spain to the Genoese in exchange for future delivery of gold in Antwerp, where the gold was used to pay Spanish troops fighting in the Low Countries.[19] Genoa benefited from the Price revolution as they enjoyed the advantage of “increasing returns to scale in international financial services”. Genoa during the price revolution was a snapshot of global finance at its best.[19] Unfortunately, The decline of Spain in the 17th century brought also the decline of Genoa (due to the Spanish crown's frequent bankruptcies), in particular, Genoa's merchant houses. Later in 1684, Genoa was bombed by a French fleet as punishment for its alliance with Spain and Genoese banker Ambrogio Spinola role in the Eighty Years' War in the Netherlands.
