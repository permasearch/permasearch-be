Pepto-Bismol is an over-the-counter drug currently produced by the Procter & Gamble company in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. Pepto-Bismol is made in chewable tablets[20] and swallowable caplets,[21] but it is best known for its original formula, which is a thick liquid. This original formula is a medium pink in color, with a strong wintergreen or cherry[citation needed] flavor.
