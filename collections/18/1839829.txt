Studies suggest that slow lorises are polygynandrous.[109] Infants are either parked on branches while their parents find food or else are carried by one of the parents.[94] Due to their long gestations (about six months), small litter sizes, low birth weights, long weaning times (three to six months),[110] and long gaps between births, slow loris populations have one of the slowest growth rates among mammals of similar size.[111] Pygmy slow lorises are likely to give birth to twins—from 50% to 100% of births, depending on the study; in contrast, this phenomenon is rare (3% occurrence) in Bengal slow lorises. A seven-year study of captive-bred pygmy slow lorises showed a skewed sex distribution, with 1.68 males born for every 1 female.[50]
