On 20 September 2017, Barcelona issued a statement exercising their stance on the 2017 Catalan Referendum quoting "FC Barcelona, in holding the utmost respect for its diverse body of members, will continue to support the will of the majority of Catalan people, and will do so in a civil, peaceful, and exemplary way".[144] The match against UD Las Palmas on the referendum day was requested to be postponed by the Barcelona board due to heavy violence in Catalonia, but it (the request) was declined by La Liga, therefore being held behind closed doors.[145] Two directors, Jordi Monés and Carles Vilarrubí, handed in a resignation in protest to the game being played.[146]
