On the other side of Australia, in Perth, germinal punk rock act the Cheap Nasties, featuring singer-guitarist Kim Salmon, formed in August.[159] In September 1976, the Saints became the first punk rock band outside the U.S. to release a recording, the single "(I'm) Stranded". As with Patti Smith's debut, the band self-financed, packaged, and distributed the single.[160] "(I'm) Stranded" had limited impact at home, but the British music press recognized it as a groundbreaking record.[161] At the insistence of their superiors in the UK, EMI Australia signed the Saints. Meanwhile, Radio Birdman came out with a self-financed EP, Burn My Eye, in October.[162] Trouser Press critic Ian McCaleb later described the record as the "archetype for the musical explosion that was about to occur".[163]
