In 1989, Steinman produced a concept album, Original Sin, with an all-female group called Pandora's Box. The album featured many tracks that would later be recorded by other artists, particularly Meat Loaf. Elaine Caswell was the lead vocalist for "It's All Coming Back To Me Now", who apparently collapsed five times during its recording.[6] Caswell has since performed the song as part of The Dream Engine at Joe's Pub in New York City.
