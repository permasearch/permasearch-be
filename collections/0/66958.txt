In early March 1971, approximately ~300 Biharis were slaughtered in rioting by Bengali mobs in Chittagong alone.[51] The Government of Pakistan used the "Bihari massacre'" to justify its deployment of the military in East Pakistan on 25 March when it initiated its military crackdown.[52] President Yahya Khan then called on the military, which was overwhelming led by West Pakistanis, to suppress dissent in the East after accepting the resignation of Lieutenant-General Yaqub Ali Khan, the chief of staff of the East-Pakistani military.[53][54]
