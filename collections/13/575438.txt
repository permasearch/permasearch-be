Some towns, such as York, suffered from Norman sacking during William's northern campaigns.[38] Other towns saw the widespread demolition of houses to make room for new motte and bailey fortifications, as was the case in Lincoln.[38] The Norman invasion also brought significant economic changes with the arrival of the first Jews to English cities.[39] WilliamÂ I brought over wealthy Jews from the Rouen community in Normandy to settle in London, apparently to carry out financial services for the crown.[40] In the years immediately after the invasion, a lot of wealth was drawn out of England in various ways by the Norman rulers and reinvested in Normandy, making William immensely wealthy as an individual ruler.[41]
