The first scale for measuring earthquake magnitudes was developed by Charles F. Richter in 1935. Subsequent scales (see Seismic scale) have retained a key feature, where each unit represents a ten-fold difference in the amplitude of the ground shaking, and a 32-fold difference in energy. Subsequent scales are also adjusted to have approximately the same numeric value within the limits of the scale.[27]
