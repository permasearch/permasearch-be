Three major components of the nucleolus are recognized: the fibrillar center (FC), the dense fibrillar component (DFC), and the granular component (GC).[1] Transcription of the rDNA occurs in the FC.[10] The DFC contains the protein fibrillarin,[10] which is important in rRNA processing. The GC contains the protein nucleophosmin,[10] (B23 in the external image) which is also involved in ribosome biogenesis.
