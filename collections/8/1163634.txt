For the rest of January and through February, extensive overdubs were carried out on the album's basic tracks[76] – comprising vocals, percussion, Harrison's slide guitar parts and Horn's contributions. "Living in the Material World" received significant attention during this last phase of the album production, with sitar, flute and Zakir Hussain's tabla being added to fill the song's two "spiritual sky" sections.[78][nb 9] The resulting contrast between the main, Western rock portion and the Indian-style middle eights emphasised Harrison's struggle between physical-world temptations and his spiritual goals.[116][117] The Indian instrumentation overdubbed on this track and "Be Here Now" also marked a rare return to the genre for Harrison,[118] recalling his work with the Beatles over 1966–68 and his first solo album, Wonderwall Music (1968).[119]
