At their Clydebank Scotland factory Singer built a 200Â ft clock tower which stood over the central wing and had the reputation of being the largest four-faced clock in the world. Each face weighed five tons and it took four men fifteen minutes twice a week to keep it wound.[20] Singer railway station, built to serve the factory, is still in existence to this day.
