Robinson started broadcasting almost immediately upon the development of the Trinity Broadcasting Network a show entitled, "Up On Melody Mountain." The program is a depiction of Robinson in what looks like her Tennessee mountain home in which she sings and shares inspirational moments with her audience.[6]
