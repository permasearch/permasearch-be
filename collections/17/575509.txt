British investors built a modern railway system in the late 19th centuryâ€”it became the then fourth largest in the world and was renowned for quality of construction and service.[40] The government was supportive, realising its value for military use, as well as its value for economic growth.

At first, only the unskilled workers were Indians.[41]
