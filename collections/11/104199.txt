Many prokaryotic genes are organized into operons, with multiple protein-coding sequences that are transcribed as a unit.[38][39] The genes in an operon are transcribed as a continuous messenger RNA, referred to as a polycistronic mRNA. The term cistron in this context is equivalent to gene. The transcription of an operonâ€™s mRNA is often controlled by a repressor that can occur in an active or inactive state depending on the presence of certain specific metabolites.[40] When active, the repressor binds to a DNA sequence at the beginning of the operon, called the operator region, and represses transcription of the operon; when the repressor is inactive transcription of the operon can occur (see e.g. Lac operon). The products of operon genes typically have related functions and are involved in the same regulatory network.[2]:7.3
