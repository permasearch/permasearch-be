During his career, he starred as a voice actor in several animated films. His voice role as the Genie in the animated, musical fantasy film, Aladdin (1992) was written specifically for Williams. The film's directors stated that they took a risk by writing the role, and successfully convinced him to take it.[82] Through approximately 30 hours of tape,[12] Williams was able to improvise much of his dialogue and impersonated dozens of celebrity voices, including Ed Sullivan, Jack Nicholson, Robert De Niro, Groucho Marx, Rodney Dangerfield, William F. Buckley, Peter Lorre, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Arsenio Hall.[83] At first, Williams refused to take the role since it was a Disney movie, and he did not want the studio profiting by selling toys and novelty items based on the movie. He accepted the role with certain conditions: "I'm doing it basically because I want to be part of this animation tradition. I want something for my children. One deal is, I just don't want to sell anything â€” as in Burger King, as in toys, as in stuff."[84] The film went on to become one of his most recognized and best loved roles, and was the highest-grossing film of 1992, winning numerous awards, including a Golden Globe for Williams; his performance as the Genie led the way for other animated films to incorporate actors with more star power for voice acting roles.[85]
