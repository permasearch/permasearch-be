Mr. Richard Adler is the puffy cheeked, shop-class teacher at South Park Elementary. During "Tweek vs. Craig", he is plagued by memories of his fiancée's death and chews copious amounts of nicotine gum to deal with them. When he runs out of gum, he plans to commit suicide. After writing his suicide note, he lies on a large table saw with a moving feed, but is interrupted by a fight between Tweek and Craig entering his classroom, killing Kenny in the process. Afterwards, he communicates with his fiancée's spirit through Kenny's corpse, and she helps him move on from his mourning. Now it seems he has relaxed a bit and put his past behind him, and has not featured prominently in an episode since "Tweek vs. Craig", although he has appeared in the background of many scenes and was one of the teachers supporting the move to teach sex education to the younger students in "Proper Condom Use", and also spoke his views on 9/11 in "Mystery of the Urinal Deuce". He was featured in the episode, "Bass to Mouth", and has a few lines. He also commented on the country's inevitable doom in "About Last Night". His teaching method consists primarily of telling the children to "quit screwing around", and "don't screw around, you screw around too much!" The episode "Mysterion Rises" reveals Adler to be a member of the Cult of Cthulhu. Adler always has a visible bandage covering a scar on his forehead after his suicide attempt. Mr. Adler's character was based on an old shop teacher who taught co-creator Matt Stone. His name was referenced in DVD commentary, but was censored because the real teacher did not give South Park permission to reveal his name.
