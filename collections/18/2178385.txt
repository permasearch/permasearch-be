Take the case of an inverting operational amplifier configuration. If the resistor between the single output node and the inverting input node is      R  2     {\displaystyle R_{2}}   and the resistor between a source voltage and the inverting input node is      R  1     {\displaystyle R_{1}}  , then the ideal gain for such a circuit at the output terminal is defined, ideally, to be:
