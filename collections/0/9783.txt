While the third season of Stranger Things has been greenlit, no official release date has been given, though it is expected in either late 2018 or early 2019. Levy said that they are looking at a shorter season of eight or nine episodes, depending on how they develop the story and are not bound by a specific number. They expect the third season to be less about Will; Levy said, "We're not going to put Will through hell for a third season in a row. He'll be dealing with stuff, but he won't be at rock bottom... We're [going to be] dealing with forces of evil that are new."[29]
