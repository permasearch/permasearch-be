In Finland, there's no "graduate" or "undergraduate" system; university students may be employed as a research assistant (tutkimusapulainen) before they graduate with a master's degree. A doctoral student must already hold a master's degree, and are typically employed by the university, or enjoy a similar grant, and will be called tohtorikoulutettava, tutkija (researcher) or assistentti (teaching assistant). Besides post-doctoral researchers (tutkijatohtori) and senior teaching assistants (yliassistentti), there are several mid-level non-professorial positions such as teaching researcher (opettava tutkija). Senior teachers and researchers may be employed as e.g. erikoistutkija ("special researcher") or yliopistotutkija (university researcher). Docent (dosentti) is a non-professiorial rank and title (for life) awarded to academics qualified as a principal investigator and for supervision of doctoral students; however, they do not belong to the professor corps and may be employed elsewhere. Professors (professori) are understood as research group leaders and managers, and traditionally there's no direct equivalent of an assistant / associate / full professor career path, although Aalto University is introducing these. Qualifications for a chair are earned as a docent or in other mid-career positions. In management, professors serve as department heads (laitosjohtaja or osastonjohtaja) and deans (head of faculty, dekaani). The leader of a university is called a rector (rehtori), assisted by multiple vice-rectors (vararehtori). Vice-rectors may retain the chair or work full-time as a vice-rector. Some universities have an even more senior officer called Chancellor (kansleri), which works more with outreach and public relations than daily management.
