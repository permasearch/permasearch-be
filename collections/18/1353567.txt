The 2006 Accord Hybrid got the same revisions as the other Accords, although its engine and battery power was identically powerful to the 2005, the 2006 rating system re-rated it at 253 bhp (189 kW), and a larger battery pack was added. Features that differentiate the Hybrid from other Accords are the different rear light clusters, the antenna, the wheels, the mirror turn signals and the lack of a folding rear seat. The 2005 Hybrids also had a different storage door from other Accords, which disappeared on the 2006 version. Lastly, a sunroof was not available on the 2005 but was standard on the 2006.
