In the early 1940s, cyanotype blueprint began to be supplanted by diazo prints, also known as whiteprints, which have blue lines on a white background; thus these drawings are also called blue-lines or bluelines.[10] Other comparable dye-based prints were known as blacklines. Diazo prints remained in use until they were replaced by xerographic print processes.
