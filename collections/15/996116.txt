Aspirin is used in the treatment of a number of conditions, including fever, pain, rheumatic fever, and inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, pericarditis, and Kawasaki disease.[13] Lower doses of aspirin have also been shown to reduce the risk of death from a heart attack, or the risk of stroke in some circumstances.[14][15][16] There is some evidence that aspirin is effective at preventing colorectal cancer, though the mechanisms of this effect are unclear.[17] In the United States low dose aspirin is deemed reasonable in those between 50 and 70 years old who have a more than 10% risk of cardiovascular disease and are not at an increased risk of bleeding who are otherwise healthy.[18]
