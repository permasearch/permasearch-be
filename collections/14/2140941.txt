Boom Boom (ブンブン, Bunbun) is the henchman and faithful servant of Bowser. He first appeared in Super Mario Bros. 3 as one of the main antagonists of the game, where he often fights with Mario or Luigi by chasing him flailing his arms, jumping high and flying at them. Boom Boom returns in Super Mario 3D Land 23 years later, where it introduces his new partner, Pom Pom. He resides in various airships where he encounters Mario. In New Super Mario Bros. U, he reprises his old role from Super Mario Bros. 3, guarding the fortresses and towers. After beating him in the first world, Boom Boom has Kamek supporting him by lending him some of his powers. He also returned in Super Mario Run.
