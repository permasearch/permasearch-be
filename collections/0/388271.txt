Those who submit panels do not have to know the person, but they do have to feel some sort of connection with the individual that they want people to recognize. For example, to memorialize Queen lead-singer Freddie Mercury, there were many panels made, two of which were a solid white background with a blue and black guitar, and "Freddy Mercury" written down the sides in black, with the AIDS ribbon above his name,[11] and a purple silk with "Freddie Mercury," "Queen," and "1946â€“1991" in silver applique, along with two pictures of Mercury with Queen.[12]
