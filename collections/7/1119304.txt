Despite the rage of his troops, however, thousands of Poles were taken alive and most of those captured in Praga were soon released by Suvorov: 10,000 out of 12,860.[30][31] Similar figures appear in the writings of Major General Lev Engelgardt, who served under Suvorov: 14,680 captured, of whom 8,000 were released the next day.[32] The practice of releasing thousands of Polish prisoners of war by Suvorov shortly after the battle is confirmed by a letter of State Secretary Dmitry Troschinsky to Count Alexander Vorontsov on 24 November 1794, "Count Suvorov has rendered great services by taking Warsaw, but is unbearably annoying with his inconsistent orders there. All Poles in general, not excluding the main rioters, are being released by him to their homes".[33][34] The fact that thousands of Poles were taken alive and released soon afterwards on the orders of Suvorov is also evident in other documents, such as the report sent by Suvorov to Count Pyotr Rumyantsev on 7 November, regarding the fate of some of the captives, "Polish Praga prisoners with 3 generals, staff and ober-officers, up to 500, and lower ranks, up to 4,000, as well as the artillery that got in our hands, 101 guns, today will be sent to Varkovic at Kiev. Out of the captured insurgents and defending townspeople, more than 6,000 have been released".[35] 500 captured Polish staff and ober-officers were released by Suvorov en route to Kiev, as is confirmed by the autobiography of Major General Sergey I. Mosolov, who escorted them in 1794.[36]
