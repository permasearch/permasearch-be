If several twin crystal parts are aligned by the same twin law they are referred to as multiple or repeated twins. If these multiple twins are aligned in parallel they are called polysynthetic twins. When the multiple twins are not parallel they are cyclic twins. Albite, calcite, and pyrite often show polysynthetic twinning. Closely spaced polysynthetic twinning is often observed as striations or fine parallel lines on the crystal face. Rutile, aragonite, cerussite, and chrysoberyl often exhibit cyclic twinning, typically in a radiating pattern. But in general based on relationship between twin axis and twin plane there are 3 types of twinning exists, such as; 1-parallel twinning:-when twin axis and compositional plane lies parallel to each other. 2-normal twin:-when the twin plane and compositional plane lies noramally. 3-complex twin:-combination of parallel twinning and normal twinning on one compositional plane.
