The Detour was a choice between Baskets or Trunks. In Baskets, the teams had to load 10 live chickens into baskets on a bicycle-powered wagon. They then navigated to a farm marked on a map to exchange the chickens for their next clue. In Trunks, the teams had to load 2 bales of coir onto an elephant. They then delivered it to the coir shop, trading their cargo for the next clue.
