Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives (also known on screen as Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI) is a 1986 American slasher film and the sixth installment in the Friday the 13th film series. It was written and directed by Tom McLoughlin. Although the original concept called for Tommy Jarvis, the protagonist of Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter and Friday the 13th: A New Beginning, to become the new villain, the poor fan reception of A New Beginning prompted the producers to bring back Jason Voorhees as the series' antagonist.[3][4] In resurrecting Jason, McLoughlin made Jason an explicitly supernatural force for the first time in the series, depicting him as being raised from the dead via electricity; this version of Jason, an undead mass murderer and more powerful superhuman, would become the standard depiction for the rest of the films, until 2009's remake. The film likewise broke with many other series conventions, introducing metahumor and action film elements including shootouts and car chases.[5]
