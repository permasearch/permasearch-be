Shortly after BRAC was complete, the United States government announced plans to build a missile defense installation at Ft. Greely.  The installation was then divided into two parts operated by two different commands â€” U.S. Army Garrison Alaska and Space and Missile Defense Command. The main post retained the name Fort Greely and is operated by the Space and Missile Defense Command. Outlying range, training and impact areas were absorbed by Fort Wainwright and were renamed Donnelly Training Area.
