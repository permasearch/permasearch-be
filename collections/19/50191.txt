A third approach to limiting slippage is taken by a Torsen differential. A Torsen differential allows the output shafts to receive different amounts of torque. This design does not provide for traction when one wheel is spinning freely, where there is no torque, but provides excellent handling in less extreme situations.[citation needed] A typical Torsen II differential can deliver up to twice as much torque to the high traction side before traction is exceeded at the lower traction side.
