Hungary is the world's second-largest foie gras (libamáj) producer and the largest exporter. France is the principal market for Hungarian foie gras – mainly exported raw. Approximately 30,000 Hungarian goose farmers are dependent on the foie gras industry.[36] French food companies spice, process, and cook the foie gras so it may be sold as a French product in its domestic and export markets.[37]
