Canadian Tire Money is given out for purchases paid for by cash or debit, based on the pre-tax total, excluding labour and shop supplies costs. The initial coupon rate earned was 5% of the eligible purchase price, but it was lowered to 3%, then to 1.4%, and now is 0.4%.[3] Customers can use Canadian Tire Money to buy anything in the store. (Older coupons state that they are redeemable at Canadian Tire stores and gas stations; however, coupons produced during at least the last 15 years lack this wording and are therefore redeemable in the stores only.)
