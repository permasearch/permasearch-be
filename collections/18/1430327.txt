Many Jews fell victim to the Great Purge, and there is evidence that Jews were specifically targeted by Stalin[citation needed], who harbored antisemitic sentiments all his life. A number of the most prominent victims of the Purges—Trotsky, Zinoviev, and Kamenev, to name a few—were Jewish, and in 1939 Stalin gave Molotov an explicit order to purge the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Jews, in anticipation of rapprochement with Nazi Germany.[citation needed]
