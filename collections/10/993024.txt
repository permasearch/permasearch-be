But as Dan and Amy race around the world, they discover something horrifying. The Outcastâ€™s disasters are only a smokescreen to cover up his true plan, a diabolical revenge on the family that betrayed him. Soon Amy and Dan will have to confront a hard truth: Sometimes the only way to save the world is to sacrifice everything you love. The book begins with the gang in Ian's apartment in London.
