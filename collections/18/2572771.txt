One of these rights is legal professional privilege. It is a privilege that attaches to the client (not to the lawyer) in a clientâ€“lawyer relationship. It may only, therefore, be waived by the client. In the law of England and Wales, legal professional privilege is divided into two types: advice privilege, and litigation privilege, the former category being more absolutely and broadly-defined than the latter.
