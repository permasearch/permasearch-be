Brian offers to go to college to learn something of value in farming to help out and heads out. During a tornado, the Griffins take shelter in a storm cellar and discover a methamphetamine lab. Lois wants to call the police, but Peter decides to use it to get back on their feet. Despite her reservations, she agrees to make meth just long enough to get profitable. Peter becomes paranoid as he develops a carrier pigeon delivery system as Stewie buys decongestants. Brian returns to find that the farm and the family have gone to hell and are only wearing their underclothes (except for Meg who is unconscious for some reason). A news report reveals that the family is responsible for a flood of drugs into Quahog, Tricia Takanawa and almost everyone else hooked on meth, worsening the crime problem. Lois, distraught by how their business is destroying Quahog and changing the Griffins for the worst, packs up and convinces everyone to go back home. Peter at first is reluctant to leave, but changes his mind when he suddenly remembers the lab going haywire at the moment, thus blowing up the farm immediately. Eventually, they're back at their original house, having managed to buy it back after property values plummeted during the crime wave. When Jodie Sweetin comes looking for a taste of their drugs, Peter has the family hide out while he takes care of the situation.
