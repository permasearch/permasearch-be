The valuable furs with which survivors of Bering's expedition returned sparked greater interest in the fur trade. Russian Promyshlenniki, or fur traders, began to set off to Alaska in droves with hopes of striking it rich. The drive to obtain furs led the promyshlenniki to exploit the native Aleuts through fear, threats, and forced commerce.[6] Through this economic abuse of the native peoples, the traders caused much environmental harm - many animals were hunted to near-extinction.[7] The subjugated tribes rebelled against their imperial overlords in 1764, but their valiant resistance was met by fierce retribution and defeat at Russian hands in 1766.[8] Prior to the onset of the American Revolutionary War, the Russian expansion into North America boosted the empire's economy and prestige, but caused much detriment to the local wildlife of Alaska, and brought about the desolation of the Aleut through disease, warfare, and exploitation.[9]
