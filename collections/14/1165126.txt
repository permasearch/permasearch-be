Located high in the Andes, La Rinconada has an alpine/tundra climate (ET, according to the Köppen climate classification), with no month having average temperatures even close to the 10°C threshold that would permit tree growth and a subtropical highland classification for the city. Far above the tree line, La Rinconada is unique in its high elevation and population, with the highest city of comparable population (Cerro de Pasco) being located over 700m closer to sea level.
