The 2013–14 season was Chelsea Football Club's 100th competitive season, 25th consecutive season in the top flight of English football, 22nd consecutive season in the Premier League and 108th year in existence as a football club. Chelsea participated in the UEFA Champions League this season, qualified directly for the group stage by virtue of finishing third in the 2012–13 Premier League, and reached the Semi-finals stage, being knocked out by Atlético Madrid. Chelsea came third in the Premier League for a second successive season, thus again qualified for the UEFA Champions League group stage. Chelsea ended their 2013–14 campaign without a trophy, a first since the 2010–11 season. Their league performance, however, at 82 points, was the best one since the 2009–10 season.
