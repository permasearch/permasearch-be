A common strategy is to use the principles of photometry or, more broadly, colorimetry to calculate the grayscale values (in the target grayscale colorspace) so as to have the same luminance (technically relative luminance) as the original color image (according to its colorspace).[2][3] In addition to the same (relative) luminance, this method also ensures that both images will have the same absolute luminance when displayed, as can be measured by instruments in its SI units of candelas per square meter, in any given area of the image, given equal whitepoints. Luminance itself is defined using a standard model of human vision, so preserving the luminance in the grayscale image also perserves other perceptual lightness measures, such as L* (as in the 1976 CIE Lab color space) which is determined by the linear luminance Y itself (as in the CIE 1931 XYZ color space) which we will refer to here as Ylinear to avoid any ambiguity.
