Beginning in 2013, the rules will revert to a system more similar to the pre-2005 rules. In the NASCAR Cup Series, the first 36 places in the field will be determined strictly by qualifying speed. The next six places will be awarded on owner points, with the final place reserved for a past Series Champion. If the final exemption is not used because all past Champions are already in the field, it will pass to another car based on the number of owner points.[27]
