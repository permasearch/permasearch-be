Panini Comics bought Marvel UK and in 2006 renewed and broadened their license with Marvel[5] which allows them to produce original comic stories for the British and European markets. This has included Captain Britain's first original appearance in UK comics in thirteen years, with a story that ran in Spectacular Spider-Man Adventures[6][7] and Panini plan to have more in their new all-ages title Marvel Heroes.[8]
