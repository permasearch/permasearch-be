The first notable cover recording was released as a single by English urban dance act Rage (known as En-Rage in some European countries) in 1992. This version did not meet with the same critical acclaim as Adams' version, but, after having failed to chart when released the first time in May 1992, the single gained an unexpected boost in popularity due to controversy in the UK music media about the band's name: they shared their name with a German heavy metal band who had been recording under the same since 1984. After changing their name to En-Rage in some European countries to avoid legal action from the German band, they re-released the single six months later, and this time it peaked at number 3 in the UK (eight places higher than the Bryan Adams version) in November 1992.[19]
