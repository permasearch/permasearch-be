Sang Nila Utama is a Srivijaya prince from Palembang said to have founded the Kingdom of Singapura in 1299.[1][2] His official title adopted upon his coronation, was Sri Maharaja Sang Utama Parameswara Batara Sri Tri Buana, which can be translated as "Central Lord King of the Three Worlds". The "Three Worlds" may refer to the three realms of the universe â€“ the heaven of the gods, the world of humans, and the underworld of demons.  A few early kings in South East Asia had used the title Sri Tri Buana or "Lord of the Three Worlds".[3] He died in 1347; his son, Paduka Seri Wikrama Wira succeeded him.[4]  The account of his life is given in the Malay Annals.  However, the historicity of the events as given in the Malay Annals is debated by scholars,[5] and some believe that Sang Nila Utama may be a mythical person.[6]
