Later on, in the middle of the night, Ruby steals Terry's car key, wakes Rhett up, and drives off in his Jaguar, attempting to escape. She is unfortunately stopped by the police who demands to see her driver's license. The kids are recaptured in the car on the road by Terry and Erin who talk the police into letting them go. Back at home, while Ruby attempts to run away again, Terry slaps Ruby, knocking her down, and Erin drugs her. Terry then tells Erin they must get rid of Ruby. Overcome by guilt and having lost her medical license due to her drug abuse, Erin commits suicide. Terry locks the kids in the basement and sabotages his car, expecting the kids to make another escape attempt and consequently die in it. However, the loan sharks, alerted by Ruby, appear at Terry's house, kill Mr. Begleiter (who has come to confront Terry and revealed his complicity, though without being aware of the Glasses'corrupted intention), repossess Terry's Jaguar, and insist on taking a ride. Terry begs them to reconsider, or to at least take another car, the Volvo instead of the Jaguar which he has earlier cut the brake line. Having heard everything, Ruby rushes to stab the tires of the Volvo with a knife, causing the loan sharks to put Terry in the Jaguar and drive away in it. The car then goes over a ledge and crashes, killing the loan sharks, but Terry survives.
