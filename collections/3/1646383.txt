According to the Guinness Book of Records, the current record holder for fastest pitch is Nolan Ryan, with a pitch clocked at 100.9 mph (162.4 km/h) in 1974, though the record has not been updated in many years and several pitchers have recorded faster pitches since then. That seems to be because Ryan's speed was recorded 10' from the plate, unlike 10' from release as today, costing him up to 10 MPH. http://www.efastball.com/baseball/stats/fastest-pitch-speed-in-major-leagues/ Earl Weaver, who had years of exposure to both pitchers, said, "[Dalkowski] threw a lot faster than Ryan."[23] The hardest thrower in baseball currently is recognized as Aroldis Chapman, who has been clocked with the fastest pitch on record at 105.1 mph (169 km/h).
