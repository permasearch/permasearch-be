Body piercing in some religions is held to be destructive to the body. Some passages of the Bible, including Leviticus 19:28,[79] have been interpreted as prohibiting body modification because the body is held to be the property of God.[18] The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has taken an official position against most piercings unless for medical reasons, although they accept piercings for women as long as there is only one set of piercings in the lower lobe of the ears and no other place on the body.[80] Wearing of very large nose rings on Shabbat is forbidden by the Talmud.[23]
