On Iwo Jima McCarthy was the Company Commander of G Co 2nd Battalion 24th Marines. He landed on yellow beach 2 alongside the 23rd Marines. On D plus 3 the 24th RCT relieved the 25th. His Battalion moved and was supported by the blue beaches. On February 21, 1945, as a Captain, he earned the Medal of Honor while leading an assault team across exposed ground to wipe out positions holding up the advance of his company at airfield No. 2. "I was scared all the time," McCarthy said later. "Any man tells you he wasn't scared was an imbecile. But you dealt with it."[4]It is believed that a Seabee heavy weapons platoon provided the fire support he needed that day. (Fig. 1)
