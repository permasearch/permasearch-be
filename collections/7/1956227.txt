Most Bangladeshis earn their living from agriculture.[42] Although rice and jute are the primary crops, maize and vegetables are assuming greater importance.[42] Due to the expansion of irrigation networks, some wheat producers have switched to cultivation of maize which is used mostly as poultry feed.[42] Tea is grown in the northeast.[42] Because of Bangladesh's fertile soil and normally ample water supply, rice can be grown and harvested three times a year in many areas.[42] Due to a number of factors, Bangladesh's labour-intensive agriculture has achieved steady increases in food grain production despite the often unfavourable weather conditions.[42] These include better flood control and irrigation, a generally more efficient use of fertilisers, and the establishment of better distribution and rural credit networks.[42] With 28.8 million metric tons produced in 2005–2006 (July–June), rice is Bangladesh's principal crop.[42] By comparison, wheat output in 2005–2006 was 9 million metric tons.[42] Population pressure continues to place a severe burden on productive capacity, creating a food deficit, especially of wheat.[42] Foreign assistance and commercial imports fill the gap,[42] but seasonal hunger ("monga") remains a problem.[45] Underemployment remains a serious problem, and a growing concern for Bangladesh's agricultural sector will be its ability to absorb additional manpower.[42] Finding alternative sources of employment will continue to be a daunting problem for future governments, particularly with the increasing numbers of landless peasants who already account for about half the rural labour force.[42] Due to farmers' vulnerability to various risks, Bangladesh's poorest face numerous potential limitations on their ability to enhance agriculture production and their livelihoods. These include an actual and perceived risk to investing in new agricultural technologies and activities (despite their potential to increase income), a vulnerability to shocks and stresses and a limited ability to mitigate or cope with these and limited access to market information.[45]
