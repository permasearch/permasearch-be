In 1951, Stan Kenton disbanded his Innovations Orchestra in Los Angeles.[7] Many of the musicians, some of whom had also played in Woody Herman's band, chose to remain in California.[7] Trumpeter Shorty Rogers and drummer Shelly Manne were central figures among this group of musicians. Much of this activity centered on the Hermosa Beach Lighthouse Caf√©, where bassist Howard Rumsey led a house band, the Lighthouse All-Stars.[7]
