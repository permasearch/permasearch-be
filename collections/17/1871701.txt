Interference can hamper memorization and retrieval. There is retroactive interference, when learning new information makes it harder to recall old information[56] and proactive interference, where prior learning disrupts recall of new information.

Knowing Latin, for instance, can help an individual learn a related language such as French â€“ this phenomenon is known as positive transfer.[57]
