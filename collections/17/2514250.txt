"So mote it be" is a ritual phrase used by Freemasons, in Rosicrucianism, and more recently by Neopagans. It was also used by the old church, and ancient pagans,[citation needed] but is now adapted by Wiccans. It means "so may it be", "so it is required", or "so must it be", and may be said at the end of a prayer in a similar way to "amen". The phrase appears in the Halliwell or Regius Manuscript, the earliest known document relating to a society of Masons in England dating from the first half of the 15th Century.[1] " Amen! amen! so mot hyt be! Say we so all per charytÃ©".[2]
