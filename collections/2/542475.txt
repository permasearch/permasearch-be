Reward/punishment: Michelle went on a tour to see all the breath-taking views of Los Angeles from her very own helicopter; after that, she ate at 71 Above and took Nick with her. The remaining chefs had to participate in deep cleaning day. During punishment, Robyn got annoyed when Milly was seen not helping much and eating the leftover food from the challenge.
