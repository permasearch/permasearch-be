At Lakes Bennett and Lindeman, the prospectors camped to build rafts or boats that would take them the final 500 miles (800Â km) down the Yukon to Dawson City in the spring.[98][n 22] 7,124 boats of varying size and quality left in May 1898; by that time, the forests around the lakes had been largely cut down for timber.[100][101] The river posed a new problem. Above Whitehorse, it was dangerous, with several rapids along the Miles Canyon through to the White Horse Rapids.[102]
