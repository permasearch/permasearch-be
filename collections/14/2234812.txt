The scene of Kane inspecting the egg was shot in post-production. A fiberglass egg was used so that actor John Hurt could shine his light on it and see movement inside, which was provided by Ridley Scott fluttering his hands inside the egg while wearing rubber gloves.[66] The top of the egg was hydraulic, and the innards were a cow's stomach and tripe.[26][66] Test shots of the eggs were filmed using hen's eggs, and this footage was used in early teaser trailers. For this reason the image of a hen's egg was used on the poster, and has become emblematic of the franchise as a wholeâ€”as opposed to the Alien egg that appears in the finished film.[66]
