The Woodlands Township is a Special-purpose district created by the 73rd Texas Legislature in 1993,[40] and is run by a seven-member board of directors who are elected directly by the residents of the township in an at large election, for two year staggered terms.[41] Even though The Woodlands is not a city nor a traditional township government, it still provides limited municipal government services such as trash pickup, parks and recreation, covenant enforcement, fire and rescue services, streetscaping, economic development, and enhanced law enforcement and security patrols.[42] The township's offices are located at 2801 Technology Forest Boulevard, The Woodlands, TX 77381.[42]
