In 1904, Ida Blair settled with her children at Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire. Eric was brought up in the company of his mother and sisters, and apart from a brief visit in mid-1907,[14] they did not see the husband and father Richard Blair until 1912.[9] His mother's diary from 1905 describes a lively round of social activity and artistic interests.
