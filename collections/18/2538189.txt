Hōkūleʻa sailed from Hawaiʻi to Rapa Nui (Easter Island) and back, via the Marquesas Islands of French Polynesia.[81] While in the Marquesas, short trips were made between principal islands of the group (map).[82] A brief stop was made at Pitcairn Island on the Mangareva – Rapa Nui leg. A technically challenging voyage due to Rapa Nui's isolation and location over 1,000 miles upwind;[83] it is known as "Closing the Triangle" because it took the canoe to the southeastern Pacific for the first time.[84] Kama Hele escorted the voyage.[85]
