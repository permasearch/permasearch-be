Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone calling the song "a big, goofy, stomp-along pop-metal anthem".[13] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard described the song as "a natural evolution of the Fall Out Boy sound," adding also that the song is "muscular in scope and jittery in practice, with rolling chants cresting above Stump's nervous energy."[14]
