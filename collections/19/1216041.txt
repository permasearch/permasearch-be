where e is the charge,     Ï„   {\displaystyle \tau }   is the mean free time, m is the mass, d is the mean free path, and vF is the Fermi velocity of the charge carrier. The Fermi velocity can easily be derived from the Fermi energy via the non-relativistic kinetic energy equation. In thin films, however, the film thickness can be smaller than the predicted mean free path, making surface scattering much more noticeable, effectively increasing the resistivity.
