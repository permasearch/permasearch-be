Since then, curriculum studies researchers ranging across the spectrum of paradigms—from conservative structural-functionalists, to neo-Marxists to narrative- and arts-based researchers—have examined formal curricula, experienced curricula, and hidden curricula.  Progressive researchers like Paul Willis (1977, Learning to Labor: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs), Jean Anyon  (1980, "Social Class and the Hidden Curriculum of Work". Journal of Education 162), and Annette Lareau (1989. Home Advantage: Social Class, and Parental Intervention in Elementary Education) have examined the ways that hidden and overt curricula reproduce social class position.  Narrative and arts-based researchers like Thomas Barone (2001, Touching Eternity: The Enduring Outcomes of Teaching) have inquired about the long-term effects of curricula on student lives.
