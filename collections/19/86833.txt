Philippians has been the subject of much research and Ralph P. Martin argues that Philippians 2 may be considered the beginning of the field of Christology, specifically referring to the rich analysis that Apostle Paul began in Philippians 2:5â€“6.[10] Veronica Koperski views Philippians 3:10 as the beginning of the analysis of the knowledge of Christ.[11]
