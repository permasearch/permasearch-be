Norrington pursues Sparrow and Turner with three objectives: reclaim the Interceptor, capture Jack Sparrow, and rescue Elizabeth. Barbossa sinks the Interceptor and maroons Sparrow and Elizabeth. Norrington spots Elizabeth's distress signal and rescues them. Norrington arrests Jack and ignores Elizabeth's plea to rescue Will from Barbossa, believing he has turned pirate. He only relents after Elizabeth accepts his previous marriage proposal. He asks for Jack's assistance to locate Isla de Muerta.
