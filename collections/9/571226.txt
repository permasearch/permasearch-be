Little is known about the Etruscans, but a few artifacts have been found showing a thin bundle of rods surrounding a two-headed axe.[3] Fasces symbolism might be derived via the Etruscans from the eastern Mediterranean, with the labrys, the Anatolian, and Minoan double-headed axe, later incorporated into the praetorial fasces. There is little archaeological evidence.[4]
