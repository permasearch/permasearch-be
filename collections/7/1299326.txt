While Norman was denounced by television evangelists like Bob Larson;[16] Jimmy Swaggart,[17][18][19] who called rock music "the new pornography";[20] and Jerry Falwell;[21] and others within the conservative religious establishment, who considered the development of Christian rock-and-roll, "a sinful compromise with worldliness and immoral sensuality",[15][22] his music gained a large following in the emerging counter cultural movements.[23] However, not all critics were impressed with this album. For example, a writer in Entertainment World called Norman "a hermaphrodite" and wrote "Faith can move mountains, so it may move this incredible hunk of hubris".[24] while another, who described Upon This Rock as "a musical misery tour", and wrote: "God didn't give Larry Norman a voice â€” a recording contract, but not a voice".[25] Another reviewer wrote: "In "Ha Ha World," Neil Young's "Mr. Soul" is thinly and lethargically evoked. Ditto a Jim Morrison effect on "The Last Supper." And shades of Art Garfunkel on the ballad "I Wish We'd All Been Ready".[26]
