In 1909, after the formation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, McKenzie sensed the time was ripe for a national organization of "educated and progressive Indians” and corresponded with Coolidge and Eastman calling for an Indian-led national conference on Indian affairs.[10] McKenzie asserted that “the time has come when a ‘Mohonk by Indians’ can do even more for the country than a ‘Mohonk for Indians.’” [11] In a letter to inviting participants to a proposed 1909 Indian conference, McKenzie envisioned a new dawn at Columbus, writing, “even as the navigator Columbus discovered the old Indian in 1492, may we not hope that the city of Columbus shall discover the “new Indian.” McKenzie called upon American Indians to form the first national pan-tribal organization run by and for Indians, and not a “friends of Indians” organization such as the progressive Indian Rights Association. However, McKenzie's first efforts to organize an Indian conference in 1909 failed.[12]
