Samantha is the eldest of the four friends (in the final scene of the Sex and the City film, her 50th birthday is celebrated), though it is implied during the early seasons that the other three are not aware of how much older Samantha is than they are. She has her own public-relations company. In the book's prequel series, it is revealed that Carrie met Samantha first.
