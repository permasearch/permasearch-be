Folk dances specific to the West of France include the courante, or maraichine, and the bal saintongeais. Bourr√©es in triple time have been noted in the 19th century by Bujeaud, and more recently, in Angoumois. Circle- or chain-dances accompanied by caller-and-response singing have been noted in the West, and also in other regions such as Gascony, Normandy and Brittany.
