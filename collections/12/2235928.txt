After the annexation of his kingdom by British, Purandar Singha continued to live in Jorhat. In October 1838 CE, a pension of 1000 rupees per month was granted to him but he declined to accept it as he hoped for the eventual restitution of his state as a result of his petition to the Governor-General.[91] The petition of Purandar Singha was turn down by Governor-General, after consulting with the British officials serving in Assam. During that time, the British Government officials and many other adventurers dug the Royal Tombs or Maidams of Ahom kings in Charaideo, in search of treasures, as it was widely known that the material properties of the dead king, like swords, furniture, utensils, gold and silver jewellary, and other valuables were also entombed along with the dead king in the Maidam. Purandar Singha, at first protested the desecration of his ancestorsâ€™ tombs, but finding it hopeless to appeal, in a bid to preserve the treasure; he himself dug many Royal Tombs and recovered a large booty of treasures.[92] Fearing outburst and reactions from other princes of Ahom Dynasty, he spread the news that he had dug the ancestral tombs to recover their bones and other remains, to take them to Ganges, for spiritual and religious purpose.
