2008 The game on October 25, 2008, in Ann Arbor, was the first Michigan–Michigan State game for new Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez. Early in the game, Michigan scored on a pass to running back Brandon Minor, who was only able to get one foot on a pylon. The pass was initially called incomplete, but the play was reviewed and incorrectly ruled a touchdown. During halftime, ABC-TV displayed the NCAA rule on the broadcast screen and concluded that the Replay Official was incorrect in awarding the touchdown to Michigan; ABC indicated officials on the field had been correct in originally ruling the play incomplete. The Commissioner of the Big Ten later acknowledged that the call was wrong.[38] The two teams traded touchdowns for much of the game before the Spartans finally pulled away in the 4th quarter, winning 35–21.[39]
