Shortly after receiving the trophy, Adams was called over by pitchside reporter Jim Rosenthal for a conversation on the field, explaining his absence from the celebratory team photograph for the press.[35] The Arsenal captain spoke of how his teammates were "really fired up" before the game and was delighted with the effort they put in during the course of the match.[36] Graham was proud of his team's performance, and credited Adams, who "suffered an awful lot of stick which has given football very little dignity."[37] When asked about the result he said, "Nobody outside Highbury expected us to do it, but when you lose belief you might as well get out of football."[37] Dalglish paid tribute to his players and refused to blame the fixture rearrangements for losing out to Arsenal, lamenting "It just wasn't to be."[37]
