In May 2013, McCoy was sued for his alleged actions towards a woman using the alias "Mary Roe"[158] aboard a party bus on the New Jersey Turnpike. Roe testified that McCoy humiliated her and 15 other women by spraying them with a beverage before ejecting Roe from the vehicle. McCoyâ€™s attorney Andrew Smith Esq. responded, "There are no criminal charges pending and no probable cause was ever found,"  stating that the accuser was simply attempting to collect money from McCoy. Roe sued for over $50,000 in damages for assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, false imprisonment and negligence.[159]
