The city was founded as Villa Real de Chiapa in 1528 by Diego de Mazariegos in what was called the Hueyzacatlán Valley, which means “pasture” in Nahuatl. From then on, the city went through a number of name changes: to Villa Viciosa in 1529, to Villa de San Cristóbal de los Llanos in 1531, and to Ciudad Real in 1536. It was changed to Ciudad de San Cristóbal in 1829. “de las Casas” was added in 1848 in honor of Bartolomé de las Casas.  There were some modifications in the early 20th century to the name but it returned to San Cristóbal de las Casas in 1943.[1] In the Tzotzil and Tzeltal languages the name of the area is Jovel, “the place in the clouds”.[12]
