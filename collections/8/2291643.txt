The above table is only valid for SSN issued before June 2011. On June 25, 2011, the SSA changed the SSN assignment process to "SSN randomization".[2] SSN randomization affects the SSN assignment process. Among its changes, it eliminates the geographical significance of the first three digits of the SSN, previously referred to as the Area Number, by no longer allocating the Area Numbers for assignment to individuals in specific states. The table above is based on out-of-date information. Numbers in the range of 650-699 most certainly have been issued (see related comment on the Talk page).
