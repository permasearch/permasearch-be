In the mid-1980s, as stock engine sizes diminished, rodders discovered the all-aluminum 215 (Buick or Olds) could be stretched to as much as 305 cu in (5 l), using: the Buick 300 crank, new cylinder sleeves, and an assortment of non-GM parts, including VW & Mopar lifters and Carter carb.[18] It could also be fitted with high-compression cylinder heads from the Morgan +8. Using the 5-liter Rover block and crank, a maximum displacement of 317.8 cu in (5,208 cc) is theoretically possible.[19]
