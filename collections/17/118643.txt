Some human rights organisations have alleged that Indian Security forces have killed hundreds of Kashmiris through the indiscriminate use of force and torture, firing on demonstrations, custodial killings, encounters and detentions.[372][373][374][375] The government of India denied that torture was widespread[373] and stated that some custodial crimes may have taken place but that "these are few and far between".[373]  According to cables leaked by the WikiLeaks website, US diplomats in 2005 were informed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) about the use of torture and sexual humiliation against hundreds of Kashmiri detainees by the security forces.[376] The cable said Indian security forces relied on torture for confessions and that the human right abuses are believed to be condoned by the Indian government.[377] SHRC also accused Indian army of forced labour.[378]
