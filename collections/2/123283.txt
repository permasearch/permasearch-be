CDLA is a digital audio transfer standard. CDLA gives an end-to-end true lossless audio sound. In CDLA the audio is precisely correct and attenuation-free because in CDLA technology, the headset itself has an integrated audio processing chip and a decoder, and uses a Type-C port, which does not allow any sound quality loss. The loss usually occurs in bluetooth headphones and earphones, irrespective of whether you are using a phone or a laptop. In a 3.5mm jack-based system, the decoder is built into the smartphone. The sound quality depends on the quality of the DAC decoder, and the implementation of this. in addition to the quality of the amplification circuit. regardless of whether the circuit is internal (3.5mm jack) or external (CDLA). however the CDLA has the advantage of making a thinner phone possible, in addition to the possibility of implementing balanced amplification circuits.
