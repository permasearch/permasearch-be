In 1735, George Frideric Handel wrote the opera Samson,[29] with a libretto by Newburgh Hamilton, based on Samson Agonistes.[29] The opera is almost entirely set inside Samson's prison[29] and Delilah appears only briefly in Act II.[29] In 1877, Camille Saint-SaÃ«ns composed the opera Samson and Delilah with a libretto by Ferdinand Lemaire in which the entire story of Samson and Delilah is retold.[29] In the libretto, Delilah is portrayed as a seductive femme fatale,[29] but the music played during her parts invokes sympathy for her.[29]
