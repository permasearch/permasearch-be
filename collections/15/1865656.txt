Allen Johnson of the San Francisco Chronicle praised her as "the best American actress you've never heard of".[52] She next starred in the psychological thriller film Joshua (2007) with Sam Rockwell,[53] and portrayed Fiona Ankany in the drama film Quid Pro Quo,[54] which premiered at the 2008 Sundance. David Edelstein of New York magazine stated that Farmiga's performance on the latter film was "scarily good", and added: "She's always visibly calculating, thinking better of something reckless she's about to do – then doing it anyway".[55]
