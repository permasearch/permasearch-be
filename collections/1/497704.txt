In an interview, Parkinson spoke about his return and death. Parkinson stated, "Whenever I was told that I was coming back for Season 6, before they sent me through the scripts and stuff, they sent me through a ring just to say, "Listen, so that you don't get a shock whenever you read the scripts, just know that you die this season."[14] He continued, "Whenever I came back, I was excited to come back, and the scenes all seemed pretty amazing. I was so happy to re-embrace the character."[14]
