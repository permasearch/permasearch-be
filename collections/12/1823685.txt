The chest is typically well developed and reaches to (FCI-Standard NÂ° 283 / 04. 02. 2000 / GB) the elbows. A Coton de Tulear's feet are small and arched, and its back is normally strong and slightly arched. The pads of the feet are usually black. The body is of moderate length and typically has a moderate tuck-up. Traditionally, the loin is muscular and not overly long in length. The hind legs are normally strong and straight. The hind feet are similar to the front feet. Throughout history the dewclaws have been removed, however many would now oppose this arguably unnecessary and cruel procedure.[7] The tail is traditionally low-set and tapering, carried over the back when in motion or excited, but relaxed otherwise.
