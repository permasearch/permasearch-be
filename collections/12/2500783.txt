Concourse E dates back to the terminal's 1959 opening, and was originally known as Concourse 4. From the start, it was the airport's only international concourse, containing its own immigration and customs facilities. In the mid-1960s, it underwent renovations similar to the airport's other original concourses, but didn't receive its first major addition until the International Satellite Terminal was opened in 1976. Featuring Gates E20â€“E35 (commonly known as "High E"), the satellite added 12 international gates capable of handling the largest jet aircraft as well as an international intransit lounge for arriving international passengers connecting to other international flights. At the same time, Concourse E's immigration and customs facilities were radically overhauled and expanded. During the late-1980s, the original portion of Concourse E ("Low E") was rebuilt to match the satellite.
