The Nemesis System expands upon its introduction in Shadow of Mordor to apply to a larger part of the world, including other characters called Followers that have behavior guided by how the player-character has interacted with them. Players will be able to transfer their top Nemesis and their most loyal follower from Shadow of Mordor into Shadow of War.[3] It will include an in-game store from which players can purchase elements to improve their Followers, such as purchasing support of new allies or abilities, or loot chests that contain randomized items of various rarity. The in-game store can use currency earned in game, though players may also purchase such elements with microtransactions.[4] The inclusion of microtransactions in a full-price single-player game has been criticized by game journalists, although later on, it was announced that the game would have multiplayer as well.[5][6][7]
