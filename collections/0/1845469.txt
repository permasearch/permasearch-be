The Panthers picked up several talented players in the 2008 NFL Draft, including running back Jonathan Stewart, and offensive tackle Jeff Otah. With the help of a much improved rushing offense, the Panthers rebounded, finishing the season with a 12–4 record. This included an 8-0 home record. After defeating the New Orleans Saints 33–31 in the season finale, the Panthers claimed their second NFC South title and a first round bye in the playoffs. However, on January 10 the Panthers' season came to a disappointing end, as they lost to the Arizona Cardinals 33–13 at home in the Divisional round. The Panthers' offense was plagued by Delhomme's 6 turnovers (5 interceptions and a fumble) and the Cardinals 27 first-half points.
