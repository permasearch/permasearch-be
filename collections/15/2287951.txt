It is sometimes difficult to determine if a material is non-stoichiometric or if the formula is best represented by large numbers.  The oxides of tungsten illustrate this situation.  Starting from the idealized material tungsten trioxide, one can generate a series of related materials that are slightly deficient in oxygen.  These oxygen-deficient species can be described as WO3−x, but in fact they are stoichiometric species with large unit cells with the formulas WnO3n−2, where n = 20, 24, 25, 40.  Thus, the last species can be described with the stoichiometric formula W40O118, whereas the non-stoichiometric description  WO2.95 implies a more random distribution of oxide vacancies.[citation needed]
