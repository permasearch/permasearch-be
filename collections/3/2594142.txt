After the separation of Queensland from New South Wales in 1859, subsequent subdivisions were much smaller.  In the following 5 years, land parcels south of Zillmere Road/Graham Road  in what is now recognised as Aspley began.  In 1865, subdivisions west of what is now Maundrell Terrace were sold at the Brisbane Land Sales.  In 1866, subdivisions between what is now Gympie Road, Maundrell Terrace and Webster Road were auctioned.  The subdivisions were named "Soldier's Flat".  Initially, the area was known as "Little Cabbage Tree Creek District".[5]  The immigrants were primarily of English and German ancestry.
