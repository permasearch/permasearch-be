In early July 2011, founding member Fatt developed arrhythmia and underwent "urgent but routine"[60] heart surgery, when he was fitted with a pacemaker after feeling unwell for several weeks and blacking out. He missed the group's US tour as a result, after not missing a show in 20 years.[61] Also in mid-2011, The Wiggles celebrated their 20th anniversary with circus-themed shows and performances throughout Australia and the outback in a circus tent,[28] as well as a "physically grueling"[62] birthday-themed tour of 90 shows throughout Australia, which Paul Field called "one of the biggest of their careers".[62] Sydney's Powerhouse Museum commemorated the group's anniversary with an exhibit that displayed Wiggles memorabilia.[63]
