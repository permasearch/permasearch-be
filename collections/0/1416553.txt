Donny Dion is a member of the East High School boys' varsity basketball team. It is unclear whether or not he is a player or an equipment manager or towel boy. Nevertheless, he looks up to Chad Danforth and evens asks to have Chad's gym locker after he graduates. His best friend is Jimmie Zara. Donny is portrayed by Justin Martin in High School Musical 3: Senior Year. Martin almost gave up on auditioning for the roll because the casting directors told him he was too little.[31]
