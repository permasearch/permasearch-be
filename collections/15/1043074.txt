The show is hosted by Sarah Harris and features a panel of investors whom are the "sharks", who listen to entrepreneurs pitch ideas for a business or product they wish to develop. The sharks do receive money for their participation, but they invest their own money. These self-made multi-millionaires judge the business concepts and products pitched and then decide whether to invest their own money to help market and mentor each contestant.[2]
