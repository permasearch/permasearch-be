In March 1995, Jordan decided to quit baseball due to the ongoing Major League Baseball strike, as he wanted to avoid becoming a potential replacement player.[70] On March 18, 1995, Jordan announced his return to the NBA through a two-word press release: "I'm back."[4] The next day, Jordan took to the court with the Bulls to face the Indiana Pacers in Indianapolis, scoring 19 points.[71] The game had the highest Nielsen rating of a regular season NBA game since 1975.[72] Although he could have opted to wear his normal number in spite of the Bulls having retired it, Jordan instead wore number 45, as he had while playing baseball.[71]
