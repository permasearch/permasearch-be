Stern denied "The Death of Superman" was a publicity stunt, believing the sensation was caused only because it was a good story: "The word got out on a slow news day, and the media storm that followed was greater than anything we could have hoped for. But it was all thanks to the story's power."[16] Paul Levitz said DC had no reason to think the wider public would care because they had killed Superman in stories before.[21] Jurgens also stated he did not anticipate the attention.[15]
