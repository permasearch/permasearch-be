This song is written from the perspective of a son of a single mother. The single mother begins dating a new man who almost immediately includes the child in things like going to the movies. In the final verse, the son now is about ready to become a father himself, standing in the hospital next to his stepfather and hoping that he can be "at least half the dad" that his stepfather "didn't have to be." This song is set in the key of A major in cut time, and has a vocal range from A3 to D5.[4]
