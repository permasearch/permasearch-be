Riley Griffin is portrayed by Michael Taber.[2][3][4][5] In an interview, Taber brought up how the production team tricked them all at the final cold read audition, and how they had not heard from the producers in over a month when they were all finally called in, again. When asked about his favorite episode, he said it was one that had not yet aired when the interview was held at the 2015 San Diego Comic Con, but aside from that one it was when his character became a Power Ranger in the second episode.[6]
