Marcia is asked out by popular school hunk Doug Simpson (Nicholas Hammond). Marcia is so taken aback by the gesture that she instantly accepts the date without realizing that she has a date with Charley (Stuart Getz), the nice but average joe son of a wallpaper salesman, for the same night, creating a conflict. So taking Greg's advice, Marcia breaks her date with Charley, using the excuse "something suddenly came up." Later, when Peter's wildly-thrown football hits Marcia's nose, causing it to swell and bruise ("Oh, my nose!"), Doug breaks their date, using the same excuse. After Marcia's nose quickly heals, Doug asks her out again. Marcia rejects him, admits to Charley what she did, and reaccepts the date with him. When Marcia returns home, she reveals to Mike and Carol that during the date she and Charley crossed paths with Doug and, after Doug teases Charley and Marcia, they get into a fight, resulting in a swollen nose for Doug. In a subplot, Mike and Carol mull over what wallpaper pattern to decorate their bedroom with.
