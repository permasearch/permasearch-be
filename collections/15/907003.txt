The series was sponsored by Campbell Soup Company, with Johnson & Johnson as the principal alternate sponsor (succeeded in the fall of 1963 by The Singer Company).[2] Following first-run, the show entered daytime reruns on ABC and then syndication on Nick at Nite and TV Land for several years. The first five seasons have been released on DVD.
