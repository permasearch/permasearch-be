One known problem was that gauge invariant approaches, including non-abelian models such as Yangâ€“Mills theory (1954), which held great promise for unified theories, also seemed to predict known massive particles as massless.[51] Goldstone's theorem, relating to continuous symmetries within some theories, also appeared to rule out many obvious solutions,[52] since it appeared to show that zero-mass particles also would have to exist that simply were "not seen".[53] According to Guralnik, physicists had "no understanding" how these problems could be overcome.[53]
