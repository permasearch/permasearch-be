Lost source accidents,[114][115] also referred to as orphan sources, are incidents in which a radioactive source is lost, stolen or abandoned. The source then might cause harm to humans. One case occurred at Yanango where a radiography source was lost, also at Samut Prakarn a phosphorus teletherapy source was lost[116] and at Gilan in Iran a radiography source harmed a welder.[117] The best known example of this type of event is the Goi√¢nia accident in Brazil.
