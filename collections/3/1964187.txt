This was Neil Simon's first screenplay. At the time, he had three hit shows running on Broadway — Little Me, Barefoot in the Park and The Odd Couple. Simon said that he originally wanted to write a spoof of art house films such as Last Year at Marienbad and Michelangelo Antonioni's films, but the story evolved into the idea of a film-within-a-film. Aldo Vanucci brings to mind the fast-talking cons of Phil Silvers and the brilliant dialects of Sid Caesar. This is probably no coincidence, since Simon wrote for both on television.[3]
