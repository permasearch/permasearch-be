Mrs. Coulter is described as being 35 years old in the third novel, The Amber Spyglass. She is described as appearing 'beautiful and young' with 'sleek black hair' that 'framed her cheeks' and slim.[1] Such details of a character's physical appearances are uncommon in His Dark Materials. There is a reference in Lyra's Oxford to Mrs. Coulter having written an academic work called 'The Bronze Clocks of Benin'.
