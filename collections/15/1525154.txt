Counters that drop into the win zone during this round are worth £50 apiece, and the mystery and double counters are still in effect. Ambient drops are not voided in this round, but are added to the contestant's winnings. If the jackpot counter enters the win zone, the contestant's cash total is augmented to £10,000; this prize is not affected by any double counters that drop on the same turn.
