Christy is celebrating both five years sober and her college graduation. The ladies get her diamond earrings as a graduation gift. The next night, Chef Rudy talks Christy into a poker game where she proceeds to lose her tip money and the earrings. Bonnie blows up at Christy during her graduation party when she finds out. Christy grudgingly has to admit she needs help for her gambling addiction. After the ladies' next AA meeting, she walks down the hall to a Gamblers Anonymous meeting. Upon returning home, Christy opens a letter and learns she got into law school.
