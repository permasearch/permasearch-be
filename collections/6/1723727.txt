According to Roman and Greek sources, Phoenicians and Carthaginians sacrificed infants to their gods. The bones of numerous infants have been found in Carthaginian archaeological sites in modern times but the subject of child sacrifice is controversial.[20] In a single child cemetery called the Tophet by archaeologists, an estimated 20,000 urns were deposited.[21]
