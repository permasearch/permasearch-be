The Armenian name for moonshine is oghee. The production of oghee is widespread in Armenia. White mulberry, grape, cornelian cherry, plum, and apricot moonshine are especially popular, particularly in the countryside. The Arabic word Araq (Arak) is derived from the Sanskrit word Ark (or Urk, where the sound of U is as in BUT), which means distillate.
