The legality of downloading Harmy's Despecialized Edition is contentious.[1] As a fan edit, the cut cannot be legally bought or sold, and treads a line between fair use and copyright infringement.[15] OriginalTrilogy.com states that the edits are "made for culturally historical and educational purposes" and that they are "to be shared among legal owners of the officially available releases only".[6] Consequently, the films are only available via various BitTorrent trackers and through specialized rapid download programs using file sharing sites.[3][16] Harmáček himself remarked: "I'm convinced that 99% of people who download this already bought Star Wars 10 times over on DVD."[10] As of November 2015[update], he has received no legal issues from Lucasfilm over the Despecialized Edition.[8]
