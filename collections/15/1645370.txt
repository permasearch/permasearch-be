In a review of the 2009 film, The Independent Critic wrote "The music in Tancharoen's "Fame" certainly has its moment, most notably Naughton's outstanding version of the original film's "Out Here on My Own," the only left over with the exception of a closing credit Naughton version of "Fame".[9] FilmSchoolRejects wrote "only one scene transcends the façade and evokes genuine feeling: Naughton’s terrific rendition of “Out Here on My Own,” which gets closer to evoking the emotions swelling in an artist struggling to find her place in the world than a thousand heavily choreographed hip-hop dance numbers ever could".[10] The AV Club deemed it a "heartbreaking cover"[11] while FilmScoreClickTrack described the song as a "gorgeous ballad".[12]
