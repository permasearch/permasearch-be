At the time of the cup's first season Queen's Park were by far the dominant force in Scottish football, and no other team had even managed to score a goal against them until 1875, eight years after their formation.[2] This early dominance meant they were invited into the first FA Cup season and in season 1883–84 they came close to a cup double, winning the Scottish Cup but losing the FA Cup Final to Blackburn Rovers.[3] They again met Blackburn Rovers in the following season's Final but were defeated once again.[4] Other Scottish teams competed in the FA Cup such as Partick Thistle and 3rd Lanark RV and continued to compete until 1887, when the Scottish Football Association banned its members from taking any further part in the "English Cup".[5] By the time the Scottish Football League was founded in the 1890–91 season Queen's Park had been eclipsed by many of the league clubs, they finally agreed to enter the competition in the 1900–01 season, they finished seventh in their first season.[6] Their demise was reflected in their Scottish Cup results, although they reached 4 Finals after the foundation of the league they could only win one and their 1893 success was their last, reaching only one more final in 1900. Dumbarton filled the void left by Queen's Park for a time but like all Scottish football competitions the Scottish Cup would come to be dominated by the Old Firm of Celtic and Rangers.
