Cerebral palsy is due to abnormal development or damage occurring to the developing brain.[41] This damage can occur during pregnancy, delivery, the first month of life, or less commonly in early childhood.[41] Structural problems in the brain are seen in 80% of cases, most commonly within the white matter.[41] More than three-quarters of cases are believed to result from issues that occur during pregnancy.[41] Most children who are born with cerebral palsy have more than one risk factor associated with CP.[42]
