Robinson was the only Wolverine from the 2012â€“2013 team who was invited to participate in the NFL combine. He was not invited as a quarterback, but rather as a wide receiver,[173] but he did intend to throw and return kickoffs and punts on his Pro Day.[174] On the Pro Day, he did not do quarterback drills, but he did return punts, made catches while running routes, and also did running back drills. Scouts concluded he should become a running back first before developing into a wideout.[175]
