Spiegelman rendered the original three-page "Maus" and "Prisoner on the Hell Planet" in highly detailed, expressive styles. Spiegelman planned to draw Maus in such a manner, but after initial sketches he decided to use a pared-down style, one little removed from his pencil sketches, which he found more direct and immediate. Characters are rendered in a minimalist way: animal heads with dots for eyes and slashes for eyebrows and mouths, sitting on humanoid bodies.[37] Spiegelman wanted to get away from the rendering of the characters in the original "Maus", in which oversized cats towered over the Jewish mice, an approach which Spiegelman says, "tells you how to feel, tells you how to think".[131] He preferred to let the reader make independent moral judgments.[132] He drew the cat-Nazis the same size as the mouse-Jews, and dropped the stereotypical villainous expressions.[89] The contrast between the artwork in "Prisoner on the Hell Planet" and Maus drives home the effectiveness of the simpler artworkâ€”"Prisoner" is alienating, while Maus is more inviting, encouraging deeper contemplation and understanding.[40]
