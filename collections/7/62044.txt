The Supreme Court has been criticized for not keeping within Constitutional bounds by engaging in judicial activism, rather than merely interpreting law and exercising judicial restraint. Claims of judicial activism are not confined to any particular ideology.[187] An often cited example of conservative judicial activism is the 1905 decision in Lochner v. New York, which has been criticized by many prominent thinkers, including Robert Bork, Justice Antonin Scalia, and Chief Justice John Roberts,[187][188] and which was reversed in the 1930s.[189][190][191] An often cited example of liberal judicial activism is Roe v. Wade (1973), which legalized abortion in part on the basis of the "right to privacy" inferred from the Fourteenth Amendment, a reasoning that some critics argued was circuitous.[187] Legal scholars,[192][193] justices,[194] and presidential candidates[195] have criticized the Roe decision. The progressive Brown v. Board of Education decision has been criticized by conservatives such as Patrick Buchanan[196] and former presidential contender Barry Goldwater.[197] More recently, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission was criticized for expanding upon the precedent in First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti (1978) that the First Amendment applies to corporations.[198] Lincoln warned, referring to the Dred Scott decision, that if government policy became "irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court...the people will have ceased to be their own rulers."[199] Former justice Thurgood Marshall justified judicial activism with these words: "You do what you think is right and let the law catch up."[200] During different historical periods, the Court has leaned in different directions.[201][202] Critics from both sides complain that activist-judges abandon the Constitution and substitute their own views instead.[203][204][205] Critics include writers such as Andrew Napolitano,[206] Phyllis Schlafly,[207] Mark R. Levin,[208] Mark I. Sutherland,[209] and James MacGregor Burns.[210][211] Past presidents from both parties have attacked judicial activism, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan.[212][213] Failed Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork wrote: "What judges have wrought is a coup d'état, – slow-moving and genteel, but a coup d'état nonetheless."[214] Senator Al Franken quipped that when politicians talk about judicial activism, "their definition of an activist judge is one who votes differently than they would like."[215] One law professor claimed in a 1978 article that the Supreme Court is in some respects "certainly a legislative body."[216]
