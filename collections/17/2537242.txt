Between 1940 and 1970, water exports through the Mono Extension averaged 57,067 acre-feet per year (afy) and peaked at 135,000 af in 1974. Export licenses granted by the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) in 1974 increased exports to 167,000 afy.[23] These export levels severely impacted the region's fish habitat, lake level and air quality, which led to a series of lawsuits.[25] The results of the litigation culminated with a SWRCB Decision to restore fishery protection (stream) flows to specified minimums, and raise Mono Lake to 6,391 feet above sea level. The agreement limited further exports from the Mono Basin to 10,000 afy.[26]
