In 2005, Terry Labonte took over the car after he announced he became semi-retired; the number had been changed to No. 44, used by Labonte during his first championship season in 1984. Kyle Busch, meanwhile, moved to his No. 5 car full-time. Sponsored by Kellogg's, Pizza Hut, and GMAC/Ditech.com, Labonte drove the car in a limited schedule over the next two years.[17] His final race with the team was at his native Texas Motor Speedway in November 2006, in a special commemorative paint scheme sponsored by longtime-partner Kellogg's.[17] Though Labonte planned to retire following the race, he would race on a part-time or substitute basis until 2014.[78]
