"Because" was written with the intention of being the Dave Clark Five's fifth US single, but the band's label, Epic Records, was initially resistant, believing the ballad strayed too far from the hit-making formula that had proven successful with the band's previous upbeat singles.[2]  In May 1964, the song was released in the UK as the B-side to "Can't You See That She's Mine". Clark insisted that "Because" be released as an A-side in the US, and Epic eventually agreed.[1]  The single entered the Billboard Hot 100 chart at number sixty in August, and peaked six weeks later at number three.[3][4]  "Because" became the band's fifth US single to sell more than one million copies.[5]  In Canada, the song reached number three on RPM magazine's singles chart.[6]
