Danielle (Julie St. Claire) is a girl that Zack dates for one episode ("Fake I.D.'s"). Zack meets Danielle at the Max after she gets a flat tire. She attempts to use the occupied pay phone, so Zack allows her to use his cell phone. He then changes the flat tire after the tow truck company says it would take an hour. Danielle is a student at USC, so Zack lies and tells her he was also a Trojan. He continues to lie, telling her that he is a Photojournalism major, and the reason that she never saw him on campus is because he is always in the dark room working on a project. However, Danielle ditches Zack upon learning he lied to her.
