Apart from the stability engendered by the unification of Europe, one of the major causes of the sudden economic growth was the slave trade. Following the rise of the Arab empires, the Arab elites created a major demand for slaves with European slaves particularly prized. As a result of wars and raids in the Eastern Europe, a steady supply of captured Slavs reached Frankish/Italian merchants which were then sold to Muslim Spain and other parts of the Arab world. The trade was so lucrative that it almost immediately transformed the European economies.[4][5] The West was able to re-engage with the more civilized cultures of the East (the Muslim and Eastern Roman empires) and other industries, such as textiles, were able to grow in Europe as well.[6]
