At its most fundamental level, inheritance in organisms occurs by passing discrete heritable units, called genes, from parents to offspring.[36] This property was first observed by Gregor Mendel, who studied the segregation of heritable traits in pea plants.[13][37] In his experiments studying the trait for flower color, Mendel observed that the flowers of each pea plant were either purple or whiteâ€”but never an intermediate between the two colors. These different, discrete versions of the same gene are called alleles.
