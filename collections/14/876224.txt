In December 2008, Spears's sixth studio album Circus was released. It received positive reviews from critics[116] and debuted at number one in Canada, Czech Republic and the United States, and inside the top ten in many European nations.[103][117] In the United States, Spears became the youngest female artist to have five albums debut at number one, earning a place in Guinness World Records.[118] She also became the only act in the Soundscan era to have four albums debut with 500,000 or more copies sold.[117] The album was one of the fastest-selling albums of the year,[119] and has sold 4 million copies worldwide.[120] Its lead single, "Womanizer", became Spears's first number one in the Billboard Hot 100 since "...Baby One More Time". The single also topped the charts in Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Norway and Sweden.[121][122] It was also nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best Dance Recording.[123] In January 2009, Spears and her father James obtained a restraining order against her former manager Sam Lutfi, ex-boyfriend Adnan Ghalib and attorney Jon Eardley â€” all of whom, court documents claim, had been conspiring to gain control of Spears's affairs. The restraining order forbids Lutfi and Ghalib from contacting Spears or coming within 250 yards of her, her property or family members.[124] Spears embarked on The Circus Starring Britney Spears in March 2009. With a gross of U.S. $131.8 million, it became the fifth highest grossing tour of the year.[125]
