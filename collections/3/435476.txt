In Secrets of the Furious Five, Tigress was revealed to be an orphan living in the Bao Gu Orphanage where she was greatly feared by the other children and the matron due to her destructive temper and strength. Isolated in her room for the safety of the other children, she began to see herself as a monster, as everyone else did. Shifu, at the request of the orphanage, came to teach her to control herself by playing dominoes, which required discipline, grace, and precision. After months of training, Tigress learned to control both her anger and her movements. However, she was still feared by all potential parents who visited the orphanage, and Shifu soon took her in as a foster daughter, giving a small but genuine smile to her as they walked towards Tigress' new home, the Jade Palace. However, Shifu still carried the emotional scars of previous events, and was strict and distant in her upbringing. An adult Tigress explained that Shifu loved Tai Lung like no other person before or since, including her.
