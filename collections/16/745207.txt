Under new manager Charlie Manuel, whose offensive strategy predominantly revolved around hitting lots of home runs, Rollins struggled to post a strong batting average early in the Phillies' 2005 season, as he too tried to hit home runs.[26] Nevertheless, he was again selected to the NL All-Star team.[8] His offensive strategy changed in early August, when he began a hitting streak that spanned the season's final 36 games; during the streak, he hit .379.[8] It was the longest hitting streak in Phillies' history, surpassing Ed Delahanty, whose streak lasted 31 games.[28][29] Throughout the streak, Rollins aspired to maintain a team-first mentality, and noted that he would trade the streak for a playoff berth: "If we lose and I keep the streak, what does that mean? The season is automatically over. The playoffs is everything. That's what we all want."[30] Ultimately, the Phillies missed the playoffs by one game.[31] Overall, Rollins compiled his fourth career quadruple-double, tying Johnny Damon for most among active players, and posted a .290 batting average with 12 home runs, 54 RBIs, and 41 stolen bases.[1][8]
