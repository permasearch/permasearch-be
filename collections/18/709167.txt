Tornadoes are also relatively uncommon. However, there has been at least one damaging tornado in the city. The Salt Lake City Tornado of August 11, 1999, which killed one person and injured 60, resulted in only the second ever fatality from a tornado in Utah, and caused about $500 million in damage. As a result of extended drought patterns, Salt Lake City constructed several reservoirs to hold excess water during flood periods and provide water during drought conditions. Additionally, artesian wells and water siphoned from Utah Lake miles to the south act as alternate water sources for the city. [6]
