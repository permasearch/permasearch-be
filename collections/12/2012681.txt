So the expectations for undo are to be easy to understand, to have a predictable functionality and to include all undoable commands.[1] Usually undo is always available until the user undoes all executed operations back. But there are some actions which are not stored in the undo list and so thereâ€™s no possibility to undo these. For example saving file is not undoable, but is queued in the list to show, that this command was executed. Another action, which is not undoable and not stored, too, is scrolling or selection.[2]
