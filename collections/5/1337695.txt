Development on Crash of the Titans began after the completion of Crash Tag Team Racing.[17] The graphics of the Wii version of the game was one of Radical Entertainment's main focuses in the game's development,[1] with Radical stating that the Wii has "a lot of horsepower under the hood" and expressing their desire to make full use of it.[30] They also considered implementing a feature to connect the Wii to DS during gameplay, but stopped due to technical issues and time.[10] The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 2 version got a few extra months of development time to improve its graphics before setting a final release date.[31]
