The North American porcupine has a strong odor to warn away predators, which it can increase when agitated. The smell has been described as similar to strong human body odor, goats, or some cheeses. The odor is generated by a patch of skin called the rosette, on the lower back where modified quills serve as osmetrichia to broadcast the smell.[16] The characteristic odor comes from the R-enantiomer of delta-decalactone.[17] Not present is the S-enantiomer which smells like coconut and is used in flavorings and perfumes.
