Navy Day is celebrated on 8 September to commemorate its service in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.[citation needed] The navy lost one-half of its force in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.[162] The Navy heavily depended on American-built naval technology and operated a large infrastructure from 1947â€“1971.[158] The Pressler amendment forced an embargo in the 1990s, during which the navy developed air independent propulsion (AIP) technology purchased from France and built the Agosta-class submarines; two of these (as well as one of the new frigates) were built at Pakistan's facilities in Karachi.[163] The navy's surface fleet consists of helicopter carriers, destroyers, frigates, amphibious assault ships, patrol ships, mine-countermeasures, and miscellaneous vessels.[164] Established in 1972, the Naval Air Arm provides fleet air defence, maritime reconnaissance, and anti-submarine warfare capability. Mirage 5 aircraft donated by the PAF are flown by the Navy, equipped with Exocet anti-ship missiles.[164] The Navy's fleet of P-3C Orion turboprop aircraft, equipped with electronic intelligence (ELINT) systems, play a pivotal role in the Navy's gathering of intelligence.[165] Since 2001, the navy has emphasized its role and expanded its operational scope across the country with the establishment of Naval Strategic Forces Command, based in Islamabad.
