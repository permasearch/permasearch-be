Termites are less likely to be attacked by parasites than bees, wasps and ants, as they are usually well protected in their mounds.[116][117] Nevertheless, termites are infected by a variety of parasites. Some of these include dipteran flies,[118] Pyemotes mites, and a large number of nematode parasites. Most nematode parasites are in the order Rhabditida;[119] others are in the genus Mermis, Diplogaster aerivora and Harteria gallinarum.[120] Under imminent threat of an attack by parasites, a colony may migrate to a new location.[121] Fungi pathogens such as Aspergillus nomius and Metarhizium anisopliae are, however, major threats to a termite colony as they are not host-specific and may infect large portions of the colony;[122][123] transmission usually occurs via direct physical contact.[124] M. anispliae is known to weaken the termite immune system. Infection with A. nomius only occurs when a colony is under great stress.
