In Joseon Korea, the Scholar occupation took the form of the noble yangban class, which prevented the lower classes from taking the advanced gwageo exams so they could dominate the bureaucracy.  Below the yangban were the chungin, a class of privileged commoners who were petty bureaucrats, scribes, and specialists.  The chungin were actually the least populous class, even smaller than the yangban. The yangban constituted 10% of the population.[94] From the mid-Joseon period, military officers and civil officials were separately derived from different clans.[95]
