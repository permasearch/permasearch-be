Gautama Buddha, who was called an "awakened one" (Buddha), was born into the Shakya clan living at Kapilavastu and Lumbini in what is now southern Nepal. The Buddha was born at Lumbini, as emperor Ashoka's Lumbini pillar records, just before the kingdom of Magadha (which traditionally is said to have lasted from c. 546â€“324 BCE) rose to power.  The Shakyas claimed Angirasa and Gautama Maharishi lineage,[124] via descent from the royal lineage of Ayodhya.
