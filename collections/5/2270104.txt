Sonny tries to help Tawni have a good date with an intern Hayden (Robert Adamson). Sonny begs Chad for Laker Tickets for herself, Tawni, and Hayden which she got after saying three nice things about him. Meanwhile, Nico and Grady try to create a sandwich to be named after, after seeing the sandwich Chad got named after. At the date, Tawni leaves for a moment and the kiss cam zooms in on Sonny and Hayden. Under the pressure, Sonny and Hayden are forced to kiss, making Tawni furious. Chad gets upset because he trusted Sonny to use his tickets "responsibly", but instead he saw the kiss on "Tween Weekly" magazine. Both Chad and Tawni blame Sonny so to make it up to Tawni, Sonny gets her a second chance with Hayden. Hayden wants the date to be a home cooked meal at Tawni's apartment. Since Tawni doesn't know how to cook and uses her kitchen as a closet, the date will be at Sonny's and Sonny will cook the meal. At the apartment, Sonny's oven is not working, so Nico and Grady send over sandwiches to serve. Not only that, but Sonny drops her phone down the drain and Tawni accidentally destroys it by turning on the garbage disposal and then Sonny's phone somehow calls Chad, Tawni loses her contact lens when the sandwich hit her, and Sonny gets locked out after Hayden comes into the kitchen. Nico and Grady come into the apartment to help Sonny get back in. Chad breaks open Sonny's door and accidentally damages it when he heard a phone call from Sonny (this happened when her phone went down the drain). Then, Sonny gets back in and Tawni tells Hayden the truth. In the end, Nico, Grady, Hayden, and Chad all end up retching because they ate the sandwich Nico and Grady accidentally left out in the sun for 12 hours. Then Sonny's new blarmie ends up with a gross sandwich that Tawni retched on when it showed up in the mail at Sonny's apartment.
