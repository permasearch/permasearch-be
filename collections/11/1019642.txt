In December 2004, two time Daytime Emmy nominee Ashley Jones (Megan Dennison, The Young and the Restless) took over the role of Bridget Forrester.[4] In 2008, she spoke of her first day on set, revealing "I was so intimidated because I was working with Katherine Kelly Lang, and I had all these crying scenes", and also remembering that she felt on edge having replaced Finnigan.[5] By June 2009, Jones had appeared in over 600 episodes of the series.[6] Initially, she had only planned to remain in the role for only two years, but said: "I didn't see any reason to leave, and I didn't want anyone else to play Bridget."[6]
