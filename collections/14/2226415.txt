A common error is to use the phrase "Hobbesian choice" instead of "Hobson's choice", confusing the philosopher Thomas Hobbes with the relatively obscure Thomas Hobson[11][12][13][14] (It's possible they may be confusing "Hobson's choice" with "Hobbesian trap", which refers to the trap into which a state falls when it attacks another out of fear).[15] Notwithstanding that confused usage, the phrase "Hobbesian choice" is historically incorrect.[16][17][18]
