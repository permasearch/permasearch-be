The album had been delayed a number of times, for various reasons. Originally, the release was aimed for Halloween;[citation needed] this was later pushed back to November 2007. In September 2007, Oldfield and Universal decided to delay the release of the album until January 2008, for personal reasons. However, in November the release date was again put back until March 2008, around this time Oldfield also moved out of the United Kingdom to Spain.
