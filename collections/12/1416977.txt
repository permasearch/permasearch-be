Because a 129Xe nucleus has a spin of 1/2, and therefore a zero electric quadrupole moment, the 129Xe nucleus does not experience any quadrupolar interactions during collisions with other atoms, and the hyperpolarization persists for long periods even after the engendering light and vapor have been removed. Spin polarization of 129Xe can persist from several seconds for xenon atoms dissolved in blood[76] to several hours in the gas phase[77] and several days in deeply frozen solid xenon.[78] In contrast, 131Xe has a nuclear spin value of ​3⁄2 and a nonzero quadrupole moment, and has t1 relaxation times in the millisecond and second ranges.[79]
