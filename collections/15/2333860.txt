After getting a taste of the amazingly delicious Kreemy Kold ice cream, Marty (Robert Capron) becomes obsessed with catching the mysterious "Kreemy Kold" ice cream truck that seems to haunt his neighborhood, but always manages to elude him. The local mailman tells Marty the story of a boy named Jimmy Jeffries who was just as obsessed as he was and caught the truck, but vanished and never returned. Marty manages to stop the ice cream truck but in a twist ending, he learns that to get all the Kreemy Kold ice cream he wants involves the payment of his soul when he encounters an older Jimmy Jeffries (C. Ernst Harth). He ends up trapped inside the freezing ice cream truck until someone else becomes as crazed as he was for the ice cream, catches the truck, and takes his place.
