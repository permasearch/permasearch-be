Sonic the Hedgehog (ソニック・ザ・ヘッジホッグ, Sonikku Za Hejjihoggu), trademarked Sonic The Hedgehog,[1] is a blue anthropomorphic hedgehog and the main protagonist of the series. Developed as a replacement for their existing Alex Kidd mascot, as well as Sega's response to Mario, his first appearance was in the arcade game, Rad Mobile (as a cameo), before making his official debut in Sonic the Hedgehog (1991). Sonic's greatest ability is his running speed, and he is known as the world's fastest hedgehog.[2] Using the power of the seven Chaos Emeralds, he becomes Super Sonic and can achieve even greater speeds.
