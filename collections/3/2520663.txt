In a program begun in October 2011, the TSA's Precheck Program allows selected members of the American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Alaska Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, Virgin America, Southwest Airlines, Air Canada, JetBlue Airlines, and Sun Country Airlines frequent flyer programs, members of Global Entry, NEXUS, and SENTRI and active duty members of the US military[citation needed] to receive expedited screening for domestic and select international itineraries.[57] As of August 2015[update], this program was available at 156 airports.[58] After completing a background check, being fingerprinted,[59] and paying an $85 fee, travelers will get a Known Traveler Number. The program has led to complaints of unfairness and longer wait lines.[60] Aeromexico, Etihad Airways, Cape Air, and Seaborne Airlines joined the program bringing the total number of member carriers to 16.[61] On December 15, 2015, the program expanded to include Allegiant Air.[62] On June 21, 2016, it was announced that Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines will also join the program starting in the fall of 2016.[63] On August 31, 2016, the program expanded to include Lufthansa[64], then on September 29, 2016, Frontier Airlines was added[65]. In 2017, 11 more airlines were added on January 26[66], and another 7 airlines were added on May 25[67], bringing the total to 37 carriers.
