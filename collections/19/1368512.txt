Abortion, the voluntary termination of pregnancy, is one of the primary consequences of unintended pregnancy.[5] A large proportion of induced abortions worldwide are due to unwanted or mistimed pregnancy.[22][23] Unintended pregnancies result in about 42 million induced abortions per year worldwide.[6] In the United States, over 92% of abortions are the result of unintended pregnancy.[21]
