The cook took PVT Slovik to a MP, then his company commander, who read the note and urged PVT Slovik to destroy it before he was taken into custody, PVT Slovik refused. He was brought before Lieutenant Colonel (LTC) Ross Henbest, who again offered him the opportunity to tear up the note, return to his unit, and face no further charges. PVT Slovik again refused, Henbest instructed PVT Slovik to write another note on the back of the first one stating that he fully understood the legal consequences of deliberately incriminating himself, and that it would be used as evidence against him in a court martial.
