Tyler has been criticized for his use of homophobic slurs, in particular, his frequent use of the epithet "faggot" in his lyrics and on Twitter.[56][57] He has denied accusations of homophobia, stating, "I'm not homophobic. I just say faggot and use gay as an adjective to describe stupid shit,"[58][59] and, "I'm not homophobic. I just think faggot hits and hurts people."[60] However, he later said in an interview with MTV about the slurs, "Well, I have gay fans and they don't really take it offensive, so I don't know. If it offends you, it offends you. If you call me a nigger, I really don't care, but that's just me, personally. Some people might take it the other way; I personally don't give a shit."[61][62] Despite making several remarks that have been taken as homophobic, Tyler, The Creator was among the first to openly support fellow Odd Future member Frank Ocean after publicly revealing a past relationship with another young man.[63]
