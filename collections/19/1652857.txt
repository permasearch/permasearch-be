After High Court judges ruled in 2016 that parliamentary approval must be sought for activation of Article 50, the leading headline on the Mail's front page read "Enemies of the people".[137] The paper's front page and other coverage drew much criticism from the legal world, as well as from high-ranking politicians.[138] On its website, the Mail described one of the judges as "openly gay." Critics accused the Mail of unnecessarily highlighting the judge's sexual orientation due to anti-gay motives. The Mail later removed the description.[139] One law professor commented: "I have never seen this kind of invective against judges, either here or abroad, in the national media."[140]
