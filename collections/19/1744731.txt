To experience a detailed model of a large empire, 4X games are designed with a complex set of game rules.[16] For example, the player's productivity may be limited by pollution.[39][40] Players may need to balance a budget, such as managing debt,[41] or paying down maintenance costs.[42] 4X games often model political challenges such as civil disorder,[29][39] or a senate that can oust the player's political party or force them to make peace.[39][43]
