Although Eton College has long abandoned the top hat as part of its uniform, top hats are still worn by "Monitors" at Harrow School with their Sunday dress uniform.[25] They are worn by male members of the British Royal Family on State occasions as an alternative to military uniform, for instance, in the Carriage Procession at the Diamond Jubilee in 2012.[26] Top hats may also be worn at some horse racing meetings, notably The Derby[27] and Royal Ascot.[28] Top hats are worn at the Tynwald Day ceremony and a few other formal occasions in the Isle of Man.
