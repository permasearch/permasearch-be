Sarah Lynn (voiced by Kristen Schaal) was a human actress who played the Horse's precocious adoptive youngest daughter Sabrina on Horsin' Around starting when she was only 3 years old, and who looked up to BoJack off-screen as a father figure. After the show went off the air, she became a successful pop singer in the early 2000s before drug addiction and alcoholism ended her career. Flashbacks indicate that Sarah Lynn's self-destructive behavior is in part the result of being forced into an acting career by her mother, and BoJack (whom she idolized) having neglected her as a child. Around the end of "Later", she was seen visiting Andrew Garfield (with whom she was mentioned as having an on-again, off-again relationship) at the hospital. It is heavily implied that she was sexually abused as a child by her mother's boyfriend and later stepfather. Although BoJack attempts to get her sober earlier in Season 1, he later goes on a bender with her and Todd in an attempt to rewrite his memoir after firing Diane.
