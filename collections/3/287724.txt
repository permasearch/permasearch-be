In 1930, the boundaries between the 88 constellations were devised by Eug√®ne Delporte along vertical and horizontal lines of right ascension and declination.[45] However, the data he used originated back to epoch B1875.0, which was when Benjamin A. Gould first made his proposal to designate boundaries for the celestial sphere, a suggestion upon which Delporte would base his work. The consequence of this early date is that because of the precession of the equinoxes, the borders on a modern star map, such as epoch J2000, are already somewhat skewed and no longer perfectly vertical or horizontal.[46] This effect will increase over the years and centuries to come.
