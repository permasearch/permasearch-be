The week before the single reached Number One, Sony BMG (the parent company of BNA Records, the label to which Chesney was signed at the time) e-mailed a cease-and-desist order to several radio stations that were monitored by Billboard, demanding that these stations cease playing the version featuring McGraw and Chesney's vocals. According to the letter, which was written by Sony BMG's president, Sony BMG "did not grant 'singles' rights to Rocky Comfort with respect to the album versions of this song and has not authorized any radio station to play this recording".[9] Despite the demands from Sony BMG, radio stations did not stop playing the version with McGraw and Chesney.[10] One day after the release of that letter, Sony BMG issued a formal apology to the radio stations to which the cease-and-desist order had been sent.[10]
