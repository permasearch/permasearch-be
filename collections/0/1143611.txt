Concurrent programming has traditionally been a topic in operating systems theory texts.[28] Formal verification seems indispensable, because concurrent programs are notorious for the hidden and sophisticated bugs they contain.[29] A mathematical approach to the study of concurrency and communication is referred to as Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP).[30] Concurrency can also be modelled using finite state machines like Mealy and Moore machines. Mealy and Moore machines are in use as design tools in digital electronics systems, which we encounter in the form of hardware used in telecommunications or electronic devices in general.[31]
