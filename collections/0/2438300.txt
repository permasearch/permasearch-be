A green bin is a short, rigid container used to contain biodegradable waste or compostable materials as a means to divert waste from landfills. In some localities green bins are also used to contain unsorted municipal waste. The bins are designed and manufactured by Norseman Environmental (an ORBIS brand), a manufacturer of recycling and organic waste containers in North America.
