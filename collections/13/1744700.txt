As a secret character in the first Mortal Kombat, Reptile features a hybrid of Sub-Zero's and Scorpion's attacks, such as the former's freezing projectile and the latter's harpoon.[25] When made a playable character for later installments, his moves were changed completely. His "Forceball" attack creates an energy ball from his hands, while his "Acid Spit" attack produces a higher, faster projectile. Reptile can slide towards the opponent, or turn invisible for a brief period of time or until hit.[26] Later titles in the series modify these moves, such as splitting the Forceball attack into slow and fast variants,[11] or remove moves in favor of different attacks, only to return them in the next installment.[27]
