A framework for section 5 inspections of academies and maintained schools was introduced from January 2012, and replaced with another new framework in September 2012.  Public consultation was undertaken,[26] and Ofsted prepared for the new framework after piloting a series of inspections across the country. Among other changes, the new system relabelled the "Satisfactory" category as "Requires Improvement", with an expectation that schools should not remain at that level.[27]
