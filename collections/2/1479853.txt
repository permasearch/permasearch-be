It's the final four on I Love Money, and Craig notes their next challenge will be "crazy." When the four contestants arrive to their next location, they see a wide beam supported by a crane, suspended over the water and rocks. This challenge is called "The Krazy Toss" and it's based on Flavor Of Love 2, when Buckeey almost pushed Krazy over the balcony. The contestants will wear a harness and a helmet and will have to carry a Krazy doll over the beam and drop it on a target. Craig tells them they will then have to go back to the starting point and that the event is being timed. Whoever does it in the least amount of time will be Pay Master. The remaining three contestants will go with the Pay Master on a power dinner. The Pay Master will eliminate one person. Megan goes first although she feels she does not have much of a chance because she is afraid of heights. Megan becomes somewhat paralyzed with fear, as well as having a hard time picking up the Krazy doll. Craig tells her if she does not give him a thumbs up and get going, she will be disqualified. Cheered on by Whiteboy, Megan finally gives the sign but does not have her footing. She drops the doll, almost falls off the beam and loses the challenge. Hoopz goes next and impresses the other contestants with the way she grabs the doll, runs right over the beam and tosses the doll off. She forgets she has to come back and stays on the balcony side until she is told she's not done. She finishes in 23 seconds, but says the rules were not made clear. They replay the segment where Craig made the rules perfectly clear. Real goes next. He is also afraid of heights but he manages to get through the challenge in 28 seconds, putting him in second place. Whiteboy wastes no time and finishes in 16 seconds, winning the game.
