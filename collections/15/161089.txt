In the Angry Video Game Nerd's 2008 episode on the video game adaptation of The Wizard of Oz, all the episode's events are deliberately synced up to Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon if one plays the first four songs of the album in sync to this episode, a reference to the connection between the album and the 1939 film.[20]
