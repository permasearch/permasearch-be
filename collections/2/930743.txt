During the construction phase, the naming rights to the "New Garden" were sold to Boston-based Shawmut Bank, and the arena was originally slated to open as the Shawmut Center. However, just as the arena was being completed, the name of the "New Garden's" sponsor, Shawmut, disappeared upon the bank's merger with Fleet Financial Group. Shortly before the new arena opened, every seat, which had been stamped with the Shawmut logo, had to be replaced. Also, the entire color scheme for the interior had to be adjusted from Shawmut's blue-and-white to Fleet's green-and-gold. The arena opened on September 30, 1995.
