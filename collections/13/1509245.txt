pork /ˈ-ɔərk/ has no rhymes in conservative RP and GA. However, the distinction between horse and hoarse has been mostly lost in younger generations, and for them and many others pork which was an exception to the normal rule, now rhymes with fork, cork, etc. (/ˈ-ɔːrk/) The OED no longer lists "/pɔək/" as an alternative pronunciation in its third edition.
