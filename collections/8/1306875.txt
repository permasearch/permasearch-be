There are several methods for generating the Avar values to obtain realistic motion. Traditionally, animators manipulate the Avars directly.[22] Rather than set Avars for every frame, they usually set Avars at strategic points (frames) in time and let the computer interpolate or tween between them in a process called keyframing. Keyframing puts control in the hands of the animator and has roots in hand-drawn traditional animation.[23]
