The original Old Fashioned recipe would have showcased the whiskey available in America in the 19th century: Irish, Bourbon or rye whiskey.[13] But in some regions, especially Wisconsin, brandy is substituted for whiskey (sometimes called a Brandy Old Fashioned).[14][15][16] Eventually the use of other spirits became common, such as a gin recipe becoming popularized in the late 1940s.[13]
