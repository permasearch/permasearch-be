"The Grand Delusion" was one of the last tracks written for the album. It was the result of a riff that Green had, which the band "Neck Deep-ified it", according to Barlow.[11] Discussing the track, Barlow said "There have been times where I've wished I didn't have this pressure on me, and that I was a normal person".[3] "Parachute" started out as a demo under the name "Britpop". Barlow said the group wanted the track "to have a massive festival feel" to it.[11] "In Bloom" was the first track written for the album, written around six months following the release of Life's Not out to Get You.[11] Barlow said the song "kickstarted the whole creative process".[20] It started out as an acoustic song, before eventually becoming a full-band track. Barlow said it "set the bar and tone" for the remainder of the album.[20] He added that it was "pretty down-tempo for us, yet it builds and climaxes in one of my favourite arrangements weâ€™ve ever created".[20] Barlow considers it "unique" as it contains an instrumental middle 8 section, something the group had not done before.[11] He explained that they intentionally left it as an instrumental so that people could "dance and feel the song."[11]
