Cedric Diggory was a Hufflepuff student two years above Harry. A Hufflepuff prefect, he shows a notable streak of modesty, fairness, and loyalty. When he catches the Snitch and wins the match after Harry falls off his broomstick following an encounter with the Dementors, he believes the circumstances of the match to be unfair and protests that the result should be nullified and the match replayed. He is described as being exceptionally handsome, tall, with chiselled features, a straight nose, dark hair, and bright grey eyes.
