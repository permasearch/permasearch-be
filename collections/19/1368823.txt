Eugene is downwind of Willamette Valley grass seed farms.[44] The combination of summer grass pollen and the confining shape of the hills around Eugene make it "the area of the highest grass pollen counts in the USA (>1,500 pollen grains/m3 of air)."[45] These high pollen counts have led to difficulties for some track athletes who compete in Eugene. In the Olympic trials in 1972, "Jim Ryun won the 1,500 after being flown in by helicopter because he was allergic to Eugene's grass seed pollen."[46] Further, six-time Olympian Maria Mutola abandoned Eugene as a training area "in part to avoid allergies".[47]
