Hitler made very different statements about his economic views on different occasions. At one point he was quoted as saying: "I had only to develop logically what social democracy failed.... National Socialism is what Marxism might have been if it could have broken its absurd ties with a democratic order.... Why need we trouble to socialize banks and factories? We socialize human beings...."[96] At another point, in private, Hitler said that "I absolutely insist on protecting private property... we must encourage private initiative".[97] On yet another occasion he qualified that statement by saying that the government should have the power to regulate the use of private property for the good of the nation.[98] In spite of this, he later asserted that "It is my firm conviction that property rights... must be unconditionally respected. Any tampering with them would eliminate one of the most vital incentives to human activity and would jeopardize future endeavor."[99] Hitler clearly believed that the lack of a precise economic programme was one of the Nazi Party's strengths, saying: "The basic feature of our economic theory is that we have no theory at all."[100]
