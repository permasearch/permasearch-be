On March 25, 2014, Lerman said that a sequel to Sea of Monsters would not be made.[49] However, a report of March 31, 2014 stated "Logan Lerman has said Percy Jackson 3 could still go ahead" and that the previous report "was taken out of context".[50] At the 2015 Santa Barbara International Film Festival, Lerman said that while he finds the Percy Jackson films fun to make, he has not heard anything about the production of a third film and expressed concern that he and his co-stars were growing too old for their parts.[51]
