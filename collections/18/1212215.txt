The Roundhouse is a former locomotive engine roundhouse constructed in 1847 for the London & North Western Railway. It later had various uses, including a corn and potato store, Gilbey's gin warehouse, and eventually became derelict.[16] It was converted to a theatre, arts centre and music venue in 1966,[17] later closed, and re-opened in 2006 as a theatre and music venue.[18]
