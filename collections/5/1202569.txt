Miss Piggy and Kermit formally ended their romantic relationship on May 10, 1990.[10] The decision was made by Jim Henson Productions and a publicity campaign titled "The Pig of the Nineties" was scheduled to follow. An autobiography of Piggy was expected to be published as part of the effort.[11] However, shortly after the announcement on May 16, Jim Henson died and the campaign was dropped altogether.[10] The two eventually resumed their relationship.
