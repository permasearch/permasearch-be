In 1982, the Accord became the first car from a Japanese manufacturer to be produced in the United States when production commenced in Marysville, Ohio at Honda's Marysville Auto Plant. The Accord has achieved considerable success, especially in the United States, where it was the best-selling Japanese car for sixteen years (1982â€“97), topping its class in sales in 1991 and 2001, with around ten million vehicles sold.[7] Numerous road tests, past and present, rate the Accord as one of the world's most reliable vehicles.[8] The Accord has been on the Car and Driver 10Best list a record 30 times.[9]
