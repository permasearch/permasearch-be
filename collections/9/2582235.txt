Chauhan was introduced to music by her father and credits her "powerful" voice to him.[2] She acknowledges that western music had a huge impact in her singing and confessed that she likes to perform "songs that have a western flavour in them".[197] Believing that her voice has a "global appeal", she feels that her exposure to international music has only "sharpened" her skills while she does not forcefully tries to imply a western feel to the song.[198] She considers Lata Mangeshkar as her biggest inspiration, calling her "a temple of music".[199][200] She grew up listening to music by Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle and is equally influenced by singers like Kavita Krishnamurthy, Sadhana Sargam, Alka Yagnik, Kishori Amonkar, Kishore Kumar and Manna Dey.[194][201]
