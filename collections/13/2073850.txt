A returned missionary (often abbreviated "RM") is a term used by members of the LDS Church to refer to men and women who have previously served as Mormon missionaries. Once they return home, RMs are generally encouraged to begin dating seriously and to seek marriage.[46][47][48] Those who learned to speak a foreign language must readjust, sometimes with difficulty, to speaking their first language.[32]
