Doritos are sold in many countries worldwide in assorted flavors. They launched nationally in the United States in 1966,[5] with only one flavor: toasted corn.[20] The product proved successful, but additional market research revealed that many consumers outside the Southwest and West considered the chip to be too bland and not spicy enough for what was perceived as a Mexican snack. Frito-Lay therefore developed taco-flavored Doritos, which also became successful after they were introduced nationally in 1967.[20] National distribution of nacho cheese-flavored Doritos began in 1972, and were also a hit.[20] For a short run in the late 1970s, Sour Cream and Onion flavored Doritos were available, but were discontinued in the early 1980s. A Sesame seed flavored chip was also available for a short time in the late 1970s.[21] In 1986, Cool Ranch Doritos made their debut and also became popular.[20] Cool Ranch Doritos are sold under the name "Cool Original" in the UK and are called "Cool American" elsewhere in Europe, as ranch dressing is less common in those places.
