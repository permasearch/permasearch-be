For 2014, Kevin Harvick was signed to the newly renumbered No. 4 car, with his Budweiser and Jimmy John's sponsorship coming over from Richard Childress Racing. Hunt Brothers Pizza, which had sponsored the team in the past, also came over with Harvick. Harvick won in just his second start with Stewart-Haas Racing at Phoenix International Raceway. The team then won again at Darlington Raceway in April, leading 239 of 374 laps and using fresher tires to pass Dale Earnhardt, Jr. with two laps to go.[26] Harvick's two wins with the team earned him a spot in the Chase for the Sprint Cup. He advanced into the second round with two Top 5's and won at Charlotte in October to earn a spot in the third round. Harvick finished the season strong, winning the penultimate race of the year at Phoenix to remain in title contention, then winning the final race of the year at Homestead-Miami Speedway to clinch the second Cup Championship for SHR.
