The monarchy was restored after Cromwell's death, and for the coronation of King Charles II, who had been living in exile abroad, new Jewels were made based on records of the lost items.[52] They were supplied by the banker and Royal Goldsmith,[i] Sir Robert Vyner, at a cost of £12,184 7s 2d[59] – as much as three warships.[60] A medieval anointing spoon and three swords had survived and were returned to the Crown,[61] as were some historically important gemstones.[62] Between 1660 and 1663, at the additional cost of some £18,000, almost two tons (4,400 lb) of altar and banqueting plate were made for the king.[63]
