The Asia-Pacific Rugby League Confederation's purpose is to spread the sport of rugby league throughout their region along with other governing bodies such as the ARL and NZRL.[31] Since rugby league was introduced to Australia in 1908 it has become the largest television sport and 3rd most attended sport in Australia[32] and neighbouring Papua New Guinea is one of two countries to have rugby league as its national sport (with Cook Islands).[10][11] This has led to officials from that country lobbying to have a team admitted to the National Rugby League,[33] Australia's elite club competition which also features a team from Auckland, New Zealand's biggest city. The reasonable popularity of the code in New Zealand has led to talk about the possibility of another team from the South Island entering the competition as well.[34] Rugby league is the dominant winter sport in the eastern Australian states of New South Wales and Queensland.[35] The game is also among the predominant sports of Tonga[36] and is played in other Pacific nations such as Samoa and Fiji. In Australia, and indeed the rest of the region, the annual State of Origin series ranks among the most popular sporting events.[37][38]
