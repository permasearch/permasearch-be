In North America, the Lancer was introduced in 2001 for the 2002 model year as a direct replacement for the Mirage. In the United States, Chrysler had offered an unrelated Dodge Lancer at various stages between the 1950s and 1980s. However, when Chrysler briefly controlled Mitsubishi through the DaimlerChrysler-Mitsubishi alliance from 2000 through to 2004, the license to the "Lancer" name was relinquished to Mitsubishi for usage in North America. Consequently, after Mitsubishi discontinued the 1995 series Mirage for North America in 2001, the replacement model adopted the Lancer name for the first time.
