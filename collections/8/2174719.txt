McLachlan and Newman performed "When She Loved Me" live at the 72nd Academy Awards in 2000,[51] where the song had been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song.[17] The song has since been covered by several artists, many of whom tend to alter the song's interpretation to that of a love song in their own renditions.[24] Brian Sutherland, Steve Tyrell, Kerry Butler, Jordan Pruitt. Actor Michael Crawford recorded a version of the song for his album The Disney Album.[10] Singer Jane Monheit covered "When She Loved Me" for her album The Heart of the Matter (2013).[52][53] Mexican music trio Belanova released a Spanish cover of the song in 2016, entitled "Cuando Ella Me Amaba".[18] Their version was included on the compilation anthem We Love Disney (Latino).[18] Describing it as "more heartbreaking" than the original version, AXS contributor Lucas Villa observed that the group's "signature electro-pop sound" had been replaced with more acoustic instruments to emphasize front woman Denisse Guerrero's voice, which is used as the version's main instrument instead, which Villa felt "beautifully reflects the pain and pining in Jessie's sad story. The emotion translates well with Belanova's haunting rendition."[18]
