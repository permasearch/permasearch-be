Standing wave ratio (SWR) is the ratio of the amplitude at the antinode (maximum) to the amplitude at the node (minimum). A pure standing wave will have an infinite SWR. It will also have a constant phase at any point in space (but it may undergo a 180° inversion every half cycle). A finite, non-zero SWR indicates a wave that is partially stationary and partially travelling. Such waves can be decomposed into two linearly superpositional components (assuming the medium is linear) of a travelling wave component and a stationary wave component. A zero SWR indicates that the wave does not have a stationary component – it is purely a travelling wave.[9]
