The Court unanimously allowed then Attorney General Phill Kline to examine the abortion records of 90 women to investigate possible crimes.[16] It later denied Kline from pursuing 30 misdemeanor criminal charges against Dr. George Tiller after he lost office.[17] The case was a major issue in the 2006 defeat of Kline by former prosecutor and former Attorney General Paul J. Morrison whose investigation found no crimes.[18]
