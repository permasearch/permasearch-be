Abby dates Dr. Kova훾, Dr. Carter and Jake, a medical student, but eventually returns to Kova훾, with whom she has a son. They later marry. She befriends many colleagues in the ER throughout the series, particularly female co-workers such as Carol Hathaway and Susan Lewis, and later Elizabeth Corday and Kerry Weaver. Her closest friend is Dr. Neela Rasgotra, who graduates medical school with her and lives with her during some of Neela's hard times. As Carter is phased out of the show and Weaver departs midway through Season 13, Abby and Luka Kova훾 are the senior figures on the show until their departure in 2009.
