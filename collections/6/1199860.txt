In Australia, a predominantly secular country, Muslims are able to practise their religion with great freedom. Most large companies[citation needed] allow for special religious holidays allowing Muslims to take a day off for Eid al-Fitr. Areas where there are large (but not necessarily majority) Muslim populations have overflowing attendances at the mosque for the Eid al-Fitr prayer. Police frequently block off roads and divert traffic to cater for the prayer and subsequent festivities. Eid prayers are also held in open areas (playground, stadium) in some places.
