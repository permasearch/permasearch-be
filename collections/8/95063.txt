There are many references to 99s in British and Irish pop culture. The pop-electronica duo The KLF used ice-cream van iconography and included the phrase "Make mine a 99" in their 1991 single version of "Justified and Ancient". The 2006 episode of New Tricks titled "Ice Cream Wars" saw the team's attempt to buy 99s turn into an investigation,[4] and DI Alec Hardy eats a ninety-nine in the first episode of the British drama Broadchurch.[citation needed]
