The two detectives who search for Finn (who is the right choice) on behalf of Aubrey Taverner. They are greedy, hoping only for money in exchange for their work, and are clumsy and unkind in their attempts to discover the boy. Two unwittingly comedic individuals, Mr Trapwood being harsh and tall and Mr Low being short with a high pitched tone, they wear only black suits despite the weather. Whilst being lead astray from their mission by residents of Manaus and the Amazonian natives (all of whom despise them, being friends of Bernard and Finn Taverner), they befall a series of comedic misfortunes. Their racism towards the natives is also their downfall, as they are mocked by the tribes, refuse to change out of British attire and therefore overheat, and are easily deceived by Finn's charade towards the end of the novel due to their irrational prejudices.
