Antonia repeats this act in Bon Temps four centuries later, after inhabiting Marnie's body inside Bill's compound.  She eventually becomes disheartened over the collateral damage done in her war against the vampires, however, and leaves Marnie's body.  But Marnie convinces Antonia to re-bond with her, for she wants to continue the war with Antonia as her source of power.  After Marnie kills a member of their coven, Antonia sees that Marnie has become evil and leaves her body; but Marnie puts a binding spell on her and draws her back in.  Antonia is finally freed from Marnie by Jesus, and all the spells she has performed have been broken.
