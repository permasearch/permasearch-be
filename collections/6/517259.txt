The Bay improved slightly in terms of the overall health of its ecosystem, earning a rating of 31 out of 100 in 2010, up from 28 in 2008.[3] An estimate in 2006 from a "blue ribbon panel" said cleanup costs would be $15 billion.[43] Compounding the problem is that 100,000 new residents move to the area each year.[43] A report in 2008 in the Washington Post suggested that government administrators had overstated progress on cleanup efforts as a way to "preserve the flow of federal and state money to the project."[60] In January 2011, there were reports that millions of fish had died, but officials suggested it was probably the result of extremely cold weather.[61]
