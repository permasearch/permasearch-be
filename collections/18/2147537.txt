The next redesign, in 1988, produced a longer-wheelbase option, 3,099 mm (122 in) rather than 2,616 mm (103 in) for the regular wheelbase. Its one-piece cargo-box walls eliminated the rust-prone seams that were found in earlier models. The V6 Xtracab SR5 earned Motor Trend magazine's Truck of the Year award that year. The Xtra Cabs now featured more room behind the front seats than the last generation which allowed optional jump-seats for rear passengers, a feature more in line with competitors of the time.
