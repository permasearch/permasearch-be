The 3rd Ward encompasses the majority of the Central Business District near the River. The Ward includes the city's seat of government, both the old 19th century City Hall on Lafayette Square and the new City Hall Complex on Loyola Avenue. Farther back from the Central Business District is the Tulane/Gravier neighborhood. At Tulane and Broad are the Courthouse and Orleans Parish Prison. Continuing back, the Ward includes a large section of the Mid City neighborhood. Due to the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, much of the 3rd ward area was damaged.
