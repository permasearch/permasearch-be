Hermann Cohen rejected Spinoza's idea that God can be found in nature, but agreed that God was not a personal being. Rather, he saw God as an ideal, an archetype of morality.[18] Not only can God not be identified with nature, but God is also incomparable to anything in the world.[18] This is because God is “One,” unique and unlike anything else.[18] One loves and worships God through living ethically and obeying His moral law: “love of God is love of morality.”[18]
