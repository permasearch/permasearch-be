BC Hydro via Powerex trades electricity eastward with Alberta and south to all of the western US through the Pacific-Intertie. In 2014 BC had the largest volume of electricity imports in Canada (9700 Mwh), from the Western Interconnection in the US which is 60% fossil fueled.[50][51] BC Hydro typically imports power during off-peak hours when thermal plants in the US and Alberta have excess power for sale, Then exports hydropower during peak hours when prices are higher.[52]
