Some of these areas are 'brownfield' that have been provided directly by the NBN Co, but many are new 'greenfield' areas that are new subdivisions that did not have an existing telephone.[113] All greenfield developments must provide fibre, at a cost to the developer (and thus home owner).[114] Most of the brown field areas are near existing exchanges, which presumably already had ADSL. It is still unknown if the existing brown fields developments will get direct fibre (FTTP) due to already having a telephone service and a basic ADSL internet connection. These premises may one day receive FTTN instead of FTTP via their existing copper services.
