The 1967 Mr. Olympia, won by Sergio Oliva, heralded a new era in bodybuilding competition. At 5 ft 10 ins and 240 lbs[2] Oliva, nicknamed "The Myth", displayed a level of muscle mass and definition, including a "V" shape of a large and a well-formed upper-body that tapered down to a narrow waist, unlike anything seen in prior competitions. His upper arms measured nearly 22 inches[citation needed] and his chest measured at 55 inches,[citation needed] which tapered down to a reportedly 28 inch[citation needed] waist and two 31 inch legs.[citation needed] Oliva would go on to win the Mr. Olympia competition in 1967, 1968, and 1969—where he would defeat Arnold Schwarzenegger four to three, marking Schwarzenegger's first and only loss in a Mr. Olympia competition.
