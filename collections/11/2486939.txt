Some investigations have found poor-quality ingredients in döner kebab meat, or meat types other than what was advertised.[69][70] Food safety regulations in most countries address the dangers of bacteria in undercooked meat of all kinds, sold to the public. Some have guidelines specific to döner kebab handling and preparation. Following several outbreaks of E. coli food poisoning, the Canadian government in 2008 introduced a number of recommendations, including that the meat should be cooked a second time, after being sliced from the rotisserie.[71] In Germany, any döner kebab meat placed onto the rotisserie must be sold the same day. It is a violation of health regulations to freeze any meat for sale at a later date. [72] There were also a number of "Gammelfleisch" scandals, particularly in Autumn 2005, relating to spoiled and expired döner meat being sold.[73]
