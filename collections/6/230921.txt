Olympe de Gouges was a French playwright and political activist whose feminist and abolitionist writings reached large audiences. She began her career as a playwright in the early 1780s, and as the political tensions of the French Revolution built, she became more involved in politics and law. Personally, de Gouges was born to a petit bourgeois family – she believed she was an illegitimate daughter, and her supposed biological father’s rejections of such claims might have influenced her later passionate defense of the rights of illegitimate children.
