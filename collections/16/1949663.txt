In the first half of 2009, an estimated 631 recorded acts of antisemitism took place in France, more than the whole of 2008.[93] Speaking to the World Jewish Congress in December 2009, the French Interior Minister Hortefeux described the acts of antisemitism as "a poison to our republic". He also announced that he would appoint a special coordinator for fighting racism and antisemitism.[94]
