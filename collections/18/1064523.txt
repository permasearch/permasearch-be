This theme of friendship is explored when Sal abandons his friendship with Miranda after Marcus hits him. Elli Housden of The Courier-Mail found that Miranda is forced to deal with the fact that Sal seemingly abandons their friendship and ignores her for no apparent reason.[16] Scattergood considered the novel an "ordinary friendship story" with Sal ignoring Miranda to find other friends.[9] Julie Long from Reading Time noted how the incident forces Miranda to find new friends and become more active in school, where she starts learning the dynamics of that environment.[17]
