Shortly after being promoted to a full warrior (he was named "Graystripe" because there is a gray stripe running down his back that is darker than the rest of his gray fur), Graystripe falls in love with a RiverClan she-cat, Silverstream, after she saves him from drowning, and starts to sneak out of camp to meet her. His friendship with Fireheart is strained due to Fireheart's need to cover for him while he is away, which included mentoring Graystripe's apprentice Brackenpaw in his place, and for a short time the two quarrel with each other. Eventually Graystripe is able to settle his issues with Fireheart, and their friendship continues. Graystripe eventually leaves ThunderClan to live in RiverClan after Silverstream dies, but returns when Bluestar leads dogs that Tigerstar set on the clan off the gorge.[12] In the end of the original series, he becomes ThunderClan's deputy, due to Whitestorm's death,[10] but is replaced by Brambleclaw when he was captured in Dawn.[13]
