Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four and described it as "a whimsical comedy [that depends] on the warmth of Segel and Sarandon, the discontent of Helms and Greer, and still more warmth that enters at midpoint with Carol (Rae Dawn Chong), Sarandon's co-worker at the office." He concluded that "it's not a Feel Good Movie, more of a Feel Sorta Good Movie."[9] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also gave the film three stars out of four and described it as "funny, touching, and vital", praising the Duplass brothers by saying that "their films hit you where you live."[10]
