The album boasts relatively high production values and ornate arrangements compared to other early-1990s alternative albums. Vig said, "Billy wanted to make a record that people would put on and say, 'What the fuck was that?' [...] We wanted to have things going on in the left ear and right ear all the time".[13] One of Corgan's main goals was to create a sense of sonic depth, but, as Corgan said, "without necessarily using delays or reverbsâ€”to use tonalities instead."[20] For the album, the guitars were layered multiple times. Corgan has stated that "Soma" alone contains up to 40 overdubbed guitar parts.[21] Vig stated that as many as 100 guitar parts were compressed into a single song.[13] Rolling Stone noted that the album was "closer to progressive rock than to punk or grunge."[22]
