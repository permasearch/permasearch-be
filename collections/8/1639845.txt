Many of the arguments used are outlined in Paul Moon's book Te Ara Ki Te Tiriti: The Path to the Treaty of Waitangi (2003), which argued that not only did the M훮ori signatories have no intention of transferring sovereignty, but that at the time the British government and James Busby did not wish to acquire it and that the developments and justifications leading to the present state were later developments.[19] It is estimated that the hearings will last between 4 and 6 years, and may stand as a precedent for all iwi if the Tribunal recognises Ng훮puhi sovereignty. A common Ng훮puhi interpretation of the Declaration of the United Tribes is that the British government was simply recognising M훮ori independence and putting the world on notice, merely re-asserting sovereignty that had existed "from time immemorial".[20]
