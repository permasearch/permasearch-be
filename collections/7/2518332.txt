The middle of the 18th century produced a slew of northern writers, who would ultimately shape the interaction between Catholic Germany that had resisted Luther's linguistic influence and the rest of the German-speaking world, which directed the path that language development would take. The South did not have any literary geniuses to combat the sudden emergence in the North and so the most influential literary minds of two generations all happened to speak Lutheran-influenced dialects. In 1871, after centuries of highly-variable spelling and punctuation, a conference was called to finally create a semblance of uniformity within German spelling, enforced by the publication of a Bavarian dictionary in 1879 and a Prussian one in 1880.
