The original story concept was written by Hashino, while the scenario was co-written by Shinji Yamamoto and Yuichiro Tanaka.[32][35] The initial concept was for a storyline that diverged from the established paths of Persona 3 and Persona 4, with "self-discovery" and "journey" being its keywords.[29] Originally using the frame story of a backpacking trip around the world, Hashino decided to refocus on Japan in the wake of the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami.[26] Following that, and seeing the way people were bonding in the face of the crisis, Hashino decided to have the story take place solely in Japan, with the journeying being through the ever-shifting Palace.[29] According to Hashino, the central theme of the game is freedom and how the characters attain it.[36] He wanted to make the game more "thematically approachable" for newcomers to the series, and to be an emotional experience that presents players with a mix of emotions that leaves its audience with a strong sense of catharsis and the inspiration to take on their own modern-day problems.[36][37]
