From 1887 to 1945, Hanoi was home to another copy of the statue. Measuring 2.85 m (9 ft 4 in) tall, it was erected by the French colonial government after being sent from France for an exhibition. It was known to locals unaware of its history as Tượng Bà đầm xòe (Statue of the madame saux). When the French lost control of French Indochina during World War II, the statue was toppled on August 1, 1945, after being deemed a vestige of the colonial government along with other statues erected by the French.[68]
