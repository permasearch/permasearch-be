After Dante's mission, the character is resurrected in an ascension ceremony (during which a human receives the essence of a demon) and continues as leader of the Order. He orders Credo (captain of the Holy Knights) to arrest Nero after Agnus (an alchemist working for the Order) tells Sanctus that he has demonic power. When Credo cannot do this, Agnus kidnaps Kyrie (Nero's childhood sweetheart); Nero tries to rescue her after defeating Agnus, but Sanctus intervenes and leaves with her. He uses Kyrie as building material for the Savior, a demonic structure which has been collecting demonic energy for centuries. When Nero confronts him Sanctus defeats him, telling him that he originally intended to use Dante for the Savior's core. Using the Savior's strength, Nero is absorbed into it and Sanctus uses Yamato to open the gates of hell. When demons attack residents of Fortuna he controls the Savior and some of the Order's Angels, ordering them to exterminate the demons and announcing the arrival of the Savior. Sanctus merges with the structure, and does not reappear until (through Dante's efforts) Nero is released and fights him. Nero defeats him, and he is absorbed into the Savior's core; the structure is his body until Nero destroys him with the Devil Bringer. The character is voiced by Liam O'Brien in English, and Ikuya Sawaki in Japanese version of Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition.
