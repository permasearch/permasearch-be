The religious practices, social customs and cultural standards of the Americo-Liberians had their roots in the antebellum American South. The settlers wore top hat and tails and modeled their homes on those of Southern slaveowners.[138] Most Americo-Liberian men were members of the Masonic Order of Liberia, which became heavily involved in the nation's politics.[139]
