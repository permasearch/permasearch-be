Confused and consumed with guilt for lying to her parents about her true relationship with Taylor, Jane seeks advice from her mother's gay friend Jimmy (RuPaul) and comes out to him. Jimmy explains that it will get easier and that when the time is right, she'll tell her parents the truth. Eventually the harassment and name calling gets too much for Jane at school and, during dinner, Jane says how she wants to see Taylor only for her younger brother to call Taylor a dyke. Snapping, Jane attacks him by pulling him across the dining room table and hitting him. When her parents yell at her and say that she should rise above gossip, Jane confesses that it's not just gossip and comes out to her parents as a lesbian.
