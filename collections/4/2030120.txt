Prince wrote "Manic Monday" in 1984, and recorded it as a duet for the band Apollonia 6's self-titled album; however, he eventually pulled the song.[4] Two years later, he offered the single to The Bangles under the pseudonym "Christopher",[5][6] a character he played in the 1986 film Under the Cherry Moon.[7] It was rumored by various writers that after Prince listened to the band's 1984 debut album All Over the Place, he gave the song to Bangles rhythm guitarist Susanna Hoffs, so that in return she would sleep with him.[8][9][10]
