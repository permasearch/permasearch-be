The modern cowboy hat has remained basically unchanged in construction and underlying design since the Stetson creation.[1] The cowboy hat quickly developed the capability, even in the early years, to identify its wearer as someone associated with the West.[20] "Within a decade the name "John B. Stetson" became synonymous with the word "hat" in every corner and culture west of the Mississippi."[21] The shape of the hat's crown and brim were often modified by the wearer for fashion and to protect against weather by being softened in hot steam, shaped, and allowed to dry and cool. Felt tends to stay in the shape that it dries.[22] Because of the ease of personalization, it was often possible to tell where a cowboy hat was from, right down to which ranch, simply by looking at the crease in the crown.[16]
