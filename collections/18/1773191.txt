Firaxis published additional titles by Meier, the first being Sid Meier's Gettysburg! (1997). Lacking the rights to the Civilization name, they subsequently produced Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, a "space-based Civilization-style game"[7] released in 1999 and published by Electronic Arts.[8] Alpha Centauri uses a game engine similar to the one used in Civilization II[9] and its storyline continues from where the Civilization franchise ends, namely the colonization of a planet in Alpha Centauri.
