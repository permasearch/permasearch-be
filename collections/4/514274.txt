Although travellers within the Schengen Area are no longer required to show documents at an internal border (although there have been some controversial instances when they have), the laws of most countries still require them to carry identity documents.[103] Thus, foreigners with a valid residence permit in a Schengen State and carrying valid documents can travel within the territory and do not need any special permission to do so. It is the obligation of everyone travelling within the area to be able to show a fully valid form of personal identification approved by other Schengen states.[104][105]
