In 1494, Pico and his friend Angelo Poliziano were poisoned, under mysterious circumstances.[14] It was rumored that his own secretary had poisoned him, because Pico had become too close to Savonarola.[12] He was interred together with Girolamo Benivieni at San Marco and Savonarola delivered the funeral oration. Ficino wrote: "Our dear Pico left us on the same day that Charles VIII was entering Florence, and the tears of men of letters compensated for the joy of the people. Without the light brought by the king of France, Florence might perhaps have never seen a more somber day than that which extinguished Mirandola's light."[12]
