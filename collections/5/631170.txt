In 2003, Stein Mart introduced the "Real Shopper" campaign with support from Orlando-based advertising agency, Fry Hammond Barr. This multimedia advertising campaign features real Stein Mart shoppers chosen via casting calls held throughout the country.[10] As part of the casting call, Stein Mart looks for loyal female customers to share their stories about why they enjoy being a Stein Mart shopper. Each season six to eight female shoppers are chosen to appear in the campaign and are featured in Stein Mart's Sisterhood book online. On April 7, 2005, The Women of Studio Arena Theatre sponsored a luncheon and fashion show in Transit Valley Country Club, and fashions was shown by Stein Mart.[11]
