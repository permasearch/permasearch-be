For its slender body, the black mamba is deceptively powerful; it is the fastest moving snake indigenous to Africa, and perhaps the fastest anywhere.[29][30][31] It does however, move rather clumsily over soft sand, a surface to which it is not adapted.[32] There have been many unrealistic stories concerning the black mamba's speed,[33] perhaps partly because the slender body exaggerates the impression of speed.[34] These stories include the myth that it can outrun a galloping horse or a running human. On 23 April 1906, on the Serengeti Plains, an intentionally provoked black mamba was recorded at a speed of 11 km/h (6.8 mph), over a distance of 43 m (141 ft).[35][36][37] A black mamba would almost certainly not be able to exceed 16 km/h (9.9 mph),[33] and like most reptiles it can maintain such relatively high speeds only for short distances.[34]
