Disraeli spoke in favour of the measure, arguing that Christianity was "completed Judaism", and asking the House of Commons "Where is your Christianity if you do not believe in their Judaism?"[107] Russell, and Disraeli's future rival Gladstone, thought it brave of him to speak as he did;[108] the speech was badly received by his own party. The Tories and the Anglican establishment were hostile to the bill.[n 16] Samuel Wilberforce, Bishop of Oxford, spoke strongly against the measure, and implied that Russell was paying off the Jews for helping elect him.[109] With the exception of Disraeli, every member of the future protectionist cabinet then in Parliament voted against the measure. One who was not yet an MP, Lord John Manners, stood against Rothschild when the latter re-submitted himself for election in 1849. Disraeli, who had attended the protectionists' dinner at the Merchant Taylors' Hall, joined Bentinck in speaking and voting for the bill, although his own speech was a standard one of toleration. The measure was voted down.[110]
