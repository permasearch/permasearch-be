Saltalamacchia was traded to the Boston Red Sox just before the Major League Baseball trading deadline on July 31, 2010. The Rangers received minor league prospects Chris McGuiness, Román Méndez, a player to be named later (Michael Thomas), and cash. He reported to the Pawtucket Red Sox of the Class AAA International League.[13][14] Saltalamacchia was called up on August 11 after Kevin Cash went on the disabled list needing surgery in his left thumb, in September 2010.[15][16]
