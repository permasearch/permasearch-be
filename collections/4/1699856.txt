Ash, along with Brock, travel to Sinnoh, befriends a new traveling companion, Dawn, and also finds a brutal new rival in Paul; and through their journey they encounter and defeat Cyrus and his Team Galactic. Ash wins all 8 Sinnoh gym badges, and competes in the Sinnoh conference at the Lily of the Valley Island. He eventually faces Paul in the quarter-finals of the Sinnoh League Festival and finally defeats him, marking the first time Ash has ever made it into the semi-finals in a Pokémon League. Afterwards, however, Ash is matched against Tobias, a trainer who famously swept all eight Sinnoh League gyms and all other opponents with only his legendary Pokémon Darkrai. Ash is eventually defeated by Tobias, but not without having defeated his Darkrai, as well as his Latios, which is also a legendary Pokémon, whom Ash also defeated in a draw with his final Pokémon, making Ash the only known trainer to have defeated two of Tobias' legendary Pokémon, something that not even Tobias' opponent in the finals could achieve. Ash concludes his participation in the Sinnoh League with an impressive new ranking. He bids farewell with Dawn in Twinleaf Town, and parts ways with Brock for the last time.
