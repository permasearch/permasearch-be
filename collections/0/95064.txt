The Flake chocolate bar manufactured and marketed by Cadburys itself was first developed in the UK in 1920.[5] An employee of Cadbury's noted that when the excess from the moulds used to create other chocolate bars was drained off, it fell off in a stream and created folded chocolate with flaking properties.[5] In 1930, Cadbury started producing a smaller version of the standard Flake bar especially for ice cream cones.[2] These were marketed under the name 99 Flake and sold loose in boxes rather than individually wrapped like the traditional Flake.
