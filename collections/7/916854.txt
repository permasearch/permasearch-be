The contestant was presented with one small prize and was then shown three pairs of additional prizes. By choosing one prize from each pair in the order they were presented, the contestant attempted to "trade up" from that initial prize and create a sequence of four prizes in ascending order of price. If the contestant successfully traded up with all three choices, he or she won both the last small prize chosen and a larger prize package. If not, the contestant won only the first small prize chosen that was lower in price than the one before it.
