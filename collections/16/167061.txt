As the Northern Ireland Assembly was reduced in size and a number of departments removed it is not currently (March 2017) clear who holds political responsibility for Sport in Northern Ireland. However virtually every team sport is organised on either an all Ireland or United Kingdom-wide basis, with football and netball being the only exceptions. As such responsibility for most sports lies with either the United Kingdom minister or the Irish minister for Transport, Tourism & Sport.
