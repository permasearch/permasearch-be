The effects of the fathers age on offspring are not yet well understood and are studied far less extensively than the effects of the mother's age.[74] Fathers contribute proportionally more DNA mutations to their offspring via their germ cells than the mother, with the paternal age governing how many mutations are passed on. This is because, as humans age, male germ cells acquire mutations at a much faster rate than female germ cells.[58][31][28]
