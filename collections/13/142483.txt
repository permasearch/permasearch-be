In "Michael's Last Dundies", Erin starts avoiding Gabe at work because she does not feel attracted to him anymore.  Erin reveals how she feels to Pam and Jim, with Pam encouraging her to tell Gabe to avoid leading him on.  She then breaks up with Gabe while accepting her Dundie in front of everyone at a packed restaurant.  Gabe tells everyone he is upset with Erin but tries to joke it off, only to reveal he is genuinely upset and leaves the award show.  Later she joins the rest of the office in serenading a teary-eyed Michael with a song.
