"Run the World" is an electropop[26] and R&B song.[27] Jocelyn Vena of MTV News described the song as a "club banger"[28] and "female empowerment/girl power type of song",[29] like several of Beyoncé's previous singles, including "Independent Women" (2000)—with Destiny's Child—and "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" (2008).[30][31] Shea Taylor said that the track draws more from pop music than R&B, and is reminiscent of Michael Jackson's prime work.[32] "Run the World (Girls)" also incorporates dancehall influences[33] in the tradition of "Get Me Bodied" (2007).[34] The "high energy" song contains elements of go-go,[35] and is set to a marching militaristic drumbeat sampled from the club song "Pon de Floor" by Major Lazer and Vybz Kartel.[6][25][36][37] "Run the World" also consists of heavy synth pangs[25] and African and marching percussion.[38]
