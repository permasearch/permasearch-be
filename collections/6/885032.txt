Another haloed Apollo in mosaic, from Hadrumentum, is in the museum at Sousse.[204] The conventions of this representation, head tilted, lips slightly parted, large-eyed, curling hair cut in locks grazing the neck, were developed in the 3rd century BCE to depict Alexander the Great.[205] Some time after this mosaic was executed, the earliest depictions of Christ would also be beardless and haloed.
