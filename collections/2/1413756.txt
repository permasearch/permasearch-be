During Prohibition in the United States the relative ease of illegal gin manufacture led to the martini's rise as the predominant cocktail of the mid-20th century there. With the repeal of Prohibition, and the ready availability of quality gin, the drink became progressively drier. In the 1970s and '80s, the martini came to be seen as old-fashioned and was replaced by more intricate cocktails and wine spritzers, but the mid-1990s saw a resurgence in the drink and numerous new versions.[16]
