The 12-member ATP Player Council delivers advisory decisions to the Board of Directors, which has the power to accept or reject the Council's suggestions. The Council consists of four players who are ranked within the top 50 in singles (Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic - President, Gilles Simon, and Kevin Anderson - Vice-President), two players who are ranked between 51 and 100 in singles (Yen-Hsun Lu and Rajeev Ram), two top 100 players in doubles (Jamie Murray and Bruno Soares), two at-large members (Marcelo Melo and Sergiy Stakhovsky), one alumni member (Colin Dowdeswell) and one coach (Claudio Pistolesi).[23][24]
