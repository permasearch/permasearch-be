While the use of animation in lieu of photography lends a degree of abstraction to the idea of concessions, in America's Film Legacy, Daniel Eagan argues that "[w]ith its simple, repetitive lyrics and streamlined animation, Let's All Go to the Lobby has a hypnotic pull that is as compelling today as it was fifty years ago."[3] He also notes that by choosing not to simply photograph the offered items, the creators of the film managed to avoid using brand names for the products for sale.[3]
