Garrett is first seen in "Muted" during lacrosse practice and is put on the lacrosse team. In "The Benefactor" he, Mason and Violet attend the party at Lydia's lake house with the other freshmen. Garret pays for the beer keg that was delivered to the party by the distributor named DeMarco Montana. It's revealed Garrett had ordered the beer keg to lure DeMarco, who was a werewolf, to the party, so Violet could kill him. Both he and Violet are working for 'the Benefactor' by assassinating supernaturals in Beacon Hills, as seen when he and Violet learn they've received the money in their account for the assassination by a text sent by 'the Benefactor' and they kiss. Garrett and Violet assassinate another werewolf on the Dead Pool in "I.E.D.", Carrie Hudson, with Garrett delivering the killing blow with his blade. Garrett tries to talk Violet out of going after Scott reasoning that Scott came out on top when the Alpha Pack went after him. He reasons their target, Beta werewolf Brett Talbot was worth a lot of money as well.
