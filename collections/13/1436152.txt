In the early 1980s he also began composing for ballet and theatre stage plays.[44] In 1983 Vangelis wrote the music for Michael Cacoyannis' staging of the Greek tragedy Elektra which was performed with Irene Papas at the open-air amphitheater at Epidavros in Greece.[44] The same year Vangelis composed his first score for a ballet by Wayne Eagling. It was originally performed by Lesley Colier and Wayne Eagling himself at an Amnesty International gala in Drury Lane,[44] but in 1984 the Royal Ballet School presented it again at the Sadler's Wells theatre. In 1985 and 1986, Vangelis wrote music for two more ballets: "Frankenstein – Modern Prometheus"[28] and "The Beauty and the Beast".[30] In 1992, Vangelis wrote the music for the Euripides play, Medea, that featured Irene Papas.[45][47] In 2001 composed for the third play which starred Papas, and for The Tempest by Hungarian director György Schwajdas.[48]
