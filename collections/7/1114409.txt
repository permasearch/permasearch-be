The story cuts to things from the Doctor's perspective. He and Donna arrive in the 51st century at a planet-sized book repository simply called The Library. The Doctor is responding to a summons from his psychic paper, but upon arrival they find the library curiously empty. The Doctor searches a nearby computer for information and is told that Donna and the Doctor are the only humans in the library but trillions of non-human life signs are present in the library.
