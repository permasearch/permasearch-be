Reprint series of public domain fiction (and sometimes nonfiction) books appeared as early as the 18th century, with the series Poets of Great Britain Complete from Chaucer to Churchill (founded by British publisher John Bell in 1777).[1] Later British reprint series were to include the Routledge's Railway Library (George Routledge, 1848â€“99), the Oxford World's Classics (Oxford University Press, 1901- ), the Everyman's Library (J. M. Dent, 1906- ), the Penguin Classics (Penguin Books, 1945- ) and the Penguin English Library (1963- ).
