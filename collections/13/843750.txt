On 24 June, an agreement was reached between Formula One's governing body and the teams to prevent a breakaway series. It was agreed teams must cut spending to the level of the early 1990s within two years; exact figures were not specified,[40] and Max Mosley agreed he would not stand for re-election to the FIA presidency in October.[41] Following further disagreements after Max Mosley suggested he would stand for re-election,[42] FOTA made it clear that breakaway plans were still being pursued. On 8 July, FOTA issued a press release stating they had been informed they were not entered for the 2010 season,[43] and an FIA press release said the FOTA representatives had walked out of the meeting.[44] On 1 August, it was announced FIA and FOTA had signed a new Concorde Agreement, bringing an end to the crisis and securing the sport's future until 2012.[45]
