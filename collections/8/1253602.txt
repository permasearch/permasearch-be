January 23, 1996 in Las Vegas (Caesars Palace)[41] Lord Steven Regal injured his knee during the opening dark match against Chris Benoit. Benoit bled from the eye after receiving several headbutts. The show included the wedding of Col. Robert Parker and Sister Sherri, which was interrupted by Madusa, who was revealed to have been seeing Parker on the side. Brian Pillman, during his match with Eddy Guerrero, grabbed ringside commentator Bobby Heenan's jacket neck from behind, causing Heenan to yell "What the fuck are you doing?". Heenan later apologized for his outburst. Disco Inferno forfeited his match to perform at Parker & Sherri's wedding. This was revealed by an Elvis Impersonator (Mike Winner) who Sullivan attacked. The Road Warriors returned at this event and challenged WCW Tag Team Champions Sting and Lex Luger, with Sting agreeing to a match despite Luger being reluctant. Debra McMichael, Linda Bollea, Woman, Elizabeth, and several other women initially came to the ring with Hogan & Savage. It was reported that Ric Flair, who lost the WCW World Title to Savage one day prior, threatened to quit WCW unless the finish to the main event (Hogan pinning Flair with the legdrop) was changed. At the event, Flair pinned Savage after use of a foreign object. Live reports claim 75% of the crowd left during the dark match that closed the show.
