On October 4, the United States prepared the aircraft carrier, the hospital ship USNS Comfort—which previously aided thousands in the wake of the 2010 Haiti earthquake—and the transport dock for relief operations in Haiti. USS Mesa Verde and USS George Washington were later relieved by USS Iwo Jima, along with the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit. United States Southern Command also deployed 100 troops with 9 helicopters to the Cayman Islands to prepare for relief work.[154] Initial estimates indicated at least 350,000 people were in need of assistance.[92]
