The period also witnessed a number of rebellions starting with the 1806 Vellore Mutiny.[23] The rebellion of Velu Thambi and Paliath Achan and the Poligar Wars were other notable insurrections against the British rule, but the Madras Presidency remained relatively undisturbed by the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857.[24]
