Turbidity currents are often triggered by tectonic disturbances of the sea floor. The displacement of continental crust in the form of fluidization and physical shaking both contribute to their formation. Earthquakes have been linked to turbidity current deposition in many settings, particularly where physiography favors preservation of the deposits and limits the other sources of turbidity current deposition.[7][8] Since the famous case of breakage of submarine cables by a turbidity current following the 1929 Grand Banks earthquake,[9] earthquake triggered turbidites have been investigated and verified along the Cascadia subduction Zone,[10] the Northern San Andreas Fault,[11] a number of European, Chilean and North American lakes,[12][13][14] Japanese lacustrine and offshore regions[15][16] and a variety of other settings.[17][18]
