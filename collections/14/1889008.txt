In the Parable of the Ten Virgins, Jesus tells a story about a party of virgins, perhaps bridesmaids [3] or torchbearers for a procession,[4] chosen to participate in a wedding. Each of the ten virgins is carrying a lamp or torch[4] as they await the coming of the bridegroom, which they expect at some time during the night. Five of the virgins are wise and have brought oil for their lamps. Five are foolish and have only brought their lamps.
