This series was a continuance of volume 1, with the creative team of Howard Mackie and John Romita Jr. having migrated to the new series.[11] In June 2001, Marvel began a dual numbering system on all its titles that had been relaunched and renumbered. The first issue of Peter Parker: Spider-Man to be dual-numbered was listed as both #30 and #128 on the cover â€“ the second figure achieved by adding the total of issues of the new volume (30) to the first volume's 98. The comic's legal indicia, printed on the title page, still listed the series as vol. 2 #30.
