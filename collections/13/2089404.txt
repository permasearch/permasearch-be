"While culinary historians debate its exact lineage, most agree eggnog originated from the early medieval" British drink called posset,[15] which was made with hot milk[9] that was curdled with wine or ale and flavoured with spices. In the Middle Ages, posset was used as a cold and flu remedy. Posset was popular from medieval times to the 19th century. Eggs were added to some posset recipes; according to Time magazine, by the "...13th century, monks were known to drink a posset with eggs and figs."[15] A 17th century recipe for "My Lord of Carlisleâ€™s Sack-Posset" uses a heated mixture of cream, whole cinnamon, mace, nutmeg, eighteen egg yolks, eight egg whites, and one pint of Sack wine (a fortified white wine related to sherry). At the end, sugar, ambergris and animal musk are stirred in.[16] Posset was traditionally served in two-handled pots. The aristocracy had costly posset pots made from silver.
