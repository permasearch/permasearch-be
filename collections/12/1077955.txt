Changers were in a period when the mean hard drive capacity was measured in hundreds of megabytes. After exponential growth of hard drive storage density, a single inexpensive hard disk drive has many times the capacity of a CD, and changers have fallen out of use. Even flash memory can hold as many as more than 10 ISO images of CDs, and even as many as 5 ISO images of DVDs can be stored onto larger thumb drives.
