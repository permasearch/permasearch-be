While at the Krusty Krab, the two superheroes of Bikini Bottom, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, argue because Barnacle Boy feels he should not be considered a child sidekick anymore. He wants to be called "Barnacle Man" and everyone laughs at his protests so he decides to team up with Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble. They cause chaos all over Bikini Bottom that alarms Mermaid Man. It stimulates him to call a league of heroes to stop Barnacle Boy.
