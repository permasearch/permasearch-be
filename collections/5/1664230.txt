The choice of optimality criteria is difficult as there are multiple objectives in a feature selection task. Many common ones incorporate a measure of accuracy, penalised by the number of features selected (e.g. the Bayesian information criterion). The oldest are Mallows's Cp statistic and Akaike information criterion (AIC). These add variables if the t-statistic is bigger than       2     {\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}}  .
