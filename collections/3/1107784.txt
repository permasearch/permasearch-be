Internal disputes meant Argentina's squad for the tournament did not contain a single member of the team which had reached the final in 1930.[23] Against Sweden in Bologna, Argentina twice took the lead, but two goals by Sven Jonasson and a winner by Knut Kroon gave Sweden a 3–2 victory.[24] Fellow South Americans Brazil also suffered an early exit. Spain beat them comfortably; 3–1 the final score.[25]
