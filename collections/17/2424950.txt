A relatively new class called multilevel inverters has gained widespread interest. Normal operation of CSIs and VSIs can be classified as two-level inverters because the power switches connect to either the positive or the negative DC bus.[5] If more than two voltage levels were available to the inverter output terminals, the AC output could better approximate a sine wave.[4] For this reason multilevel inverters, although more complex and costly, offer higher performance.[5] A three-level neutral-clamped inverter is shown in Figure 10.
