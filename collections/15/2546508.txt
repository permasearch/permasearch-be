On Day 82, the evicted HouseGuests returned to choose whether Nicole or Will should win the series. Nicole and Will learned that they could each nullify one HouseGuests vote for the winner; Nicole chose to void Shannon's vote, while Will reluctantly chose to void Bunky's vote - he was so confident that he felt he didn't need to nullify a vote at all but the producers required that he do so (while it was surprising that Will voided Bunky's vote instead of Hardy to many viewers, Will said that Bunky was a sincere player and his disgust with Will's tactics and previous statement that he would never vote to give Will the winner's money meant that he was the right person to remove from Nicole's vote side). Both Nicole and Will guessed correctly and were able to take a vote for each other out of the final tally.[100] Nicole emphasized how evil Will was to an increasingly unimpressed jury that took pains to point out that she always cried about how awful it was to vote people out yet directly ended several of their games because she wanted to win (Monica followed up on an earlier interview where she'd said Nicole's claims of "love" for other players were selfish and aimed at boosting her own ego), while Will reminded the jury how charismatic he was through his eloquent final speech. Dr. Will was crowned the winner of the series in a five to two vote.[167][168][169]
