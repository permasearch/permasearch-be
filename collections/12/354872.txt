A man does not need grounds to divorce his wife in Islam. To divorce, he can simply invoke Talaq and part with the dower he gave her before marriage; or, he can invoke Lian doctrine in case of adultery, by bringing four witnesses who saw the wife committing adultery (which is almost impossible) or by self-certify and swear by Allah four times, and Sharia requires the court to grant divorce requested by the man.[3][14]
