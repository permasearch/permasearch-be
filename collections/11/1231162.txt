The basic document needed to establish a person's identity and citizenship in order to obtain a passport is a birth certificate. These are issued by either the US state of birth or by the US Department of State for overseas births to US citizens. A child born in the US is in nearly all cases (except for children of foreign diplomats) automatically a US citizen. A child born overseas to US citizens must have the birth registered with the corresponding US embassy/consulate to obtain citizenship at birth, or they will need to apply for recognition of their citizenship at a later date.
