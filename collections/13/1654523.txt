Maria C. Avila Arcos reviews the book in Science magazine, arguing that "troubling traces of biocolonialism undermine an otherwise eloquent synthesis of ancient genome research."[12] She calls Reich's account graceful, combining his personal opinions with "hard science"[12] (Reich's phrase). She accepts that the book is "scientifically solid and comprehensive",[12]  but argues that it "raises some concerns",[12]  since in her view Reich overlooks the conflict of interest between the needs of researchers to gather ancient human DNA specimens and the rights of the often marginalised populations that descend from those ancestors.[12]
