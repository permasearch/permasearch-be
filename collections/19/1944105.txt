The administrative court system is made up of two tiers: The Administrative Courts of First Instance and the Supreme Administrative Court. The court system was first created in 1997. The court's main jurisdiction is to settle litigation between the state or an organ of state (government ministries, departments and independent agencies) and private citizens.
