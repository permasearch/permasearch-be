The number of Piranhas resided in the ice lakes of the waterpark, where they were pursed by flocks of Baptornis and scattered by other animals. The piranha, however, found potential prey in the form of Scrat that had fall in the lake. The piranhas bared their teeth and chased Scrat out of the water onto an ice floe, one leaping out of the water and biting him on the paw; this paw was holding his prized acorn. Angry that something had attempted to take his acorn. Scrat seized another piranha and used it to hit at others, fighting and kicking the fish away, stunning them all. As one attempted to edge back to the water, Scrat stomped on its side, forcing it to release an acorn that is held.
