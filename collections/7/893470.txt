The issue of how such a diverse range of nebular shapes can be produced is a debatable topic. It is theorised that interactions between material moving away from the star at different speeds gives rise to most observed shapes.[39] However, some astronomers postulate that close binary central stars might be responsible for the more complex and extreme planetary nebulae.[57] Several have been shown to exhibit strong magnetic fields,[58] and their interactions with ionized gas could explain some planetary nebulae shapes.[44]
