After the end of the war, in 1918, the Woolf's were given a year's notice by the landlord, who needed the house. In mid 1919, "in despair", they purchased "a very strange little house" for £300, the Round House in Pipe Passage, Lewes, a converted windmill.[233][234][237] No sooner had they bought the Round House, than Monk's House in nearby Rodmell, came up for auction, a weatherboarded house with oak beamed rooms, said to be 15th or 16th century. The Leonards favoured the latter because of its orchard and garden, and sold the Round House, to purchase Monk's House for £700.[242][170] Monk's House also lacked water and electricity, but came with an acre of garden, and had a view across the Ouse towards the hills of the South Downs. Leonard Woolf describes this view (and the amenities)[243] as being unchanged since the days of Chaucer.[244] From 1940 it became their permanent home after their London home was bombed, and Virginia continued to live there until her death. Meanwhile, Vanessa had also made Charleston her permanent home in 1936.[241] It was at Monk's House that she completed Between the Acts[245] in early 1941, followed by a further breakdown, resulting in her death on March 28, 1941, the novel being published posthumously later that year.[170]
