The word juventutem is Latin for "youth" and is taken from Psalm 42(43):4, as used in the opening prayers of the Traditional Mass, which the priest and altar server recite at the foot of the altar: Introibo ad altare Dei. Ad Deum qui laetificat juventutem meam. ("I will go in to the altar of God; to God, the joy of my youth.")[1] In the Catholic understanding, the term juventutem refers to the spiritual youth that comes from the grace of Jesus Christ.[1]
