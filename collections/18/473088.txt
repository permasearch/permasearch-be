The thirteenth-century Italian literary revolution helped set the stage for the Renaissance. Prior to the Renaissance, the Italian language was not the literary language in Italy.  It was only in the 13th century that Italian authors began writing in their native language rather than Latin, French, or Proven√ßal.  The 1250s saw a major change in Italian poetry as the Dolce Stil Novo (Sweet New Style, which emphasized Platonic rather than courtly love) came into its own, pioneered by poets like Guittone d'Arezzo and Guido Guinizelli.  Especially in poetry, major changes in Italian literature had been taking place decades before the Renaissance truly began.
