At the end of each year, the district must be provided with written documentation that the student has made academic progress. This could be through a letter from an educator holding a master's degree or higher in education who has evaluated the achievement of the student through the submission of a portfolio or through a report card or transcript from an accredited program (i.e., a community college or correspondence program employed as the primary curriculum). If these are not available, the use of some form of "nationally normed standardized achievement test" is required.[48] The scores attained must be at or above the twenty-third percentile. Some tests that may be used include the "Stanford Achievement Test, the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills (CTBS), the California Achievement Tests (CAT), the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS-TAP), Science Research Associates (SRA), or the Woodcock-Johnson Educational Battery."
