Ari's life without Dante revolves around learning to drive, lifting weights, running with Legs, trying to find information about his brother at the library, arguing with Gina and Susie, trying to run into Ileana at school, reading Dante's letters, having bad dreams, and working a part-time job at a burger joint called The Charcoaler. He writes this list down in his journal.[26]
