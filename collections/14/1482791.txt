Outcome is related to the extent and duration of lead exposure.[195] Effects of lead on the physiology of the kidneys and blood are generally reversible; its effects on the central nervous system are not.[54] While peripheral effects in adults often go away when lead exposure ceases, evidence suggests that most of lead's effects on a child's central nervous system are irreversible.[29] Children with lead poisoning may thus have adverse health, cognitive, and behavioral effects that follow them into adulthood.[101]
