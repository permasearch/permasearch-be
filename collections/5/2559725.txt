The theory of symbiogenesis (from Greek: σύν syn "together", βίος bios "life", and γένεσις genesis "origin, birth") was first outlined by the Russian botanist Konstantin Mereschkowski in his 1905 work, The nature and origins of chromatophores in the plant kingdom, and then elaborated in his 1910 The Theory of Two Plasms as the Basis of Symbiogenesis, a New Study of the Origins of Organisms.[2][3][4] Mereschkowski was familiar with work by botanist Andreas Schimper, who had observed in 1883 that the division of chloroplasts in green plants closely resembled that of free-living cyanobacteria, and who had himself tentatively proposed (in a footnote) that green plants had arisen from a symbiotic union of two organisms.[5] In 1918 the French scientist Paul Portier (fr) published Les Symbiotes in which he claimed that the mitochondria originated from a symbiosis process.[6][7] Ivan Wallin advocated the idea of an endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria in the 1920s.[8][9]
