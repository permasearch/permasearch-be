On one weekend in April and on every Sunday in October, Angola holds the Angola Prison Rodeo. On each occasion, thousands of visitors enter the prison complex.[84] Initiated with planning in 1964,[115] the rodeo held its first events in 1965.[143] Initially it was held for prisoner recreation, but attracted increasing crowds.
