The construction of large homes in hillside areas and unrestricted deforestation for residential purposes weakened the stability of nearby slopes and incurred significant adverse soil erosion.[8] Within a decade leading to the disaster, Sierra Leone cleared approximately 800,000 hectares of forest cover â€“ the country's civil war, fought between 1991 and 2002, is also a cause of deforestation. The nation's Environmental Protective Agency reported a reforesting mission in the region two weeks prior to the floods and mudslides which was ultimately unsuccessful.[9]
