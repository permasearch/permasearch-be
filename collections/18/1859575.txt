The Legend of Zelda: Original Sound Track is a soundtrack album by composer Koji Kondo, featuring the complete score to the 1998 Nintendo 64 video game The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. It was released in November 1998 through Nintendo of America (United States)[1] and on December 18, 1998 through Pony Canyon (Japan).[4] The 35-track U.S. edition, made available through Nintendo Power magazine, does not contain all of the tracks that are included on the 82-track Japanese release, but includes six hidden tracks not listed on the album's back cover. Furthermore, the U.S. edition omits most of the rudimentary sound effect/minor theme tracks, whilst many area-specific pieces are extended from their Japanese edition running times.
