Together they build a beacon that can be lit to signal to ships, but for a long time they see no sign of any ships. Later, however, Michael witnesses a junk and he consults Kensuke as to whether or not he should light the beacon. Kensuke recognises the ship as that of poachers, and he and Michael rush to gather all the orangutans into the cave to protect them from the threat that lies in the ship. They nearly succeed but cannot find one particular orang-utan, the one Kensuke calls Kikanbo. The ship arrives and they hear gunshots. When the ship leaves, they discover that some gibbon monkeys have been killed, but that Kikanbo had survived.
