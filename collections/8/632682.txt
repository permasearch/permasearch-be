The scandal spread rapidly through the national media, as did another damaging story about angry creditors of the $1.3 million debt Hart had incurred in his 1984 campaign.[49] Media questions about the affair came to dominate coverage of Hart's campaign,[50] but his staff believed that voters were not as interested in the topic as the media was.[49] Hart's staff believed that the media was filtering his message.[49] A Gallup Poll conducted that week for Newsweek (but published the following week) found that 55% of Democrats believed that Hart had been truthful, and 44% of them were unconcerned about the issue.[51] The polling of all voters was even more favorable to Hart. Nearly two-thirds (64 percent) of the U.S. respondents it surveyed thought the media treatment of Hart was "unfair", and 70% disapproved of covert surveillance by the media.[51] A little over half (53 percent) responded that marital infidelity had little to do with a president's ability to govern.[51] Time magazine had similar results: Of those polled 67% disapproved of the media writing about a candidate's sex life, and 60% stated that Hart's relationship with Rice was irrelevant to the presidency.[52] When queried about the matter, Cuomo remarked that there were "skeletons in everybody's closet."[53]
