The film originally received an "X" certificate in the UK, meaning the picture could only been seen by adults. At issue,  the scene of the creature being destroyed by a blowtorch was seen as animal cruelty. However, producer Samuel Z. Arkoff was able to convince the film board that the violence was against a otherworldly person, and not an animal, earning the film its passing certificate.[2] [6]
