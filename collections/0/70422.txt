The show opened with Chris Martin singing the opening chorus from "Yellow". He was then joined by the remaining band members of Coldplay to perform "Viva la Vida", "Paradise", and "Adventure of a Lifetime" with the Youth Orchestra Los Angeles conducted by Gustavo Dudamel and the University of California Marching Band. Bruno Mars, Mark Ronson, and a troupe of backing dancers (dressed in the style of Michael Jackson[7]) then performed "Uptown Funk". Beyoncé, also in a Jackson-inspired outfit and appearing with a set of backing dancers dressed as Black Panthers, then performed her new single "Formation" in a mass choreographed dance number before joining Mars onstage for a verse of "Uptown Funk". Coldplay played a snippet of "Clocks" during a video montage of past Super Bowl halftime and national anthem performances, including those by Bruce Springsteen, Missy Elliott, Katy Perry, The Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney, Stevie Wonder, Diana Ross, James Brown, Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, The Black Eyed Peas, U2, Prince, Beyoncé and Mars. The show concluded with the band performing "Fix You" and "Up&Up" with Beyoncé, Mars and everyone taking part in the show. At the end of the performance, the audience participated in a card-stunt creating a rainbow and the phrase, "Believe in love", the closing lyrics to Coldplay's A Head Full of Dreams.
