Off-screen, at this time, Dumas had been involved with Matt Hardy romantically, but began a relationship with Adam Copeland (Edge).[2][5] WWE then began to use the real-life issues between the three as an on-screen storyline.[5] In April, Hardy was released from WWE,[43] only to be rehired several months later.[44] Lita continued to act as Edge's valet, and Edge defeated Hardy at SummerSlam. On the October 3 episode of Raw, Edge, with the assistance of Lita, defeated Hardy in a ladder match, and Hardy was obligated to leave Raw as a stipulation of the match.[2] Edge defeated John Cena to win the WWE Championship on January 8 at New Year's Revolution.[45] [46][47]
