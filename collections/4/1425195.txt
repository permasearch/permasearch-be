Although medieval Birmingham was never incorporated as a self-governing entity independent of its manor,[52] the Borough – the built-up area – was governed separately from the Foreign – the open agricultural area to the west – from at least 1250.[94] The burgesses of the town elected the two bailiffs; the "commonalty of the town" is first recorded in 1296[88] and a pavage grant of 1318 was made out not to the Lord of the Manor but "to the bailiffs and good men of the town of Bermyngeham".[95] The town thus remained free of the restrictive trade guilds of fully chartered boroughs, but was free also from the constraints of a strict manorial regime.[96]
