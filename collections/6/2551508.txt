Faldo met his first wife, Melanie Rockall, when he was 21. They married in 1979, but less than five years later they parted when she discovered he was having an affair with his manager's secretary, Gill Bennett. Faldo later said of his relationship with Rockall: "We were happily married for eight months. Unfortunately, we were married for four-and-a-half years."[27]
