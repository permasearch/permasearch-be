The first phase of a 2013 world tour in support of Babel was released in November 2012.[46] Their Gentlemen of the Road tour continued through 2013. After performing two shows on 8 & 9 June 2013 at the Austin360 Amphitheater in Austin, Texas, bassist Ted Dwane checked into a hospital the next day. Surgeons found a blood clot on the surface of his brain and performed surgery to remove it. Heeding medical advice to aid Dwane's recovery, the band cancelled the rest of its Summer Stampede Tour, including performances at the 2013 Bonnaroo Music Festival and returned to the UK.[47] Dwane's surgery was successful, and his recovery was such that the band were able to headline the 2013 Glastonbury Festival on 30 June, with the band receiving acclaim for their performance.[48]
