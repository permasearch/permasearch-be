Kami, shin, or, archaically, jin (ç¥ž) is defined in English as "god", "spirit", or "spiritual essence", all these terms meaning "the energy generating a thing".[8] Since the Japanese language does not distinguish between singular and plural, kami refers to the divinity, or sacred essence, that manifests in multiple forms. Rocks, trees, rivers, animals, places, and even people can be said to possess the nature of kami.[8] Kami and people exist within the same world and share its interrelated complexity.[3]
