Men are 25% more likely to suffer strokes than women,[41] yet 60% of deaths from stroke occur in women.[183] Since women live longer, they are older on average when they have their strokes and thus more often killed.[41] Some risk factors for stroke apply only to women. Primary among these are pregnancy, childbirth, menopause, and the treatment thereof (HRT).
