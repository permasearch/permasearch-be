Connecticut is home to the first successful copper mining by Europeans in what is now the United States.[19] A copper deposit was discovered in the present town of East Granby, Connecticut in 1705, and German metallurgists from Hanover were imported to reduce the ore to copper metal.[20] The mine was shut down in 1725, and the property served as a prison from 1773 to 1897.[21]
