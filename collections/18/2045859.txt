According to Gaudiya Vaishnava theology, one's original consciousness and goal of life is pure love of the god Krishna.[3] Since the 1960s, the mantra has been made well known outside India by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada and his International Society for Krishna Consciousness (commonly known as "the Hare Krishnas").[4]
