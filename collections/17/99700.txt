In its reassessment of Soviet history that began during perestroika in 1989, the USSR condemned the 1939 secret protocol between Germany and itself.[29] However, the USSR never formally acknowledged its presence in the Baltics as an occupation or that it annexed these states,[30] and considered the Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republics as its constituent republics. The Russian SFSR, on the other hand, recognized it in 1991 as "annexation"[31]. Nationalist-patriotic[32] Russian historiography and school textbooks continue to maintain that the Baltic states voluntarily joined the Soviet Union after their peoples all carried out socialist revolutions independent of Soviet influence.[33] The Russian government and its state officials insist that incorporation of the Baltic states was in accordance with international law[34][35] and gained de jure recognition by the agreements made in the Yalta and Potsdam conferences and by the Helsinki Accords,[36][37] whereas the Accords only committed existing frontiers would not be violated.[38] However, Russia agreed to Europe's demand to "assist persons deported from the occupied Baltic states" upon joining the Council of Europe.[39][40][41] Additionally, when the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic signed a separate treaty with Lithuania in 1991, it acknowledged that the 1940 annexation was a violation of Lithuanian sovereignty and recognised the de jure continuity of the Lithuanian state.[42][43]
