As with American football the NBA have arranged regular season matches in London for several years now, the most recent being a two-game series between the New York Knicks and Detroit Pistons at the O2 Arena, London. NBA Commissioner David Stern, has enthusiastically discussed the possibility of the NBA expanding into Europe, at one point envisioning a new division of 5 teams based in London, Paris, Berlin, Italy (Rome or Milan), and Spain (Madrid or Barcelona). Though in 2012. Stern went on to say that of the sites suggested only London and Berlin had arenas of the standard expected in the NBA, while Spain and Italy's domestic leagues had become increasingly popular. The idea of a single team or pair of teams relocating to London and Berlin was dismissed as uneconomical due to the distances involved for away fixtures.
