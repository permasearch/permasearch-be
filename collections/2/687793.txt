Before Euro 2012, UEFA president Michel Platini dismissed the need for goal-line technology, instead arguing for placing additional assistant referees behind the goal. However, in a Group D match with Ukraine losing 1–0 to England, the on-field officials did not see Ukraine's Marko Dević's shot briefly cross the line before it was cleared by England's John Terry, although an offside in the build-up to the incident was too unnoticed by the match officials.[25][26]
