where      R  0     {\displaystyle R_{0}}   is resistance at temperature      T  0     {\displaystyle T_{0}}  . Therefore, many materials that produce acceptable values of      R  0     {\displaystyle R_{0}}   include materials that have been alloyed or possess variable negative temperature coefficient (NTC), which occurs when a physical property (such as thermal conductivity or electrical resistivity) of a material lowers with increasing temperature, typically in a defined temperature range. For most materials, electrical resistivity will decrease with increasing temperature.
