In IPv4, determination of whether a destination IP address is on-link can be made by examining the source and destination addresses and the source's subnet mask, as an address cannot be disassociated from the on-link prefix.[3] For IPv6, however, on-link determination is different in detail and requires the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP).[4][5] IPv6 address assignment to an interface carries no requirement of a matching on-link prefix and vice versa, with the exception of link-local addresses.
