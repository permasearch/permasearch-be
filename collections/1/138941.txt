One of the earliest legends that connects the Tower with a raven is the tale of the euhemerised mutually destructive battle against the Irish leader Matholwch who had mistreated the British princess Branwen. Branwen's brother Br창n the Blessed (King of the Britons) ordered his followers to cut off his head and bury it beneath the White Hill (where the Tower now stands) facing out towards France as a talisman to protect Britain from foreign invasion.[8] Please note that Br창n is the Welsh word for Raven. This fact makes clear the link between Br창n's head being buried beneath the site of today's tower and the importance of the continued presence of ravens.
