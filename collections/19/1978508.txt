With the onset of the Protestant Reformation, most Hungarians took up first Lutheranism, then soon afterwards Calvinism. In the second half of the 16th century, however, Jesuits led a partially successful campaign of Counter Reformation and the country once again became predominantly Catholic. However, eastern parts of the country, especially around Debrecen ("the Calvinist Rome"), retained strong Protestant communities.[184] Orthodox Christianity in Hungary is associated with the country's ethnic minorities: Romanians, Rusyns, Ukrainians, and Serbs.
