However, while many of the architectural details of Maya cities are correct,[8] they are blended from different locations and eras,[8] a decision Farhad Safinia said was made for aesthetic reasons.[13] While Apocalypto is set during the terminal post-classic period of Maya civilization, the central pyramid of the film comes from the classic period, which ended in A.D. 900,[13] such as those found in the Postclassic sites of Muyil, Coba, and others in Quintana Roo, Mexico, where later cities are built around earlier pyramids.   The temples are in the shape of those of Tikal in the central lowlands classic style but decorated with the Puuc style elements of the northwest YucatÃ¡n centuries later. Richard D. Hansen comments, "There was nothing in the post-classic period that would match the size and majesty of that pyramid in the film. But Gibson ... was trying to depict opulence, wealth, consumption of resources."[13] The mural in the arched walkway combined elements from the Maya codices, the Bonampak murals (over 700 years earlier than the film's setting), and the San Bartolo murals (some 1500 years earlier than the film's setting).[citation needed]
