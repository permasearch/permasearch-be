It is connected to the North Atlantic at both its northern and southern ends. To the north, the connection is through the North Channel between Scotland and Northern Ireland and the Malin Sea. The southern end is linked to the Atlantic through the St George's Channel between south eastern Ireland and Pembrokeshire in Wales, and the Celtic Sea. The Irish Sea is composed of a deeper channel about 300 km (190 mi) long and 30–50 km (19–31 mi) wide on its western side and shallower embayments to the east. The western channel's depth ranges from 80 metres (260 ft) up to 275 m (902 ft) in the Beaufort's Dyke in the North Channel. The main embayments – Cardigan Bay in the south and the waters to the east of the Isle of Man – are less than 50 m (160 ft) deep. The Sea has a total water volume of 2,430 km3 (580 cu mi), 80% of which is to the west of the Isle of Man, and a surface area of 47,000 km2 (18,000 sq mi). The largest sandbanks are the Bahama and King William Banks to the east and north of the Isle of Man and the Kish Bank, Codling Bank, Arklow Bank and Blackwater Bank near the coast of Ireland. The Irish Sea, at its greatest width, is 200 km (120 mi) and narrows to 75 km (47 mi).[9]
