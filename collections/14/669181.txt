Principal photography began on September 23, 2013, in southern France,[7] in Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val,[8][9] lasted for nine weeks and proceeded in The Netherlands[10] and in the Cité du Cinéma studio complex, located in Saint-Denis, north of Paris.[11]The Hundred Foot Journey was extensively shot at scenic locales of Midi-Pyrénées.[12] Prior to actual filming, actors Manish Dayal and Charlotte Le Bon spent a considerable amount of time going to restaurants and observing and learning in kitchens.[13] To sign off on the food featured in the film, producer Juliet Blake consulted Indian-born chef Floyd Cardoz who understands “fusing together two cultures through cooking.”[13] Indian actress Juhi Chawla plays Om Puri's character's wife in the film. The makers felt the need for her to look 15 years older than her present age. That's why she has been made to age digitally on screen with the help of post-production techniques.[14]
