Regular Norwegian, in the bokmål variant, is mostly spelled without diacritic signs, the only exceptions is one word of Norwegian origin, namely fôr, to be distinguished from for (see below) and then other words with a recent foreign origin, e.g. allé.[citation needed] The nynorsk uses several letters with diacritic signs: é, è, ê, ó, ò, â, and ô. The diacritic signs are not compulsory,[1] but can be added to clarify the meaning of words (homonyms) that would otherwise be identical. One example is ein gut ("a boy") versus éin gut ("one boy"). Loanwords may be spelled with other diacritics, most notably ü, á, à and é,[citation needed] following the conventions of the original language. The Norwegian vowels æ, ø and å never take diacritics.
