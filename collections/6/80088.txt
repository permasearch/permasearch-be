Epicurus applies his method of inference (the use of observations as signs, Asmis' summary, p. 333: the method of using the phenomena as signs (σημεīα) of what is unobserved)[22]:pp.175–196 immediately to the atomic theory of Democritus. In Aristotle's Prior Analytics, Aristotle himself employs the use of signs.[22]: pp.212–224[23] But Epicurus presented his 'canonic' as rival to Aristotle's logic.[22]:pp.19–34 See: Lucretius (c. 99 BCE – c. 55 BCE) De rerum natura (On the nature of things) a didactic poem explaining Epicurus' philosophy and physics.
