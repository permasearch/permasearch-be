Sometime later, Yao comes out of hiding to visit the Valley of Peace. After years of being cooped in constant meditation and isolated from the rest of the world, Yao was cheerful and glad to experience life again. He gets overly excited at every little thing that surrounds him because of his long cut-off from the world. Po and Shifu had to protect him when Temutai and the Qidan Clan target Yao to learn the secrets of Kung Fu. Even though his physical strengths are weak, he is able to use Kung Fu with his mind. It was with this talent that he was able to free Po and Shifu and knock the entire Qidan Clan unconscious.
