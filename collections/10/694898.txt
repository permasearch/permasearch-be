The film won eight awards, and was nominated for five others. The individual critics were also mixed. The film was the last to be reviewed by Gene Siskel before his death in February of 1999, who gave a favorable review and wrote that "Rachael Leigh Cook, as Laney, the plain Jane object of the makeover, is forced to demonstrate the biggest emotional range as a character, and she is equal to the assignment."[9]
