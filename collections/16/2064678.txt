Roman Reigns tried to get another shot at the WWE World Heavyweight Championship by qualifying in the Money in the Bank Ladder Match at Money in the Bank. Reigns became close to winning the match and the Money in the Bank contract until Bray Wyatt interfered and cost Reigns the match. This began a feud between Reigns and Wyatt that would last until Hell in a Cell where Reigns defeated Wyatt in a Hell in a Cell match.
