He took his first karate class at the age of six.[2] A year later, he attended the national karate tournament in Louisville, Kentucky, where he met Michael Chaturantabut, the founder of Xtreme Martial Arts. Chaturantabut invited Lautner to a camp he held at University of California, Los Angeles.[2] Lautner trained with Chaturantabut for several years, earning his black belt by the age of eight, and winning several junior world championships.[8] He appeared in an ISKA karate event televised on ESPN in 2003 that was later lampooned on the sports-comedy show Cheap Seats that first aired in 2006.[10]
