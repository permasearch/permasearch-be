where     ×   {\displaystyle \times }   denotes the vector cross product. In other words, the rate of change of P in the stationary frame is the sum of its apparent rate of change in the rotating frame and a rate of rotation      ω  ×  P    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\omega }}\times {\boldsymbol {P}}}   attributable to the motion of the rotating frame. The vector ω has magnitude ω equal to the rate of rotation and is directed along the axis of rotation according to the right-hand rule.
