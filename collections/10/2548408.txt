However, other extensions received priority, and the Woburn extension was not built. The B&M dropped the Somerville local stops in the late 1940s and early 1950s due to declining ridership. In 1955â€“57 the B&M raised the tracks through Wedgemere and Winchester Center onto a high grade and viaduct in order to eliminate busy grade crossings.[12] However, the elevated portion was only built with two tracks, preventing a rapid transit extension from reaching to Woburn, since two tracks would still be needed for Lowell Line service. All discussion of the project since has focused on an extension no further than West Medford. The trackless trolleys were replaced by buses in 1959 and 1963, leaving most of Somerville with a transit system dependent on buses running on frequently crowded streets.[13]
