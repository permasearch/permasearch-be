General elections were held in Mexico on 1 July 2018.[1] Voters elected a new President of Mexico to serve a term  of five years and ten months (reduced by two months from the constitutional mandate due to a change in the inauguration date as of 2014),[2] 128 members of the Senate for a period of six years and 500 members of the Chamber of Deputies for a period of three years.  It was one of the largest election days in Mexican history, with most of the nation's states  holding state and local elections on the same day, including nine governorships, with over 3,400 positions subject to elections at all levels of government.[3]  It has been the most violent campaign Mexico has experienced in recent history, with 130 political figures killed since September 2017.[3]
