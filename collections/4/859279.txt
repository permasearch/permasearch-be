Lee outlasted Matt to win immunity for the third consecutive time. Matt was very disappointed not to win immunity, but tried his utmost to convince Kristie and Flick to vote against El. Flick and Kristie discussed the challenge prowess of Lee in particular, and Flick felt that it was in her best interest to vote El off. However, Flick's closeness to El meant that she and Kristie would owe her genuinity of telling her that she would be voted off. This backfired on Flick however, as El revealed that she had told her repeatedly that she would take her to the final two and had lied to her on many other occasions. El then made a plea to Kristie to work with her and Lee by reassuring her that they would be far more trustworthy than Flick. Kristie then asked Matt openly whether Flick had promised to take him to the final two, to which Matt said that she hadn't.
