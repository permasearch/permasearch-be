Monetary topics abound in the Next Generation era. In the inaugural episode "Encounter at Farpoint" set in 2364, Enterprise medical officer Beverly Crusher buys a bolt of fabric and asks for it to be charged to her ship's account. Some officers are known to visit casinos, particularly near starbases, as in "Tapestry", and poker is often depicted as a favorite of Enterprise-D crewmembers, though actual money is never shown as part of the game. In Deep Space Nine's episode "Explorers", Benjamin Sisko recounts how, upon first entering Starfleet Academy and transporting back to his New Orleans home many times, he quickly spent an entire month's allotment of "transporter credits" (though these may not be a form of money). Later, in "The Changing Face of Evil", Sisko arranges for his wife's employer (the Bajorans, a non-Federation race) to give her a month's paid vacation, a fact emphasized in the episode. And, in Star Trek: Voyager's pilot, Tom Paris references having someone pay his bar bills.
