On December 10, 2013, WBEB announced the station would be rebranding as "More FM at 101.1". The disc jockeys and format would stay the same. The name change took place on December 26, after the Christmas music format concluded.[5] With the branding change, the station dropped its "Saturday Night '80s" program. When WBEB began playing Christmas music in 2014, the name was shortened to "101.1 More FM." In response to WZMP changing formats from Top 40 to AC, in January 2017, the station was rebranded as "Today's 101.1 More FM".
