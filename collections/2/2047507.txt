Conceptually, the Eltonian niche introduces the idea of a species' response to and effect on the environment. Unlike other niche concepts the Eltonian niche emphasizes that a species not only grows in and responds to an environment based on available resources, predators, and climatic conditions, a species may also change the availability and behavior of those factors as it grows. In an extreme example, beavers require certain resources in order to survive and reproduce, but also construct dams that alter water flow in the river where the beaver lives. Thus, the beaver affects the biotic and abiotic conditions of other species that live in and near the watershed.[14] In a more subtle case, competitors that consume resources at different rates can lead to cycles in resource density that differ between species.[15] Not only do species grow differently with respect to resource density, their own population growth can lead to different effects on resource density over time (see Relative nonlinearity).
