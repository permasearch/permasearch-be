The series, described as a "close-ended series"[19] by the network, was adapted from the novel of the same name by Petra Hammesfahr; however, the book's darker outlook was toned down and the location shifted from Germany to Upstate New York in the United States.[20] It was the first time that Biel had executive-produced a series, a role she said was "gold".[21] Biel stated that she moved into production so that she could develop projects with challenging and interesting roles rather than wait for them to happen.[22]
