Fred Rutherford (Richard Deacon, October 18, 1957 – May 23, 1963) is Ward's pompous, overbearing co-worker. Fred is the father of an awkward teenage son named Clarence ("Lumpy"), and a daughter about Beaver's age named Violet. The Rutherfords socialize with the Cleavers on a couple of occasions: playing cards in the Cleaver home and, at a later time, enjoying a picnic outing together. Fred travels widely and gives Ward a meerschaum pipe after visiting Germany.
