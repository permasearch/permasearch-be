There was controversy over whether the perpetrators should be memorialized. Some were opposed, saying that it glorified murderers, while others argued that the perpetrators were also victims. Atop a hill near Columbine High School, crosses were erected for Harris and Klebold along with those for the people they killed,[37] but the father of Daniel Rohrbough cut them down, saying that murderers should not be memorialized in the same place as victims.[38]
