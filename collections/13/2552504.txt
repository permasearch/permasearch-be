Hitchcock was so impressed with Hedren's acting abilities he decided to offer her the leading role of his next film, Marnie (1964), a romantic drama and psychological thriller from the novel by Winston Graham, during the filming of The Birds.[31][32] Hedren was stunned and felt extremely fortunate to be offered to play "such a complicated, sad, tragic woman", and later said, "I consider my acting, while not necessarily being method acting, but one that draws upon my own feelings. I thought Marnie was an extremely interesting role to play and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity".[31] She voiced doubts about her ability to play that demanding role, but Hitchcock assured her she could do it.[33] As opposed to The Birds, where she had received little acting guidance, for this film Hedren studied every scene with Hitchcock.[34]
