The complex interactions of elevation, slope, exposure and regional-scale air masses determine the climate within the park,[61][62] which is noted for its extreme weather patterns.[62] A "collision of air masses" from several directions produces some of the key weather events in the region. When cold arctic air from the north meets warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico at the Front Range, "intense, very wet snowfalls with total snow depth measured in the feet" accumulate in the park.[61]
