A United States postage stamp and the names of a number of recreational and cultural facilities, schools, streets and other facilities and institutions throughout the United States have commemorated Banneker's documented and mythical accomplishments throughout the years since he lived (see Commemorations of Benjamin Banneker). In 1983, Rita Dove, a future Poet Laureate of the United States, wrote a biographical verse about Banneker while on the faculty of Arizona State University.[107]
