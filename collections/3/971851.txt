In 1997, suppressed P90s were used in combat by the Peruvian special forces group (Grupo de Fuerzas Especiales) in Operation Chav√≠n de Huantar, the hostage rescue siege that ended the Japanese embassy hostage crisis.[37] The operation was a success: all 14 MRTA revolutionaries were killed, and 71 hostages were rescued.[37] The MRTA revolutionaries who had taken the hostages were equipped with body armor, but it was defeated by the Peruvian special forces' P90s.[38] In 2011, P90s were used by Muammar Gaddafi's military forces in the 2011 Libyan civil war, and some of these examples were captured and used in the war by Libyan rebel forces.[3]
