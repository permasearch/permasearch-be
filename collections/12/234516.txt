The museum was dedicated on May 15, 2014.[69][70][71] In attendance were a range of dignitaries, from President Barack Obama, former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to former mayors David Dinkins, Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg and current mayor Bill de Blasio. During the hour-long ceremony LaChanze sang "Amazing Grace", which she dedicated to her husband (who was killed in the World Trade Center that day).[2] During the five days between its dedication and the public opening, over 42,000 first responders and family members of 9/11 victims visited the museum.[82]
