The game broke Nintendo's launch title sales records in multiple regions.[141][142] The game competed with the open-world title Horizon Zero Dawn in its launch week, which it outsold in Japan (around 200,000 copies).[143][144] While Breath of the Wild was only the second best-selling retail game in the UK in its week of release, selling less than Horizon, it was the third largest Zelda series release there, behind Wind Waker and Twilight Princess.[145][146] Nintendo reported that Breath of the Wild sold more than 1.3 million copies in the United States in March 2017, 925,000 copies of which were for the Switch version, attaining a 100% attach rate for the console.[147][148][149][150] It was also the second best-selling retail game in the US in March, only behind Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands.[151] In its year-end report for the 2016 fiscal year which ended on March 31, 2017, Nintendo reported it had sold 3.84 million copies of Breath of the Wild worldwide. The Wii U version sold 1.08 million units and the Switch version sold 2.76 million units, surpassing the latter console's global sales of 2.74 million for the same period.[152] Nintendo's president Tatsumi Kimishima said that the attach rate of Breath of the Wild to the Switch was "unprecedented", and that "this momentum may lead to a new sell-through record for the entire The Legend of Zelda series".[153] By September 2017, total worldwide sales of the Switch version of the game exceeded 4.70 million, making it the system's best-selling title.[154][155]
