In the electromagnetic cgs system, electric current is a fundamental quantity defined via Amp√®re's law and takes the permeability as a dimensionless quantity (relative permeability) whose value in a vacuum is unity. As a consequence, the square of the speed of light appears explicitly in some of the equations interrelating quantities in this system.
