It is to be expected that the draft dodgers denounce the state as an oppressive bureaucracy, using the vernacular of the time to rail against "the machine" and "the system."  What is more surprising is their general resistance to mass movements, a sentiment that contradicts the association of the draft dodger with sixties protest found in more recent work by [Scott] Turow or [Mordecai] Richler.  In contrast to stereotypes, the draft dodger in these narratives is neither an unthinking follower of movement ideology nor a radical who attempts to convert others to his cause. ...  [Another surprise is that the dodgers] have little interest in romantic love.  Their libidinal hyperactivity accords with [Herbert] Marcuse's belief in the liberatory power of eros.  They are far less worried about whether particular relationships will survive the flight to Canada than about the gratification of their immediate sexual urges.[130]
