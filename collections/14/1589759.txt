The buildings on Newton Road were opened by King George V in 1928 after opening the Tyne Bridge. The school building was symmetrical; everything found on one side of the school was mirrored on the opposite side. The western side of the building was Heaton Grammar School[1] for boys with an entrance on Jesmond Park West and the eastern side of the building was Heaton High School[1] for girls, again with a separate entrance on Newton Road.
