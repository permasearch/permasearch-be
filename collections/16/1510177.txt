Spectra Energy's Fort Nelson Project is proposed but still needs to secure funding.[97] The total project cost is estimated to be US $12.5 Million. The source of CO2 will be from the Fort Nelson Natural Gas Processing Plant and will be transported 15Â km via an onshore pipeline to middle Devonian carbonate rock that is between 6500 and 7000 feet deep. The process will capture 2.2 Megatonne CO2 per year using an amine process in its pre-combustion capture. Injections and MVA Operations have already occurred (2014) and is projected to startup in 2018.[98]
