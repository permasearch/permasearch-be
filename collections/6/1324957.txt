Toby gets revenge when Michael's insulting farewell gift to him is exposed(a rock with a note reading: "Suck on this!") and Pam gets Michael to unwillingly give up his watch to Toby, which he does, clearly upset. Toby's main concern on his last day is getting pictures of himself alone with Pam, which he finally does as his party is ending. Michael gets a last dig in by having Hank the security guard escort Toby out of the office as he leaves for his new life in Costa Rica and is still shown to be upset when Toby looks at his new watch. In a deleted scene at his farewell party, Toby refers to an undefined incident involving his sister; this marks the first time Toby has mentioned having any siblings, although late in season 7 he reveals also having a brother Rory.[7]
