In the instance of the Anglo-Saxon origin, the surname can be derived from any of the numerous place-names in England, composed of two elements (brōm + dūn) derived from the Old English language. The first element, brōm, means "broom" or "gorse", and the second, dūn, means "hill". Such places can include: Brandon, County Durham; Brandon, Northumberland; Brandon, Suffolk; Brandon, Warwickshire; and other locations[3]. However, one location, Brandon in Lincolnshire, may be connected to the River Brant, which runs close by.[3] This river's name is derived from two Old English elements: brant, meaning "steep", "deep"; and dūn, meaning "hill"[4] The name of this location is probably in reference to the river's steep banks[3]. A famous instance of the use of 'Brandon' as a surname is that of Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk. He was a close friend and brother-in-law of King Henry VIII.
