Far Cry 2 was released in October 2008, and was critically praised and commercially successful, with over 2.9 million in sales by 2009.[14] However, the game's director, Clint Hocking, noted that internally, much of the design of Far Cry 2 was haphazard.[13] Far Cry 2 had a polarizing reception from players over some of the gameplay features that were implemented to make the game feel diegetic and immerse the player into the world. Some of these disputed mechanics included the random onset of malaria that would impact the character's vision and movement until they obtained and took medicine for it, a weapon decay system that would cause guns picked up from enemies to wear down and break over use, military checkpoints that a player could clear out but which would become repopulated with enemies minutes later, and the game's buddy system, where the player could call a selected non-player character to help their character in battle, but only for a short while and would not be available until the player reached a safe house to rest.[15]
