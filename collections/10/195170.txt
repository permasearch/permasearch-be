Dust storms are not limited to Earth and have been known to form on other planets such as Mars.[18] These dust storms can extend over larger areas than those on Earth, sometimes encircling the planet, with wind speeds as high as 60 miles per hour (97Â km/h). However, given Mars' much lower atmospheric pressure (roughly 1% that of Earth's), the intensity of Mar's storms could never reach the kind of hurricane-force winds that are experienced on Earth.[19] Martian dust storms are formed when solar heating warms the Martian atmosphere and causes the air to move, lifting dust off the ground. The chance for storms is increased when there are great temperature variations like those seen at the equator during the Martian summer.[20]
