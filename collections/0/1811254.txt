Following Zakiyah and Bridgette's eviction, the HouseGuests went head-to-head in the Hollywoods Squirrels Head of Household competition. In this competition, HouseGuests competed in one-on-one matches. In each round, HouseGuests were asked a question based on a grid of Benny the BB Comp Squirrels. If a HouseGuest buzzes in with the correct answer, they will move on and eliminate their opponent. If they are incorrect, they will be eliminated. The HouseGuest who survives in each round must pick the next two HouseGuests to face off. The last HouseGuest standing will be the new Head of Household. Victor was the winner. For being the first two HouseGuests eliminated in the Head of Household competition, Michelle and Nicole became Have-Nots for the week. Nicole received America's Care Package, which contained safety for the week, on the condition she wear a "Super Safety" costume all week. On Day 59, Victor nominated Corey and Paulie for eviction, with Paulie as the target. On Day 60, Zingbot made an appearance and hosted Victor, Corey, Paulie, Paul, Nicole and James in the Zingbot for President Power of Veto competition, with Natalie moderating. In each round, HouseGuests launched a beanbag at a map to claim votes for Zingbot. Once a spot has been landed in, any future tosses into that spot will have a score of zero. The HouseGuest who gets the least votes in each round will be eliminated from the competition. After each HouseGuest has been eliminated, they will claim a campaign gift. HouseGuests eliminated in future rounds have the option of keeping their gift or claiming a gift already revealed. The HouseGuest with the Power of Veto at the end of the game will win the Power of Veto. Paul became a member of the BB Secret Service, James won $5,000, Paulie must bake apple pies any time he is instructed by Big Brother for the rest of the season, Corey has to wear the "Patriotard" for the week and Nicole won a trip to anywhere in the United States. Victor won the Power of Veto. On Day 62, Victor decided not to use the Power of Veto. On Day 65, Paulie was evicted by a unanimous 5-0 vote. Paulie was revealed not to have the round trip ticket and he became the fourth member of the jury. All of the tickets expired and it was later revealed that Paul had the round trip ticket.
