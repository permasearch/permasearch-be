For U.S. sea services, The United States Navy Memorial is the triumph of a centuries-old dream. In the early days of U.S. independence, architect Pierre L'Enfant envisioned a memorial in the nation's capital "to celebrate the first rise of the Navy and consecrate its progress and achievements." But it was only in the twentieth century that L'Enfant's vision was realized.[1]
