While some modern historians[17] accept the earlier date of c. 460 for Patrick's death, scholars of early Irish history tend to prefer a later date, c. 493. Supporting the later date, the annals record that in 553 "the relics of Patrick were placed sixty years after his death in a shrine by Colum Cille" (emphasis added).[18] The death of Patrick's disciple Mochta is dated in the annals to 535 or 537,[18][19] and the early hagiographies "all bring Patrick into contact with persons whose obits occur at the end of the fifth century or the beginning of the sixth".[20] However, E. A. Thompson argues that none of the dates given for Patrick's death in the Annals are reliable.[21]
