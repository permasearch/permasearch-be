Despite playing two backups at the QB position, Michigan State would snap Ohio State's 23-game winning streak on Senior day in Columbus; this would be the second time the Spartans would pull off such a feat, as two years prior MSU had snapped an Ohio State 24-game winning streak after beating the Buckeyes in the Big Ten Championship Game. Additionally, this was also the first time under Urban Meyer that Ohio State had lost a regular season conference game. Tyler O'Connor would finish the game completing 7/12 passes for 91 yards and a touchdown, however the running game was the prevailing theme of the day as LJ Scott and Gerald Holmes carried the brunt of the load, combining for 27 carries, 123 yards, and 1 touchdown; as a team they rushed for 203 yards. The Spartan offense also dominated the time of possession, controlling the ball for 38:10.[21] The Michigan State defense held Ohio State to five first downs and 132 yards of total offense (86 rushing, 46 passing). The Buckeyes had six three-and-outs. The 132 yards were the fewest by an Urban Meyer-coached team and the fewest allowed by MSU since Illinois had 128 yards on Oct. 26, 2013. It was also the fewest total yards for a Buckeye team since 1999 (79 vs. Michigan State). Ohio State entered the game ranked first in the Big Ten in scoring offense (36.4 points per game) and rushing offense (244.8 yards per game) and second in total offense (453.3 yards per game).[22] With the win, the Spartans took control of the East Division and only needed to defeat Penn State the following week to secure a 3rd appearance in the Big Ten Championship Game.
