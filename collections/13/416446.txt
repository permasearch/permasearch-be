Axillary steroids are produced by the testes, ovaries, apocrine glands, and adrenal glands.[41] These chemicals are not biologically active until puberty when sex steroids influence their activity.[42] The change in activity during puberty suggest that humans may communicate through odors.[41] Several axillary steroids have been described as potential human pheromones: androstadienol, androstadienone, androstenol, androstenone, and androsterone.
