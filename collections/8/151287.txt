In 1991, the 19th-century sidewheeler Atlantic was discovered.[120] It had sunk in a collision with the Ogdensburg, a steamship sometimes referred to as a "propeller" according to 19th-century parlance, in 1852, six miles (9.7 km) west of Long Point, Ontario and survivors from the Atlantic were saved by the Ogdensburg.[120][121] One account suggests 130 people drowned[120] while another suggests about 20 drowned.[121] The aftermath of the disaster led to calls for authorities to seize captains of both ships so "that the cause of the collision may be correctly ascertained" as well as calls for more lifeboats and improved life preservers since the earlier ones proved to be "totally useless."[121] There was speculation that the sunken vessel had been a gambling ship, and therefore there might have been money aboard, but most historians were skeptical.[120] In 1998, the shipwreck of the vessel Adventure was the first shipwreck registered with the state of Ohio as an "underwater archaeological site"; when it was discovered that the Adventure's propeller had been removed and given to a junkyard, the propeller was rescued days before being converted to scrap metal and brought back to the dive site and back to its underwater home.[39] In 2003, divers discovered the steamer Canobie near Presque Isle, which sunk in 1921.[119] Other wrecks include the fish tub Neal H. Dow (1910), the Elderado "steamer-cum-barge" (1880),[119] the W. R. Hanna,[39] the Dundee which sank north of Cleveland in 1900,[39] the F. H. Prince,[39] and The Craftsman.[39] In 2007, the wreck of the steamship named after Mad Anthony Wayne was found near Vermilion, Ohio in 50 feet (15 m) of water; the vessel sank in 1850 after its boilers exploded, and 38 people died.[122] The wreck belongs to the state of Ohio and "salvaging it is illegal" but divers can visit it after it is surveyed.[122] In addition, there are wrecks of smaller vessels, with occasional drownings of fishermen.[123]
