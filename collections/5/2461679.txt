There is a sizable population of Tamils in the Central Province, plantation laborers brought down from India by the British colonial authorities in the 19th and 20th centuries. These Indian Tamils (or Estate Tamils), as they are called, still work mainly in Sri Lankaâ€™s tea plantations. They have been locked in poverty for generations and continue to experience poor living conditions.[16] Although they speak dialects of the same language, they are usually considered a separate community from the Sri Lankan Tamils of the North and East.
