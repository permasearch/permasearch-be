Gabriel Drake Santiago was the son of Patrick Drake and Sabrina Santiago. Gabriel was born prematurely April 25, 2014 after his parents and older sister, Emma were in a car accident. He was rushed to the hospital and treated by Dr. Britt Westbourne in the neonatal intensive-care unit. He was put on a ventilator to help him breathe. He suffered a minor set back and was unable to get enough air into his lungs, but the doctors were able to stabilize him. Patrick and Sabrina sat vigil by his bedside as the doctors cared for him. As his condition seemed to be improving, his parents along with sister Emma, decided to name him Gabriel Drake Santiago, after his maternal grandmother, father, and half-sister. Gabriel's condition took a turn for the worse when he was diagnosed with necrotizing enterocolitis. This condition caused the infection he was fighting to spread, which resulted in massive organ failure. His parents had him baptized in the hospital and soon after he died surrounded by his parents.
