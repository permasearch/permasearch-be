This Westinghouse broadcast was not unique â€” that evening at least two other stations made audio transmissions of election returns, one a temporary arrangement made by the Saint Louis Post-Dispatch in conjunction with W. E. Woods of the Benwoods Company, "manufacturers and distributors of wireless outfits",[30] and the other a broadcast by the Detroit News' "Detroit News Radiophone" station.[31] And although later station publicity proclaimed that Westinghouse's election night broadcast "was a national sensation, acclaimed by newspapers all over the country",[3] a comprehensive review of contemporary newspapers determined that reports, although positive, actually appeared only in a few local papers, thus it "was not an immediate 'sensation' and that the fame of this event developed over time with later celebratory accounts".[32] However, KDKA would eventually gain national prominence once it began to offer an extensive range of programming.
