The lymphatic system is a collection system which starts in the same tissue space as initial lymph collectors that have fenestrated openings to allow fluid and particles to enter. These initial lymph collectors are valveless vessels and go on to form the precollector vessels which have rudimentary valves which are not considered to be fully functional. These structures then form increasingly larger lymphatic vessels, which form co-laterals. In animals lower than mammals, these vessels have lymph hearts, which possess stretch receptors and smooth muscle tissue embedded in their walls. The lymphatic vessels make their way to the lymph nodes and from the lymph nodes the vessels form into trunks which connect to the internal jugular group of veins in the neck. The lymphatic system, once thought to be passive, is now known to be an active pumping system, with segments exhibiting a function similar to that of peristalsis.
