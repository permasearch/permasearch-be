On July 31, 2001, Univision announced that TeleFutura would be the name for the new network, with Univision Communications chairman and chief executive officer A. Jerrold Perenchio noting the name was suggested in part by two of corporate employees to "represent[...] the future of Spanish-language television".[12] Univision continued to run the nine HSN affiliates and four independent stations as English language outlets for several months following the USA Broadcasting purchase.
