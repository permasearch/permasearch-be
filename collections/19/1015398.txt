Introducing livestock makes the most efficient use of critical sod and cover crops; livestock (through manure) are able to distribute the nutrients in these crops throughout the soil rather than removing nutrients from the farm through the sale of hay.[7] In systems where use of farm livestock would violate reservations growers or consumers may have about animal exploitation, efforts are made to surrogate this input through livestock in the soil, namely worms and microorganisms.[11]
