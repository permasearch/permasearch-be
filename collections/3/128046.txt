When the mean orbital period of an asteroid is an integer fraction of the orbital period of Jupiter, a mean-motion resonance with the gas giant is created that is sufficient to perturb an asteroid to new orbital elements. Asteroids that become located in the gap orbits (either primordially because of the migration of Jupiter's orbit,[67] or due to prior perturbations or collisions) are gradually nudged into different, random orbits with a larger or smaller semi-major axis.
