Throughout the 20th century, many singers have taken the role of Norma. In the early 1920s, it was Rosa Raisa, Claudia Muzio, and Rosa Ponselle who were each admired. Maria Callas emerged as a major force in the role in the post-World War II period. She made two studio recordings of the opera for EMI, and several broadcasts of her live performances have been preserved from the early 1950s through her final performances of the role in Paris in 1964.
