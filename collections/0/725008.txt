Siaka Stevens assumed the role of prime minister following his party's narrow victory in the 1967 general election. However, immediately after taking office, Stevens was deposed by the National Reformation Council in a coup d'Ã©tat and placed under house arrest. Military rule persisted until an April 1968 counter-coup restored Stevens' premiership.[29]
