Pterano, voiced by Michael York, is the antihero of The Land Before Time VII: The Stone of Cold Fire. He is the brother of Petrie's mother and the uncle of Petrie and his siblings, but exiled from the herd for abandoning his own followers to Deinonychus. Having rejoined the herd, he attempts to capture the titular Stone of Cold Fire, but ultimately fails when it turns out the Stone is just a regular asteroid, and is banished anew temporarily. In The Land Before Time X: The Great Longneck Migration, a lone Flyer resembling Pterano is seen when Littlefoot and his grandparents leave the Valley.
