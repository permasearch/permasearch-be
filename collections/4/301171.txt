In the first book, two definitions of justice are proposed but deemed inadequate.[11] Returning debts owed, and helping friends while harming enemies, are common sense definitions of justice that, Socrates shows, are inadequate in exceptional situations, and thus lack the rigidity demanded of a definition. Yet he does not completely reject them, for each expresses a common sense notion of justice that Socrates will incorporate into his discussion of the just regime in books II through V.
