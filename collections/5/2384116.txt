In 2013, country singer Jennifer Nettles recorded "That Girl," which she stated in interviews should be subtitled "The Ballad of Jolene." The song is written from the perspective of the Jolene character, who Nettle feels is unfairly maligned in the original song. In this version, the other woman is shown to have no interest in taking another woman's man, and her song is in fact framed as a warning to Parton's character that "her man" has a roving eye.
