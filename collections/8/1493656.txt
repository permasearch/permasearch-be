Thomas “Tom” Scavo /ˈskɑːvoʊ/ is a fictional character on the ABC television series Desperate Housewives, played by actor Doug Savant. Tom was originally credited as a recurring role throughout Season 1, but became credited as a series regular in Season 2. Early storylines often revolved around Tom's position at an advertising firm, causing him to frequently travel, usually leaving Lynette alone to run the family. Starting in Season 3, Tom's storyline turned to a focus of him trying to find what was next for him, due to being tired of working in advertising. When he finally decides, he opens Scavo's Pizzeria, much to Lynette's dismay. After the five year jump, it becomes apparent that Tom is now experiencing a mid-life crisis, as he purchased and restored an early model convertible. After Lynette gives birth to Paige, it is discovered that Tom is experiencing Male Post-Partum Depression (to which Lynette laughs off, thinking of it as a ridiculous notion.) Tom separates from Lynette at the end of Season 7 and dates Jane for the greater part of Season 8, however, Tom and Lynette reunite at the end of the series.
