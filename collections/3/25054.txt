The Maple Leafs have retired the numbers of 19 players (as some players used the same number, only 13 numbers have been retired).[225] Between October 17, 1992, and October 15, 2016, the Maple Leafs took a unique approach to retired numbers. Whereas players who suffered a career ending injury had their numbers retired, "great" players had their number "honoured".[226] This meant that, although it hung from the rafters, the number was still in team circulation, and could still be worn by other players. During this period, only two players met the criteria, the first being the #6 worn by Ace Bailey retired on February 14, 1934, with Bill Barilko's #5 following on October 17, 1992.[226] The retirement of Bailey's number holds the distinction of being the first retired number in professional sports.[227] It was briefly taken out of retirement before to the 1968â€“69 season, after he asked that Ron Ellis be allowed to wear his number.[228] Bailey's number was re-retired after Ellis ended his career. The first players to have their numbers honoured were Syl Apps and Ted Kennedy, on October 3, 1993.[226] Mats Sundin was the last player to have his number honoured on February 11, 2012.[229]
