In the 1990s, a number of activities which are or were illegal in other Australian states were legalised in the ACT. These include the sale of X-rated pornographic materials (1989) and prostitution in brothels (1992),[209][210] although brothels are only permitted to operate in the suburbs of Hume, Mitchell and Fyshwick.[211] The personal use of cannabis was decriminalised in 1992 and abortion was decriminalised in 2002.[212][213] In 2006, the ACT Government attempted to introduce a law recognising civil unions, but it was overturned by the federal government.[214]
