The malware has both user-mode and kernel-mode rootkit capability under Windows,[53] and its device drivers have been digitally signed with the private keys of two certificates that were stolen from separate well-known companies, JMicron and Realtek, both located at Hsinchu Science Park in Taiwan.[43][51] The driver signing helped it install kernel-mode rootkit drivers successfully without users being notified, and therefore it remained undetected for a relatively long period of time.[57] Both compromised certificates have been revoked by Verisign.
