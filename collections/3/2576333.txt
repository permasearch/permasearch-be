Duality is central to understanding Lady Eboshi, who is at odds with the film’s namesake, Princess Mononoke, also known as San. It is apparent that San plays a heroic role, and at first glance Lady Eboshi appears to be San’s antagonist as well as the film’s villain. A closer look, however, reveals that Lady Eboshi plays a dual role. In mining the forest Lady Eboshi destroys it. And yet she does not fully understand the harm her destruction of nature does to the spirits who live there. Her focus is on creating a safe home for her people. She holds no malicious intent toward nature and its spirits until they begin attacking her people. Once nature attacks, she gathers her soldiers to protect the inhabitants of her town, a place where all are welcome. Irontown is a haven for prostitutes and lepers. She brings them to Irontown and gives them jobs, hospitality, and a kindness that they have never experienced before. The same treatment goes for all Irontown’s inhabitants, not just the sickly and the scorned. Lady Eboshi treats everyone equally, no matter the race, sex, or history of the individual, creating a caring community. While Lady Eboshi hates San and the forest spirits, she keeps a garden in her town. Her care for the garden implies that her intention is not to ravage nature to no end, but rather to create something beautiful for her own people (Thevenin, 2013). Due to her kindness and fair treatment, the townspeople truly respect her and gladly follow her into battle. Therefore, although Lady can be seen as the film’s villain, she is also a hero to the citizens of Irontown and to humankind in general. [37]
