He then entered the Indian Wells Masters 1000 event, losing to Nicolás Lapentti 4–6, 6–7(7–9) in the second round. Despite playing well and winning the challenger Sunrise, Söderling suffered from injuries mixed with poor results for over two months. He finally won consecutive matches for the first time on the ATP tour since the Australian Open at the Rome Masters, before falling to world No. 1 Rafael Nadal in a controversial match 1–6, 0–6 in the third round.[8][9] Following another third round exit at the Madrid Masters against Roger Federer, Söderling next competed at the ARAG World Team Cup in Düsseldorf, as part of the Swedish contingent. Although Sweden did not win, Söderling defeated Gilles Simon and Rainer Schüttler, the latter 6–0, 6–0.
