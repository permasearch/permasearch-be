It is later, as Lexa is running into Clarke's room, that Lexa is accidentally shot by Titus, who intended to kill Clarke. Clarke catches Lexa as she falls and they take her to the bed. Lexa realizes she is going to die and tells Clarke not to be afraid. She tells Titus to never harm Clarke again, and he swears he will not. She tells him serve the next commander as he served her. Clarke continues to try and save Lexa, but she tells Clarke that her spirit will find a new commander. She says her fight is over and that Clarke was right that life should be about more than just surviving. Clarke recites the Traveler's Blessing, an Arkadian prayer. As Lexa dies, Clarke kisses her one last time. Titus extracts a tech from Lexa's neck, where her tattoo is. The tech is called "the flame," and it is revealed to be Lexa's spirit. She was augmented to carry an AI (the flame). The flame is how every new commander is chosen, with each new commander becoming a part of the flame. It is only compatible with Nightbloods. Aden is meant to succeed Lexa, but, in "Stealing Fire," he is murdered by Ontari, a rogue Nightblood who seeks the throne for herself.
