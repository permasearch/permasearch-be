The name Bahamas is mostly likely derived from either the Ta√≠no ba ha ma ("big upper middle land"), which was a term for the region used by the indigenous Native Americans,[13] or possibly from the Spanish baja mar ("shallow water or sea" or "low tide") reflecting the shallow waters of the area. Alternatively, it may originate from Guanahani, a local name of unclear meaning.[14]
