According to the Organic Law of the NPC, the President is nominated by the NPC Presidium, the Congress's executive organ.[7] In practice, however, the ruling Communist Party of China reserves the post of President for its current General Secretary. Like all officers of state elected by the NPC, the President is elected from a one name ballot.
