At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Beyoncé performed "Love on Top" after having said on the black carpet about an hour previous to going on stage that she would be making an announcement.[133] Before beginning her live performance, she said to the audience: "Tonight I want you to stand up on your feet, I want you to feel the love that's growing inside of me", giving a hint about the news that she had alluded to on the black carpet.[133] She took the stage in "a purple spangly tuxedo jacket, black pants and white tuxedo shirt, still rocking her fierce six-inch heels of old, pregnant or not", as stated by Gil Kaufman of MTV News.[133] As she performed, her blond hair blowing in the wind, and backed by six dancers wearing similar shimmering tuxes, Beyoncé gave new meaning to the lyrics: "Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear."[133] She kept her dancing to a minimum for most of the song as she held onto the microphone stand while singing "Love on Top".[133] Eventually making her way to the extended lip in front of the stage and throwing down, she encouraged the audience to put their hands together.[133] Beyoncé ended the performance by dropping the microphone, opening her jacket, rubbing her belly, and thus announcing her pregnancy to the world.[133]
