The social change of the turbulent 1960s has decisively led to a change of the scientific perspective to the point that introspection as a scientific method and ASCs as valid realms of experience became more widely accepted.[20] Foundations for the research have been laid out by various scientists such as Abraham Maslow, Walter N. Pahnke, Stanislav Grof and Charles Tart.[21] They focused on seemingly beneficial aspects of ASCs such as their potential to "promote creativity or treat addiction".[9] Rather oppressive states such as dissociation from trauma were neglected.
