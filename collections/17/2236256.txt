The Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame was first founded by the Louisiana Sports Writers Association in 1958, but it did not have a physical structure until the city Natchitoches and Northwestern State University addressed the issue in 1971 with an offer of space on the campus. The growing archive of memorabilia was shelved in Prather Coliseum for 40 years until the opening of the new $23 million Hall of Fame on June 28, 2013.
