"A.O.U.M" is an acronym, which stands for "abstinence only until marriage."[59] A.O.U.M is a federally-funded policy for sex education that was developed in the 1990s as a part of welfare reform, partially in reaction to the growth and development of adolescent sex and HIV education programs spanning the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.[57][60][61][62]
