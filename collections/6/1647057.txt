A film based on the series, titled Khichdi: The Movie, was released on 1 October 2010 and starred the same principal cast. It became the first Indian television series to be adapted into a film.[11] The film faced stiff competition from big-budget movies like Priyanka Chopra - Ranbir Kapoor starrer Anjaana Anjaani and dubbed Hindi version of Aishwarya Rai - Rajinikanth starrer Enthiran (Robot) and in the end its performance at the box office was termed below average.[12]
