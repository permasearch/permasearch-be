The 2006 season began on March 16 with the sudden death of Doug Hamilton, the team's 43-year-old general manager, who suffered a heart attack on board a plane carrying the team back from Costa Rica where they had played Saprissa in the CONCACAF Champions' Cup.[8] The team finished fifth in the Western Conference, eliminating them from playoff contention for the first time since the league's inception. Midway through the season, Steve Sampson was sacked as Head Coach,[9] replaced by Frank Yallop.[9] The team managed to make a deep run to the U.S. Open Cup final, but lost 3â€“1 against the Chicago Fire.
