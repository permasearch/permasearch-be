The classification schemes in common usage are based on separate (but may be overlapping) categories of disorder schemes sometimes termed "neo-Kraepelinian" (after the psychiatrist Kraepelin)[23] which is intended to be atheoretical with regard to etiology (causation). These classification schemes have achieved some widespread acceptance in psychiatry and other fields, and have generally been found to have improved inter-rater reliability, although routine clinical usage is less clear. Questions of validity and utility have been raised, both scientifically[24] and in terms of social, economic and political factorsâ€”notably over the inclusion of certain controversial categories, the influence of the pharmaceutical industry,[25] or the stigmatizing effect of being categorized or labelled.
