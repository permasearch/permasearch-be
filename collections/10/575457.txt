In the 13th century, England was still primarily supplying raw materials for export to Europe, rather than finished or processed goods.[105] There were some exceptions, such as very high-quality cloths from Stamford and Lincoln, including the famous "Lincoln Scarlet" dyed cloth.[105] Despite royal efforts to encourage it, however, barely any English cloth was being exported by 1347.[106]
