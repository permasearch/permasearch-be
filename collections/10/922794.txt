After Franchione led the Aggies to a 38-30 victory over 13th-ranked Texas, he announced his resignation.[101] In the press conference, after he discussed the game, he read out loud a farewell letter that he had prepared beforehand. His last words were "Thank you, and gig 'em." Franchione immediately left the press conference as A&M athletic director Bill Byrne started to speak, with friends and family members following him.[102][103] The following day, Byrne named defensive coordinator Gary Darnell as interim head coach. Darnell led the Aggies to a 24-17 defeat at the hands of Penn State in the Alamo Bowl on December 29, 2007.[104] On December 7, 2007, the Texas A&M Board of Regents approved a reduced buyout of $4.4 million for Franchione.[105]
