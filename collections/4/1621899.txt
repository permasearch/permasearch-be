Lower connectivity between brain regions was found across the default network in people who have experienced long term trauma, such as childhood abuse or neglect, and is associated with dysfunctional attachment patterns. Among people experiencing posttraumatic stress disorder, lower activation was found in the posterior cingulate gyrus compared to controls.[22] Hyperconnectivity of the default network has been linked to rumination in depression[23] and chronic pain.[24] If the default mode network is altered, this can change the way one perceives events and their social and moral reasoning, thus making a person more susceptible to major depressive-like symptoms.[25]
