After World War II, Miranda's films at Fox were produced in black-and-white, indicative of Hollywood's diminishing interest in her and Latin Americans in general. A monochrome Carmen Miranda reduced the box-office appeal of the backstage musical, Doll Face (1945), in which she was fourth on the bill. Miranda played Chita Chula, billed in the show-within-the-film as "the little lady from Brazil"â€”a cheerful comic sidekick to leading lady Doll Face (Vivian Blaine) with one musical number and little dialogue.[68] A New York Herald Tribune review read, "Carmen Miranda does what she always does, only not well";[69] according to The Sydney Morning Herald, "Carmen Miranda appears in a straight part with only one singing number. The innovation is not a success, but the fault is the director's not Carmen's."[70]
