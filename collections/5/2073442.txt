If a motion for leave to introduce a Bill is opposed the Speaker after permitting, if he thinks fit, a brief explanatory statement from the member who opposes and from the member who moves the motion may, without further debate, put the question thereon. As soon as may be after a Bill has been introduced, the Bill unless it has already been published, is published in the Gazette.
