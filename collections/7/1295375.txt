The Evil Queen is also featured in a number of traditional games, albeit usually as a mere obstacle for the players.[115][116][117] She is, however, playable in some of them, such as Snow White and the Severn Dwarfs Game in the Disneykins franchise[118] and Disney Villains Collector's Edition Monopoly.[119]
