Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been used for a number of years to treat osteoarthritis. Their use has mostly been autologous (self); used fresh (in the form of a mixed cell population mainly sourced from adipose tissue), or expanded in number via culture; or allogeneic (non-self). The majority of their action via a paracrine effect,[14] and hence the route of administration has been mostly via intra-articular injection. In vitro, this paracrine effect has been shown to enhance type II collagen expression in OA chondrocytes while decreasing matrix metalloproteinase activity (MMP-3 and MMP-13).[15] In clinical cases, this has been shown via their anti-inflammatory/pain relieving effects. Dogs treated with adipose derived stem cell therapy have had significantly improved scores for lameness and compiled scores for pain and range of motion compared with control dogs.[16] Other randomised studies have shown similar improved results with functional limitation, range of motion, and owner and veterinary investigator visual analogue scale for pain all showing improvement.[17] Beyond this, significant improvements in MSC treated animals as measured by peak vertical force and vertical impulse in force platform have been observed.[18]
