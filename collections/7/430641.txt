The dialects of the Catalan language feature a relative uniformity, especially when compared to other Romance languages;[37] both in terms of vocabulary, semantics, syntax, morphology, and phonology.[83] Mutual intelligibility between dialects is very high,[23][84][53] estimates ranging from 90% to 95%.[85] The only exception is the isolated idiosyncratic Alguerese dialect.[37]
