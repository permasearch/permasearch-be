The first known outboard motor was a small 5 kilogram (11 lb) electric unit designed around 1870 by Gustave Trouvé,[4] and patented in May 1880 (Patent N° 136,560).[5]  Later about 25 petrol powered outboards may have been produced in 1896 by American Motors Co[4]—but neither of these two pioneering efforts appear to have had much impact.
