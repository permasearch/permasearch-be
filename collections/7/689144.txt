After the accident, Dr. Avery stays at Seattle Grace and continues his work in plastic surgery. He and Dr. Kepner continue a sexual relationship, although April frets about the indiscretion to her faith until she believes she is pregnant. When told about the baby, Dr. Avery proposes to her and she accepts, promising her the fairytale wedding she has always wanted. As it turns out, the pregnancy was false and the couple break up before announcing the news of their engagement to the rest of the staff. As a means to avoid each other, the two doctors decide to each bring a date to Dr. Bailey's wedding selecting this date for each of them, both of which are interns. At the end of the wedding, Stephanie (Jerrika Hinton) the intern and Jackson have sex in his car, after affirming how their relationship was supposed to be merely professional. Shortly afterwards he tells April he is sleeping with Stephanie and even though she is crushed she thanks him for telling her the truth. It is hinted that Jackson is still in love with April when she turns to him for dating advice and he shows signs of jealousy but they manage to reestablish their friendship. When the hospital faces a financial crisis, Jackson's mom Catherine agrees to invest in the hospital via the Harper Avery foundation on the condition that Dr. Avery become the new chairman. The board (at Jackson's prompting) later renames the hospital Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. Matthew and April get engaged but at the wedding, Jackson realizes he still loves her and stands up professing his love.
