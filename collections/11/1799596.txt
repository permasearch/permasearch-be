Aphrodite is usually said to have been born near her chief center of worship, Paphos, on the island of Cyprus, which is why she is sometimes called "Cyprian", especially in the poetic works of Sappho. However, other versions of her myth have her born near the island of Cythera, hence another of her names, "Cytherea".[78] Cythera was a stopping place for trade and culture between Crete and the Peloponesus,[79] so these stories may preserve traces of the migration of Aphrodite's cult from the Middle East to mainland Greece.[80]
