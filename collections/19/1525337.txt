The earliest reasonably reliable date for the utilization of crossbows in Europe is in ancient Greece from the 5th century BC.[31][better source needed] The historian Diodorus Siculus (fl. 1st century BC), described the invention of a mechanical arrow shooting catapult (katapeltikon) by a Greek task force in 399 BC.[32][33] According to the inventor Hero of Alexandria (fl. 1st century AD), who referred to the now lost works of the 3rd-century BC engineer Ctesibius, this weapon was inspired by an earlier hand crossbow, called the gastraphetes (belly shooter), which could store more energy than the Greek bows. A detailed description of the gastraphetes, along with a drawing, is found in Heron's technical treatise Belopoeica.[34][35] The gastraphetes was powered by a composite bow. It was cocked by resting the stomach in a concavity at the rear of the stock and pressing down with all strength. In this way, considerably more energy can be summoned up than by using only one arm of the archer as in the hand-bow. The heavy weight and bulk of the gastraphetes may have necessitated a prop to keep it standing, i.e. by mounting it on a defensive wall or using a portable prop.[36]
