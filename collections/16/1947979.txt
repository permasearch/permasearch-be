The International Thylacine Specimen Database was completed in April 2005, and is the culmination of a four-year research project to catalog and digitally photograph, if possible, all known[83][119] surviving thylacine specimen material held within museum, university and private collections. The master records are held by the Zoological Society of London.[2]
