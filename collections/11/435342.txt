In the early 1980s, "Another One Bites the Dust" was one of many popular rock songs that Christian evangelists alleged contained subliminal messages through a technique called backmasking. It was claimed that the chorus, when played in reverse, can be heard as "Decide to smoke marijuana",[16] "It's fun to smoke marijuana",[17] or "Start to smoke marijuana".[18] A spokeswoman for Hollywood Records (Queen's current US label) has denied that the song contains such a message.[19]
