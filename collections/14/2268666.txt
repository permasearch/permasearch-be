To control the waters, the corporation has posted "no trespassing" signs and issued permits to select individuals who overcome various administrative hurdles.[16] The corporation also regulates boat and operator licensing, water safety, and water quality,[17] but those regulations may not be actually binding.[16] With most land around the lake privately owned, and following a unanimous vote by the Lake Oswego City Council to bar entry to the lake from several lakefront parks,[18] few people have been able to test the authority of the corporation to enforce those regulations.[16]
