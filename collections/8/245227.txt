Chelsea travelled to the Stadium of Light for the second time in a month to face Sunderland in the quarter-final of the League Cup. Despite leading for most of the second half through a scrambled Frank Lampard finish (this goal was the first incident to require the use of hawk-eye technology in League Cup history) and barely being troubled by their opponents' attack, a late equaliser from former Chelsea man Fabio Borini pushed the game into extra time, where a 118th-minute winner from Ki Sung-yueng saw Chelsea dumped out of the Capital One Cup.[44] On 23 December, Chelsea faced a tough trip to Arsenal yet they came through it unscathed, drawing 0–0,[45] keeping their first clean sheet since the 3–0 victory over West Ham.[36] On Boxing Day, an Eden Hazard goal granted Mourinho's team a 1–0 win over Swansea City.[46] Chelsea's final game of 2013 ended in a superb victory over Liverpool. Despite going behind after three minutes, goals from Eden Hazard and Samuel Eto'o moved the Blues four points ahead of Liverpool and two points behind leaders Arsenal.[47]
