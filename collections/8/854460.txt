As the influence and profitability of CRAs expanded, so did scrutiny and concern about their performance and alleged illegal practices.[39] In 1996 the US Department of Justice launched an investigation into possible improper pressuring of issuers by Moody's in order to win business.[40][41] Agencies were subjected to dozens of lawsuits by investors complaining of inaccurate ratings[42][43] following the collapse of Enron,[12] and especially after the US subprime mortgage crisis and subsequent late-2000s financial crisis.[44][45] During that debacle, 73%—over $800 billion worth[46]—of all mortgage-backed securities that one credit rating agency (Moody's) had rated triple-A in 2006 were downgraded to junk status two years later.[46][47]
