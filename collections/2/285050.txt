In late 1924, Stalin also removed Kamenev and Zinoviev's supporters from key positions.[285] In 1925, Kamenev and Zinoviev moved into open opposition of Stalin and Bukharin.[286] They attacked one another at the 14th Party Congress, where Stalin accused Kamenev and Zinoviev of reintroducing factionalism—and thus instability—into the party.[287] In mid-1926, Kamenev and Zinoviev joined with Trotsky's supporters to form the United Opposition against Stalin;[288] in October they agreed to stop factional activity under threat of expulsion, and later publicly recanted their views under Stalin's command.[289] The factionalist arguments continued, with Stalin threatening to resign in both December 1926 and December 1927.[290] In October 1927, Zinoviev and Trotsky were removed from the Central Committee;[291] the latter was exiled to Kazakhstan and later deported from the country in 1929.[292] Some of those United Opposition members who were repentant were later rehabilitated and allowed to return to government.[293] Stalin had established himself as the party's supreme leader,[294] although was not the head of government, a task he entrusted to key ally Vyacheslav Molotov.[295] Other important supporters on the Politburo were Voroshilov, Lazar Kaganovich, and Sergo Ordzhonikidze,[296] with Stalin ensuring that his allies ran the various state institutions.[297] According to Montefiore, at this point "Stalin was the leader of the oligarchs but he was far from a dictator".[298]
