The band moved to Capitol Records and their first album for their new label was simply titled Heart (1985). The move to Capitol coincided with a glam metal makeover that included minimizing the acoustic and folk sounds characteristic of their early work.[35] The album reached number one, sold five million copies and launched four Top-10 hits:[6] "What About Love" (No. 10, 1985), "Never" (No. 4, 1985), the chart-topping "These Dreams" (1986) and "Nothin' at All" (No. 10, 1986).[29] A fifth single, "If Looks Could Kill" also charted, giving the band five hit singles from the same album for the first time.[29]
