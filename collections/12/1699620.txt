What I do know is that all of the US CNME approved schools advertise Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine which is designated by the US Department of Education "Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (NMD). Using the designation ND which the US Department of Education ascribes to "Doctor of Naturopathy (ND). In such disputes, the granting authority (in this case the US Department of Education) takes precidence. This attribution of ND to Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine is done primarily for political and legal reasons. First, some states licensing Naturopathic Medicine objected to "NMD" because it could be confused with "MD". Secondly, the last three states to regulate naturopathic medicine (ID, MN, CA) included provisions to protect traditional naturopaths right to do what is already legal for them to do. I understand the desire for advocates of Naturopathic Medicine to want to muddy the waters by claiming there is no distinction between Naturopathic Medicine and Naturopathy (aka Traditional Naturopathy)but such propaganda goes directly against wikipedias NPOV policy. With respect to adhering to wikipedias NPOV policy I see there are two choices here. 1. Degree designations can be properly ascribed according to the granting authority (Department of Education) and the politics and propaganda saved for lobbying efforts. 2 We can add a sub-section in criticism documenting the long history of propaganda used by the NANP and later the AANP to mislead and deceive legislators and the public in their attempts to obtain licensure.
