Guests arrive for the Armitages' annual get-together, where various older couples take an uncanny interest in Chris. He meets Logan King, a guest whose bizarre demeanor and familiarity unsettles him. He calls his best friend, TSA Officer Rodney "Rod" Williams, whom he tells about his hypnosis and the unusual behavior of everyone. He later tries to stealthily take a picture of Logan with his phone, but its camera flash causes Logan to suffer a nosebleed, and then hysterically yell at Chris to "Get out!" Dean claims that Logan has suffered an epileptic seizure, but Chris is skeptical. Chris and Rose go on a walk, and he persuades her to leave with him. While they are away, Dean holds a mysterious auction, a picture of Chris on display, with Jim Hudson, a blind art dealer, placing the winning bid.
