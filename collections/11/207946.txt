Focal impaired awareness seizures might arise from any lobe of the brain.[12] They most commonly arise from the mesial temporal lobe, particularly the amygdala, hippocampus, and neocortical regions.[15] A common associated brain abnormality is mesial temporal sclerosis.[13] Mesial temporal sclerosis is a specific pattern of hippocampal neuronal loss accompanied by hippocampal gliosis and atrophy.[16] Focal onset impaired awareness seizures occur when excessive and synchronous electrical brain activity causes the impaired awareness and responsiveness.[17] The abnormal electrical activity might spread to the rest of the brain and cause a focal to bilateral seizure or a generalized tonicâ€“clonic seizure.[18] The newer classification of 2017 groups only focal and generalized seizures, and generalised seizures are those that involve both sides of the brain from the onset.[6][5]
