Coldplay vocalist Chris Martin admitted that the song was developed after the band had listened to English art rock singer Kate Bush. The song's drum beat is similar to Bush's 1985 song "Running Up That Hill". Upon the song's release, it charted in the UK Singles Chart in the number two position. In the United States, it debuted at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100,[3] their first top ten hit in the country, and their most successful song until "Viva la Vida" reached number one in 2008.
