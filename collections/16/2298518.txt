As the player progresses, the hazards posed to them increase; helicopters may begin dropping explosive barrels into the sea, or fisherman may seek out the player in an attempt to end their frenzy. In addition to these foes, the shark's health constantly deteriorates and can only be restored when food is consumed; if the player goes without food for too long, the shark will die. Each shark possesses a unique ability (such as freezing breath or a boost) that can be upgraded.
