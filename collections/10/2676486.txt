Originally, Episode 3 was the only episode of this story to survive in the BBC archives.[10] On 11 October 2013, the BBC announced that the remaining five episodes had been recovered from a television relay station storage room in Nigeria[11] following search efforts by Television International Enterprises Archive and Philip Morris,[12][13] making the serial complete in the BBC television archives for the first time since the mass junkings of Doctor Who episodes between 1972 and 1978. It was subsequently released at iTunes.[1][2] It is also the second Season 5 serial to be found in its entirety.
