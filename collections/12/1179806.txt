In Ultimate Spider-Man, Gwen Stacy dies in a completely different way a few issues after she found out Spider-Man's secret identity. Walking home after a talk with Mary Jane Watson, she realized she had forgotten her key so she tried to open the door to the cellar (Peter's lab) but that was locked too. She heard rustling in the bushes so she turned around and was grabbed by small tentacles coming from Carnage, who killed her the way it killed its other victims: by absorbing the life out of her. The last thing Gwen saw before being turned into a mummy-like corpse was Carnage taking the form of a more solid form of Peter's father due to Dr. Connors mixing his and Peter's DNA with elements of the Venom suit, which was used with Richard Parker's DNA.
