In the beginning of the second movie, Johnny marries Mavis. It also marks the beginning of the Hotel being open to both humans and monsters. The first humans (besides himself) to enter are his family. Sometime later, it is revealed that Johnny has gotten Mavis pregnant and is going to be a father. They name their human/vampire hybrid Dennis, as it is a boy.
