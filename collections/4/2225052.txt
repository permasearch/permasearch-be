Following the army into the Soviet Union, the Einsatzgruppen rounded up and killed Jews and others deemed undesirable by the Nazi state.[108] Hitler was sent frequent reports.[109] In addition, 2.8 million Soviet prisoners of war died of starvation, mistreatment or executions in just eight months of 1941â€“42.[110] As many as 500,000 Soviet prisoners of war died or were executed in Nazi concentration camps over the course of the war; most of them were shot or gassed.[111] By early 1941, following Himmler's orders, ten concentration camps had been constructed in which inmates were subjected to forced labour.[112] Jews from all over Germany and the occupied territories were deported to the camps or confined to ghettos. As the Germans were pushed back from Moscow in December 1941, signalling that the expected quick defeat of the Soviet Union had failed to materialize, Hitler and other Nazi officials realised that mass deportations to the east would no longer be possible. As a result, instead of deportation, many Jews in Europe were destined for death.[113][114]
