For West Virginia “reconstruction, in a sense, began in 1861…”.[20] Unlike the other border states West Virginia did not send the majority of its soldiers to the Union.[21] The prospect of those returning ex-Confederates prompted the Wheeling state government to implement laws that restricted their right of suffrage, practicing law and teaching, access to the legal system, and subjected them to “war trespass” lawsuits.[22] The lifting of these restrictions in 1871 resulted in the election of John J. Jacob, a Democrat, to the governorship. It also led to the rejection of the war-time constitution by public vote and a new constitution written under the leadership of ex-Confederates such as Samuel Price, Allen T. Caperton and Charles James Faulkner. In 1876 the state Democratic ticket of eight candidates were all elected, seven of whom were Confederate veterans.[23] For nearly a generation West Virginia was part of the Solid South.[24][25]
