Empirical studies document that leading accounting journals publish in total fewer research articles than comparable journals in economics and other business disciplines[61], and consequently, accounting scholars are relatively less successful in academic publishing than their business school peers.[62] Due to different publication rates between accounting and other business disciplines, a recent study based on academic author rankings concludes that the competitive value of a single publication in a top-ranked journal is highest in accounting and lowest in marketing.[63]
