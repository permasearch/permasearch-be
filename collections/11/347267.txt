In South Vietnam, after the Diá»‡m regime enacted the 10/59 Decree in 1959, mobile special military courts were dispatched to the countryside in order to intimidate the rural population and they used guillotines which had belonged to the former French colonial power in order to carry out death sentences on the spot.[32] One such guillotine is still on show at the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City.[33]
