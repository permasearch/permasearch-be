VHF/UHF TV tuners are rarely found as a separate component, but are incorporated into television sets. Cable boxes and other set top boxes contain tuners for digital TV services, and send their output via SCART or other connector, or using an RF modulator (typically on channel 36 in Europe and channel 3/4 in North America) to TV receivers that do not natively support the services.  They provide outputs via composite, S-video, or component video. Many can be used with video monitors that do not have a TV tuner or direct video input.  They are often part of a VCR or digital video recorder (DVR, PVR).  Many home computers in the 1970s and 1980s used an RF modulator to connect to a TV set.
