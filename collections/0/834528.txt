Among Lubavitcher Hasidim, a gathering known as a farbrengen (Yiddish: פארברענגען‎, lit. 'gathering') is celebrated, similar to a tish. A farbrengen may be conducted with or without the presence of a Rebbe, and even with the presence of only a few Hasidim. At a farbrengen, zemiros are generally not sung (with the exception of the zemiros of the Arizal for each Sabbath meal), but rather only niggunim.
