The late-2000s financial crisis is considered by many economists to be the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.[67] It was triggered by a liquidity shortfall in the United States banking system[68] and has resulted in the collapse of large financial institutions, the bailout of banks by national governments, and downturns in stock markets around the world. In many areas, the housing market has also suffered, resulting in numerous evictions, foreclosures and prolonged vacancies. It contributed to the failure of key businesses, declines in consumer wealth estimated in the trillions of U.S. dollars, and a significant decline in economic activity, leading to a severe global economic recession in 2008.[69]
