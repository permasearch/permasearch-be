As of 2015, Hoppus has switched to customized Fender Jaguar Basses when performing on stage with Blink-182, although he still occasionally uses his signature model[55]. For live sound, Hoppus plugs his basses into three Ampeg SVT Classic bass heads running into two Ampeg 8x10 SVT bass cabs. Prior to the use of the all-tube SVT Classic heads, Hoppus used two Ampeg SVT-4 Pro heads which only feature a tube preamp.[56] As of the Neighborhoods album release, Hoppus has been using New Vintage amplifiers and cabinets, specifically the Undertow 300 amplifier and NW 8x10 bass cabinets.[57]
