In her review of the film, Melina Newman of Billboard called the ballad "stunning".[7] The magazine's Tatiana Cirisano ranked Lady Gaga's performance of "I'll Never Love Again" as the film's best scene and wrote, "Not only are the lyrics devastatingly beautiful, but Gaga/Ally showcases her full, skyscraper-high range."[8] Jon Pareles of The New York Times compared the song to Harry Nilsson's "Without You" and Eric Carmen's "All by Myself" , and complimented Gaga's "old-school finesse, timing, emotionality and lung power".[9] Pitchfork's Larry Fitzmaurice called the song a "stunning, heart-wrenching closer" and wrote, "... even though 'I'll Never Love Again' is plenty effective on its own, the dialogue-included version of the song dramatically cuts out in its final seconds the same way the film does: jumping back in time from Gagaâ€™s time-stopping performance to a pivotal and heartbreaking scene that only enhances the song's emotional quotient".[10]
