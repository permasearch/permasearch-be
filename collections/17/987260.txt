The U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed Puerto Rican citizenship in Gonzales v. Williams (1904), which denied that Puerto Ricans were United States citizens and labeled them as non-citizen US nationals.[8] This ruling effectively protected Puerto Ricans from conscription in the United States. In March 1917, while preparing to enter World War I, President Woodrow Wilson signed the Jonesâ€“Shafroth Act, which gave Puerto Ricans citizenship of the United States and allowed popular election of the Senate of Puerto Rico.[6] After the President declared war in April 1917, many Puerto Ricans were then drafted.
