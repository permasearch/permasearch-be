Warren took a hard stance against labor in the buildup to the San Francisco General Strike. In Whitney v. California (1927) Warren prosecuted a woman under the California Criminal Syndicalism Act for attending a communist meeting in Oakland.[6] When in 1936 the killer of a ship officer escaped, Warren successfully prosecuted union organizers on the ship of the murder. As governor, Warren later pardoned the seamen, Earl King, Ernest Ramsay, and Frank Conner, hours before leaving office.[7]
