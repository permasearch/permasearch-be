Except for close-up and macro photography, the effect of lens asymmetry is minimal. At unity magnification, however, the errors from neglecting the pupil magnification can be significant. Consider a telephoto lens with     P = 0.5   {\displaystyle P=0.5}   and a retrofocus wide-angle lens with     P = 2   {\displaystyle P=2}  , at     m = 1.0   {\displaystyle m=1.0}  . The asymmetrical-lens formula gives      D O F  = 6 N c   {\displaystyle \mathrm {DOF} =6Nc}   and      D O F  = 3 N c   {\displaystyle \mathrm {DOF} =3Nc}  , respectively. The symmetrical lens formula gives      D O F  = 4 N c   {\displaystyle \mathrm {DOF} =4Nc}   in either case. The errors are âˆ’33% and 33%, respectively.
