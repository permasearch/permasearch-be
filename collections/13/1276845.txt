The 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics were held in an Olympic Park created on former industrial land around the River Lea. It is intended that this should leave a legacy of new sports facilities, housing, and industrial and technical infrastructure that will further help regenerate the area.[6] This is linked to a new Stratford International station in the Newham, and the future Stratford City development.[162] Also in Newham is London City Airport, built in 1986 in the former King George V Dock, a small airport serving short-haul domestic and European destinations.  In the same area, the University of East London has developed a new campus which provided the United States Olympic Team its training base during the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.[163] The Queen Mary campus has expanded into new accommodation both adjacent to its existing site at Mile End, and with specialist medical campuses at the Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel and at Charterhouse Square in the City. Whitechapel is the base for the London Air Ambulance, and the hospital's clinical facilities are undergoing a Â£1 billion refurbishment and expansion.[164]
