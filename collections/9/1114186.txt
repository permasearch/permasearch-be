Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the song a perfect 5/5 review, stating: "Long before Britney knocked us for six with that head-spinning dubstep breakdown on her comeback hit, Chase & Status had a few startling syncopated moments of their own, you know. In fact, we could happily spend the weekend drawing up a neat 'Six Degrees of Dubstep' table to show how, two years since the London duo's debut, the genre's gone from scuzzy underground raves to the sound of choice for pop's A-listers. Of course, there are no double entendres or Spears-style vocal trickery here â€“ just a straight-up grime/dance crossover cut that's both thumpingly energetic and beautifully uplifiting. Guest crooner Liam Bailey's soulful vocals are both soaring and cinematic, while the Yolanda Quartey-helmed chorus sounds like a million '90s club classics rolled into one. Seventeen spins on, it's got us as excited as a Grandad-on-viagra for tonight's dancefloor debauchery.".[1]
