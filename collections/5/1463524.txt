Service: Unbeknownst to the chefs, their families (Michael's wife and in-laws, Jessica's girlfriend, sister and mother, and Ralph's fiance and his mother and uncle) attended service, having the chance to select their favorite without knowing who made it. Despite Jessica struggling with desserts, service was completed and every customer was served. Michael's tuna received five votes from the family members, compared to three for Ralph's filet mignon and one for Jessica's chicken.
