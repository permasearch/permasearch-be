This procession reenacts the journey of the Myrrhbearers to the Tomb of Jesus "very early in the morning".[84] After circling around the temple once or three times, the procession halts in front of the closed doors. In the Greek practice the priest reads a selection from the Gospel Book.[85] Then, in all traditions, the priest makes the sign of the cross with the censer in front of the closed doors (which represent the sealed tomb).
