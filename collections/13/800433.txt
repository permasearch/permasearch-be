The current account shows the net amount of a country's income if it is in surplus, or spending if it is in deficit. It is the sum of the balance of trade (net earnings on exports minus payments for imports), factor income (earnings on foreign investments minus payments made to foreign investors)  and cash transfers. It is called the current account as it covers transactions in the "here and now" â€“ those that don't give rise to future claims.[3]
