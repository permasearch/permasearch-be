A study by Jochemsen and Keown, from the Dutch Lindeboom Institute [30] published in the peer reviewed Journal of Medical Ethics, argued that euthanasia in the Netherlands is not well controlled and that there is still a significant percentage of cases of euthanasia practiced illegally.[24] Raanan Gillon, from the Imperial College School of Medicine, University of London commented that "what is shown by the empirical findings is that restrictions on euthanasia that legal controls in the Netherlands were supposed to have implemented are being extensively ignored and from that point of view it is surely justifiable to conclude, as Jochemsen and Keown do conclude, that the practice of euthanasia in the Netherlands is in poor control".[31] A similar conclusion was presented by Herbert Hendin, who argued that the situation in The Netherlands demonstrated a slippery slope in practice, changing the attitudes of doctors over time and moving them from tightly regulated voluntary euthanasia for the terminally ill to the acceptance of euthanasia for people suffering from psychological distress, and from voluntary euthanasia to the acceptance of non-voluntary and potentially involuntary euthanasia.[32]
