Some of the more well studied genes central to these repair processes are shown in the chart.  The gene designations shown in red, gray or cyan indicate genes frequently epigenetically altered in various types of cancers.  Wikipedia articles on each of the genes highlighted by red, gray or cyan describe the epigenetic alteration(s) and the cancer(s) in which these epimutations are found.  Two review articles,[105][108] and two broad experimental survey articles[109][110] also document most of these epigenetic DNA repair deficiencies in cancers.
