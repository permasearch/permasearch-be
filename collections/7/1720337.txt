Eventually, the trio dubbed themselves America, chosen because they did not want anyone to think they were British musicians trying to sound American.[2] They played their first gigs in the London area, including some highlights at the Roundhouse, Chalk Farm. Through Ian Samwell and Jeff Dexter's efforts they were eventually contracted to Kinney Records (UK) in March 1971 by Ian Ralfini and assigned to the UK Warner Brothers label.
