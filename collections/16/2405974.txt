A segment of The Bullwinkle Show, called "Bullwinkle's Corner," had the star moose recite such poetry, ostensibly as a means of promoting classic literature in an otherwise-vulgar comedy.  In its rendition, the Queen of Hearts (Rocky the Flying Squirrel) made tarts: "Soybean, rutabaga, asparagus and turnip.  I'm using my new health-food cookbook!"  The King (Bullwinkle Moose) replied, "Turnip TARTS?!?  YUCK!"  Whereupon the Knave of Hearts (Boris Badenov) stole them.  Captured by the King, the Knave "...vowed he'd steal no more."  But the King had other ideas.  "You're not getting off THAT easy!" he warned.  "You STOLE 'em, friend...you EAT 'em!"
