Notre Dame has traditionally played Division I FBS football independent from any conference affiliation. In its early years joining a conference, in particular the geographically-contiguous Big Ten Conference, would have provided stability and scheduling opportunities.[5] Conferences have periodically approached Notre Dame about joining,[15] most notably the Big Ten in 1999.[16] Notre Dame elected to keep its independent status in football, partially due to the Big Ten refusing to schedule the Irish, feeling that it has contributed to Notre Dame's unique place in college football lore. Subsequently, Notre Dame has developed close relationships with several schools from various conferences to fill its schedule. With Notre Dame's agreement to play the ACC for 5 games per year, the future of some of these series is unknown. The following is a list of Notre Dame's more frequent opponents and a synopsis of the series history.
