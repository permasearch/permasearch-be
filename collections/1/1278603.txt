According to Edmunds.com, the price premium paid for the Fusion Hybrid takes 5 years to recover in fuel savings as compared to its non-hybrid sibling, and is one of the quickest payback periods among top selling hybrids as of February 2012. Edmunds compared the hybrid version priced at US$27,678 with a comparably-equipped gasoline-powered Fusion priced at US$24,493 and found that the payback period is 6 years for gasoline at US$3 per gallon, 4 years at US$4 per gallon, and drops to 3 years with gasoline prices at US$5 per gallon. These estimates assume an average of 15,000 mi (24,000 km) annual driving and vehicle prices correspond to Edmunds.com's true market value estimates.[49] For the same two vehicles, the U.S. EPA estimates the Fusion Hybrid annual fuel cost at US$1,431 while the gasoline-powered Fusion has an annual fuel cost of US$2,320. EPA estimates are based on 45% highway and 55% city driving, over 15,000 annual miles, and gasoline price of US$3.72 per gallon, the national average as of February 2012.[50] The Lincoln MKZ Hybrid has no price premium.[49]
