The recording medium should be able to resolve fully all the fringes arising from interference between object and reference beam. These fringe spacings can range from tens of micrometers to less than one micrometer, i.e. spatial frequencies ranging from a few hundred to several thousand cycles/mm, and ideally, the recording medium should have a response which is flat over this range. photographic film has a very low or even zero response at the frequencies involved and cannot be used to make a hologram – see, for example, Kodak's professional black and white film[33] whose resolution starts falling off at 20 lines/mm — it is unlikely that any reconstructed beam could be obtained using this film.
