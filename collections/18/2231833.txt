The Guardian of Light may be played with a single player, and a second player may join at any time, whether online or locally.[7] In the single-player campaign the only playable character is Lara; Totec cannot assist and Lara has all the tools required along with new abilities to make it through her own unique adventure.[8][10] Puzzles and parts of the map are also different.[8] Creative director Daniel Neuberger said that this was because he did not want the player to get frustrated by having to rely on AI.[10] The campaign features eight to ten hours of gameplay.[11]
