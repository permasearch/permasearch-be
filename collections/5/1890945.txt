Despite beating the Wallabies, the English were still heavily tipped to lose, mainly because the French were expected to challenge more upfront. Five victories in the last six matches also meant that recent track record was in favour of France. England had not won in Paris since 2000. The game began 21:00 local time and within two minutes a box kick by English scrumhalf Andy Gomarsall was not dealt with by French full-back Damien Traille and Josh Lewsey capitalized with a try. Jonny Wilkinson missed the conversion to the left. Two penalties before half time by Lionel Beauxis gave the French a slender advantage.
