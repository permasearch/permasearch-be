Three more deaths occurred in 1986 from tampered gelatin capsules.[19] A woman died in Yonkers, New York, after ingesting "Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules laced with cyanide".[20] Excedrin capsules in Washington state were tampered with, resulting in the deaths of Susan Snow and Bruce Nickell from cyanide poisoning and the eventual arrest and conviction of Nickell's wife, Stella, of crimes connected to both deaths[21] That same year, Procter & Gamble's Encaprin was recalled after a spiking hoax in Chicago and Detroit that resulted in a precipitous sales drop and a withdrawal of the pain reliever from the market.[22]
