Arms manufacturer Norinco, of the People's Republic of China, has made unlicensed copies of the Remington 870 as the design is no longer under patent protection. The most common of these designs are the Norinco HP9-1 and M-98, the difference being that the HP9-1 has either a 12.5" or 14" barrel, whereas the M-98 has an 18.5" barrel.[11] In the United States, where most Norinco products are specifically non-importable,[12] this shotgun was imported and sold under the names Norinco Hawk 982 and Interstate Hawk 982.[13]
