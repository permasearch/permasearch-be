A study in 2016 proposed that large theropods like Tyrannosaurus had teeth covered in lips like extant lizards instead of bare teeth like crocodilians. This was based on the presence of enamel, which according to the study needs to remain hydrated, an issue not faced by aquatic animals like crocodilians or toothless animals like birds.[39][40]
