The Iroquois influence extended from northern New York into what are now southern Ontario and the Montreal area of modern Quebec.[29] The Iroquois Confederacy is, from oral tradition, formed circa 1142.[30] Adept at cultivating Three Sisters (maize/beans/squash), the Iroquois became powerful because of their confederacy. Gradually the Algonquians adopted agricultural practises enabling larger populations to be sustained.
