The letter may have been written by Paul at Rome during his first imprisonment.[7] Other scholars have suggested that it was written from Caesarea or Ephesus.[8] If the letter is not considered to be an authentic part of the Pauline corpus, then it might be dated during the late 1st century, possibly as late as AD 80.[9]
