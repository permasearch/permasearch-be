Such infection does not produce symptoms in 90% of cases, and produces a sore throat in the remaining 10%.[14][15] In advanced cases, gonorrhea may cause a general feeling of tiredness similar to other infections.[13] It is also possible for an individual to have an allergic reaction to the bacteria, in which case any appearing symptoms will be greatly intensified.[13]
