The third match was the encounter of Marc Mero against a mystery opponent chosen by Sable, where if Sable's representative lost, she would have to leave the WWF.[18][19] After Mero was introduced, Sable came out and told Mero that she did not need a man to fight for her, insisting she would fight Mero.[6][7] Mero then lay down and allowed Sable to pin him. However, he reversed the pin at a two count and rolled Sable into a small package, winning the match via pinfall. This forced Sable to leave the WWF.[5][20][21]
