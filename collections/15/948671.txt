The tone of baseball rivalries changed in the early 1990s; fraternization between players who had moved to different teams or knew each other from various ventures kept baseball rivalries to a "friendly" level.[151] Major League Baseball's 1994 divisional re-alignment solidified the rivalry between the Yankees and Red Sox. Prior to the realignment, the American League East Division contained seven teams, spread out over a wider geographical area, including the Cleveland Indians and the Milwaukee Brewers.
