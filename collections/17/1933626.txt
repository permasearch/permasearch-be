Many techniques are used to analyze music. Metaphor and figurative description may be a part of analysis, and a metaphor used to describe pieces, "reifies their features and relations in a particularly pungent and insightful way: it makes sense of them in ways not formerly possible." (Guck 1994, 71) Even absolute music may be viewed as a, "metaphor for the universe," or nature as, "perfect form" (Dahlhaus 1989, 8, 29 cited in Bauer 2004, 131).
