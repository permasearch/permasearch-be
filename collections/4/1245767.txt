Over 7,000 Canadian soldiers and support personnel were involved in the second Boer war from October 1899 to May 1902.[95] With approximately 7,368[96] soldiers in a combat situation, the conflict became the largest military engagement involving Canadian soldiers from the time of Confederation until the Great War.[95] Eventually, 270 soldiers died in the course of the Boer War.[95] The Canadian public was initially divided on the decision to go to war as some citizens did not want Canada to become Britain's 'tool' for engaging in armed conflicts. Many Anglophone citizens were pro-Empire, and wanted the Prime Minister, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, to support the British in their conflict. On the other hand, many Francophone citizens felt threatened by the continuation of British Imperialism to their national sovereignty.[97]
