The key distinctions between HANA and previous generation SAP systems are that it is a column-oriented, in-memory database, that combines OLAP and OLTP operations into a single system.[26] Storing data in main memory rather on disk provides faster data access and, by extension, faster querying and processing.[27] While storing data in-memory confers performance advantages, it is a more costly form data storage. Observing data access patterns, up to 85% of data in an enterprise system may be infrequently accessed[27] therefore it can be cost-effective to store frequently accessed, or "hot", data in-memory while the less frequently accessed "warm" data is stored on disk, an approach SAP have term "Dynamic tiering".[28]
