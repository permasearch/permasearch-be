In Ecuador, Anna was forced to remain in Sonny's jet because she was wanted in Port Charles. Paul called Anna while she waited for Sonny to return. She quickly realized that he hoped Sonny would kill Carlos. Anna knew if Sonny killed Carlos, Paul would charge her and Sonny with murder when they returned to Port Charles. She accused Paul of trying to save his own skin because Carlos knew that Paul had killed Kyle. Sonny found Carlos in a church, dressed as a priest. After a brief standoff, Anna burst into the church to stop Sonny from killing Carlos. Carlos took advantage of the distraction and lunged at Sonny. A brief struggle ensued, followed by a gunshot. Carlos had been hit in the shoulder. Anna handcuffed Carlos, and they all boarded Sonny's plane back to Port Charles.
