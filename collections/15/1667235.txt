The paintings were most often made on wood, but sometimes on the less expensive canvas.[C] The wood was usually oak, often imported from the Baltic region, with the preference for radially cut boards which are less likely to warp. Typically the sap was removed and the board well-seasoned before use.[53] Wood supports allow for dendrochronological dating, and the particular use of Baltic oak gives clues as to the artist's location.[54] The panels generally show very high degrees of craftsmanship. Lorne Campbell notes that most are "beautifully made and finished objects. It can be extremely difficult to find the joins".[55] Many paintings' frames were altered, repainted or gilded in the 18th and early 19th centuries when it was common practice to break apart hinged Netherlandish pieces so they could be sold as genre pieces. Many surviving panels are painted on both sides or with the reverse bearing family emblems, crests or ancillary outline sketches. In the case of single panels, the markings on the reverse are often wholly unrelated to the obverse and may be later additions, or as Campbell speculates, "done for the artist's amusement".[53] Painting each side of a panel was practical since it prevented the wood from warping.[56] Usually the frames of hinged works were constructed before the individual panels were worked on.[55]
