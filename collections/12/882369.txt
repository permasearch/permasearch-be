Like the rest of the country and much of the world, Kentucky faced great difficulty with the arrival of the Great Depression in the late 1920s to early 1930s. There was widespread unemployment and little economic growth. The people of Harlan County fought in the first Harlan County Coal War, against the coal owners. Unions would eventually be established, and working conditions improved immediately.[6]
