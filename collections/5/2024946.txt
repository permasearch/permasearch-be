The most expensive residential areas stand along the coast in suburbs such as Larrakeyah and Brinkin,[23] despite the slight risk these low-lying regions face during cyclones and higher tides.[24] The inner northern suburbs of Millner and Coconut Grove and the eastern suburb of Karama are home to lower-income households, although low-income Territory Housing units are scattered throughout the metropolitan area.[25] The suburb of Lyon was an addition to the Northern Suburbs. Development and construction took place in 2009 and 2010 and became home for a number of affluent Darwin residents and local/recently posted military families above the rank of Sergeant or Flying Officer.
