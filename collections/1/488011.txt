In the season 8 premiere, with Brennan on the run, Clark has been appointed to her position of Chief Forensic Anthropologist at the Jeffersonian. He is running a tighter ship than Brennan did, which Angela and Hodgins are resisting. Cam supports him and reminds the pair that all of them, including Clark, are working to clear Brennan's name so that she can return home. Once Brennan is cleared of the charges, he is relieved to return the position to her. Cam makes an announcement: The Jeffersonian needs two forensic anthropologists - one to solve crimes and one to do archaeological work, which allows Clark to take up the new archaeological anthropology position and remain at the Jeffersonian while Dr. Brennan returns to solving crimes. He reappears in "The Archaeologist in the Cocoon", where he assumes custody of prehistoric human remains, and he and Brennan clash over who should be working with them. In "The Shot in the Dark", after Brennan is shot in the Bone Room, Clark steps in to continue where she left off while she's in the hospital. During this episode, in a conversation with Hodgins and Sweets, Clark reveals that his middle name is "Thomas", and they joke that essentially his name is "Thomas Edison".
