There are a number of components that make the Holy War particularly fierce. The University of Utah and Brigham Young University are the two biggest colleges in the state of Utah. There is a stark contrast between the campuses and student bodies, as one is a religious institution while the other is a public university. As the name of the rivalry implies, religion is a large component to the rivalry. Brigham Young University is owned by the LDS church, and thus imposes religious restrictions upon its students. Although both are dry campuses, variation between the religious student body at BYU and more lax, traditional university student body of Utah creates further animosity between the two schools. The long length of rivalry is also a major element.[1]
