The episode was written by Jennifer Crittenden, and directed by Swinton O. Scott III.[1] This was the first episode Scott directed for the show.[4] Crittenden also made her debut as a writer for The Simpsons in this episode. Crittenden was taking a beginners' writing program at 20th Century Fox when former The Simpsons showrunner David Mirkin hired her on the show.[5] Crittenden's only writing experience before that had been as an intern on the Late Show with David Letterman.[5] 20th Century Fox introduced Crittenden to Mirkin, and Mirkin read a script of hers that he liked.[5] When Mirkin first talked to Crittenden, he thought she was a really nice woman who was very mature.[5] Crittenden was only 23 years old at the time, but Mirkin liked her and he hired her.[5]
