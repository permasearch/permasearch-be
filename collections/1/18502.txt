Statistical significance test: "Very roughly, the procedure for deciding goes like this: Take a random sample from the population.  If the sample data are consistent with the null hypothesis, then do not reject the null hypothesis; if the sample data are inconsistent with the null hypothesis, then reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the alternative hypothesis is true."[5]
