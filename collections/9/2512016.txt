As of 2013[update] ownership of the parking lot and land access to the pier was transferred to Foster City.[52] Initial concepts for the newly acquired space included a possible ice rink[53] and ferry terminal, but the land was deemed too environmentally sensitive to support high-intensity use.[54] The park carried an interim name of Werder Park,[55] and was dedicated as Bridgeview Park for a grand opening on June 27, 2015 (2015-06-27).[56]
