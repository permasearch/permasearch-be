The music video of this song tells a story of a car accident on a rainy evening where a young male drunk driver crashed his sedan head-on into a Trans Am driven by a female, resulting in her death. The drunk driver, however, survives relatively uninjured, and ends up captured by the FBI and BATF. The video was filmed near the famous tunnel in Griffith Park.
