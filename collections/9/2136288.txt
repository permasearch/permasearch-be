The giant anteater is the most terrestrial of the living anteater species. Its ancestors may originally have been adapted to arboreal life;[9] the transition to life on the ground could have been aided by the expansion of open habitats such as savanna in South America and the availability there of colonial insects, such as termites, that provided a larger potential food source. Both the giant anteater and the southern tamandua are well represented in the fossil record of the late Pleistocene and early Holocene.[8]
