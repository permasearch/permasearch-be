A Cameron Mackintosh-produced version of Avenue Q premiered in 2006 in the West End at the NoÃ«l Coward Theatre (formerly the Albery Theatre). Several adaptive changes were made for British audiences, including portrayal of the Gary Coleman character by a male actor. The production ran 1,179 performances through March 2009, then reopened in June 2009 at the Gielgud Theatre. After a further 327 performances, the show moved in March 2010 to the Wyndham's Theatre,[29][30] where it closed on October 30, 2010 after a five-year run.[31]
