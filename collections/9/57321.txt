In the first act for the evening was loosely based on the theme of Eklavya from Mahabharat. Bharadwaj played the role of an aspiring boxer Amrita, and Ahlawat was portrayed as the boxing Guru who urges her to lose her final fight so that his disciple can win. However, there was a twist at the end, and Ahlawatâ€™s character realizes that he is disgracing his role as a coach, and urges her to win. Johar advised Ahlawat to create a connect with the co-actor while performing. Ranaut was very moved with the performance, and stated that she was choking with emotions by the time the act ended. Alhawat scored fourteen out of twenty and Bharadwaj got a high eighteen.
