There has been some financial conflict between the USOC and International Olympic Committee (IOC), with some pointing out the frequent leadership changes of USOC, and USOC trying to broadcast the Olympics using its own television network, which the IOC discouraged. USOC president Peter Ueberroth allegedly stonewalled a negotiation between IOC and USOC to discuss the revenue sharing of the US broadcasts with IOC. Under a long-standing contract, the USOC has received a 20 percent share of global sponsorship revenue and a 12.75 percent cut of U.S. broadcast rights deals. The IOC believed the U.S. share, set out in an open-ended contract dating to 1996, was excessive and should be renegotiated. The USOC argued that it saved the Olympic movement by hosting the most financially successful Games in the history of the Olympics in 1984. The failure of the 2012 and 2016 US Olympic bids[20] was partly blamed by some on USOC.[21][22][23] For instance, NBC television executive Dick Ebersol said after the failed 2016 bid, "This was the IOC membership saying to the USOC there will be no more domestic Olympics until you join the Olympic movement".[24] A new revenue-sharing agreement was signed in 2012.[25]
