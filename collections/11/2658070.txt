Edward Doty - (Name per Morton, 1669: Edward Doten) He was from London and came as a servant of Stephen Hopkins, also from London. Per author Caleb Johnson, his quick temper was the primary cause of numerous civil disturbances recorded against him in the more-than 30 years he lived in the colony. One of the first recorded was in June 1621 when he was in a sword and dagger fight with fellow Hopkins servant Edward Leister, where both were lightly wounded and sentenced to public punishment.[109][110][111]
