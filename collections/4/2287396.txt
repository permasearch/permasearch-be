In 2011 at the Orange County Fair in Costa Mesa, California, deep-fried butter was paired with chocolate-covered bacon and dubbed the "coronary combo." ABC News made a comparison regarding the pricing of this food pairing, stating, "the $10.50 price rivaled some health plans' co-payments for a visit to a cardiologist."[1] This dish has also been served at other events and venues, such as the State Fair of Virginia[9][10] and the Musikfest music festival in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.[11]
