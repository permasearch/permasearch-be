Ezra tells Aria about Spencer's addiction. Spencer, Emily and Hanna plan to tell Aria that Ezra is "A." Aria shows Emily and Hanna the file Ezra gave her in secret about Spencer's previous addiction two years ago. They stage an intervention, but it does not go well and Spencer blurts out that Ezra is "A" to Aria. Mike and Mona grow closer and Mona distances herself from Ezra, telling him she can't help him anymore. Feeling uncertain, Aria digs for answers at Ezra's cabin and finds notes about his relationship with Alison. She assumes the worst and tries to run away, but Ezra catches up to her and traps her in a ski lift at a nearby lodge. Spencer, Emily and Hanna set a trap for "A" to retrieve the money for Alison that Emily placed in a coffee bag for Shana to take to Ali. But "A" sets a trap for them, too, locking them in the reptile pavilion at a zoo in Norristown. Ezra confesses the truth to Aria - that he knew about her and how old she was before he started teaching at Rosewood High, that he knew Alison before she disappeared, and that he's been watching her and her friends as research for a book about Ali. But Aria doesn't believe him and thinks their whole relationship has been a ruse. Ezra knocks the pages of his novel about Ali from Aria's hand. They fall to the ground several feet below.
