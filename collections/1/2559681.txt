where          R  i    →    =    r →    −     r →     i     {\displaystyle {\vec {\mathcal {R_{i}}}}={\vec {r}}-{\vec {r}}_{i}}   is the distance of each charge      Q  i     {\displaystyle Q_{i}}   from the test charge     q   {\displaystyle q}  , which situated at the point        r →      {\displaystyle {\vec {r}}}  , and     ϕ (    r →    )   {\displaystyle \phi ({\vec {r}})}   is the electric potential that would be at        r →      {\displaystyle {\vec {r}}}   if the test charge were not present. If only two charges are present, the potential energy is      k  e    Q  1    Q  2    /  r   {\displaystyle k_{e}Q_{1}Q_{2}/r}  . The total electric potential energy due a collection of N charges is calculating by assembling these particles one at a time:
