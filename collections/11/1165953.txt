The coordinate time      t  c     {\displaystyle t_{c}}   is the time that would be read on a hypothetical "coordinate clock" situated infinitely far from all gravitational masses (    U = 0   {\displaystyle U=0}  ), and stationary in the system of coordinates (    v = 0   {\displaystyle v=0}  ). The exact relation between the rate of proper time and the rate of coordinate time for a clock with a radial component of velocity is
