And I have regretted the separation of our companionship :: An eon, and tears flooded my eyes And I’ve sworn if time brought us back together :: I’ll never utter any separation with my tongue Joy conquered me to the point of :: which it made me happy that I cried Oh eye, the tears out of you became a principle :: You cry out of joy and out of sadness
