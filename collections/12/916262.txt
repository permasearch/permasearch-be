La Grange Lock and Dam is a lock and dam complex on the Illinois River at Versailles, Illinois. The structure includes a 1,066 feet (325 m) dam and a 110 by 600 feet (34 by 183 m) lock. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built the complex from 1936 to 1939; A.F. Griffin designed the lock and dam, while Paul Le Gromwell designed the control station. The lock and dam, as well as a similar lock and dam near Peoria, were constructed in response to a Supreme Court order limiting the amount of water which could be diverted from Lake Michigan via the river. The lock uses Chanoine wicket gates, which allow for navigation on the river, rather than the Tainter gates seen elsewhere on the river.[2][3]
