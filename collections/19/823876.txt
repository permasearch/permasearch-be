An early script was leaked onto the internet in March 2008, leading to a review by Ain't It Cool News which called it "[not] just a good adaptation of a difficult book [but] a genre-defining piece of work that could well see us all arguing about whether or not a zombie movie qualifies as 'Best Picture' material".[17] The script was well-enough respected to find a place on the 2007 Black List of "most liked" screenplays not yet produced.[18] The Ain't It Cool News review also noted the film appears stylistically similar to Children of Men, following Gerry Lane as he travels the post-war world and interviews survivors of the zombie war who are "starting to wonder if survival is a victory of any kind."[17] Straczynski had hoped that the film would begin production by the start of 2009.[12] In March 2009, Forster said that the script was still in development and he was not sure if World War Z would be his next film.[19] Later in March, rumors surfaced that production offices were set up and the film was in early pre-production.[20] In June 2009, Marc Forster told an interviewer that the film would be delayed, stating that the film's script still needs a lot of development and is "still far from realization".[21]
