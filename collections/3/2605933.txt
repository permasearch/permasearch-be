The flag shows a white band between two blue stripes, representing the land between two oceans. The coat of arms shows five mountains (one for each state) between two oceans, surmounted by a Phrygian cap, the emblem of the French Revolution. The flag was introduced to the area by Commodore Louis-Michel Aury inspired by the Argentine flag, also adopting the term united provinces, used in Argentina's original name, Provincias Unidas del RÃ­o de la Plata ("United Provinces of the Silver River").
