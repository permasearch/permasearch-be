Both brothers were convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. In the penalty phase of the trial, the jury chose sentences for the brothers of life in prison without the possibility of parole rather than death. The jury later said that the abuse defense was never a factor in its deliberations and that it rejected the death penalty because neither brother had a felony record or a history of violence. Unlike the juries in the previous trials, the jury in the penalty phase unanimously rejected the defense's theory that the brothers killed their parents out of fear. It believed that the brothers had committed the murders with the intent to gain control over their father's considerable wealth.[26]
