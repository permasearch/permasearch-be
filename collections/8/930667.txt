The voyages were diplomatic, militaristic, and commercial in nature.[150] They were conducted to establish imperial control over the maritime trade,[2][138] to bring the maritime trade into the tributary system,[151] and to force foreign countries into compliance within the tributary system.[138][151][152] The diplomatic aspect comprised the announcement of the Yongle Emperor's accession to the throne, the establishment of hegemony over the foreign countries, and providing safe passage to foreign envoys who came bearing tribute.[153]
