Keaton has had several romantic associations with noted entertainment industry personalities, starting with her time with the Broadway production of Play It Again, Sam when she auditioned for director Woody Allen. Their association became personal following a dinner after a late-night rehearsal. It was her sense of humor that attracted Allen.[103] They briefly lived together during the Broadway production, but by the time of the film release of the same name in 1972, their living arrangements became informal.[104] They worked together on eight films between 1971 and 1993, and Keaton has said that Allen remains one of her closest friends.[22]
