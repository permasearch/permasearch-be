Proponents of heavier requirements[who?] argue that they are necessary for the societal goal of an educated public that is prepared to participate in democratic society. No scientific studies, however, indicate that heavier requirements produce better results. In general, standardized test scores in states with high requirements are no better than in states with lower requirements casting doubt on the wisdom of placing high requirements on homeschooling since higher requirements create higher administrative costs.[citation needed]
