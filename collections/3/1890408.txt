In 1994 GM ceased production of Bedford Vehicles because their profits were decreasing over time. Bedford Vehicles had been Vauxhall's commercial vehicle arm, making successful vans, trucks and lorries since the 1930s.  The last "true" Bedford light commercials – the Bedford HA and Bedford CF panel vans – had already ceased production in 1983 and 1987 respectively, and had been replaced by licence-built versions of Isuzu and Suzuki vans such as the Midi and Rascal.  Production of these models continued at Luton, now badged Vauxhall but built by a separate company named IBC (Isuzu-Bedford Commercials).  Also in 1994, the Vauxhall Carlton nameplate was abandoned after 16 years, and Omega took its place, becoming the first model to feature the new corporate "v" grille. Vauxhall also added another vehicle to its four-wheel drive line-up in the shape of the Isuzu-based Monterey. Vauxhall joined the expanding "compact coupé" market with its new Corsa-based Tigra model.
