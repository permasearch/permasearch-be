On Halloween, when Kathy shuts up the cafÃ©, she is startled when James comes in. As James acts casual, Kathy takes hold of a knife and James tells Kathy he has been diagnosed with terminal liver cancer. Kathy rubbishes James' beliefs that they are alike and James says the reason for his visit is to move on from the past. Kathy wants James to explain truthfully what happened on the night of the rape, but when he refuses to do so, Kathy retells it, demanding to know when he decided to rape her and she realises that James chose to rape her when he locked up The Dagmar. Kathy tells James that he has scared her that night like the night he raped her, but James, still in denial, refuses to apologise for the rape and he leaves Kathy his address. Luke attends Ben's half-sister's, Louise Mitchell (Tilly Keeper), birthday meal to make sure Phil knows nothing about James seeing Kathy, believing Kathy would tell him. Luke contacts James to inform him that Phil is unaware. Kathy confides in Ian that James is back and Ian contacts Phil about James. Phil visits James and warns him away from Kathy. Phil realises Luke is James' son when he finds a photo of them. Phil tells Kathy that Luke is James' son and Phil fails to warn Luke away from Ben. Ben is angry with what Phil did and when Kathy tries to get Ben and Phil to make up, Kathy tells Ben that Phil was protecting him as James raped her. After struggling to process what he is told, Ben is determined to hurt James, but Kathy orders Ben to keep out of it as it happened to her and not him. Ben confronts Luke with what he has been told and Luke tells Ben that James wants to meet him.
