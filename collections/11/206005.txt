One of the producers, Miles Dale, said that the film is "the biggest movie ever identifiably set in Toronto."[22] The film features Casa Loma, St. Michael's College School, Sonic Boom, the Toronto Public Library Wychwood Library, a Goodwill location on St. Clair West, a Second Cup, and a Pizza Pizza. The developers planned to set the series in Toronto because, in Dale's words, "the books are super-specific in their local details" and director Wright wanted to use the imagery from the books, so Universal Studios had no plans to alter the setting.[22] Dale stated that "Bathurst Street is practically the cerebral cortex of Scott Pilgrim".[22]
