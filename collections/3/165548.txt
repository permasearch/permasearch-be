Terry discovers the Joker to be a formidable combatant since he has extensive knowledge of Bruce's tactics. Terry improvises by using his own street fighting maneuvers and taunting the Joker's obsession with Bruce as well as his origin, sending the Joker into a fury to put him off balance. Retrieving the Joker's joy buzzer—which had minutes earlier fallen against several control wires, shocking them and causing the active laser to redirect itself towards the candy factory—Terry delivers a shock to the Joker's neck, destroying the microchip and reverting Tim to his old self, finally freeing him from the Joker's control and ending him permanently. Terry escapes with Tim before the satellite destroys the factory and the satellite-jamming device, safely shutting itself down.
