In Star Wars Rebels, Palpatine is now the Emperor of the Galactic Empire. He briefly appears offscreen at the end of the season 2 premiere, "The Siege of Lothal", voiced by Sam Witwer. Darth Vader informs Palpatine that the Rebel Alliance cell on Lothal has been broken. However, Vader tells him that Ahsoka Tano, the apprentice of Anakin Skywalker, is alive and is now helping the Rebels. Palpatine sees this as an opportunity to seek out other remaining Jedi (such as Obi-Wan Kenobi). Palpatine then tells Vader to dispatch an Inquisitor to hunt down Ahsoka.
