In September, 2017, United States President Donald Trump, himself a former sports franchise owner, decried the NFL for instituting the 15 yard penalty against helmet-to-helmet collisions. He called such head-butts "beautiful tackle[s]", stated his opinion that NFL players "want to hit" one another in this manner, and blamed NFL team owners for "ruining the game." Speaking at a rally in Alabama, Trump said: “Today if you hit too hard — '15 yards! Throw him out of the game!' They had that last week. [...] Two guys, just really, beautiful tackle. Boom, 15 yards! [...] They’re ruining the game! They’re ruining the game. That’s what they want to do. They want to hit. They want to hit! It is hurting the game." [14]
