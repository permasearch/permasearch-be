In the first qualifier round, Galway were drawn at home to Tipperary. Galway managed their first victory outside of Connacht in just under nine years, with an unconvincing 1-12 to 0-11 win, in Pearse Stadium[15] This was followed up by a narrow win over Waterford in Round 2, Galway winning by just one point with a Michael Meehan goal proving vital.[16] This win set up a Round 3 game with Armagh, who had come through their qualifier matches with relative ease, and entered the match as favourites. Despite going into the match as underdogs, Galway produced a strong performance to knock Armagh out, beating the Ulster side by 1-11 to 0-09.[17] This win put Galway through to a Round 4 meeting with Munster runners-up Cork. Galway entered the match even more unfancied than they had been against Armagh but a strong performance saw the team come up just short, losing by a single point, having led the game by four points at one stage.[18]
