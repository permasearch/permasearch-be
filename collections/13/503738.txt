Federal appeals courts have struck down strict voter-ID laws in Texas and North Carolina, citing intent by the legislatures to discriminate against minority voters.[103] The appeals court noted that the North Carolina Legislature "requested data on the use, by race, of a number of voting practices"â€”then, data in hand, "enacted legislation that restricted voting and registration in five different ways, all of which disproportionately affected African Americans."[104] The changes to the voting process "target African Americans with almost surgical precision," and "impose cures for problems that did not exist."[104]
