Currently, Del Taco uses a variety of commercials to promote their new slogan, "Go Bold or Go Home." The first commercial featured a team of miniature "Mole Men" (a play on "Mole-Men" or "mole people") to promote the Spicy Chicken Mole Soft Taco, which aired in August 2008. Ads included Del Taco's promotion of their improved regular taco in September 2008, the Classic Combo Deal in November 2008, three separate meal deals for under three dollars (including the aforementioned deal) in January 2009, the crispy shrimp taco in February 2009, the chicken soft taco in April 2009, and the chicken fajita burrito in June 2009.[19][20][21][22]
