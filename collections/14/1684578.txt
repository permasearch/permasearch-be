Miles Raymer from the Chicago Reader gave the song a negative review, stating referring to the song as "garbage, paint-by-numbers EDM with all the artistic flavor of an audio software preset that makes "Harlem Shake" sound like Selected Ambient Works Volume II. But the song's only there to deliver the meme, and if the song had any personality it might distract from the hashtag-packed spoken-word bit that's the real focus here."[1]
