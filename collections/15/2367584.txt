In 1894, Hungarian engineer K치lm치n Kand칩 developed a new type 3-phase asynchronous electric drive motors and generators for electric locomotives. Kand칩's early 1894 designs were first applied in a short three-phase AC tramway in Evian-les-Bains (France), which was constructed between 1896 and 1898.[40][41][42][43][44]
