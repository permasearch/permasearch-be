Dr. Allen Hu (voiced by Ken Jeong) is a human physician who sells drugs to Sarah Lynn. An unseen character throughout most of the first season, he is the subject of a recurring joke based on the phonetic similarity of his name to "who" with BoJack and others believing that Sarah's drug connection is a man who simply calls himself "Doctor Who" rather than an actual physician. He made his first onscreen appearance in "Downer Ending."
