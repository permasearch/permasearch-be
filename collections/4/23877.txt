Elevations of 8,200 to 9,000 feet (2,500 to 2,700Â m) are in the Canadian Life Zone, which includes the North Rim and the Kaibab Plateau.[55] Spruce-fir forests characterized by Engelmann spruce, blue spruce, Douglas fir, white fir, aspen, and mountain ash, along with several species of perennial grasses, groundsels, yarrow, cinquefoil, lupines, sedges, and asters, grow in this sub-alpine climate.[54] Mountain lions, Kaibab squirrels, and northern goshawks are found here.[55]
