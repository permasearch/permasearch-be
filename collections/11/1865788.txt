Marasmus is caused by a severe deficiency of nearly all nutrients, especially protein, carbohydrates and lipids, usually due to poverty and scarcity of food.[6] Viral, bacterial and parasitic infections can cause children to absorb few nutrients, even when consumption is adequate.[7] Marasmus can develop in children who have weakening conditions such as chronic diarrhea.[8]
