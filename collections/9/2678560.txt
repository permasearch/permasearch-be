In the second half of the century, new composers began giving back to the trombone a level of importance in solo and chamber music. Pieces such as Edgard Varèse's Octandre, Paul Hindemith's Sonata, Charles Wuorinen's Trombone Trio and Luciano Berio's Sequenza V led the way for lesser-known composers to build a wider repertoire. Popular choices for recital music today include Stjepan Sulek's Vox Gabrieli, Jacques Casterède's Sonatine and Jean Michel Defaye's Deux Danses. Some well known trombone concertos from this period include works by Pascal Dusapin, Derek Bourgeois, Lars-Erik Larsson, Launy Grøndahl, Nino Rota, Christopher Rouse and Henri Tomasi. Jan Sandström composed two concertos to be performed by Christian Lindberg, his Trombone Concerto No. 1 (1990) is called Motorbike Odyssey or Motorbike Concerto. In 1995-6, Johan de Meij wrote his T-Bone Concerto for trombone and concert band. Artists such as Mark Hetzler have recorded works from Berg, Webern, and Stravinsky transcribed from other instruments (such as oboe, clarinet and strings) to show the difficulty, versatility and range of solo music the trombone can handle very sensitively.[7][not in citation given] The Solo for Sliding Trombone is one of the parts for John Cage's Concert for Piano and Orchestra (1958). It can be played as a solo or with any combination of the other parts of the Concert. The Solo employs a wide variety of standard and extended playing techniques. Due to the crossover ability of performers from the last 50 years being well trained in both the classical and jazz genres, more chamber works have appeared which blur those distinctions and also include improvisation. Several of those are the Improvisation No. 1 (O'Grady), Sonata for Trombone (Cooper), and the Arrows of Time (Peaslee). Other solo pieces for trombone and piano include Guy Ropartz's Piece for trombone (1908), J. E. Barat's Andante and Allegro, Camille Saint-Saens's (even though romantic) Cavatine (1915), and Boris Pigovat's Meditation.
