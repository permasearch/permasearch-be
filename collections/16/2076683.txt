The Prophet’s and other spiritual teachers around the world teach or have taught that one can have many soulmates but only one true love or twin flame.“You have only one twin flame. But you may have brothers and sisters in various places whom you’re working with.”.[9] Spiritual teachers like Mark and Elizabeth Prophet ultimately define or describe a soulmate as one of many potential spiritual brothers or sisters “even though there may be a great attraction and bond between soulmates, fundamentally, in the ultimate sense, you could define it more as a brother/sister relationship, even though soulmates have great marriages and a great union of hearts.”[9]
