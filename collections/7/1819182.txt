After uncovering the identity of the "Ice Truck Killer", a serial killer who chops up the bodies of his victims and drains their blood, Dexter hurries to find his sister Debra. Since the murderer had always sent secret messages to Dexter, he searches his apartment for clues that Rudy could have left, and finds a picture of the shipping container where his mother was killed. When Dexter is about to leave, Doakes and LaGuerta arrive, telling him that they think Rudy Cooper was the one who stabbed Batista. Doakes insists that Dexter knows something, and he reveals that the blood on Angel's collar matched Rudy's. The pair leave, and Dexter goes to find the shipping container. At the station, LaGuerta orders a search for Rudy. Matthews walks in and introduces Esmee Pascal, the new lieutenant replacing LaGuerta.
