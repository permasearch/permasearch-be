Squilliam reveals to Squidward that he has become the leader of a band and that they are supposed to play at the Bubble Bowl; but he will be busy at that time and will not be able to attend so Squilliam asks Squidward to allow his band to substitute for his at the Bubble Bowl, believing that Squidward does not have one. However, Squidward insists that he has a band and accepts the offer. He assembles a large marching band composed of various Bikini Bottom residents.[1]
