An iOS version of the game was announced in August 2012, with episodes released shortly after their computer/console debut.[82] Later, after the full release of all five episodes to the App Store, Telltale offered the first episode for free, something they had done in the past, as doing so, according to Dan Connors, "opens the funnel and gets it out to more people who can then convert into the [full] game".[58]
