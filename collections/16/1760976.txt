Larry's friend, comedian Richard Lewis, is in dire need of a kidney transplant operation. Purely out of paranoid guilt, Larry offers one of his own to Richard if Richard cannot find a suitable donor in time. Larry then makes many concerted, ridiculous efforts to find Richard a kidney donor. Larry explores the possibility that he may have been adopted, because of a potentially misunderstood word his father said (and no longer remembers) while in the hospital â€” Larry hires a private investigator (Mekhi Phifer) to look into it. Eventually, he discovers the "truth" and visits his potential biological family, where he learns that he could be Gentile. His new faith in Christianity makes him agree to donating Richard his kidney.
