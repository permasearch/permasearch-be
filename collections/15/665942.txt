From 2014, it had a separate listing for gastropubs in Ireland.[52] The 2016 Guide for Hong Kong and Macau introduced an overview of notable street food establishments.[53][54] The Singapore guide that year introduced the first Michelin stars for street food locations, for Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice and Noodle and Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle.[55]
