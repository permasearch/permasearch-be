Parks College was initially a publicly traded company. During the great depression, the Detroit Aircraft Corporation bought up eighty percent of the stock as part of a large merger of aviation entities. Oliver Parks sold most of his assets to buy back a controlling interest.[2][3] The college students manufactured their own series of biplane aircraft, including the Parks P2A, which became the "hero" of books by author Richard Bach.[4][5] The college quickly got out of the manufacturing business, selling the P2A rights to Ryan as the Ryan Speedster, and later the Hammond 100.
