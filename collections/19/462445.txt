"Over the Horizon", Samsung's signature sound for its smartphone devices, is initially the only music stored in the music library of any new Samsung smartphone. Initially developed in 2011, by a team headed by Joong-sam Yun, Senior Designer at IT & Mobile Communications, the highly recognizable, distinctive jingle can be used as a ringtone, as a sound when the phone turns on or off, as well as a basic notification alert for messages. According to the Samsung Newsroom, "this musical arrangement is not just an audio file stored in the phone. Rather, it is a brand sound of Samsung Galaxy devices."  While the basic composition of the six-note tune has not changed since its inception, various versions have been introduced as the product line evolved. Moreover, the song has been covered by various popular artists who have released their own arrangements and remixes of the song, such as Quincy Jones, Icona Pop, and various K-Pop artists.[54] In Samsung's U.S. registration of the trademark for the sound, it is described as "the sound of a bell playing a B4 dotted eighth note, a B4 sixteenth note, an F#5 sixteenth note, a B5 sixteenth note, an A#5 eighth note, and an F#5 half note."[55]
