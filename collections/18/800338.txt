"Josie" was named after the dog of Elyse Rogers, vocalist for Dance Hall Crashers, and the girl in the song is fictional.[4][5] "It is about a common feeling that everyone can understand, which is being stoked on a girl," Hoppus told Billboard in 1998.[6] The lyrics describe an ideal girlfriend who tolerates the narrator's flaws and shares his taste in music. The line "Yeah my girlfriend, likes UL and DHC" is a reference to the bands Unwritten Law and Dance Hall Crashers. The line "She brings me Mexican Food from Sombreros just because" is a reference to the Sombrero Mexican Food restaurant located in San Diego.[7][8]
