From mid-2011 selected episodes have been re-broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra and also on BBC6 Music.  The episodes on BBC Radio 4 Extra have included some 60-minute versions of the show; many of these open with additional lead-in and lead-outs from presenter Kirsty Young, often featuring sections of other interview footage or recordings featuring the guest of the episode in question. Some, but not all, of these extended versions, also feature extended in-programme material not used on the original broadcast. Episodes repeated on BBC6 are those concerning musicians and figures in the music industry.
