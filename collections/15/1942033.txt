The setuid permission set on a directory is ignored on most UNIX and Linux systems.[citation needed] However FreeBSD can be configured to interpret setuid in a manner similar to setgid, in which case it forces all files and sub-directories created in a directory to be owned by that directory's owner - a simple form of inheritance.[4] This is generally not needed on most systems derived from BSD, since by default directories are treated as if their setgid bit is always set, regardless of the actual value. As is stated in open(2), "When a new file is created it is given the group of the directory which contains it."
