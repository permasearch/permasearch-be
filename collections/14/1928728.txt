Islam is the third-largest religious group of British Indian people, after Hinduism and Sikhism.[52] 8% of UK Muslims are of Indian descent,[53] principally those whose origins are in Gujarat, West Bengal, Telangana and Kerala. Gujarati Muslims from the Surat and Bharuch districts started to arrive from the 1940s when India was under British colonial rule, settling in the towns of Dewsbury and Batley in Yorkshire and in parts of Lancashire.
