Babbage purchased the actuarial tables of George Barrett, who died in 1821 leaving unpublished work, and surveyed the field in 1826 in Comparative View of the Various Institutions for the Assurance of Lives.[28] This interest followed a project to set up an insurance company, prompted by Francis Baily and mooted in 1824, but not carried out.[29] Babbage did calculate actuarial tables for that scheme, using Equitable Society mortality data from 1762 onwards.[30]
