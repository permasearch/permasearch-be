In 2009, Ford modified an experimental 3.5 L V6 EcoBoost engine with both E85 direct injection and gasoline indirect fuel injection, which achieved a brake mean effective pressure of 395 psi (27 bar), which translates to roughly 553 pound-feet (750 N⋅m) of torque and 316 horsepower (236 kW)@3000 rpm (flat torque curve from 1500–3000 rpm).[59]
