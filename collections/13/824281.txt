Splitting pills may result in uneven splitting and creating pieces which will not deliver accurate dosage.[10] Pills which are split might not be correctly halved, making the cut pieces unequal in size.[10] Some pills are difficult to split.[10] Some pills (particularly some time release drugs)[11] are unsafe to split, and there could be mistakes in identifying when pills should not be split.[10]
