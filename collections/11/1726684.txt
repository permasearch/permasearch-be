Overall, about 45% of all pregnant women and 25% of all women postpartum suffer from PGP.[21] During pregnancy, serious pain occurs in about 25%, and severe disability in about 8% of patients. After pregnancy, problems are serious in about 7%.[22] There is no correlation between age, culture, nationality and numbers of pregnancies that determine a higher incidence of PGP.[23][24]
