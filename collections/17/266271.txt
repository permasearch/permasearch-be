Along with his stint at H&H Bagels, Kramer is engaged in a variety of other short-lived jobs. He works part-time as a department store Santa before being fired for spreading Communist propaganda to young children in "The Race". In "The Bizarro Jerry", he works at an office where he is not actually employed, describing his daily activities to Jerry as "T.C.B. You know, takin' care of business." His boss, "old man Leland", eventually fires him, commenting that his reports resemble work by someone with "no business training at all", which, of course, was the truth. In "The Beard", Kramer works as a "lineup decoy" for the NYPD, earning $50 per lineup. This job ends when the witness to a jewelry store heist, a homeless man who'd had a recent unrelated altercation with Kramer, fingers Kramer as the perpetrator. A story arc of the fifth season includes Kramer's idea for a coffee table book about coffee tables, which is eventually published in "The Fire". His success in that particular endeavor is short-lived, however, because he spews coffee all over Kathie Lee Gifford at the first stop of his book tour on Live with Regis and Kathie Lee in "The Opposite". In "The Pick", he becomes an underwear model for Calvin Klein, which must account for at least some of his income. The biggest boost to Kramer's income would have to be in the episode "The Wizard" when his coffee table book is optioned for a movie by a "big Hollywood so-and-so", earning Kramer enough royalty money to retire to Florida (although he moves back to New York almost immediately after a "political scandal" involving going barefoot in the clubhouse, which costs him the election for condo board president at Del Boca Vista, Phase 3).
