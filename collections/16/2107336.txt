In the film adaptation of I Am Number Four, he is simply called the Mogadorian Commander. He is portrayed by Kevin Durand in the film. He kills Number Three (just like in the novel) and leads the investigation to find Number Four/John. After finding him to be in Paradise, Ohio, he leads his soldiers against John and Six, when John overheats his ammo and destroys it.
