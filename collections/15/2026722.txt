During the development of the Steven Universe pilot, Sugar focused much attention on the design of the world, adding notes to her drawings.[32] Inspired by the idea of foreign figures (Gems) living human lives, she drew many sketches depicting their world and history. The series' design was also inspired by her and her brother's interest in video games, comics and animation.[9] After the series was commissioned, Sugar decided to redesign everything to make the series "flexible and simple" for future production staff to add ideas of their own.[8] During this time, the creative director was Kevin Dart, followed by Jasmin Lai, Elle Michalka and Ricky Cometa.[33] Dart's artistic style remained a great influence on the show after his departure. Steven Sugar praised Dart's work and was inspired by him in college years, saying Dart had more ideas for the art than he did.[19]
