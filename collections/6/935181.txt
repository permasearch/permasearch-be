In 1954, the Futura prototype was built entirely by hand by the Ghia Body Works in Turin, Italy, at a reported cost of US$250,000â€”the equivalent of approximately US$2 million in 2009.[40] It made its debut in pearlescent Frost-Blue white paint on 8 January 1955 at the Chicago Auto Show.[41] In 1959, sporting a fresh red paint job, the Futura was featured in the film It Started with a Kiss, starring Debbie Reynolds and Glenn Ford.
