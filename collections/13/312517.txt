In a 2011 interview with Prevention, Inaba stated she was legally blind, having a vision of 20/750 which is corrected with eyeglasses and contact lenses.[4]a[â€º] She won't have LASIK eye surgery, however, as her vision impairment gives her, in her words, a "soft-focus morning" until she's ready to "deal with the world."[4] She also revealed that she suffers from spinal stenosis,[26][27] which she thinks began with a neck injury during gymnastics when she was eight years old.[4]
