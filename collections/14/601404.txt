Some recent historians dispute the whole concept of Reconquista as a concept created a posteriori in the service of later political goals. A few historians point out that Spain and Portugal did not previously exist as nations, and therefore the heirs of the Christian Visigothic Kingdom were not technically reconquering them, as the name suggests.[12][13][14][15][16][17] One of the first Spanish intellectuals to question the idea of a "reconquest" that lasted for eight centuries was Jos√© Ortega y Gasset, writing in the first half of the 20th century.[18] However, the term is still widely in use.
