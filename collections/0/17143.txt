Lake Placid hosted the Winter Olympics in 1932 and 1980. During the 1932 games, the trails outside of the village served for the cross-country skiing events and the cross-country skiing part of the Nordic combined event.[5] Lake Placid, St Moritz and Innsbruck are the only sites to have twice hosted the Winter Olympic Games.
