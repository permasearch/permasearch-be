Commandeering a car, the three catch up to the train. Sam stays behind while the women hop on and fight through Asav's men. Seeing a switch that will turn the train away from the city, Chloe hops off while Nadine stays behind and, with Sam's help, turns the switch before going back for Nadine. The two make it to the engine car, where the bomb is, and fight Asav. They trap his leg under the bomb and jump to safety before the train falls off a collapsed bridge and explodes, killing Asav. Safe and with the tusk in hand, Chloe and Nadine decide to go into business together while Sam reacts with horror to their intentions to hand the tusk over to the Ministry of Culture, who likely will not pay them a lot of money.
