Because Blossom aired immediately after The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air on NBC for a period, NBC cross-promoted the shows on two occasions. Will Smith appeared in I'm With The Band as himself under his rap stage name, The Fresh Prince, and later that season, Karyn Parsons made an appearance on the show in Wake Up Little Suzy as her Fresh Prince character, Hilary Banks. Estelle Getty appeared in one episode as Sophia Petrillo, her character from The Golden Girls and Empty Nest.
