Critics consider race to be the Planet of the Apes series' primary theme.[6] Eric Greene, author of a book on the role of race in the original films and spinoff material, writes that "when seen as one epic work, the Apes saga emerges as a liberal allegory of racial conflict."[37] In Greene's interpretation, the franchise's plot arc is rooted in the central conflict in which humans and apes alternately subjugate one another in a destructive cycle.[133] Difference between human and ape manifests primarily in physical appearance, and dominance derives from social power rather than innate superiority. Each film shifts the power balance so that the audience identifies sometimes with the humans, and other times with the apes.[134] According to Greene, this arc's central message is that unresolved racial discord inevitably leads to cataclysm.[133] Other critics have adopted or echoed Greene's interpretation.[135][136] Producers Abrahams and Jacobs did not consciously intend the first film's racial undertones, and did not appreciate them until Sammy Davis Jr. pointed them out in 1968.[137][138][139] Subsequently, the filmmakers incorporated the theme more overtly in later installments; as a result, race moves from being a secondary motif in the first two films, to becoming the major concern of the last three.[140]
