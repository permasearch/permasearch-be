Another explanation for the X marks may be rooted in the duty taxes of alcoholic beverages beginning in 1643. The "X" mark on a cask of beer was originally used to indicate that the contents were stronger than legal small beer limits, and were subject to a ten shillings per barrel tax.  Later, brewers added additional (superfluous) X marks to signify progressively stronger beers: "the present quack-like denominations of XX (double X) and XXX (treble X), which appear, unnecessarily, on the casks and in the accounts of the strong-ale brewers".[8]
