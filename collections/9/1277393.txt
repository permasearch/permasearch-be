On March 24, 2017, it was reported by several news outlets that the Calgary Stampeders and Edmonton Eskimos were bidding to host the 2018 Grey Cup game.[3][4] In previous years, the games would be awarded based on regional preference or ownership changes (such as Toronto hosting the 104th Grey Cup four years after hosting their previous one).[5] However, beginning with the 2018 game, the league will have a bidding process based on the merits of the application to determine a host.[6] Calgary last hosted the Grey Cup in 2009 while Edmonton last hosted in 2010. Both cities have previously hosted the Grey Cup game four times.
