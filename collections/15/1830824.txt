A person who successfully finishes a Tough Mudder event is deemed a “Legionnaire,” Tough Mudder collectively calls all its finishers the “Mudder Legion”.[66] Each finisher receives a headband for completing a Tough Mudder. The headbands change color with the number of runs one has completed— orange for one, green for two, blue for three, yellow for four to six, pink for seven to nine black for 10 Tough Mudders or more.[67] Tough Mudder created a handcrafted steel headband for the first legionnaire, Jim Campbell, who completed 100 Tough Mudders.[68] [69]
