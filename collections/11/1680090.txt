Virginia Kirkus had handled Wilder's debut novel Little House in the Big Woods for Harper & Brothers as its book editor from 1926 to 1932. In Kirkus Reviews, her semimonthly bulletin from 1933, she awarded this novel a starred review (as she did the next three sequels). "Good Americana â€“ and a first rate tale. Personally, I liked it certainly as well, perhaps better than the other."[3]
