During Six Flags' ownership of Geauga Lake, Dominator was the star attraction of the Gotham City themed area and featured various Batman theming.[10] The trains' seats had the Batman symbol engraved into the headrests and the station originally had text reading, "Bruce Wayne Foundation."[14] When Cedar Fair bought the park in 2004, they did not own the rights to DC Comics characters. All Batman theming had to be removed before opening day, which included melting the Batman symbol off every seat, removing the Bruce Wayne Foundation text on the station, and renaming the Gotham City section into "Power City." There has been no theme for the ride while it has been owned by Cedar Fair.
