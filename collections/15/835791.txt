With complex procedures being performed free of cost, patients visit the department from all over the country. The invasive cardiac set up of the department has 2 fully equipped top-of-the-line flat panel catheterisation labs with hemodynamic recorders. A 16 bedded Critical Care Unit (CCU) is equipped with patient monitors networked with a central station, ventilators, infusion pumps, ECG and echo machines, defibrillators, portable X-Ray and imaging units.  Patients mostly belong to economically weaker sections of the society, who could not have afforded the cost of the treatment elsewhere.[7]
