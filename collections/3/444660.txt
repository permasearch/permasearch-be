Paul is introduced spying on the Alexandria Safe-Zone community shortly following the horde invasion. Paul is later attacked by Michonne and Abraham Ford where he easily immobilizes them. After insisting to meet Rick Grimes, he is knocked out and tied up. After the interrogations, Rick eventually decides to let Paul take him to Hilltop. On the way, Paul reveals that he could have escaped any time but remained there to see if Rick could be trusted. The two make up and continue their way. After reaching Hilltop, Paul defends Rick after he kills a citizen who has been sent by Negan to deliver a message. Paul then reveals to Rick and his group, that he and the rest of his people, have for months, been under siege by the Saviors. He attempts to track them back to their base, but is caught and chased back to the colony.[volume & issue needed]
