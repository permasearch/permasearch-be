In the season finale "The First Day of the Rest of Your Life", it is revealed that while Negan intended on using her as a bargaining chip at Alexandria, Sasha chooses to take the poison capsule in order to foil Negan's plans. When Negan prepares to reveal her to Rick as a hostage, alive and well, she bursts forth as a walker and tried to attack him, killing another Savior in the process. Later in the episode, Jesus and Maggie find her, and Jesus holds down the zombified Sasha for Maggie to finish her with a knife. Flashbacks in the episode show Abraham and Sasha together on the day of his death, and her fear come true that he died, as well as brief moments with Maggie.
