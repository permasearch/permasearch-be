Prevalence of homicide and violent crime is higher in statistical metropolitan areas of the U.S. than it is in non-metropolitan counties;[89] the vast majority of the U.S. population lives in statistical metropolitan areas.[90] In metropolitan areas, the homicide rate in 2013 was 4.7 per 100,000 compared with 3.4 in non-metropolitan counties.[91] More narrowly, the rates of murder and non-negligent manslaughter are identical in metropolitan counties and non-metropolitan counties.[92] In U.S. cities with populations greater than 250,000, the mean homicide rate was 12.1 per 100,000.[93] According to FBI statistics, the highest per capita rates of gun-related homicides in 2005 were in D.C.
