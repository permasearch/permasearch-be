Ideas of limited rationality emphasize the extent to which individuals and groups simplify a decision because of the difficulties of anticipating or considering all alternatives and all information[12] Bounded rationality relates to two aspects, one part arising from cognitive limitations and the other from extremes in emotional arousal[13] Sometimes emotional arousal at the moment of a crime can be acute, therefore would be offenders find themselves out of control, and rational considerations are far less salient.[14]
