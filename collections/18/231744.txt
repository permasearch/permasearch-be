West Virginia has the distinction of being the first US state to enact a sales tax.[194] It currently is at 6%. In January 2006, the sales tax on food was lowered to 5%, then to 4% in July 2007; to 3% a year later; to 2% in January 2012; to 1% in July 2012; and has been extinct since July 2013.[195] However, the reduced rate of tax does not apply to sales, purchases and uses by consumers of prepared food. Prescription drugs are not subject to sales tax. Credit is allowed for sales or use taxes paid to another state with respect to the purchase.
