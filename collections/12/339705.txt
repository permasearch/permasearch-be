The Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem has a long history in the United States dating back to the 1920s but became more established with the appointment of Archbishop Damaskinos of Jaffa as Epitropos in 2002. Under Archbishop Damaskinos' leadership there was significant development over the following years. However, the Jerusalem Patriarchate subsequently decided to leave the jurisdictional scene in North America.[1]
