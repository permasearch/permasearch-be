In Brasil, following the success of the South American leg of the Incanto tour, where over 100,000 people attended his free concert at the S찾o Paulo's "Parque Indipendencia", earlier in the year,[83] it was announced that Bocelli would hold another Open-Air, entrance free, concert in Florian처polis, on 28 December, where a crowd of about a million people was expected to attend. However, due to financial and political reasons, the concert was later canceled on short notice, along with all the other events scheduled for Christmas in the city.
