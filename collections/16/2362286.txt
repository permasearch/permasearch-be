An apoplectic stroke deprived him of his speech, and he died shortly afterwards at 2:45Â a.m. on 18 February 1546, aged 62, in Eisleben, the city of his birth. He was buried in the Castle Church in Wittenberg, beneath the pulpit.[247] The funeral was held by his friends Johannes Bugenhagen and Philipp Melanchthon.[248] A year later, troops of Luther's adversary Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor entered the town, but were ordered by Charles not to disturb the grave.[248]
