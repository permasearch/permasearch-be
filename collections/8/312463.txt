Doctor Who's tenth series has received positive reviews. Series 10 holds a 97% score on online review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes with an average score of 3.88.[89] Writing for the Radio Times halfway through the series' run, Huw Fullerton calls it "a return to form for the sci-fi series after a much-needed rest year, with the format, actors and writers all feeling fresher than during their last outing".[90] Reaction to individual episodes have also been positive, with scores on the site ranging from 85% to 100% to date; six episodes of the series hold a perfect score, which include the final four of the series, after no episode reached this score in the previous series.[89] Specifically, episodes such as "Oxygen" and "Extremis" received positive reception, with critics saying that the former was a "great, thought-provoking episode",[91] whilst the latter was labelled as a unique and ambitious episode, and that "Doctor Who doesn't get better than this".[92]
