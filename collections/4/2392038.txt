In the third fiscal quarter of 2006, Harvey's discontinued items such as specialty burgers, deli sandwiches, Caesar salad, and value-priced burgers. The hamburger menu at the time was simplified to six basic varieties: original hamburger, original cheeseburger, original bacon cheeseburger, and double-patty versions of each. The current version of the menu lists cheese and bacon as premium toppings rather than as part of a burger, meaning that only the Original Burger and Double Original are listed as hamburgers. Three alternative sandwiches were kept on Harvey's revised menu: one with grilled chicken, one with crispy chicken and a veggie burger.
