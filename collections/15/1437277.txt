In 1957, Andrews released her debut solo album, The Lass with the Delicate Air, which harked back to her British music hall days.[33] The album includes performances of English folk songs as well as the World War II anthem, "London Pride", a patriotic song written by NoÃ«l Coward in 1941 during the Blitz, which Andrews herself had survived.[33][34]
