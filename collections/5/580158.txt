The terajoule (TJ) is equal to one trillion (1012) joules; about 0.278 GWh (often used in energy tables). About 63 TJ of energy was released by the atomic bomb that exploded over Hiroshima.[14] The International Space Station, with a mass of approximately 450 megagrams and orbital velocity of 7.7Â km/s,[15] has a kinetic energy of roughly 13 TJ. In 2017 Hurricane Irma was estimated to contain 100 TJ of energy.[16]
