The team with the most money after the fourth round played the bonus round. Just like in the original version, the first two members gave clues by building questions, alternating one word at a time. If either clue giver gave more than one word in a row, builds a clue that is not loosely in the form of a question, or said part of the answer, the clue givers must move on to the next word. The third player cannot see the answers, but must ring in to guess the answer to the question his/her partners are constructing. Once the guesser rang in, no more clues may be given on that word. Any team member could also pass as often as possible to throw out the current word.
