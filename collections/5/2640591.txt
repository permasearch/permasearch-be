The consumption of seafood, despite Ireland's enormous coastline, is not as common as in other maritime countries.[19] Irish people eat seafood well below the European average.[19] It appears that it may have been more common in the past, but declined markedly in the last few centuries. There may be various reasons for this. Irish-owned shipping was severely restricted under English governance from the late-16th century on. Ireland was traditionally a cattle-based economy and fish was associated with religious fasting. It was the traditional food of fast on Fridays, in common with other Catholic countries. Also, seafood and particularly shellfish became associated with the poor and the shame of colonisation.[20]
