The term light rail was devised in 1972 by the Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMTA; the precursor to the U.S. Federal Transit Administration) to describe new streetcar transformations which were taking place in Europe and being planned in North America.[27] Some notable distinctions between light rail systems and their streetcar predecessors were that: 1) light rail lines may run at least partially along exclusive rights of way instead of only along or in streets (i.e. without street running), 2) a light rail line is more likely to run multiple unit trains instead of single cars, and, 3) a light rail line may use high level platforms instead of in street level stops. These design differences mean that light rail systems tend to have higher passenger capacities and higher speeds than their streetcar predecessors.
