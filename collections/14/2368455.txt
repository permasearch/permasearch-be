In 1950, Ogunde continued writing plays with political undertones, Bread and Bullet, first performed in 1950 is Ogunde's play about the coal miners strike in Enugu that resulted in the shooting of twenty-two people. In Northern Nigeria, the performance of the play was limited to certain areas due to allegations of seditious dialogue.[15] It was during this time, Ogunde introduced English language to the dialogue of his plays. In January 1950, he staged a reproduction of his 1945 play Black Forest, he re-arranged the play introducing English and Yoruba dialogue with African music played by both Western and African instruments. The re-produced Black Forest and Bread and Bullet changed his style of drama from Yoruba folk opera to improvisational theatre where dialogue is spoken.[16] Ogunde then released a string of plays with dialogue either spoken or sung. He released an Islamic morality tale My Darling Fatima in 1951 followed by three situational comedies: Portmanteau Woman (1952), 'Beggar's Love (1952) and Princess Jaja (1953). In 1955, his theatre went on a tour Northern Nigeria, including performances at the Colonial Hotel, Kano. During this time, Ogunde wrote less but went on grueling road tours to different parts of the country becoming a traveling theatre group. He also changed the name of the group from Ogunde Theatre Party to Ogunde Concert Party in 1950.
