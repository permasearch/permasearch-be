Mixed assessments came from Robin Pierson of The TV Critic, giving the season an overall score of 49 out of 100.[43] Pierson said that the show had become "predictable, stale and irritating to watch" and that it had become "just like the TV shows it mocked". He criticized some episodes for "insulting their viewers' intelligence" and for being "badly written",[44][45] although he praised some of the stories for following a logical progression.[46] Pierson considered "We Love You Conrad" as the best episode of the season (rating it 67 out of 100),[47] and "Baby Not On Board" as the poorest (rating it 12).[48]
