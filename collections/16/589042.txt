All USMA cadets are rated each year; and get a final rating when they graduate. The cadet with the highest class rank is the one that has the best combination of score, academical standing, additional merits and demerits. The United States Military Academy opened in 1802; the initial class having just two cadets. The academy started the practice to rank its graduates in 1818.
