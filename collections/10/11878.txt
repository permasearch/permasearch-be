Kansas City-based architectural firm Populous released comprehensive plans for the proposed stadium in February 2011.[22] Populous' early cost estimate for the project was $700 million.[23] According to the master plan, the stadium would have a maximum capacity of 71,000, but can expand to 75,000 for special events such as the Super Bowl. It will also feature multiple club levels, suites and exhibition area.[22]
