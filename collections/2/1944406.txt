The most common varieties marketed as "Italian Sausage" in North American supermarkets are hot[1], sweet[2][3][4][5], and  mild[6]. The main difference between hot and mild is the addition of hot red pepper flakes in the spice mix of the former.  The difference between mild and sweet is the addition of sweet basil in the latter.
