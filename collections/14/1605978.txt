The Mirage, initially scheduled for an opening in early December 1989,[5] was opened early on November 22, 1989.[2] At the time of its opening, The Mirage was the largest hotel in the world, with 3,044 rooms. The hotel tower, standing 29 stories, was built out in a Y-shape design, a concept that was later copied by Las Vegas' Treasure Island, Monte Carlo, and Mandalay Bay resorts. The hotel's top five floors were used exclusively for high roller rooms and penthouse suites. The Mirage was the first new resort to be built on the Las Vegas Strip in 16 years,[3] after the completion of the MGM Grand in 1973.[2] When it opened, The Mirage was the first casino to use security cameras full-time on all table games.[6]
