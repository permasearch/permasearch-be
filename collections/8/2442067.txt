Sting is known for his time spent as the public face of two major professional wrestling promotions: the now-defunct World Championship Wrestling (WCW), which displaced the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) as the leading professional wrestling organization in the United States from 1995 to 1998,[7] and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA).[8] Borden is regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time,[9] having cultivated a legacy over a career spanning more than three decades in which he held 15 world championships.
