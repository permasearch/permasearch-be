In the MTV "clean" version the song and video were censored. Significant portions from the first two verses and most of the third verse were removed. MTV also cut out all traces of Stanâ€™s girlfriend bound in the trunk of the car and removed one scene showing him guzzling vodka while driving.[5] In the MTV full version, which is 8:15 long, verse 3 censors Stan mentioning his girlfriend in the trunk (so "Shut up bitch" and "screaming in the trunk" is censored), and about him not slitting her throat, but tied her up, and "if she suffocates, she'll suffer more, then she'll die too", which "slit", "tied her up", "suffocates", and "die" is censored.
