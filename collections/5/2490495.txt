Nine of the twelve participating nations earned medals, in addition to two medals won by mixed teams. In the early Olympic Games, several team events were contested by athletes from multiple nations.[3] Retroactively, the IOC created the designation "mixed team" (with the country code ZZX) to refer to these groups of athletes. During the 1904 games, athletes participating in mixed teams won medals in athletics and fencing. Some athletes won medals both individually and as part of a mixed team, so these medals are tabulated under different nations in the official counts.[4]
