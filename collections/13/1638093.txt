Aquatic invertebrates have been recognized as an integral part of the North American river otter's diet.[24][33][35][48] Otters consume more aquatic insects in the summer as the populations increase and specific life stages heighten their susceptibility.[33] Most aquatic invertebrates preyed upon by the otters are from the families Odonata (dragonfly nymphs), Plecoptera (stonefly nymphs), and Coleoptera (adult beetles).[33][48] Invertebrates discovered within scats or digestive tracts could most likely be a secondary food item, first being consumed by the fish that are subsequently preyed upon by the North American river otters.[30][32]
