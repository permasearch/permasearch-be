For much of the log listings era, the listings section was preceded by a channel directory, which listed the broadcast stations – and later, cable channels – whose program information was provided in each edition. The listed channels were organized numerically for broadcast stations and alphabetically (by abbreviation) for cable channels. Until cable-originated channels were added to the magazine, the directory exclusively listed broadcast television stations serving the individual markets serviced by the corresponding edition. Each station was listed in a separate entry corresponding to their city of license, and in some cases, one or more stations serving a particular media market were broken out from competing stations serving the same market based on their primary city of service (for example, in the Oklahoma City/Oklahoma State and North Texas editions, ABC affiliate KSWO-TV in Lawton, Oklahoma – which was designated under a black bullet until the Oklahoma City and Tulsa editions were consolidated into a singular Oklahoma State edition in November 2003, when it began being identified by the outlined bullets assigned to its same-market competitors – was listed as serving "Lawton/Wichita Falls," appearing in a separate entry from the three stations serving the primary city of that station's home market, Wichita Falls, Texas, NBC affiliate KFDX-TV, CBS affiliate KAUZ-TV and independent station-turned-Fox affiliate KJTL).
