As well as being a garda, Paudge Brennan is a "property tycoon". He owns several houses in Red Rock and is constantly chasing tenants for rent, going so far as selling debt to nefarious loan sharks. When he's not chasing people who owe him money he himself is being pursued for money he owes to contractors who have worked on his house. One such contractor, unhappy with the payment Paudge settles on, tears the wiring he did out of the walls. Paudge is frustrated and broke, if he doesn't start making money soon he'll lose his mother's house.
