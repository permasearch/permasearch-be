Filmmaker James Rolfe, creator of the Angry Video Game Nerd series, declared that he would not see the new film and disliked how it was based in a new universe with no continuity to the previous films.[133][143] Brooks Barnes of The New York Times and Daniel Friedman of Polygon considered Rolfe's views an example of "fan entitlement", criticising his haste to judge the film without seeing it and his lack of concern for other remakes of franchises he admired, such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.[144][145] Rolfe became the subject of personal attacks online for his position;[144][145] according to commentators for The Washington Post, Salon, and Polygon, though Rolfe had not mentioned gender, many people considered his motivation misogynistic.[133][146][147] Richard Roeper's negative review of the film was also met with criticism on social media and from Salon, who accused him of male bias.[148] Roeper responded: "How insulting would it be to give a film a pass because of good intentions and diversity in the casting? That’s not equal treatment; that’s condescension."[149] Journalists from The Atlantic and NBC News saw the controversy as part of the culture war and gender divide engaged across social media. They, along with Feig, noted commonalities to the events and reactions of the Gamergate controversy in video games.[133][145][150]
