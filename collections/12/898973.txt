Independent Kenya had an economy heavily moulded by colonial rule; agriculture dominated while industry was limited, and there was a heavy reliance on exporting primary goods while importing capital and manufactured goods.[292] Under Kenyatta, the structure of this economy did not fundamentally change, remaining externally oriented and dominated by multinational corporations and foreign capital.[293] Kenyatta's economic policy was capitalist and entrepreneurial,[294] with no serious socialist policies being pursued;[295] its focus was on achieving economic growth as opposed to equitable redistribution.[296]
