Box Hill is a summit of the North Downs in Surrey, approximately 30 km (19 mi) south-west of London.  The hill takes its name from the ancient box woodland found on the steepest west-facing chalk slopes overlooking the River Mole. The western part of the hill is owned and managed by the National Trust, whilst the village of Box Hill lies on higher ground to the east. The highest point is Betchworth Clumps at 224 m (735 ft) above OD,[1] although the Salomons Memorial (at 172 metres) overlooking the town of Dorking is the most popular viewpoint.[2]
