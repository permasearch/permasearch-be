The Fury (ザ・フューリー) is a pyromaniac and former Soviet cosmonaut. He utilizes a flame-resistant Soviet space suit in conjunction with a jet pack and a powerful flamethrower, both of which are powered by liquid rocket fuel UDMH. His codename reflects the unmitigated fury he feels towards the world while he is fighting.[142] In Metal Gear Solid 3, he fought and is defeated by Naked Snake. The Fury is voiced by Masato Hirano in Japanese and by Richard Doyle in English.
