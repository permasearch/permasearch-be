Abigail Borin (Diane Neal) is a CGIS Special Agent in Charge based out of the capitol. Borin first works with Pride's team when she is tasked with interrogating a smuggler whose crimes took place within Coast Guard jurisdiction. She later investigates a double homicide on-board a research vessel, during which she notes she has been temporarily assigned Agent Afloat status. Borin reunites with Pride to investigate the poisoning of a Naval Commander, and in "Rock-a-Bye Baby", the kidnapping of a young child. Borin expresses a desire to join Pride's team, though she had similarly inquired about the possibility of working with Leroy Jethro Gibbs, Pride's friend who is stationed in Washington D.C.
