The Federal Government and The Lakota Sioux tribe members have been involved in sorting out a legal claim for the Black Hills since signing the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty,[30] which created what is known today as the Great Sioux Nation covering the Black Hills and nearly half of western South Dakota.[30] This treaty was acknowledged and respected until 1874, when General George Custer discovered gold,[30] sending a wave of settlers into the area and leading to the realization of the value of the land from United States President Grant.[30] President Grant used tactical military force to remove the Sioux from the land and assisted in the development of the Congressional appropriations bill for Indian Services in 1876, a "starve or sell"[31] treaty signed by only 10% of the 75% tribal men required based on specifications from the Fort Laramie Treaty[32]  that relinquished the Sioux's rights to the Black Hills.[30] Following this treaty, the Agreement of 1877 was passed by Congress to remove the Sioux from the Black Hills, stating that the land was purchased from the Sioux despite the insufficient number of signatures,[30] the lack of transaction records, and the tribe's claim that the land was never for sale.[31][33]
