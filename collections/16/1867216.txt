The album is named after an incident at The Pump Room restaurant in Chicago, Illinois. Collins, entering the restaurant with former Led Zeppelin lead vocalist Robert Plant,[23] was denied admittance because he did not meet the restaurant's dress code of "jacket required" for dinner while Plant was allowed in.[24] Collins was wearing a jacket and argued about it.[25] The maître d'hôtel argued that the jacket was not "proper".[23] Collins said in an interview with Playboy that he was, at that point, never so mad in his life.[5]
