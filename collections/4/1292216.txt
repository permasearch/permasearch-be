In January 2014, however, celebrity gossip site TMZ reported that according to multiple sources that the reason Muhney was allegedly let go from the soap was because Muhney had sexually harassed co-star Hunter King (who portrays Summer Newman).[58][59] The site wrote: "38-year-old Muhney allegedly bullied and harassed 20-year-old Hunter King, who plays Summer on the show. She went to higher-ups and complained recently Muhney had fondled her breasts on 2 occasions â€” and she said both were unsolicited and unwanted."[60] The rumor generated significant negative publicity for the soap opera; Margaret Eby of the New York Daily News wrote, "The set of "The Young and the Restless" may have turned into a real life soap opera thanks to star Michael Muhney, who was allegedly fired for groping one of his co-workers."[61] Fox News reported that several viewers were upset by Muhney's firing and the sexual harassment allegations, writing: "Many Y&R fans were none too pleased to find out Muhney was leaving, and several blasted the allegations."[62] TMZ later reported that angered viewers had paid US$785 to have an airplane fly over CBS Studios in Los Angeles with a banner to have Muhney rehired,[63] and the plane flew three days later.[64] Muhney made his final appearance on January 30, 2014.[16] In August 2014, Muhney claimed on his Twitter page that the allegations were indeed false and it was only a salacious rumor.[65]
