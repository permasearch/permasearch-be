Valinor (Land of the Valar) is a fictional location in J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium, the realm of the Valar in Aman. It was also known as the Undying Lands, along with Tol Eressëa and the outliers of Aman. This latter name is somewhat misleading; the land itself, while blessed, did not cause mortals to live forever.[1] However, only immortal beings were generally allowed to reside there. Exceptionally, the surviving bearers of the One Ring were allowed to dwell there for a time--Bilbo and Frodo Baggins and Sam Gamgee--and perhaps[dubious – discuss] Gimli son of Glóin who, it is said, accompanied his friend Legolas to Valinor.[2][3]
