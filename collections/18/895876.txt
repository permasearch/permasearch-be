The point was first established by the Milanese typographer, Francesco Torniella da Novara (c.1490 â€“ 1589) in his 1517 alphabet, L'Alfabeto. The construction of the alphabet is the first based on logical measurement called "Punto," which corresponds to the ninth part of the height of the letters or the thickness of the principal stroke.[3][4]
