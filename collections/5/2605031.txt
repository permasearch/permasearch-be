After the relocation of the original Baltimore Orioles to New York in 1903 where they ultimately became the New York Yankees, no major league team would relocate for 50 years. The set-up was also reflective of the population at the time, as most of the major population areas were in the Northeast and Midwestern United States in the aftermath of Reconstruction and later the Great Migration. Baseball was tied to the history and culture of New York City up until the 1950s. Three of the best teams in the league were located in New York City: the Yankees, Giants and Dodgers.[2]
