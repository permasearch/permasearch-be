Farfrae visits Lucetta's house to see Elizabeth-Jane and falls for Lucetta, not knowing she has come to marry Henchard. Lucetta is also attracted to Farfrae.  At the same time, she begins to question Henchard's character, when it becomes public knowledge that he sold his first wife.  Although initially reluctant, Henchard decides that he wants to marry Lucetta, particularly since he is in financial trouble - he believes that his creditors would extend credit if he was about to be married to a wealthy woman.  Frustrated by her stalling, Henchard bullies Lucetta into agreeing to marry him.  But by this point she is in love with Farfrae, and they run away one weekend to get married.  She does not tell Henchard until well after the fact.  Henchard's credit collapses, he goes bankrupt, and has to sell all his personal possessions to pay creditors.
