Owen was an active supporter of the Labour Party; Peter Sallis has claimed that Owen's left-wing views contrasted so much with the right-wing opinions of Michael Bates that Last of the Summer Wine was almost not made because of their arguments.[2] Owen was a founding member of the Keep Sunday Special campaign group. He was awarded the MBE in 1976.
