The winning contestant would be given the opportunity to spend their cash total on at least one of four grand prizes at the "Sale of the Century" which almost always included a new car. Originally, champions could buy prizes totaling no more than £1,000 (£2,500 in the late 1970s). From 1981 to 1983, any champion who won the game with £140 or more could choose to purchase one of the lesser four prizes or correctly answer a possible four of five questions, with no risk, to win a car.
