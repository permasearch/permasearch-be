Space Mountain's first SOBAT was composed by Steven Bramson, primarily based on film scores by John Williams and the 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea score. Moreover, in order to create a proper Victorian atmosphere in the queue and around the building, a musical loop was created by selecting several themes from movies such as Krull, The Rocketeer, Always or Christopher Columbus: The Discovery. From 1995 to 2005, the ride was known as Space Mountain: De la Terre Ã  la Lune.
