The background animations, or BGAs, are contributed to almost every song in Pump It Up series to add multimedia along with the song played, but some are generic in-game BGAs for remixes and full songs (especially regular songs when the visualizers have insufficient time to release until the next update or arcade mix). Some of these BGA's differ from each other, meaning they are visualized by numerous artists, but most of them are uncredited for unknown reasons. In Pump It Up Fiesta EX, it marks the first game since Pump It Up 3rd Dance Floor (BanYa's "An Interesting View") where the visualizers are credited. These artists or animators can have either worked with Andamiro in-house, or been commissioned from animation studios outside. Starting Pump It Up Zero, the live music video for the licensed K-pop song (and world music beginning in Pump It Up Fiesta 2, not in home version Exceed S.E.) is added (Footprints by T.O, e.g.) when Andamiro purchased a video from the record companies and studios. They are also cut for a regular song.
