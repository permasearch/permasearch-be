The exact definition of "vegetable" may vary simply because of the many parts of a plant consumed as food worldwide – roots, tubers, bulbs, corms, stems, leaf stems, leaf sheaths, leaves, buds, bark, flowers, fruits, and seeds. The broadest definition is the word's use adjectivally to mean "matter of plant origin”. More specifically, a vegetable may be defined as "any plant, part of which is used for food",[5] a secondary meaning then being "the edible part of such a plant".[5] A more precise definition is "any plant part consumed for food that is not a fruit or seed, but including mature fruits that are eaten as part of a main meal".[6][7] Falling outside these definitions are edible fungi (such as mushrooms) and edible seaweed which, although not parts of plants, are often treated as vegetables.[8]
