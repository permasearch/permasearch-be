Kori bustards spend most of their time on the ground, with up to 70% of their time being on foot.[2] Although, they can forage occasionally in low bushes and trees. There is a lone report of a bird sighted in Kenya perched at the top of a tree.[21] This bustard is a watchful and wary bird. Their behavior varies however, and they are usually very shy, running or crouching at the first sign of danger; at other times they can be completely fearless of humans.[2] They have a hesitant, slow manner of walking, and when they detect an intruder they try to escape detection by moving off quietly with the head held at an unusual angle of between 45° and 60°.[19] Being a large and heavy bird, it avoids flying if possible. When alarmed it will first run and, if pushed further, will take to the air on the run with much effort, its wings making heavy wingbeats. Once airborne it flies more easily with slow, measured wingbeats, with the neck extended and the legs folded. It usually remains low and lands again within sight.[17] When they land, kori bustards keep their wings spread and only fold them when the bird has slowed down to a walking speed.[19] Kori bustards have no preen gland, so to keep clean, they produce a powder down. Sun bathing and dust bathing are practiced.[9] This bird has a loud, booming mating call which is often uttered just before dawn and can be heard from far away. Mostly residential, kori bustards may engage in nomadic movements.[18] These migratory movements are probably influenced by rainfall and there is no evidence suggesting any regular pattern. These local migrations take place at night but have not been mapped. In the Etosha National Park these birds have been recorded moving up to 85 km (53 mi) from mopane woodland to open grassland plains and returning again the following season.[19] Trial satellite tagging of one male kori bustard by the National Museums of Kenya demonstrated a migration along the Rift Valley between Tanzania and southeastern South Sudan.[22] Additionally, adult and juvenile males move after the breeding season, whereas females do not appear to do so.[23] Generally the kori bustard feeds during the morning and in the evening, spending the rest of the day standing still in any available shade.[19]
