In the second half, Jones' 73-yard touchdown run capped off Dallas' scoring for the day. Meanwhile, the Cowboys defense held the Eagles in check the rest of the game, forcing two turnovers on downs, another fumble and an interception, while only allowing a meaningless touchdown on a 6 M-yard pass from Donovan McNabb to DeSean Jackson in the fourth quarter, making the final score 34â€“14.
