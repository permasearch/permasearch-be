Chelsea were invited to take part in the inaugural European Cup, now UEFA Champions League, in 1955 after they claimed their first league title the previous season. However, Chelsea were bullied into withdrawing from the tournament by the Football League FA. They had thus missed the chance to become the first English club to participate in and potentially win what is now the most prestigious club competition in European football. It was not until 44 years later that they would make their debut in the Champions League.
