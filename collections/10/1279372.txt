The house has frequently been cited as haunted, based on strange noises or sights reported by some visitors. In 2005, LIFE magazine called Whaley House "the most haunted house in America."[13] Shortly after the Whaley family moved in, they told the San Diego Union that they heard heavy footsteps in the house which they believed to be the ghost of James "Yankee Jim" Robinson, who had earlier been hanged on the property for stealing a boat.[8] Some visitors have reported seeing apparitions of Thomas Whaley or Anna Whaley.[9] On the last weekend of every month, the Whaley House Museum offers a late night "ghost hunting tour".[14] Additional tours are offered around Halloween.[13]
