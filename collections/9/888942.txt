At a minimum relationships are often composed of a Source CI that is related to a Target CI. In the case of more advanced relationships, such as semantic relationships, it is desirable to have a descriptor between the Source CI and Target CI that helps provide context. For example, "Database X" is related as a "Component" of "Application Y". The descriptor is also known as a Predicate.
