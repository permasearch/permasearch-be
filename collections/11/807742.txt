The 2012â€“13 season start, however, was delayed from its original October 11, 2012, date due to a labour lock-out imposed by the NHL franchise owners after the expiration of the League's CBA. After a new labour agreement was reached between the owners and the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA), training camps opened on January 13, 2013, and a 48-game season (reduced from 82 games) commenced on January 19. The Oilers would play their first game of the shortened season a day later, on January 20.
