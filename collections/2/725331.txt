Best's last competitive game for the club was on 1 January 1974 against Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road, which United lost 3–0.[60] He failed to turn up for training three days later and was dropped by Docherty, though he claimed Docherty was deceitful with him.[61] Best was arrested and charged with stealing a fur coat, passport, and cheque book from Marjorie Wallace, but was later cleared of all charges.[62] United went on to suffer relegation into the Second Division in 1973–74.
