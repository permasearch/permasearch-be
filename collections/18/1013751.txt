In October 2015, it was announced that Fry would be stepping down as host after Series M and would be replaced by Sandi Toksvig.[24] Fry described his position on QI as "one of the best jobs on television",[25] but that "it was time to move on". Toksvig said that "QI is my favourite television programme both to watch and to be on".[26] Lloyd said that Toksvig will be "the first female host of a mainstream comedy panel show on British television",[27] and that although she is very different to Fry, she "will bring to the show the same kind of wonderful thing that Stephen does, the mixture of real brains and a hinterland of knowledge, plus this naughty sense of humour." He also said it will give the show a chance to "do things in a slightly different way".[28]
