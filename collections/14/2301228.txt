Stimulants have been used in medicine for many conditions including obesity, sleep disorders, mood disorders, impulse control disorders, asthma, nasal congestion and as anesthetics.[24] Drugs used to treat obesity are called anorectics and generally include drugs that follow the general definition of a stimulant, but other drugs such as CB1 receptor antagonists exist in this class too.[25][26] Drugs used to treat sleep disorders such as excessive daytime sleepiness are called eugeroics and include notable stimulants such as modafinil.[27][28] Stimulants are used in impulse control disorders such as ADHD[29] and off-label in mood disorders such as major depressive disorder to increase energy, focus and elevate mood.[30] Stimulants such as epinephrine,[31] theophylline and salbutamol[32] orally have been used to treat asthma, but inhaled adrenergic drugs are now preferred due to less systemic side effects. Pseudoephedrine is used to relieve nasal or sinus congestion caused by the common cold, sinusitis, hay fever and other respiratory allergies; it is also used to relieve ear congestion caused by ear inflammation or infection.[33][34]
