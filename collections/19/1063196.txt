The formation of an open cluster begins with the collapse of part of a giant molecular cloud, a cold dense cloud of gas and dust containing up to many thousands of times the mass of the Sun. These clouds have densities that vary from 102 to 106 molecules of neutral hydrogen per cm3, with star formation occurring in regions with densities above 104 molecules per cm3. Typically, only 1â€“10% of the cloud by volume is above the latter density.[28] Prior to collapse, these clouds maintain their mechanical equilibrium through magnetic fields, turbulence, and rotation.[29]
