The Sawyers (renamed the Hewitts in the reboot and its prequel) are a large, Southern American family of cannibalistic butchers and serial killers in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise, who live in the Texas backwoods, where they abduct, torture, murder, and eat stranded motorists. The family uses booby traps and man-traps, such as bear traps and spike traps, to capture or kill victims. The family also owns a gas station, where they sell the meat from the victims as barbecue and chili. It has been confirmed in the crossover comic book series, Jason vs. Leatherface, that the Sawyer family did engage in inbreeding, something that was heavily implied in the third film. As seen in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III, the remake & the prequel, the family (both Sawyer and Hewitt) are fond of leaving bodies in mass body pits or mass graves in various parts of Texas. The inspiration for the family was real killer Ed Gein, whom the filmmakers also based Leatherface on.
