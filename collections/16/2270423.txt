Unphysical universes: If a state is a superposition of two states      Ψ  A     {\displaystyle \Psi _{A}}   and      Ψ  B     {\displaystyle \Psi _{B}}  , i.e.,     Ψ = ( a  Ψ  A   + b  Ψ  B   )   {\displaystyle \Psi =(a\Psi _{A}+b\Psi _{B})}  , i.e., weighted by coefficients a and b, then if     b ≪ a   {\displaystyle b\ll a}  , what principle allows a universe with vanishingly small probability b to be instantiated on an equal footing with the much more probable one with probability a? This seems to throw away the information in the probability amplitudes.
