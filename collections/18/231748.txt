The state instituted a 0.1% sales tax in five counties (Milwaukee, Ozaukee, Racine, Washington, Waukesha), effective January 1, 1996, to cover the cost of building Miller Park in Milwaukee. The tax was originally scheduled to be retired in 2014; however, it is now not expected to collect enough taxes to cover the entire cost until 2017.[199] There had been talk of extending the tax to pay for a new arena for the Milwaukee Bucks, but the plan failed to gain any momentum.[200]
