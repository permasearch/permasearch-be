Gaga's performance was critically acclaimed, with media outlets praising the show for demonstrating her artistic and musical qualities, and some arguing that it ranked among the top Super Bowl halftime performances in history. The show was also noted for its acknowledgment of the LGBT community, the use of a swarm of lighting-equipped drones for a pre-recorded intro scene, and its perceived political undertones. With 117.5 million television viewers, the Super Bowl LI halftime show was the second most-watched Super Bowl halftime show behind Katy Perry's and had higher average viewership than the game itself.
