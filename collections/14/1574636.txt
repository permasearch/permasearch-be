After the Semi-finals test, all semi-finalists participate in Round Five. It is an oral round, similar to Rounds 2 and 3 except there is no study list. Spellers who spell correctly have three points added toward their score, go back and sit down and will spell again in Round Six. Contestants who misspell are eliminated from the competition.
