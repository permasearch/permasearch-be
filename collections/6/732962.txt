Marini was Master of Ceremonies in the 2013 conclave that elected Pope Francis. On 11 March 2013, the day before the conclave, at a ceremony presided over by the Camerlengo Tarcisio Bertone, Marini led the non-cardinal officials, support staff and other non-elector personnel with duties in the conclave in taking an oath of secrecy pertaining to the conclave.[7][8][9][10] The next day, after the cardinal-electors had taken their oath in the Sistine Chapel, Marini called out the command "Extra omnes" (Everyone out) and closed the chapel doors once all outsiders had left the chapel.[11]
