Canada has three classes of firearms: non-restricted, restricted, and prohibited.[1] Non-restricted firearms include most ordinary hunting rifles and shotguns.[1] These can be brought temporarily into Canada for sporting or hunting use during hunting season, use in competitions, in-transit movement through Canada, or personal protection against wildlife in remote areas of Canada.[1] Any person wishing to bring a hunting rifle into Canada is required to be at least 18 years old, and the firearm must be properly stored for transport.[1] Restricted firearms are primarily handguns.[1] A restricted firearm may be brought into Canada, but an Authorization to Transport permit must be obtained in advance from a Chief Firearms Officer.[1] Prohibited firearms include fully automatic, converted automatics and assault-type weapons. Prohibited firearms are not allowed into Canada.[1] A comprehensive guide on importation of firearms and weapons is published by the CBSA.[15]
