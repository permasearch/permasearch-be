Issued as a b-side to the disco version of The Supremes' "Forever Came Today" on the pop charts, airplay was massive on the urban side that the song was charted also eventually peaking at number fifty on the Billboard Hot Black Singles chart. The 45 single was issued in November 1975 by Motown. A few months earlier, in June of the year, the group abruptly left Motown Records and signed with Epic Records. Jermaine Jackson, the song's second co-lead vocalist, remained with Motown, with Randy Jackson officially replacing him. The group later performed the song on shows without Jermaine, including Soul Train and The Mike Douglas Show.
