Nintendo's North American subsidiary is based in Redmond, Washington. Originally, the American headquarters handled sales, marketing, and advertising. However, the office in Redwood City, California now directs those functions. The company maintains distribution centers in Atlanta (Nintendo Atlanta) and North Bend, Washington (Nintendo North Bend). The 380,000-square-foot (35,000Â m2) Nintendo North Bend facility processes more than 20,000 orders a day to Nintendo customers, which include retail stores that sell Nintendo products in addition to consumers who shop Nintendo's web site.[116] Nintendo of America also operates two retail stores in the United States, Nintendo New York in Rockefeller Plaza, New York City, which is open to the public, and Nintendo Redmond, co-located at NOA headquarters in Redmond, Washington, which is open only to Nintendo employees and invited guests. Nintendo of America's Canadian branch,[117] Nintendo of Canada, Ltd., is based in Vancouver, British Columbia with a distribution center in Toronto, Ontario.[citation needed] Nintendo of America's localization team, dubbed Treehouse, is composed of around eighty staff, who are responsible for translating text from Japanese to English, creating videos and marketing plans, and ensuring that Nintendo's games release in a polished state.[118]
