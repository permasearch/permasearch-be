Via an official Facebook post on May 30, 2014, the next single, "Endless Slaughter" was confirmed. Referring to it as the first "experience" off their upcoming album, the track is set to be released on cassette only during concerts, with the band encouraging potential listeners to invest in a "BOOM BOX for your analogue listening pleasure". The single has since been released as a free download on their website and has since been given its own music video.[27][28] Limp Bizkit will embark upon a European tour from June 24 to July 4, 2014, followed by 2 dates in USA and finally culminating on November 16 at the second annual Knotfest in Makuhari Messe, Tokyo, where Limp Bizkit will perform along with festival founders Slipknot, longtime friends Korn, and other heavy metal acts such as Lamb of God, Five Finger Death Punch, Trivium and In Flames.[29][30]
