Jones and Parker write, "Most of what we read under the name business ethics is either sentimental common sense, or a set of excuses for being unpleasant."[194] Many manuals are procedural form filling exercises unconcerned about the real ethical dilemmas. For instance, US Department of Commerce ethics program treats business ethics as a set of instructions and procedures to be followed by 'ethics officers'.,[34] some others claim being ethical is just for the sake of being ethical.[195] Business ethicists may trivialize the subject, offering standard answers that do not reflect the situation's complexity.[187]
