Japanese beetles have been found in the islands of the Azores since the 1970s.[7]  In 2014, the first population in mainland Europe was discovered near Milan in Italy.[8][9] In 2017 the pest was detected in Switzerland, most likely having spread over the border from Italy. Swiss authorities are attempting to eradicate the pest.[10]
