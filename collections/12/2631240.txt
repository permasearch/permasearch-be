The page says, go for a "50:50" (when the computer will randomly remove two incorrect answers and leave the right answer and one wrong answer). Is the 50:50 really random in deciding what wrong answer to leave behind? It seems to me that it usually leaves a wrong answer which the contestant has been mulling over out loud; I've never seen it leave behind an "obviously wrong" answer. I suspect that the people in the control booth get to decide which wrong answer to leave, or that this was decided when the question was written... is it truly random?
