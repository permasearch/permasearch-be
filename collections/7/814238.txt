In December 2005, Michael Schiavo created a political action committee, TerriPAC. It was formed to raise money to support right-to-die candidates and oppose candidates who had voted for government involvement in the Schiavo case.[9] In 2007, TerriPAC paid a $1,350 fine to the Federal Election Commission for failing to file complete and timely records.[91] Schiavo shut down the PAC later that year.[92]
