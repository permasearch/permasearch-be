In September 2016, Roark Capital Group agreed to purchase a majority stake in Liautaud's company, as Weston Presidio sold their minority investment after 10 years. Terms of the transaction were not immediately disclosed, though it was later clarified that Liautaud retained 35% ownership of the company as part of the deal.[8] As part of the agreement, Liautaud, as the company's founder and largest individual shareholder, will continue as chairman of the board.[9][10]
