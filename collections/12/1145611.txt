One example from the first group is that liberal democratic culture may make the leaders accustomed to negotiation and compromise (Weart 1998), (MÃ¼ller & Wolff 2004). Another that a belief in human rights may make people in democracies reluctant to go to war, especially against other democracies. The decline in colonialism, also by democracies, may be related to a change in perception of non-European peoples and their rights (Ravlo & Gleditsch 2000).
