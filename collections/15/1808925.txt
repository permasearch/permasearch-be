A landing card is an arrival card form that non-EEA citizens are required to complete on entry to the United Kingdom or the Republic of Ireland. The traveler must present the completed form at the UK Border Agency immigration desk at the point of entry. The form is usually supplied by the airline, train or ferry company.[1]
