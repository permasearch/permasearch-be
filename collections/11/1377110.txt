Retina Display (marketed by Apple with a lowercase 'D' as Retina display) is a brand name used by Apple for its series of IPS panel and OLED displays that have a higher pixel density than traditional Apple displays.[1] Apple has applied to register the term "Retina" as a trademark in regard to computers and mobile devices with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, Canadian Intellectual Property Office, and in Jamaica.[2][3] On November 27, 2012 the US Patent and Trademark office approved Apple's application and "Retina" is now a registered trademark for computer equipment.
