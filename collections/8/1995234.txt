The earliest Greek colonies were on Sicily.  Many of these were founded by people from Chalcis, but other Greek states, such as Corinth and Megara were also responsible for early colonies in the area.[37]  By the end of the eighth century BC, Greek settlements in southern Italy were also well established.[38] In the seventh century, Greek colonists expanded the areas that they settled.  In the west, colonies were founded as far afield as Marseilles. In the east, the north Aegean, the Sea of Marmara, and the Black Sea all saw colonies founded.[39] The dominant coloniser in these parts was Miletus.[40] At the same time, early colonies such as Syracuse and Megara Hyblaia began to themselves establish colonies.[39]
