The Musaeum continued as an institution in the Roman period when Strabo gave his description of it, and according to Suetonius,[21] the emperor Claudius added an additional building.[22] Under the emperors, membership of the Musaeum was awarded to prominent scholars and statesmen, often as a reward to supporters of the emperor.[23] Emperor Caracalla suppressed the Musaeum in 216,[24] perhaps as a temporary measure.[22] By this time, the center of learning in Alexandria had already moved to the Serapeum.[24] The last references to membership in the Musaeum date to the 260s AD.[25]
