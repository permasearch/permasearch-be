It is thought the first person to aerate water with carbon dioxide was William Brownrigg in 1740, although he never published a paper.[1] Carbonated water was independently accidentally invented by Joseph Priestley in 1767 when he discovered a method of infusing water with carbon dioxide after suspending a bowl of water above a beer vat at a brewery in Leeds, England.[2] He wrote of the "peculiar satisfaction" he found in drinking it, and in 1772 he published a paper entitled Impregnating Water with Fixed Air.[3][4] Priestley’s apparatus, which featured a bladder between the generator and the absorption tank to regulate the flow of carbon dioxide, was soon joined by a wide range of others, but it wasn’t until 1781 that carbonated water began being produced on a large scale with the establishment of companies specialized in producing artificial mineral water.[2] The first factory was built by Thomas Henry of Manchester, England.[2] Henry replaced the bladder in Priestley’s system with large bellows.[2] While Priestley is regarded as “the father of the soft drink”, he did not benefit financially from his invention.[2] He did however receive scientific recognition for his invention of carbonated water when, in 1772, the Council of the Royal Society “were moved to reward its discoverer with the Copley Medal”.[5]
