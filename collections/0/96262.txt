Fleet vehicles are groups of motor vehicles owned or leased by a business, government agency or other organization rather than by an individual or family. Typical examples are vehicles operated by car rental companies, taxicab companies, public utilities, public bus companies, and police departments. In addition, many businesses purchase or lease fleet vehicles to deliver goods to customers, or for sales representatives to travel to clients. In some jurisdictions and countries, fleet vehicle also means vehicles that are privately owned by employees, or on novated leases, but are used for work purposes; this is called the 'grey fleet'.[1]
