In every state there is a provision in the statutes which stipulates occupying a lane as nearly as practicable. Riding on the edge of a travel lane is a modern phenomenon based on the often misunderstood statute "As far to the right hand side of the boundary or curb as practicable". This is a throwback to the predominant mode of transportation at the time traffic laws were formulated, namely the horse and cart. The horse and cart would often take up an entire half of a width of road space if not more. Bicycles by their very nature can not take up more than half and all statutes mandating "As far to the right as practicable" leave the caveat of "Allowing reasonably free passage to the left". This modern day misunderstanding of a statute which was a product of its time, has led to many a cyclist being killed or critically injured. The basis of this misunderstood statute has also led to the production of bike lanes which do not take into account the safety of the cyclist.[7] Many laws require bicyclists to remain as close to the edge of the roadway as practicable, in the normal direction of travel. Exceptions are common for preparing for a cross-traffic turn (left in the United States), going straight on the left side of a right-turn-only lane, avoiding hazards, and going the speed of other traffic. Another common exception is where there is no room for an automobile to safely pass. Some of these laws specify distances, such as 3 feet (0.91Â m) from the curb, or using no more than 1/3 of the navigable lane.
