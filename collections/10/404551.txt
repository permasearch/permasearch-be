It is not known to which painting Matisse had referred, but it has been speculated to be Houses at l'Estaque (1908),[93] a prototypical proto-Cubist period painting consisting both of CÃ©zannian trees and houses depicted in the absence of any unifying perspective. Houses in the background do, however, appear smaller than those of the foreground, consistent with classical perspective.
