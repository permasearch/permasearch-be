The Buddhist Soga clan took over the government in 587 and controlled Japan from behind the scenes for nearly sixty years.[31] Prince Shōtoku, an advocate of Buddhism and of the Soga cause, who was of partial Soga descent, served as regent and de facto leader of Japan from 594 to 622. Shōtoku authored the Seventeen-article constitution, a Confucian-inspired code of conduct for officials and citizens, and attempted to introduce a merit-based civil service called the Cap and Rank System.[32] In 607, Shōtoku offered a subtle insult to China by opening his letter with the phrase, "The sovereign of the land where the sun rises is sending this mail to the sovereign of the land where the sun sets" as seen in the kanji characters for Japan (Nippon) thus indicating that sun's full strength originates with Japan and China receives the waning sun.[33]  By 670 a variant of this expression, Nihon, established itself as the official name of the nation, which has persisted to this day.[34]
