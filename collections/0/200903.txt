Caesar awakens in the middle of the night by the sound of gunfire. Hurrying outside, he sees that the entire colony has heard it. Rushing out into the forest with Rocket and Maurice and various others, Caesar sees that his honorary nephew, Ash, the son of Rocket has been shot. Rocket begins to panic. Caesar tells Rocket to calm down and shouts in English at the humans to leave before ordering Koba to follow them.
