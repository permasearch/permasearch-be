To Jim and Dwight's horror, Packer returns in "Tallahassee", sinisterly confronting them at the orientation meeting. In a talking-head interview, he discusses the two salesmen's attempt to get him fired, but reveals that he is still working at the company (although it is unknown whether he still retains his previous position or now has a different occupation). In the episode, he is shown to be impressed with president of Sabre's special projects, Nellie Bertram, and he manages to impress her as well. The two are shown flirting with one another, and in the end she invites him, as well as Dwight, to have breakfast with her the following day.[14]
