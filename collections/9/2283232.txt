He has cemented his place in the England squad by being selected for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.[citation needed] In a warm-up match for that tournament against Hungary on 30 May 2006, Terry scored his first goal for England, the team's second in a 3–1 victory.[citation needed] Despite an injury scare in a friendly against Jamaica, he recovered to play in England's opening fixture against Paraguay, a 1–0 victory.[citation needed] In the next match against Trinidad and Tobago, Carlos Edwards beat England's Paul Robinson to a cross and as Stern John bundled a header towards the goal, Terry cleared the ball off the line with an overhead kick.[citation needed] In the quarter-final match against Portugal, Terry played the entire match, but England lost on penalties and he was left in tears with his fellow players.[citation needed] Six days later, he was the only English player to be named in the tournament's all-star squad.[88]
