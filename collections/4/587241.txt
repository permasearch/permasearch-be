Nonresident aliens are subject to regular income tax on income from a U.S. business or for services performed in the United States.[41] Nonresident aliens are subject to a flat rate of U.S. income tax on certain enumerated types of U.S. source income, generally collected as a withholding tax.[42] The rate of tax is 30% of the gross income, unless reduced by a tax treaty. Nonresident aliens are subject to U.S. federal income tax on some, but not all capital gains.[43] Wages may be treated as effectively connected income, or may be subject to the flat 30% tax, depending on the facts and circumstances.
