Prices were also driven up by the costs of tolls. Tolls were required at many ferries, bridges and roads, but none of these tolls went toward maintaining the roads.[1] Because of the disrepair of the roads, the journey took even longer. However, freighters and travelers had to use the tolls regardless because some of the most dangerous parts of the trail were manned by toll-owners. For example, the Snake River, which runs through Idaho, was very treacherous and scared many freighters and travelers. The expensive cost of tolls, along with the longer travel because of the lack of maintenance of the trail, contributed to higher costs of goods once they reached Montana.
