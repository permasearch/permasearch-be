Hitchcock said that correct casting saved him "a reel of storytelling time", since audiences would sense qualities in the actors that did not have to be spelled out.[3] Hitchcock said that he originally wanted William Holden for the Guy Haines role,[4][5] but Holden declined. "Holden would have been all wrongâ€”too sturdy, too put off by Bruno", writes critic Roger Ebert.[6] "Granger is softer and more elusive, more convincing as he tries to slip out of Bruno's conversational web instead of flatly rejecting him."[6]
