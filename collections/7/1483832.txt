Taste of Country reviewed it positively which stated that "Ultimately, ’Ain’t Worth the Whiskey’ is a strong choice for Swindell’s third single off his self-titled debut album. It’s fun to listen to and everything we love about country music. And who doesn’t love a classic tune about moving on … with a good shot of whiskey, of course."[2]
