Different batches of wine can be mixed before bottling in order to achieve the desired taste.  The winemaker can correct perceived inadequacies by mixing wines from different grapes and batches that were produced under different conditions.   These adjustments can be as simple as adjusting acid or tannin levels, to as complex as blending different varieties or vintages to achieve a consistent taste.
