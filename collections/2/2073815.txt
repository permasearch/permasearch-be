The basic standards of missionary service and conduct are contained in the Missionary Handbook.[19] Missionaries are instructed that following these standards will protect them both physically and spiritually. Mission presidents have discretion to adjust some of the standards according to local circumstances.[19]:1 The Missionary Handbook is also commonly and informally referred to as "the white handbook" or "the white bible".[20]
