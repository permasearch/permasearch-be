Williamson has been praised by scouts for his outstanding strength and athleticism and has drawn attention for his slam dunking ability.[21] Although considered a forward, he is described as not fitting any specific basketball positions.[22] Williamson's game has most notably been likened to that of LeBron James, although he has often been compared with Julius Randle as well.[22][23] Basketball coach Roy Williams reportedly told him that he was the best player he had seen since Michael Jordan.[24] Williamson is left-handed.[22]
