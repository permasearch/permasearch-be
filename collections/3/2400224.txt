On non-mobile versions of our website, a small bronze star icon () on the top right corner of an article's page indicates that the article is featured. On most smartphones and tablets you can also select "Request Desktop Site" to see this line (do a search to find out how). Additionally, if the current article is featured in another language, a star will appear next to the corresponding entry in the Languages list in the sidebar (a user preference allows toggling this on/off under Gadgets > Appearance).
