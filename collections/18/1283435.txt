As in traditional mythology and folklore, the common raven features frequently in more modern writings such as the works of William Shakespeare, and, perhaps most famously, in the poem "The Raven" by Edgar Allan Poe. Ravens have appeared in the works of Charles Dickens,[107] J. R. R. Tolkien,[108] Stephen King,[109] George R. R. Martin[110] and Joan Aiken[111][112][113][114] among others.
