Late in the third quarter, MSU added to the lead again on a Matt Coghlin field goal to move the lead to 17–0. Rain and snow continued to hamper both offenses as neither team could manage much offense. Maryland finally got on the board in the fourth quarter, scoring on a four-yard run by Lorenzo Harrison to reduce the lead to 17–7. A missed field goal on the next Maryland possession gave the Spartans the ball as they were able to run out the clock for a 17–7 win.
