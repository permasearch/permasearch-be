Introduced on January 5, 1995,[23] the Sentra changed from an independent rear suspension to a torsion beam setup. Some variants were not equipped with a rear swaybar or rear disc brakes. Many of these vehicles equipped with the 1.6-liter DOHC engine that had Nissan's Variable Intake Valve Timing Control System (NVTCS) and standard 5-speed manual transmission can achieve upwards of 30â€“40 MPG depending on conditions. This generation is also the first generation in Mexico wearing the Sentra name. It is also the first Sentra generation exclusively sold in sedan form, as the coupe was dropped in favour of the Nissan 200SX reintroduction. The revived 200SX also replaced the related Nissan NX.
