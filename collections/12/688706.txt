On February 11, 1968, a U.S. Navy training aircraft crashed into the cantilever span of the bridge, killing both reserve officers aboard. The T2V SeaStar, based at NAS Los Alamitos in southern California, was on a routine weekend mission and had just taken off in the fog from nearby NAS Alameda. The plane struck the bridge about 15 feet (5Â m) above the upper deck roadway and then sank in the bay north of the bridge.[39] There were no injuries among the motorists on the bridge.[40] One of the truss sections of the bridges was replaced due to damage from the impact.[41]
