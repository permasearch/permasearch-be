The term Crown Attorney's Office is the title for the various public prosecution offices (16 across Ontario) under the jurisdiction of the province of Ontario. Each Ontario Superior Court of Justice has its own Crown Attorney's Office, which conducts all criminal trial prosecutions and summary conviction appeals for cases that the province is responsible for in that court's geographical area (see Criminal law in Canada).
