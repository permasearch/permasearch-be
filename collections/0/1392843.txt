Since its founding in 1978, ACSH has been anti-tobacco. ACSH has taken what it terms a "harm-reduction" stance on tobacco smoking.[citation needed] In 2008, then associate director Jeff Stier addressed the negative long-term effects of smoking by using the example of Barack Obama during his 2008 campaign.[22] It opposed a New York State law that outlawed certain types of smokeless tobacco because, it argued, that would make it harder for adult smokers to quit cigarettes.[23] ACSH also criticized Apple Inc. workers who refused to enter homes where smoking had taken place to make technical repairs out of concern over second-hand smoke.[24] Unlike some public health organizations, ACSH does not support government efforts to ban the use of e-cigarettes.[25]
