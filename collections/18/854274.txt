Panama’s involvement in drug trafficking began as early as the beginning of the 20th century, when opium was trafficked through the Panama Canal on its voyage from Asia to Europe.[2]In the 1960’s Panama’s involvement with drug trade was its production of cannabis, but by the 1980’s it became one of the transit points for the drug trafficking of cocaine from South America to the United States thanks to its shared border with Columbia. [3]
