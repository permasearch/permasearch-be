Using 2017 inflation-adjusted dollars, the federal minimum wage peaked at $11.53 per hour in 1968.[8][9][10] If the minimum wage in 1968 had kept up with labor's productivity growth, it would have reached $19.33 in 2017.[11] There is a racial difference for support of a higher minimum wage with most black and Hispanic individuals supporting a $15.00 federal minimum wage, and 54% of whites opposing it.[12] In 2015, about three percent of white, Asian, and Hispanic or Latino workers earned the federal minimum wage or less. Among black workers, the percentage was about four percent.[13]
