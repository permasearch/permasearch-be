The Western Chalukya Empire ruled most of the western Deccan, South India, between the 10th and 12th centuries.[270] Vast areas between the Narmada River in the north and Kaveri River in the south came under Chalukya control.[270] During this period the other major ruling families of the Deccan, the Hoysalas, the Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri, the Kakatiya dynasty and the Southern Kalachuris, were subordinates of the Western Chalukyas and gained their independence only when the power of the Chalukya waned during the latter half of the 12th century.[271]
