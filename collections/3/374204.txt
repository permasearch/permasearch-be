The Childlike Empress (Die Kindliche Kaiserin in German) is the mysterious and benevolent monarch of Fantastica, who resides in the capital called Ivory Tower in the heart of the realm. Although she is nominally the ruler of Fantastica, she rarely interacts with the outside world. Should she die, Fantastica and all Fantasticans would cease to exist.
