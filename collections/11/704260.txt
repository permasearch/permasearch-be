The only genuine friendship in the Who during the 1960s was between Entwistle and Moon. The pair enjoyed each other's sense of humour and shared a fondness for clubbing. Journalist Richard Green noted a "chemistry of playfullness that would go beyond playfullness".[52] Their relationship diminished somewhat when Entwistle got married in 1967, though they still socialised on tour.[77] When Moon was destroying toilets in hotels, Entwistle confessed he "was standing behind him with the matches".[356]
