The rest of the film deals with the growth and movement of the church throughout the United States, since this is what took up the remainder of Smith's life. The film shows the first major movement of church members to Kirtland, Ohio in 1836, highlighting the annoyance of previous Ohio residents with the dramatic increase in church members, the poverty that many members experienced because of the move and the harassment of Smith by local mobs. In one scene, Smith is taken from his bed at night, and tarred and feathered. Emma removes what tar she can, and Smith preaches a sermon the next day. While in Kirtland, Smith reveals that God wants them to build a temple. After it is finished and a meeting has been held, Smith and Cowdery see another vision where God accepts the temple. Other personages then appear and confer additional priesthood keys or authorities on them.
