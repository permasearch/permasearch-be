The biggest day in American horse racing, the Kentucky Derby, is preceded by the two-week Derby Festival[151] in Louisville. Louisville also plays host to the Kentucky State Fair[152] and the Kentucky Shakespeare Festival.[153] Bowling Green, the state's third-largest city and home to the only assembly plant in the world that manufactures the Chevrolet Corvette,[154] opened the National Corvette Museum in 1994.[155] The fourth-largest city, Owensboro, gives credence to its nickname of "Barbecue Capital of the World" by hosting the annual International Bar-B-Q Festival.[156]
