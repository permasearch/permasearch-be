Various desserts consisting of whipped cream in pyramidal shapes with coffee, liqueurs, chocolate, fruits, and so on either in the mixture or poured on top were called crème en mousse 'cream in a foam', crème fouettée, crème mousseuse 'foamy cream', mousse 'foam',[20] and fromage à la Chantilly 'Chantilly-style cheese'.[21][22] Modern mousses, including mousse au chocolat, are a continuation of this tradition.
