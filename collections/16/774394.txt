This did not last long, however. The French were given control of Quebec again via treaty only two years later and began an aggressive expansion west, setting up missions as far west as Lake Superior and exploring as far as modern-day Wisconsin and the Mississippi. That same year, 1632, the Iroquois declared war on the Petun people just west of them, who split in two. One group appears to have crossed the Ohio River and migrated south to become the Guyandotte (Also known as the Tiontatecaga & Little Mingo[23]), whereas the rest crossed the Niagara River and relocated near the Huron, on the shores of Lake Huron. The Iroquois followed and began a decade long guerilla war in which they attacked enemy tribes, destroyed missions and assassinated and executed Christians for virtually every crime any white person had ever been known to commit towards any native person. This completely halted French advancements west and brought about the destruction of the Huron,[24] yet all these attacks mysteriously ended around 1650.[25]
