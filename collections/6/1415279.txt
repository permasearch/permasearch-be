Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), also known as brittle bone disease, is a group of genetic disorders that mainly affect the bones.[1] It results in bones that break easily.[1] The severity may be mild to severe.[1] Other symptoms may include a blue tinge to the whites of the eye, short height, loose joints, hearing loss, breathing problems and problems with the teeth.[1][3] Complications may include cervical artery dissection and aortic dissection.[5][6][7]
