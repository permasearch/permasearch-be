Filming for Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park began in May 1978,[3] and it was produced by Hanna-Barbera, known primarily for cartoons (in the late 1960s, they filmed and produced the live-action series The Banana Splits). Most of the movie was filmed at Magic Mountain in California, with additional filming taking place in the Hollywood Hills. Much of the production was rushed, and the script underwent numerous rewrites. All four members of Kiss were given crash courses on acting.[2]
