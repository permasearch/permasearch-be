In Elizabethan entertainment, troupes were created and they were considered the actor companies. They traveled around England as drama was the most entertaining art at the time. As a boy player, many skills had to be implemented such as voice and athleticism (fencing was one). (MaClennan, 1994). Stronger female roles in tragedies were acted by older boy players because they had the experience. (MaClennan, 1994).
