Removed specific Jehovas Witness explanation of "saints" as strict 144000. The common religious interpretation of the term "saints" is either an especially holy member of heaven or any general resident; using the JW interpretation (and explaining it here) doesn't really make sense, as A) there's no evidence presented that the original author meant the song in the JW sense, B) the JW interpretation of the passage referring to 144,000 as the total of saints in heaven represents a fringe minority of general christian interpretation, and C) as Tdadamemd noted, the JW bible doesn't refer to these people as "saints" at all, so applying JW theology to the term seems particularly inappropriate.--71.63.21.14 (talk) 15:31, 1 October 2015 (UTC)
