Lucid dreaming is the conscious perception of one's state while dreaming. In this state the dreamer may often have some degree of control over their own actions within the dream or even the characters and the environment of the dream. Dream control has been reported to improve with practiced deliberate lucid dreaming, but the ability to control aspects of the dream is not necessary for a dream to qualify as "lucid" â€” a lucid dream is any dream during which the dreamer knows they are dreaming.[105] The occurrence of lucid dreaming has been scientifically verified.[106]
