There have been several differing etymologies given for the surname. One view is that it is an Anglicised form of the Gaelic MacShuibhne, which means "son of Suibhne". The Gaelic name Suibhne is a byname, which means "pleasant". This Gaelic name was also used as a Gaelic equivalent of the Old Norse byname Sveinn, which means "boy".[1] Another view is that the Anglicised surname is derived from the Gaelic MacCuinn, meaning "son of Conn".[2] The Gaelic personal name Conn is composed of an Old Celtic element meaning "chief".[1] Another suggested origin of the Anglicised surname is from the Gaelic MacCuithein.[citation needed]
