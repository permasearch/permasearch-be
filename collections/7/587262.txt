After suffering a mini-stroke, Kim Zolciak-Biermann was able to rehearse, but her doctors refused to clear her for air travel. As a result, she was unable to attend the dress rehearsal and the live show, which, according to the show's rules, meant she would have to withdraw from the competition. Had she not withdrawn from the competition, either Andy & Allison or Paula & Louis would have been eliminated that night.[24] Her dance partner, Tony Dovolani, performed their routine during the live show with stand-in Jenna Johnson.[25] There was no additional elimination.
