The project’s most high-profile contribution to the public debate was its series of “Voter Guides,”[1] which attempted to tabulate the costs of then-Senator Barack Obama’s and Senator John McCain’s campaign promises.

CNN called it “the most detailed analysis of McCain's and Obama's budget plans.".[16]
