There is an emerging performing arts scene. LSU's Swine Palace is the foremost theatre company in the city, largely made up of students of LSU's MFA acting program, as well as professional actors and stage managers.[57] There is a budding group of physical theatre and circus artists at LSU, who traveled to Edinburgh, Scotland, in summer 2012 to perform Dante in the world's largest Fringe Festival. The show ran in Baton Rouge before going to Fringe, and featured movement, acrobatics, and aerial silk.[58]
