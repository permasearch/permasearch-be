Peter Barlow goes to see his son, Simon, perform in the nativity play in December 2008; however, he is refused entry as he is drunk. He fights his way through and ruins the play. In 2013, Kylie Platt arrives drunk at her son Max's nativity play and the Platt family is removed immediately when Kylie tries to drag Max off the stage. In June 2014, Kylie and David Platt are called in as Max has been disruptive during lessons. This later leads to him being diagnosed with ADHD.
