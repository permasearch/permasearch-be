Katabatic winds are most commonly found blowing out from the large and elevated ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland.  The buildup of high density cold air over the ice sheets and the elevation of the ice sheets brings into play enormous gravitational energy. Where these winds are concentrated into restricted areas in the coastal valleys, the winds blow well over hurricane force,[2] reaching around 300 km/h (190 mph).[3]  In Greenland these winds are called piteraq and are most intense whenever a low pressure area approaches the coast.
