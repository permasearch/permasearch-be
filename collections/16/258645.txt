Because major clastic wedges and basinal deposits are distributed in a southwestward progression, it is assumed they originated from areas near promontories, areas along the continental margin where deformation is concentrated. As mention above, it was postulated that there are three, possibly four tectophases that represent increased convergence or possible collision between the continental margin promontories and Avalon terranes.[11] The earliest tectophase was located at the St. Lawrence Promontory in northern New England and in the Canadian Maritime Provinces.[9] The St. Lawrence tectophase was active during the Early to Middle Devonian with intense transpressional deformation which formed a basin in the Gasp√© Peninsula, northern New Brunswick, and northern New England.[11] Clastic wedges were present in this area, but the evidence for them has been mostly destroyed by succeeding tectonism.[9]
