Before 1971 and especially 1966, data in this basin is extremely unreliable. The geostationary satellite era began in 1966,[32] and that year is often considered the first year of reliable tropical records.[33] Intensity estimates are most reliable starting in the 1971 season. A few years later, the Dvorak technique came into use. Those two factors make intensity estimates more reliable starting in that year.[33] For these reasons, seasons prior to 1971 are not included.
