Shinigami (死神), also known as Death (デス, Desu)[ch. 31] and named "Lord Death" in the English anime dub, is the headmaster of Death Weapon Meister Academy and father to both Asura and Death the Kid. He is the personification of madness through order, reflected by his desire to maintain peace in the world and his aversion towards chaos.[ch. 72] However, though he could render humanity into mindless drones, Shinigami allows them to keep their free will. He is also the former leader of the Great Old Ones prior to sealing away his apprentice and first child Asura eight centuries ago who had become a kishin, binding his own soul around Death City to keep Asura imprisoned underground. Unable to leave the city as a result, Shinigami creates DWMA to train meisters and weapons to prevent more kishin from surfacing, and to create death scythes to help him maintain the peace.[ch. 16] As headmaster, Shinigami normally resides in a special chamber in DWMA building called the Death Room, which others can contact through mirrors and reflective objects.[ch. 0a]
