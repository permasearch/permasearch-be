For most passenger aircraft, the cruise phase consumes most of the aircraft's fuel. This lightens the aircraft and raises the optimum altitude for fuel economy. For traffic control reasons it is usually necessary for an aircraft to stay at the cleared flight level. On long-haul flights, the pilot may ask air traffic control to climb from one flight level to a higher one, in a maneuver known as step climb.
