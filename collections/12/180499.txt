In December 2015, Belgian entrepreneur Guido Dumarey commenced negotiations to buy the Commodore manufacturing plant in South Australia, with a view to continue producing a rebadged Zeta-based premium range of rear and all-wheel drive vehicles for local and export sales.[160] The proposal was met with doubt in South Australia,[161] and it later came to nothing.[162] On 20 October 2017 it ceased manufacturing vehicles in Australia.
