In Australia, the number 1194 gives the speaking clock in all areas and from all providers.  It is always the current time from where the call originates. A male voice, often known by Australians as George,[2] says "At the third stroke, it will be (hours) (minutes) and (seconds) seconds/precisely. (three beeps)" e.g. "At the third stroke, it will be three thirty three and forty seconds ...  beep beep beep".  These are done in 10 second increments and the beep is 1Â kHz.
