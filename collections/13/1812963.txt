Here     L   {\displaystyle L}   is the sundial's geographical latitude;      s  o     {\displaystyle s_{o}}   is the orientation switch integer; t is the time in hours before or after noon; and     R   {\displaystyle R}   and     D   {\displaystyle D}   are the angles of reclination and declination, respectively. Note that     R   {\displaystyle R}   is measured with reference to the vertical. It is positive when the dial leans back towards the horizon behind the dial and negative when the dial leans forward to the horizon on the sun's side. Declination angle     D   {\displaystyle D}   is defined as positive when moving east of true south. Dials facing fully or partly south have      s  o     {\displaystyle s_{o}}   = +1, while those partly or fully north-facing have an      s  o     {\displaystyle s_{o}}   value of -1. Since the above expression gives the hour angle as an arctan function, due consideration must be given to which quadrant of the sundial each hour belongs to before assigning the correct hour angle.
