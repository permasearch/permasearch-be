Auxiliary Police officers increase the public's perception of police "omnipresence" by patrolling in police cars, on foot and on bicycle. The police cars, known as RMPs or Radio Motor Patrols, are dark blue or black with white decals or white with light blue decals. Auxiliary Police officers wear virtually the same uniform as regular officers, and are equipped with straight wood batons; asp batons; bullet resistant vests; police radios directly linked to the Central Dispatcher, other Auxiliary officers, and regular officers; flashlights; whistles; handcuffs; memo books; and reflective traffic vests. Their badge is a seven-point star, in contrast to the shield worn by regular officers.[13]
