Convention delegates had previously considered the selection of the Senate's presiding officer, deciding that, "The Senate shall choose its own President," and had agreed that this official would be designated the executive's immediate successor. They had also considered the mode of election of the executive but had not reached consensus. This all changed on September 4, when the committee recommended that the nation's chief executive be elected by a group of electors apportioned among the states, with each state receiving a number of presidential electors equal to the sum of that state's allocation of representatives and senators.[10][11]
