With the Duke method, the patient is pricked with a special needle or lancet, preferably on the earlobe[5] or fingertip, after having been swabbed with alcohol. The prick is about 3–4 mm deep. The patient then wipes the blood every 15 seconds with a filter paper. The test ceases when bleeding ceases. The usual time is about 2–5 minutes.
