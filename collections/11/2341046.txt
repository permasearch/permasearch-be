U.S. Army Reserve and U.S. Army National Guard soldiers must have two creditable years in a U.S. Army watercraft unit, including a minimum of 25 days underway annually as well as two annual training exercises underway on a Class A or B army vessel; or a 90-day deployment aboard an army vessel underway. Subsequent awards are authorized upon the completion of additional qualifying periods of sea duty. For mobilized soldiers, one year of sea duty as a mobilized soldier will be credited toward one creditable year as long as minimum underway requirements are met.[2]
