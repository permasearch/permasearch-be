In Hong Kong, where Christmas is a public holiday,[14] many buildings facing Victoria Harbour will be decorated with Christmas lights. Christmas trees are found in major malls and other public buildings,[15] and in some homes as well, despite the small living area. Catholics in Hong Kong can attend Christmas Mass.[16]
