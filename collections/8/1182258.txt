In Buddhism, cannabis is generally regarded as an intoxicant and may be a hindrance to development of meditation and clear awareness. In ancient Germanic culture, Cannabis was associated with the Norse love goddess, Freya.[97][98] An anointing oil mentioned in Exodus is, by some translators, said to contain Cannabis.[99] Sufis have used Cannabis in a spiritual context since the 13th century CE.[100]
