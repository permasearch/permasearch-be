Smaug was a dragon who had destroyed the dwarven kingdom of Erebor, below the Lonely Mountain (Sindarin Erebor), and the neighbouring wealthy town of Dale many years before, driving Thorin II Oakenshield, heir of Durin, into exile. Smaug stole all the treasure of Erebor and Dale, gathering it into a deep chamber under the Mountain, where he lived thereafter.
