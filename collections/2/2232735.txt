In the mid-1990s, the marketing team for Claritin at Schering-Plough found a way around these rules. They created brand awareness commercials that never actually said what the drug was for, but instead showed sunny images, and the voiceover said things like "At last, a clear day is here" and "It's time for Claritin" and repeatedly told viewers to “ask your doctor” about Claritin.[26][27] The first ads succeeded in making people aware of the brand and increased prescriptions, which led Schering-Plough and others to aggressively pursue the advertising strategy.[27]
