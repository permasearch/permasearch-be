The Last Dance Tour is the sixth concert tour in Japan and eleventh overall by South Korean boy band Big Bang. The tour began on November 18, 2017 in Fukuoka, Japan and concluded on December 31, 2017 in Seoul, South Korea. Big Bang broke their own record by being the only foreign act to hold a dome-sized arena tour in Japan for the fifth consecutive year.[1] The oldest member T.O.P will not perform on this tour due to his mandatory military service in South Korea which began in February 2017.
