Following Erica's eviction, the HouseGuests recollected in the Before or After Head of Household competition. In this competition, HouseGuests were read a series of events from the season. They must determine whether the first event took place before or after the second event. An incorrect answer resulted in elimination. The last HouseGuest standing will be the new Head of Household. Derek was the winner. On Day 42, the HouseGuests dribbled in the Buttsketball Have-Not competition. In this competition, HouseGuests must score as many baskets as they can. However, one team member is strapped to the back of their opponents' goal, with the freedom to turn their goal to make their opponents miss. The team with more baskets will be the Haves for the week, while the other team will be Have-Nots for the week. Alejandra, Kaela, Olivia, and Paras became Have-Nots for the week. On Day 42, Derek nominated Johnny and Ryan for eviction. On Day 43, Derek, Johnny, and Ryan selected Maddy, Paras, and Olivia to play in the Under Fire Power of Veto competition. In this competition, HouseGuests will first fire one shot at the target to determine their ranking. The HouseGuest with a shot closest to the bullseye will be ranked highest, the second closest HouseGuest the second highest, and so forth. In each round, the two lowest competitors will compete head-to-head to knock down their opponent's army. The winner of the match will eliminate their opponent, and move to the next round. The last HouseGuest standing will win the Power of Veto. Derek was the winner. On Day 45, Derek decided not to use the Power of Veto. On Day 46, Will discovered Marsha the Moose inside the Crypt in the Have-Not room. He received a secret mission to hold a "Screech In" for the entire House, including getting them to take a shot and kiss the cod. He has one hour to accomplish the task. If he passes, the House will receive a kitchen party. If he fails, the House will be on slop for the rest of the season. However, the rest of the HouseGuests were given the secret task to ensure Will fails his mission. The HouseGuests passed their task and the House received a kitchen party. On Day 48, Ryan was evicted by a 6-0 vote. He became the first member of the jury.
