In Regina, Saskatchewan left-turn signals are designated by two-bulb light configuration with one (or two) red balls and one LED arrow. When a left-turn cycle begins the red ball will change to a flashing green arrow to permitted all traffic turning left. When the left-turn cycle ends the flashing green arrow will turn to a solid amber arrow for 5 to 3 seconds then change back to a red ball.
