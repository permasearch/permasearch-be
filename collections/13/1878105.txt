Covert channels can tunnel through secure operating systems and require special measures to control. Covert channel analysis is the only proven way to control covert channels.[citation needed] By contrast, secure operating systems can easily prevent misuse of legitimate channels. Distinguishing these is important. Analysis of legitimate channels for hidden objects is often misrepresented as the only successful countermeasure for legitimate channel misuse. Because this amounts to analysis of large amounts of software, it was shown as early as 1972 to be impractical.[3] Without being informed of this, some are misled to believe an analysis will "manage the risk" of these legitimate channels.
