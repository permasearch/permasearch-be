Writing for Forbes, Erik Kain appreciated the focus on Sasha in "The Other Side". He was critical of the decision to go with Rosita's plan rather than Sasha's plan "to use the sniper rifle to actually, you know, snipe Negan from a distance" rather than Rosita's insistence to "go inside the gate. Because I guess you need a sniper rifle for close quarters combat." Kain was critical of Sasha's decision to save Rosita saying, "If the show had really explained that Rosita was this awesome, essential part of group, I'd be more inclined to agree with Sasha's decision. As it stands, Sasha seems just as integral to the group as Rosita. It makes as little sense as Sasha agreeing to Rosita's plan in the first place, when the sniper plan is so much better. And it just plain sucks that the better character is waltzing off to certain death, while one of the show's worst characters (at least lately) is safe."[36] Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen liked Sasha's decision to leave Rosita behind, calling it a "nice twist" with "horrible, horrible consequences".[37] Jeff Stone, however, questioned Sasha's actions, believing it to be "manufactured and under-motivated (like Morganâ€™s turn last episode), since Sasha never seemed to have much of a martyr complex, and her major character beat in the series so far was finding a way back from the brink after she became suicidal back in Season 5."[38]
