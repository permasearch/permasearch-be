The picowatt (pW), not to be confused with the much larger petawatt (PW), is equal to one trillionth (10âˆ’12) of a watt. Technologically important powers that are measured in picowatts are typically used in reference to radio and radar receivers, acoustics and in the science of radio astronomy. One picowatt is the international standard reference value of sound power when this quantity is expressed as a level in decibels.[12]
