Cases of extrasolar planets close to a 1:2 mean-motion resonance are fairly common. Sixteen percent of systems found by the transit method are reported to have an example of this (with period ratios in the range 1.83-2.18),[33] as well as one sixth of planetary systems characterized by Doppler spectroscopy (with in this case a narrower period ratio range).[46] Due to incomplete knowledge of the systems, the actual proportions are likely to be higher.[33] Overall, about a third of radial velocity characterized systems appear to have a pair of planets close to a commensurability.[33][46] It is much more common for pairs of planets to have orbital period ratios a few percent larger than a mean-motion resonance ratio than a few percent smaller (particularly in the case of first order resonances, in which the integers in the ratio differ by one).[33] This was predicted to be true in cases where tidal interactions with the star are significant.[47]
