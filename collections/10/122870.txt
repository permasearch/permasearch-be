After a minor part in the film Dragonslayer,[10] McDiarmid was cast by George Lucas in Return of the Jedi as Emperor Palpatine, the main villain.[11] Sixteen years after appearing in Return of the Jedi, he reprised the role as the character's younger incarnation of Senator Palpatine and Sith Lord Darth Sidious in the prequel films: The Phantom Menace,[12] Attack of the Clones,[13] and Revenge of the Sith. The prequels had him play two faces to his character; he re-created his diabolical interpretation of Palpatine from Return of the Jedi when playing Darth Sidious, the Chancellor's Sith alter ego, but created a pleasant, charming character in Palpatine's public persona.
