The city's first fire department was a hook and ladder company organized in 1880 by the board of trustees (now city council).[23] A drinking water and electricity distribution system added in 1892â€“93 gave the town three fire hydrants and minimal street lighting.[24] Hillsboro built its first sewer system in 1911, but sewage treatment was not added until 1936.[25] In 1913, the city built its own water system,[26] and the first library, Carnegie City Library, opened in December 1914.[27] From 1921 to 1952, the world's second-tallest radio tower stood on the south side of the city,[28] but in 1952, the wireless telegraph tower was demolished.
