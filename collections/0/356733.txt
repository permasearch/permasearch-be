Elimination: While the women agreed that Mieka and Monique had been the two worst performers in the kitchen that night, T pushed the team into nominating Monique and Sarah to try to manipulate Ramsay into eliminating Monique, who they believed was a disruptive influence and kept the team from succeeding. When Ramsay was given the nominations, Monique interjected and revealed the team's plan to rig the elimination, but Ramsay called her and Sarah out anyway. After hearing the pleas from both Monique and Sarah he decided to overrule the nominations and eliminated Mieka for struggling on three straight services as well as he felt that she had no confidence in herself and she had given up.
