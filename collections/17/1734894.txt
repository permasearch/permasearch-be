The P224 is a subcompact variant of the compact P229. When the new design was announced in January 2012, the line was chambered only in .357 SIG and .40 S&W, and came only with a DAK (Double Action Kellermann) trigger. SIG announced that they would expand the line to include a DA/SA (Double Action/Single Action) trigger, a SRT DA/SA (Short Reset Double/Single Action) and would add a 9mm version in the future. As of 2013, the P224 was available in the original two calibers and the DAK trigger with four factory variants; SIG Anti-Snag (SAS), Nickel, Extreme and Equinox.[33] The pistol has since been discontinued.
