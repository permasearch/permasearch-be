Henderson was a Most Valuable Player candidate a year later, in a season shortened by a players' strike. He hit .319, fourth in the AL, and led the league in hits (135), runs (89) and in steals (56). Henderson was also 3rd in on-base percentage (.408), tied for 2nd in triples (7), 4th in walks (64), 8th in total bases (185) and 2nd in times reaching base (201). In so doing, he became the emblematic figure of Oakland manager Billy Martin's aggressive "Billy Ball" philosophy, which received much media attention.[25] Finishing second to the Milwaukee Brewers' Rollie Fingers in the MVP voting, Henderson's fielding that season also earned him his only Gold Glove Award. He later became known for his showboating "snatch catches", in which he would flick his glove out at incoming fly balls, then whip his arm behind his back after making the catch.[26]
