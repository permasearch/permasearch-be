Spending his teenage years in various parts of California as his father's career progressed,[3] Costner has described this as a period when he "lost a lot of confidence", having to make new friends often.[3] Costner lived in Ventura, then in Visalia; he attended Mt. Whitney High School and then moved to Orange County, where he graduated from Villa Park High School in 1973. He went on to earn a BA in marketing and finance from California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) in 1978.[3] While at CSUF, Kevin became a brother in the Delta Chi Fraternity.[1]
