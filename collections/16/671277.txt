For Bacteria, valid names must have a Latin or Neolatin name and can only use basic latin letters (w and j inclusive, see History of the Latin alphabet for these), consequently hyphens, accents and other letters are not accepted and should be transliterated correctly (e.g. ÃŸ=ss).[97] Ancient Greek being written in the Greek alphabet, needs to be transliterated into the Latin alphabet.
