Enhancing Pittsburgh's livability is the area faces little risk of natural disasters from such causes as earthquake, hurricane, wildfire, or tornado. Forbes ranked Pittsburgh as having the 2nd-lowest natural disaster risk in the nation for 2009.[161] Greater Pittsburgh is not entirely free of natural disasters, however. Residents living in extremely low-lying areas near the rivers or one of the 1,400 creeks and streams may have  occasional floods,[162] such as those caused when the remnants of Hurricane Ivan hit rainfall records in 2004.[163] River flooding is relatively rare due to federal flood control efforts extensively managing locks, dams, and reservoirs.[162][164][165] Residents living near smaller tributary streams are less protected from occasional flooding. The cost of a comprehensive flood control program for the region has been estimated at a prohibitive $50 billion.[162]
