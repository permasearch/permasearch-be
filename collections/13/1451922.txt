The MRCGP exam was first offered to general practitioners in 1965 and from 1968 it has been a requirement for GPs to hold this in order to join the college.[10] Before 2007 the MRCGP was a credit accumulation exam. Candidates needed to pass four modules within three years, or retake the whole exam.[11]
