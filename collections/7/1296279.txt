Although typical mooncakes can be around a few inches in diameter, imperial chefs have made some as large as several feet in radius, with its surface pressed with designs of Chang'e, cassia trees, or the Moon-Palace.[14] One tradition is to pile 13 mooncakes on top of each other to mimic a pagoda, the number 13 being chosen to represent the 13 months in a full lunar year.[14]
