Boogie Nights is based on a mockumentary short film that Anderson made while he was still in high school called The Dirk Diggler Story.[3] The short was based on the 1981 documentary Exhausted: John C. Holmes, The Real Story, a documentary about the life of legendary porn actor John Holmes, on whom Dirk Diggler is based.[7]
