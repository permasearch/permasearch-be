Walt Disney had planned to use "Clair de lune" for a segment of the 1940 film Fantasia, but the sequence was deleted from the film at 70% completion because of Fantasia's excessive length. The animated "Clair de lune" sequence, which illustrates the flow of the music with the movements of egrets, was later restored from a workprint in 1996 and included on a 2000 Fantasia DVD box set. The song When You Wish Upon a Star, from the 1940 Walt Disney film Pinocchio, borrows liberally from "Clair de lune".[citation needed]
