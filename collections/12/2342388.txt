In November 2017, Raj K. Purohit, an Indian politician and senior BJP member, called for the film to be banned. He stated: "How can a Rajput queen be shown dancing and without ghoonghat? It is against Rajput culture and pride. No community will be able to tolerate it." He said he would meet Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Smriti Irani to seek action against the film.[84] Central Board of Film Certification member Arjun Gupta petitioned the Home Minister to put Bhansali on trial for treason.[85] The Karni Sena held protests, supported by politicians in the ruling BJP party.[86]
