This film was Disney Australia's final feature (the studio was closed and equipment auctioned off once Cinderella III production completed in July 2006).[1] Unlike the previous sequel, Cinderella II: Dreams Come True, which was mostly made in Japan (that studio also closed shortly after completion of Cinderella II), Cinderella III's animators were given meticulous model sheets and extensive live-action sequences for animation reference.[citation needed]
