For years Spencer Publications founder Bill Spencer Sr. ruthlessly ran it as Chairman and CEO in Los Angeles then in New York City. His two living children, Karen Spencer and Bill Spencer Jr., worked their way up and upon their father's death Karen and Bill each received 50% ownership and were named co-CEO. Bill's son Liam Spencer is currently President.
