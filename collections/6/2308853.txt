In the eighteenth century, when Spain established a standing military in key areas of its overseas territory, privileges were extended to the military, the fuero militar, which had an impact on the colonial legal system and society.[11]  The fuero militar was the first time that privileges extended to plebeians, which has been argued was a cause of debasing justice.[12] Indigenous men were excluded from the military, and inter-ethnic conflicts occurred.[13] The fuero militar presented some contradictions in colonial rule.[14][15]
