The situation around No Man's Sky's promotion using screenshots and videos that were not from the game's final state (a practice known as "bullshots") led to discussion among developers, publishers, and journalists of how to best showcase upcoming games without being deceptive to the audience. Keighley, who felt some responsibility for the No Man's Sky situation, announced that all games that will be shown during The Game Awards 2016 ceremony would be more focused on gameplay of near-completed titles, using a Let's Play-type format, rather than allowing for scripted or pre-rendered videos.[225] Several journalists attribute a change in Valve's Steam storefront policies in November 2016, requiring all game screenshots and videos to be from the final product, as a response to the No Man's Sky situation.[226][227]
