1997Â : Rashid Hussain Bhd purchased Malayan Banking's share in Kwong Yik Bank. The bank then merged with DCB Bank (formerly D&C Bank, established 1966), which has been under the RHB stable since 1993. This biggest bank merger in the country's history formed RHB Bank Berhad, then Malaysia's third largest financial services group.
