Another notable example is the algorithm invented by Anatolii A. Karatsuba in 1960[7] that could multiply two n-digit numbers in     O (  n   log  2   ⁡ 3   )   {\displaystyle O(n^{\log _{2}3})}   operations (in Big O notation). This algorithm disproved Andrey Kolmogorov's 1956 conjecture that     Ω (  n  2   )   {\displaystyle \Omega (n^{2})}   operations would be required for that task.
