After finishing cleaning the house following his house party, Rick decides to unfreeze time after six months of it being stopped. He warns his grandkids, Morty and Summer, that time could initially be unstable. Rick encourages their parents, Beth and Jerry, to go get ice cream to allow time to stabilize. Morty and Summer develop a sibling rivalry, and the resulting uncertainty tears time apart into two realities—depicted visually as two mostly synchronized parallel realities. They are no longer a part of any timeline, and the garage is surrounded by a black void filled with Schrödinger's cats. Rick uses a Time Crystal to try to mend the timelines together, but Morty and Summer's continued uncertainty prevents the fusion from working. Rick's own uncertainty that his other self is potentially conspiring against him results in chaos.
