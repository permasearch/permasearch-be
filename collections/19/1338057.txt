Mickey initially wants no part of it. Pressed by Rocky, Mickey confesses that he handpicked the opponents for Rocky's title defenses in order to spare him from the beating Creed gave him in their rematch. He explains that Lang is young and powerful, and most of all he's "hungry", and that Rocky won't last three rounds, because he has lost his edge and become "civilized". Rocky, not wanting to retire and knowing that he never really defended his title against the best opponents, convinces Mickey to work with him a little while longer, pledges to "live in the gym", and be more focused than ever. Despite his promise to Mickey, Rocky trains in a Las Vegas style training camp that is filled with distractions, and is clearly not taking his training seriously. In contrast, Lang trains with ruthless determination and vigor.
