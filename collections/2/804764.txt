James "Jim" Levenstein is the main protagonist in three out of the four primary films in the American Pie series (the exception being American Wedding). He is one of the nerdy outsiders who wants to lose his virginity. He first appears in American Pie, where he is trying to lose his virginity before the end of high school and begins to pine for Czech exchange student, Nadia. Stifler persuades him to set up a webcam in his room so that they can all watch it together. The plan goes wrong, though, when Nadia discovers Jim's pornography collection and sits half-naked on his bed to read it. Jim is persuaded to return to his room, where he joins Nadia, unaware that he accidentally sent the weblink to the entire school directory. As Nadia is preparing to have sex with him, he prematurely ejaculates twice, embarrassing himself live in front of the entire school. Shortly afterwards Nadia leaves school and goes back home, now leaving Jim completely dateless for prom and ruining his likeliness of losing his virginity before high-school is over. In his desperation, Jim asks band geek Michelle Flaherty to the senior prom as she is apparently the only girl at his school who did not see what happened. He succeeds in getting Michelle into bed where she behaves passionately before leaving him to wake up alone. The film ends with Jim and his friends eating breakfast before toasting to the next step.
