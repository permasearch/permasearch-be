In 1990, Willie McGee posted a .335 average over 542 at-bats in the NL before being traded to the AL on August 29.[26] Although McGee finished the season in the AL, he had enough PA's in the NL to qualify for the NL batting title, which he won narrowly over Eddie Murray's .330. However, McGee batted .274 that season in the AL, bringing down his overall average to .324 and allowing Murray to lead the majors in batting average.[26][27]
