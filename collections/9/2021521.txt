The army of Cardolan was not crippled by Angmar's offensive at Amon Sûl, and therefore the Witch-king cannot commit to any further invasions of Arthedain with an enemy free to strike his armies' rear. The Barrow-Downs are chosen as the site of an offensive against the remainder of Cardolan's army, because the Dúnedain revere it as sacred ground that they would not allow a foe to desecrate. This way, Cardolan's forces are drawn into battle on ground of the Witch-king's choosing, and its forces are utterly destroyed. However, before Angmar can press its advantage against Arthedain, an offensive composed of Elves from Lindon, Rivendell, and Lothlórien is sent against its capital of Carn Dûm. Despite taking severe losses, the forces of Angmar manage to defend their fortress against the Elves long enough for reinforcements to arrive to lift the siege. The Elves are defeated, although enough damage has been done to Angmar to allow Arnor enough time to recover from its wounds unless action is taken. To prevent Arnor's resurgence, the Witch-king devises a plan that will inflict grievous harm upon the kingdom so that it does not defeat Angmar in its own weakness. The armies of Angmar once more descend upon the Barrow-Downs, and fell sorcerers of the Black Númenóreans create a plague that ravages Arnor, crippling its already fragile defences.
