The Meiji government at first modeled their army after the French Army. French advisers had been sent to Japan with two military missions (in 1872â€“1880 and 1884), in addition to one mission under the shogunate. Nationwide conscription was enforced in 1873 and a Western-style conscript army was established; military schools and arsenals were also built.
