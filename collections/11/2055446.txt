Supply Corps officers are widely distributed throughout the Navy and Department of Defense; they are typically billeted to a ship or shore activity's supply department, or to a supply unit or command, such as Navy Expeditionary Logistics Support Groups (NAVELSG), Fleet Logistics Centers (FLCs) or Navy Special Warfare (SPECWAR) Logistics Groups which support the United States Navy SEALs.
