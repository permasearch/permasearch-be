With Woolley's permission to redo the obverse, Weinman decided to remove the word "Liberty" from above the figure and place it above "In God We Trust" to the right of it.  This permitted him to extend Liberty's head almost to the top of the coin, maximizing the size of the depiction.  The letter "L" was placed in the concavity formed by the flag as it drapes under the figure's left elbow, and the rest of the word extended to the right from there, with the letter T in larger print, actually saving room as the larger size allowed the crossbar of the "T" to extend above the capitalized letters "R" and "Y".  This allowed the letters to be squeezed closer together.  When Woolley resigned on July 15 to become director of publicity for the Wilson  reelection campaign (a function he also fulfilled for Democratic candidates in 1912 and 1920), he mentioned in his resignation letter to Secretary McAdoo, "in working over the model for the obverse side of the half dollar Mr. Weinman is making a slight rearrangement of the word 'Liberty', and will have it ready for your inspection in a few days.  I like it and believe you will."[36]  Weinman wrote to the former director on July 20 that increasing the size of the figure of Liberty improved its appearance.[36]
