Tourism to the area began in the early 1960s. In 2003, about 19,000 tourists arrived. About 3500 Sherpa people live in villages and seasonal settlements situated along the main tourist trails.[6] The park's visitor centre is located at the top of a hill in Namche Bazaar, where a company of the Nepali Army is stationed for protection of the park. The park's southern entrance is a few hundred metres north of Monzo at 2,835 m (9,301 ft), a one-day trek from Lukla.[citation needed]
