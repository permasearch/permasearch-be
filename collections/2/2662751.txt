The NZ ETS is highly linked to international carbon markets as it allows the importing of most of the Kyoto Protocol emission units. It also creates a specific domestic unit; the 'New Zealand Unit' (NZU), which will be issued by free allocation to emitters, with no auctions intended in the short term.[12] The NZU is equivalent to 1 tonne of carbon dioxide. Free allocation of NZUs will vary by sector. The commercial fishery sector (who are not participants) will receive a free allocation of units on a historic basis.[10] Owners of pre-1990 forests will receive a fixed free allocation of units.[8] Free allocation to emissions-intensive industry,[13][14] will be provided on an output-intensity basis. For this sector, there is no set limit on the number of units that may be allocated.[15] The number of units allocated to eligible emitters will be based on the average emissions per unit of output within a defined 'activity'.[16] Bertram and Terry (2010, p 16) state that as the NZ ETS does not 'cap' emissions, the NZ ETS is not a cap and trade scheme as understood in the economics literature.[17]
