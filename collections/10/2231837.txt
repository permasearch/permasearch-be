Guardian of Light is not part of the main Tomb Raider brand, instead it was intended to start a new series simply titled "Lara Croft". Brand director Karl Stewart said, "When Underworld was finished, that was the end to the trilogy, and kind of the end of a whole era for us. We took a step back as a studio and spent a couple of months experimenting, trying to make a decision on how to go forward".[15] Stewart also said that everyone who worked on Guardian of Light also worked on the previous three games (Tomb Raider: Legend, Tomb Raider: Anniversary, and Tomb Raider: Underworld).[5] Guardian of Light uses the same game engine as Tomb Raider: Underworld and features real-time lighting effects, realistic shadows and "tons" of physics-based objects.[16] Vegetation sways in the wind and reacts when the player walks through it.[7][8] The environments have a "nice sense of scale".[7]
