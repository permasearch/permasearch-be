In the final race of the Contender Round at Talladega, Harvick was again in a tough situation. During a green-white-checker restart, Harvick's car was unable to accelerate, which triggered a multi-car wreck. Due to the caution being displayed quickly after the leaders crossed the line, the race was considered official, and Joey Logano was declared the winner. Denny Hamlin, who was competing with Harvick for a spot in the next round, was caught up in the wreck, and was eliminated from the Chase. Harvick managed to avoid the wreck, and finished 15th, advancing him to the next round in the Chase. Trevor Bayne, who was hit in the quarter panel by Harvick which triggered the wreck, accused him of intentionally spinning him out in order to secure a spot in the next round. Kevin Harvick and his crew chief, Rodney Childers, claimed that they had tried to move out of the way during the restart, knowing that their engine was failing. In the first race of the Eliminator Round, Harvick finished 8th at Martinsville. The next week at Texas, he managed to finish 3rd, despite having a faulty shifter which forced him to drive with one hand for the last several laps. In the final race before the Championship Round, at Phoenix, Harvick dominated the race, leading 143 of 219 laps. Unfortunately, the race did not go the distance due to rain, and at the time Dale Earnhardt Jr was the leader of the race due to the caution coming out during green flag pit stops, and he was ultimately the winner as well. Kevin Harvick finished the race in the 2nd position, advancing him to the Championship Round at Homestead-Miami Speedway.
