Rolling Stone ranked "Rockstar" at number 100 in their list of the 100 best songs of 2007.[2] Aside from its praise from Rolling Stone and popularity, some have even labeled it one of the worst songs of all time.[3][4] "Rockstar" was listed at number 2 in BuzzFeed's list of the 30 worst songs ever written stating that "If aliens came to earth and asked why everyone hates Nickelback so much, this song would be a perfect explanation."[5] A 2008 Popjustice poll voted "Rockstar" as the worst single of the year.[6] The Guardian's Peter Robinson claimed that the song was "...a Smack the Pony skit without the laughter track; ironic, given that Rockstar is one of the most unintentionally hilarious songs of the last few years. It is also one of most confusing." He concluded his review by stating, "In summary, this song makes literally no sense and is the worst thing of all time."[7]
