After the war Brazil signed a separate Loizaga â€“ Cotegipe Treaty of peace and borders with Paraguay on January 9, 1872, in which it obtained freedom of navigation on the Paraguay River. Brazil also retained the northern regions it had claimed before the war.[103] Those regions are now part of its State of Mato Grosso do Sul.
