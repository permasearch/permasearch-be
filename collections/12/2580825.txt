The poem is based upon an actual experience of Brontë's.[6] A note stating "Composed in the Long-Plantation on a wild bright windy day", was written in Anne Brontë's hand at the bottom of the manuscript and the "Long-Plantation" was identified by Edward Chitham as a wood to the East of Kirby Hall toward the River Ouse, though there is no clear evidence that Long Plantation is a real place.[7] This is about a mile north of Thorp Green.[8]
