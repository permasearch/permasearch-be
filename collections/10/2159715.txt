As of 2015, COPD affected about 174.5 million (2.4%) of the global population.[6] It typically occurs in people over the age of 40.[3] Males and females are affected equally commonly.[3] In 2015, it resulted in 3.2 million deaths, up from 2.4 million deaths in 1990.[7][12] More than 90% of these deaths occur in the developing world.[3] The number of deaths is projected to increase further because of higher smoking rates in the developing world, and an aging population in many countries.[13] It resulted in an estimated economic cost of $2.1Â trillion in 2010.[14]
