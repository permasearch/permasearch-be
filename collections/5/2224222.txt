A colorized version of Holiday Inn was released by Universal on October 14, 2008. The colorization was done by Legend Films, who used Edith Headâ€™s sketch artist, Jan Muckelstone, as a color design consultant for costume authenticity.[citation needed] The colorized version bears a noticeable error in the "Abraham" sequence, as Crosby's and Reynold's makeup is brown, rather than the black of burnt cork.
