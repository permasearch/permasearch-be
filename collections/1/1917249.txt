The so-called "War on Terror" that began with the September 11 attacks has been claimed by some to be World War III[55][56] or sometimes as World War IV.[57] Others have disparaged such claims as "distorting American history." While there is general agreement amongst historians regarding the definitions and extent of the first two World Wars, namely due to the unmistakable global scale of aggression and self-destruction of these two wars, a few have claimed that a "World War" might now no longer require such worldwide and large scale aggression and carnage. Still such claims of a new "lower threshold of aggression," that might now be sufficient to qualify a war as a "World War" have not gained such widespread acceptance and support as the definitions of the first two World Wars have received amongst historians.[58]
