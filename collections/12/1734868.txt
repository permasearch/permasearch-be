The SIG Sauer P226 ST was a limited production all-stainless version of the SIG P226 pistol. It is heavier than a standard P226 because the frame was made of stainless steel instead of aluminum. Weight with the magazine was a hefty 1,196 g (42.2 oz) vs 964 g (34.0 oz) of the standard aluminum-framed version. The added weight of an all-stainless frame is claimed to provide greater recoil reduction and a quicker return to target between shots making it a common choice among Practical Shooting competitors. The P226 Stainless had a blued barrel and featured an M1913 Picatinny rail. These frames were made in Germany. Prototypes were tested in 2004 and it went into production in very limited numbers. The P226 ST is no longer manufactured.
