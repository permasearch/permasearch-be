In the early-to-mid-19th century, schools in the United States were greatly influenced by Protestantism. This created difficulties with American Catholics. They challenged the singing of Protestant hymns and reading of the King James Bible in the classroom. Some school boards made changes to be more non-denominational.[41]  Tensions were great during this time period as Americans were already fearful of immigration and Catholics.  After a number of struggles, for a variety of reasons, American Catholics began creating their own schools in the 1840s.  Archbishop at the time, John Hughes, insisted that Catholic Education was the primary way to preserve proper Christian teaching.[42]  He cited education at a young age promoted the reason and experience necessary for a strong religious background.  He called American Catholics "to multiply our schools, and to perfect them."[43]  By 1852 the bishops recommended "catholic children should attend only schools that were under church control."[44]
