One, Two, Three is a 1961 American comedy film directed by Billy Wilder and written by Wilder and I. A. L. Diamond. It is based on the 1929 Hungarian one-act play Egy, kettő, három by Ferenc Molnár, with a "plot borrowed partly from" Ninotchka, a 1939 film co-written by Wilder.[3][4] The comedy features James Cagney, Horst Buchholz, Lilo Pulver, Pamela Tiffin, Arlene Francis, Leon Askin, Howard St. John, and others.[5] It would be Cagney's last film appearance until Ragtime in 1981, 20 years later.[6][7]
