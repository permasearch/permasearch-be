Brambleberry is a white she-cat with black spotted fur, blue eyes, and a strikingly pink nose. A medicine cat, she nursed Crookedstar back to health when he was a kit and was the mentor of Mudfur when he gave up his warrior life. She was mentored by Milkfur. She shared a special bond with Crookedstar, because when he was a kit, she was the only one to see past his jaw, and realize that he had a great destiny far beyond any other cat's as his own. At Crookedstar's death, she is there and is the one who leads him to StarClan.
