In this parable, the owner is generally regarded as representing God, who had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and came seeking fruit. The gardener (vinedresser) is Jesus.[1] Fig trees were common trees and would rarely be planted in vineyards because the deep roots and large branches take much ground that would otherwise be used for the vine.[2]
