The Mega Drive version knocked Ecco the Dolphin from the top of the charts in the UK.[7] MegaTech gave the game 94% and a Hyper Game award, praising the number of features and the control method.[8] Computer Gaming World in July 1994 said that the Macintosh version's graphics were not as good as Links but much better than the PC version's. Citing its emphasis on simulation, the magazine concluded that "Unlike many sequels, this actually adds to the genre".[9] Reviewing the Game Gear version, GamePro praised the screen layout, controls, and detailed graphics, but criticized the long loading times, weak sound effects, and music.[10]
