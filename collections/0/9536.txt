The Gupta Empire was an ancient Indian empire, which existed at its zenith from approximately 319 to 485 CE and covered much of the Indian subcontinent.[1] This period is called the Golden Age of India.[2][note 1] The ruling dynasty of the empire was founded by Sri Gupta; the most notable rulers of the dynasty were Chandragupta I, Samudragupta, and Chandragupta II . The 5th-century CE Sanskrit poet Kalidasa credits the Guptas with having conquered about twenty-one kingdoms, both in and outside India, including the kingdoms of Parasikas, the Hunas, the Kambojas, tribes located in the west and east Oxus valleys, the Kinnaras, Kiratas, and others.[4][non-primary source needed]
