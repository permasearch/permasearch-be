The character of Tommy Vercetti received very positive reviews and remarks from critics and players of Vice City, making it to many lists of the best video game characters. He was included on IGN's list of Grand Theft Auto Favorite Badasses. They said "as much as we admire the strong-but-silent types, by the time Vice City rolled around, we were ready for a more fleshed-out protagonist. We got just that in the Hawaiian shirt-loving Tommy Vercetti."[6] Crave Online also placed Tommy second on their Top 10 Most Memorable GTA Characters, stating that playing as him was "a breath of fresh air".[11] In 2008, The Age ranked Vercetti as the 29th greatest Xbox character of all time, praised Ray Liotta's voice acting and stated "while the character riffs on Tony Montana throughout the game, Liotta's speeches give him a reckless sense of humour that makes him more likeable than old Scarface."[12] Liotta won the award for "Best Live Action/Voice Male Performance" at the 2003 G-Phoria Awards and "Best Performance by a Human" at the 2003 Spike Video Game Awards for his work as Vercetti.[13][14]
