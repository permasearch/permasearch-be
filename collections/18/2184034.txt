Gottschalk of Orbais, a ninth-century Saxon monk, argued that God predestines some people to hell as well as predestining some to heaven, a view known as double predestination. He was condemned by several synods, but his views remained popular. Irish theologian John Scottus Eriugena wrote a refutation of Gottschalk.[20] Eriugena abandoned Augustine's teaching on predestination.[21] He wrote that God's predestination should be equated with his foreknowledge of people's choices.[22]
