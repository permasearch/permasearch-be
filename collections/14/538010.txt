Approximately one month after his sentencing,[4] Warmbier suffered severe neurological injury from an unknown cause. North Korean authorities did not disclose his medical condition until June 2017, when they announced he had fallen into a coma as a result of botulism and a sleeping pill.[5] The United States made diplomatic efforts to seek Warmbier's release, and Warmbier was freed in June 2017, in a comatose state after 17 months in captivity.[6] He was repatriated to the United States, arriving in Cincinnati, Ohio, on June 13, and was taken to University of Cincinnati Medical Center for immediate evaluation and treatment. His U.S. physicians found no evidence of botulism. Nevertheless, a Coroner's report was unable to identify the cause of the injury, finding no evidence of physical torture on Warmbier's body.[7]
