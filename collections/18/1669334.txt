In 2017 the US department of energy published the "DOE Electromagnetic Pulse Resilience Action Plan"[46], Edwin Boston published a dissertation on the topic[47] and the EMP Commission published "Assessing the threat from electromagnetic pulse (EMP)"[48]. The EMP commission was closed in summer 2017[49]. They found that earlier reports had underestimated the effects of an EMP attack on the national infrastructure and highlighted issues with communications from the DoD due to the classified nature of the material and recommended that the DHS instead of going to the DOE for guidance and direction should directly cooperate with the more knowledgeable parts of the DOE. Several reports are in process of being released to the general public.[50].
