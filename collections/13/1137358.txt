That OTS was the primary regulator of AIG has been described as "nonsense"[35] and compared to "the super-heavyweight of the world going up against the 65 lb, 13-year-old, class weakling".[36] AIG operates in 130 countries.[37] The OTS had a small division that monitored derivatives including the credit default swaps at AIG.[38] After a dispute with Goldman Sachs in 2007 over the value of the credit default swaps,[39] the OTS did not initiate formal enforcement action, but "periodically raised concerns with AIG managers".[38] Other sources of concern were the three credit rating agencies and AIG's auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers.[39] In March 2008, after AIG disclosed valuation problems, the OTS sent a letter to AIG requesting a "corrective action plan" in 30 days.[38] The division overseeing AIG Financial Products was "quietly disbanded" and AIG missed their deadline.[38]
