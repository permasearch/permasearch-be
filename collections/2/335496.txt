The clone now known as Pando was discovered in 1968 by researcher Burton V. Barnes, who continued to study it through the 1970s.[11] Barnes had described Pando as a single organism based on its morphological characteristics alone; molecular techniques and methods developed since that time have largely substantiated those conclusions.
