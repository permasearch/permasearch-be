Although his record sales and radio play dwindled during the '90s, Jennings continued to draw large crowds at his live performances.[91] In 1996, Jennings released his album, Right for the Time, including some of his newer songs, including "The Most Sensible Thing", which was covered by Angry Grandpa in 2015. In 1997, after the Lollapalooza tour, he decreased his tour schedule and became centered on his family.[95]
