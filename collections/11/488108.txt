Booth's grandfather was first mentioned in season 4, but isn't introduced until Season 5 when Hank comes to visit Booth after butting heads with the staff at his retirement home. He quickly takes a liking to Brennan and, when Booth denies being in a relationship with her, deadpans that he "did not raise [Booth] well", apparently approving of them being together despite their repeated denials. Hank reveals to her that he caught his son hitting Seeley and chased him out. From then on he raised the boys as his own children. In "The Foot in the Foreclosure", Hank confides this secret to Seeley's work partner, Temperance Brennan, telling her that she should tell Seeley this and to "hold him" when she does. In the same episode, Hank stays at Seeley's apartment after getting into trouble with the nursing staff at the "Willow River Retirement community", where he was staying at, due to having recently had heart surgery. During his stay, he bonds with Brennan and Lance Sweets, however he realizes he needs to go back after he nearly burns down Seeley's apartment while making grilled cheese. He had also caused a stir at a home depot store by pretending to be the greeter. Hank reappears in Season 7 and tells Booth that the latter's father died of liver failure. However, Seeley's indifference concerns him and Bones. He tells Booth to love Brennan and their unborn daughter and gives him a box from his son. Booth refuses to open it at first, but Brennan convinces him and Booth finally looks at the good memories of his father within, with Brennan at his side comforting him, at the end of the episode.[21]
