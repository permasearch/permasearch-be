As with any growing city, Cibolo has had its growing pains. In recent history, these include ceding a majority of the City's Extraterritorial District to the neighboring city of Schertz, a fight between the mayor and mayor pro-tem,[13] the lack of records regarding the rezoning of the property that would eventually become the city's first Super Wal-Mart and a recall election that ousted two members of the City Council,[14] a mayor who resigns,[15] and the questionable communications of a possible toll road through the city.
