Additionally, it is questionable whether Marshall should have participated in the Marbury case because of his participating role in the dispute.[13] Marshall was still the acting Secretary of State when the nominations were made, and he himself had signed the commissions and had been responsible for their delivery.[13] This potential conflict of interest raises strong grounds for Marshall to have recused himself from the case.[13] In hindsight, the fact that Marshall did not recuse himself from Marbury is likely indicative of his eagerness to hear the case and use it to establish judicial review.[31]
