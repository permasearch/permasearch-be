By 1913, imported beer represented only 12% of the total consumption in the Philippines; San Miguel held an 88% share of the industry. Róxas died in Paris, France in 1913. Soon after, Don Benito Legarda and Don Gonzalo Tuasón made it advisable to change the form of the company from a firm of co-participants to a corporation (San Miguel Brewery, Inc.). Róxas's son, Don Antonio Róxas y de Ayala, was appointed president, with Don Enrique Brías y de Coya and Don Ramón J. Fernández as managers.
