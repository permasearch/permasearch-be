If the bill goes through the second reading, the bill is sent to a Select Committee where every clause in the bill is examined. Members of Parliament who support the bill in principle but do not agree with certain clauses can propose amendments to those clauses at this stage. Following its report back to the House, the bill will go through its third reading where only minor amendments will be allowed before it is passed.[2]
