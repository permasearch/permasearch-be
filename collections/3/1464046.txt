As long as the process variable is below the setpoint, the control output is set to the higher value.  As soon as it rises above the setpoint, the control output is set to the lower value.  Ideally, the output waveform is nearly square, spending equal time above and below the setpoint.  The period and amplitude of the resultant oscillations are measured, and used to compute the ultimate gain and period, which are then fed into the Zieglerâ€“Nichols method.
