The Velvelettes, a minor act signed to Motown's V.I.P. subsidiary, recorded the first version of the song in May 1966. The group had found some success with their first two (official) Motown singles, "Needle In A Haystack" and "He Was Really Sayin' Somethin'", but their last two releases had failed to chart. Although "These Things Will Keep Me Loving You" was scheduled for release on V.I.P. (V.I.P. 25034), the song was instead released on Motown's Soul imprint (as S 35025), in August 1966. It became a minor R&B hit in America, peaking at #43 on the US R&B Charts in late 1966. It nearly made it onto the Billboard Hot 100 as well, bubbling under at #102.[1] A Velvelettes album project was also started, The Velvelettes, and scheduled for release as V.I.P. 401. The LP was scrapped and the group disbanded shortly after. "These Things Will Keep Me Loving You" proved to be their last Motown single. In 1971, however, a British (Tamla Motown) reissue of the song became a hit, making #34 on the UK Singles Charts in August of that year.[2] Despite the newfound success, The Velvelettes did not reunite until the 1980s; they would go on to record (with all four original members) for Ian Levine's Motorcity Records as well. Their next single was a rerecorded version of their hit "Needle In A Haystack", released on Levine's Nightmare label some 21 years after this song.
