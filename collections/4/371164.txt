Numerous diagnoses and findings can be made based upon electrocardiography, and many are discussed above.  Overall, the diagnoses are made based on the patterns.  For example, an "irregularly irregular" QRS complex without P waves is the hallmark of atrial fibrillation; however, other findings can be present as well, such as a bundle branch block that alters the shape of the QRS complexes.  ECGs can be interpreted in isolation but should be applied – like all diagnostic tests – in the context of the patient.  For example, an observation of peaked T waves is not sufficient to diagnose hyperkalemia; such a diagnosis should be verified by measuring the blood potassium level.  Conversely, a discovery of hyperkalemia should be followed by an ECG for manifestations such as peaked T waves, widened QRS complexes, and loss of P waves.  The following is an organized list of possible ECG-based diagnoses.
