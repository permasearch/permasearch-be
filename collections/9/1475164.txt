On 3 July 2008, Jágr, an unrestricted free agent for the first time in his career, was informed by Rangers General Manager Glen Sather that the club would not re-sign him. Sather admitted that the two sides never engaged in detailed negotiations for a new contract, and that after many months of speculation, Jágr was "seriously considering" going to Russia to finish his career, despite offers from other NHL teams.[12] Jágr expressed a desire to possibly finish out his career at his father's club, HC Kladno.[13] On 4 July, Jágr agreed to a two-year contract with Avangard Omsk of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL); the deal was reported to pay Jágr the equivalent of US$5 million annually.[14]
