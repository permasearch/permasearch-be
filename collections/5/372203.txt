When founded in 1964, SeaWorld San Diego was the first of its kind to feature a Dolphin Cove. In 1970, the second park SeaWorld Ohio was built in Aurora, Ohio, near Cleveland; it featured a Dolphin Cove.[1] In 1973, the third Dolphin Cove opened together with SeaWorld Orlando.[2] In 1988, the fourth Dolphin Cove in SeaWorld San Antonio opened its doors.[3] In January 2001, SeaWorld Ohio was sold to Six Flags resulting in the exhibit's closure. On March 6, 2015, SeaWorld San Antonio announced that the park would have a new dolphin habitat and hub for three of its animal interaction programs with dolphins, beluga whales and California sea lions called Discovery Point. The announcement of the project was followed by Dolphin Cove's closure on March 23, 2015. Discovery Point officially opened to the public on May 21, 2016. The project has doubled the size of the previous dolphin pool and added an underwater viewing area.
