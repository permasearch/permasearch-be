Atzompa has been making pottery for at least 500 years. It is widely known for its traditional green glazed cookware and ornamental pieces. The glaze for the green pieces was originally lead based but that was changed in the 1990s due to health concerns.[1][13] The green glazed ware is mostly formed into utilitarian items such as pots, cazuelas, jars, bowls and more. More recently, artisans in the town have been experimenting with various other styles of pottery, mostly decorative times in a variety of styles. One of these is called “pastillaje” where very small and fine pieces of clay are formed and pressed onto the main surface of the piece to create decoration.[2] The town also has an outlet for its ware called the Casa de las Artesanias.[22]
