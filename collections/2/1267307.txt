Ellsworth befriended Earp's widow, Josephine Earp. After Wyatt's death, she wrote him that she was sending him Wyatt's handgun, a shotgun, pipe, and wedding ring. She said she was sending him a .41-caliber Colt revolver, which she said Wyatt referred to affectionately as his "baby pony." However, Ellsworth actually received a .45-caliber Colt revolver with a 7 Â½" barrel. Its serial number indicates it was originally shipped from the Colt factory on January 30, 1883.[275] The shotgun was a 16 gauge double-barreled hunting shotgun and case belonging to Wyatt.[276] Ellsworth's widow donated this pistol to the Arizona Historical Society in 1988.[275]
