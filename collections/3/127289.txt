Astrid "Stains" Stanislowski[8] (Bridget Shergalis) is a teammate and friend of Maddie's. She is a petite girl with a hearty appetite. She gets her name because her clothing gets inadvertently dirty in each episode she appears in. She has a recurring tendency to rub the side of her nose with her thumb whenever she gets involved in a scheme, as seen in "Team-a-Rooney", when the team rallies against Principal Fickman, in "Sweet 16-a-Rooney", when she helps plan a surprise party for Maddie, and in "Shoe-a-Rooney", when she has to take over for Maddie in a game because Maddie was too busy obsessing with her new shoes. She also has a habit of ending each sentence with "man", even when referring to Maddie and her other teammates.
