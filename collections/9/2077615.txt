People who approve of or associate themselves with certain politicians or political groups are generally called "supporters" rather than "fans", although there are politicians with official or unofficial "fan clubs".  Intense and organized support for a politician may be referred to as a personality cult, particularly in authoritarian or totalitarian regimes.
