Eventually, Father's plans come to fruition on the "Promised Day" (約束の日, Yakusoku no Hi), when an eclipse (the sun symbolizes a man, and the moon symbolizes a woman, with an eclipse representing a perfect being) would ensure Father's plan succeeds. Father manages to restrain his sacrifices so he can gather enough souls into his body from Amestris's people to absorb the trans-dimensional entity behind the Gate; Father claims that this being is "God" (神, Kami). From there, Father creates a new youthful body with his powers increased to the point of defying natural order. However, Hohenheim's transmutation circle restored the Amestrians' souls to their bodies with Father starting to lose control over his new powers.[ch. 104, 107] Furthermore, Father is weakened by both the alchemists and the military. After Edward manages to pierce Father's chest to free the trapped souls, "God" proceeds to turn Father inside out, dragging him before the gate. As he is taken away, Father laments the harshness of reality, crying out that he does not understand why reality does not permit him to get his greatest desires, and why freedom seems so impossible to achieve. At the Gates, Father, now reduced back to his original form, confronts the force of Truth, who poetically punishes Father by letting the gate drag him back into it (where he was presumably created from), thus letting Father stand in God's place in some senses whilst stripping Father completely of the freedom he cherished.[ch. 108] He is voiced by Iemasa Kayumi in Japanese and by Kent Williams in English.
