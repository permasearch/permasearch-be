There are several rides that are permanent fixtures at the fair, including the Giant Slide, on which fairgoers ride down a large fiberglass slide on burlap sacks. The Skyride is an aerial lift ride that carried fairgoers across the grounds in a gondola.  The Space Tower is a gyro tower that rotates as it lifts people over 300 feet in the air, giving views of the Minneapolis/St. Paul area.  There is also a haunted house, located on Judson Ave, a water raft ride, and log chute. The fair's oldest ride, Ye Old Mill (opened in 1915), is located near the food building. It is a tunnel of love style ride that caters to all ages.[tone]
