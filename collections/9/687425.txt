Walk-off celebrations typically consist of an entire baseball team leaving the dugout to meet a player at home plate after he or she hits a walk-off home run, or at whichever base the hitter happens to reach if a traditional base hit results in a walk-off victory. Players often encircle teammates who hit a walk-off before dancing and roughhousing to celebrate their victory. Controversy surrounded these walk-off celebrations on April 29th, 2010 when Kendrys Morales, then a member of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, broke his left leg while celebrating a walk-off home run.[15] As a result of this injury, team manager Mike Sciosia instituted new guidelines for his team that ensured a much tamer response to all subsequent walk-off victories.[16]
