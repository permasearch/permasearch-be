Greek historians Herodotus (5th century BC) and Diodorus Siculus (1st century BC) provide the most complete, surviving evidence of how Ancient Egyptians approached the preservation of a dead body.[20] Before embalming, or preserving the dead body as to delay or prevent decay, mourners, especially if the deceased had high status,  covered their faces with mud, and paraded around town while beating their chests.[20] If the wife of a high status male died, her body was not embalmed until three or four days have passed, because this prevented abuse of the corpse.[20] In the case that someone drowned or was attacked, embalming was carried out immediately on their body, in a sacred and careful manner. This kind of death was viewed as venerated, and only priests was permitted to touch the body.[20]
