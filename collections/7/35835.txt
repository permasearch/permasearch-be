Clayton Donnell commented "If one believes the Maginot Line was built for the primary purpose of stopping a German invasion of France, most will consider it a massive failure and a waste of money ... in reality, the line was not built to be the ultimate savior of France, although too many Frenchmen at the time believed it to be so, thus giving them a very false sense of security... . Rather, it was assigned a series of minor yet crucial roles, all of which were fulfilled."[51] Highlighting these roles, Donnell commented "The primary role of the line was to prevent a concerted attack on France through the traditional invasion routes and to permit time for the mobilization of troops. This mission was fulfilled. Second, in case of an enemy invasion it would allow the French to fight on favorable terrain and to force the enemy to skirt the line and move through Belgium ..." Donnell notes that the French played into the Germans' hand, rather than using the line as the basis for an offensive.[52]
