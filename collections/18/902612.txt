Resins that are used in varnishes include amber, kauri gum, dammar, copal, rosin (pine resin), sandarac, balsam, elemi, mastic, and others.  Shellac is also a resin.  In the 1900s in Canada, resins from local trees were used to finish pianos[citation needed].  As a result, these now antique pianos are considered difficult to refinish.  However, shellac can be used over the existing resins provided sufficient time is allowed for thin coats to cure.  Thus the original finish can be returned to its original lustre while preserving the color and age-related crackle.
