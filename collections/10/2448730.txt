In 1998, Legendary OPM group APO and defunct band Eraserheads teamed up for their first "San Miguel Beer" TV commercial "Homeboys." The concept of reviving and modernizing their originals by rock/alternative bands in the 1990s paved the way to two tribute albums by various bands entitled Kami nAPO Muna in 2006 and Kami nAPO Muna Ulit in 2007.
