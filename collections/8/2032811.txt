The main traditional dishes in Ethiopian cuisine and Eritrean cuisine are tsebhis (stews) served with injera[1] (flatbread made from teff,[1] wheat, or sorghum) and hilbet (paste made from legumes, mainly lentils and fava beans). Eritrean and Ethiopian cuisine (especially in the northern half) are very similar, given the shared history of the two countries.
