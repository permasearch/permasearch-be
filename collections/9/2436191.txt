When China joined the WTO, it agreed to considerably harsher conditions than other developing countries.[4] After China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO), the service sector was considerably liberalized and foreign investment was allowed; restrictions on retail, wholesale and distribution ended.[5] Banking, financial services, insurance and telecommunications were also opened up to foreign investment.[6] Furthermore, China had to deal with certain concerns linked to transparency and intellectual property that the accession to WTO underlined.[7][8]
