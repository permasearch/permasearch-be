Overdose from dietary sources alone is unlikely because excess magnesium in the blood is promptly filtered by the kidneys,[54] and overdose is more likely in the presence of impaired renal function. In spite of this, megadose therapy has caused death in a young child,[62] and severe hypermagnesemia in a woman[63] and a young girl[64] who had healthy kidneys. The most common symptoms of overdose are nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; other symptoms include hypotension, confusion, slowed heart and respiratory rate, deficiencies of other minerals, coma, cardiac arrhythmia, and death from cardiac arrest.[48]
