In Project Freelancer, F.I.L.S.S. assisted the Director on the flagship Mother of Invention and various other freelancer bases. She appears to be a close companion of the Freelancers as they greet her when they return from their missions. One subroutine becomes Sheila the tank. In Season 10, in the present day, the same abandoned facility from earlier had become Director's hideout. There she spends her days constantly repeating a video of Allison. After Carolina and Church left the Director, he ordered F.I.L.S.S. to delete everything, including her, except the video. Before deletion, they both express the honor of serving each other.
