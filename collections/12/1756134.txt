The ceremony resumes with a choir boy singing, but Bean becomes so bored by this he falls asleep and starts snoring on the father's shoulder, but he suddenly wakes up when the song ends. When it is time for the bride and groom to exchange vows, Bean interrupts by repeating the first line that the groom was supposed to say. He then mocks the groom while he is repeating the rest of his vows. When it is the bride's turn to say her vows,  Bean distracts the cameraman by acting ridiculously to the lens. The priest then finally declares the two husband & wife, and when the two kiss Bean humorously covers his eyes.
