The Working Monetary Base is defined as the Monetary Base minus the excess reserves and should be conceptually understood as the fact that (at least as this instant in time) the excess reserves are not doing anything sort of like deep frozen money and that the working monetary base is only in use.[citation needed] Before the 2008 financial crisis, since excess reserves were small or unimportant; the working monetary base was essentially equivalent to the monetary base. Much recent economic work seems to indicate[citation needed] that the inflationary impact of the working monetary base is normal while the excess reserves have little current inflationary impact as general fears of hyper inflation have plagued economic columns since the balance sheet explosion. See the chart in this article showing that the actual working monetary base has appreciated much more normally than the traditional monetary base since 2008. Excess reserves, instead of being wasted, may contribute to the overall stability of the banking system since they are a more than legally required buffer against losses sudden and unexpected.[citation needed]
