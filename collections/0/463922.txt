The open-field system, especially its characteristic of common grazing lands, has often been used as an example by economists to illustrate "the tragedy of the commons" and assert that private ownership is a better steward of resources than common or public ownership. "Tragedy of the commons" refers to the alleged destruction of common pastures in England as a result of overgrazing, each tenant maximising his gain by grazing as many animals as possible and ignoring the long-term impact of overgrazing. However, the creator of the term "tragedy of the commons," Garrett Hardin, pointed out that the pastures of England were "protected from ruin by limiting each tenant to a fixed number of animals". Thus, Hardin says the commons were "managed", the "logical equivalent of socialism...which may be good or bad depending on the quality of the management."[22] The fact that the open-field system endured for as much as a thousand years and provided a livelihood to a growing population during that period indicates that the quality of management of the commons was often good.[citation needed]
