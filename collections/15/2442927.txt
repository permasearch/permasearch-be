The Red Sox World Series win in 2007 continued the success of Boston-area teams in recent years.[18] The Celtics won their 17th championship, their first championship since 1986, the last time the Red Sox lost in the World Series, ​7 1⁄2 months later. Furthermore, the New England Patriots had victories in 2001, 2003, 2004, 2014 and 2016, the Boston Bruins in 2011, and the Red Sox three years earlier in 2004 and six years later in 2013 and five years after that in 2018.
