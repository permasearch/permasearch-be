In the fall of 1863 the Army of Northern Virginia sent most of Gen. James Longstreet's First Corps, Army of Northern Virginia via rail from Virginia to northern Georgia in order to reinforce Gen. Bragg's Army of Tennessee just prior to the Battle of Chickamauga. Approximately 15,000 men[37] were transported about 900 miles[38] to the Georgia theater of operations. This operation involved sixteen different railroads[38] and took a total of seven days (9 September-16 September) for the entire corps to arrive in Georgia.[38][39]
