The Incorruptible Crown is also known as the Imperishable Crown, and is referenced in 1 Corinthians 9:25.[2] This epistle, written by Paul of Tarsus, deems this crown "imperishable" in order "to contrast it with the temporal awards Paul's contemporaries pursued".[8] It is therefore given to those individuals who demonstrate "self-denial and perseverance".[8]
