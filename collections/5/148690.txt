If a continuous-time real-valued stochastic process meets certain moment conditions on its increments, then the Kolmogorov continuity theorem says that there exists a modification of this process that has continuous sample paths with probability one, so the stochastic process has a continuous modification or version.[272][273][275] The theorem can also be generalized to random fields so the index set is     n   {\displaystyle n}  -dimensional Euclidean space[276] as well as to stochastic processes with metric spaces as their state spaces.[277]
