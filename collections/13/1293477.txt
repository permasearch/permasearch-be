Fishers have five toes on each foot, with unsheathed, retractable claws.[2] Their feet are large, making it easier for them to move on top of snow packs. In addition to the toes, four central pads are on each foot. On the hind paws are coarse hairs that grow between the pads and the toes, giving them added traction when walking on slippery surfaces.[14] Fishers have highly mobile ankle joints that can rotate their hind paws almost 180Â°, allowing them to maneuver well in trees and climb down head-first.[15][16] The fisher is one of relatively few mammalian species with the ability to descend trees head-first.[17]
