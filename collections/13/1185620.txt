In the 1970s, Stanphill's ministry included a 30-minute weekly television program originally produced in 1973 by The Christian Broadcasting Network at its KXTX-Channel 33 Dallas TV studio and later called "Young at Heart" produced by WCPX / WCFC in Chicago.[12]   In the 1990s, he appeared on several Southern gospel music videos produced by Bill Gaither. Those episodes (and others) included some of Stanphill's songs.[2]
