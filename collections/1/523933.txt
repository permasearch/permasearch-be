When the 501 was introduced in 1951, its cost of approximately DM15,000 was about four times the average German's earnings.[48] It was also much heavier than expected and underpowered with a development of BMW's pre-war twoÂ litre six.[48][49] Delays in receiving and setting up equipment caused production of the 501 to be delayed until late 1952,[48][50] with body construction, originally expected to be done in-house, being done by Karosserie Baur in Stuttgart for more than a year.[50]
