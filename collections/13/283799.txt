Most mammals are viviparous, giving birth to live young. However, the five species of monotreme, the platypus and the four species of echidna, lay eggs. The monotremes have a sex determination system different from that of most other mammals.[110] In particular, the sex chromosomes of a platypus are more like those of a chicken than those of a therian mammal.[111]
