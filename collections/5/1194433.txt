On August 15, 1998, Apple introduced a new all-in-one computer reminiscent of the Macintosh 128K: the iMac. The iMac design team was led by Ive, who would later design the iPod and the iPhone.[73][74] The iMac featured modern technology and a unique design, and sold almost 800,000 units in its first five months.[75]
