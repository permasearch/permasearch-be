Stallone is an outspoken supporter of the Republican Party.[83] In 1994, Stallone contributed $1,000 to the campaign of then-Congressman Rick Santorum, who was then running for the United States Senate in Pennsylvania.[84] In 2008, Stallone endorsed John McCain for that year's presidential election. In the 2016 election he described Donald Trump as a "Dickensian character" and "larger than life," but did not endorse him or any candidate in that year's Republican primary.[83] In December, he declined an offer to become Chair of the National Endowment for the Arts, citing a desire to work on issues related to veterans.[85] Despite his otherwise Republican views, he is an advocate for gun control and has been described as "the most anti-gun person working in Hollywood today".[86]
