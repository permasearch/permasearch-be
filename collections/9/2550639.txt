In the reboot, his appearance is similar to his Ben 10,000 incarnation, but his gloves now cover his hands. As of the episode "Mayhem in Mascot", Four Arms can transform into Omni-Enhanced Four Arms, with Shock Rock's helmet and armor covering his upper chest and shoulders. He has four blue hands, one pair of which replaces his upper arms, giving him six arms in total.
