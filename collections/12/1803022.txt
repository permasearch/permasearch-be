In 2015 the festival moved 20.54 miles to the Strathallan Castle Estate in the neighbouring county of Perthshire.[13] The 2016 event was marred by the deaths of three festival-goers and reports of anti-social behaviour problems at the campsite. This led festival bosses to cancel the 2017 event, making the festival's future uncertain.[14]
