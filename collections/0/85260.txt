The House of Lords scrutinises bills that have been approved by the House of Commons.[9] It regularly reviews and amends Bills from the Commons.[10] While it is unable to prevent Bills passing into law, except in certain limited circumstances,[11] it can delay Bills and force the Commons to reconsider their decisions.[12] In this capacity, the House of Lords acts as a check on the House of Commons that is independent from the electoral process.[13][14][15] Bills can be introduced into either the House of Lords or the House of Commons. While members of the Lords may also take on roles as government ministers, high-ranking officials such as cabinet ministers are usually drawn from the Commons. The House of Lords has its own support services, separate from the Commons, including the House of Lords Library.
