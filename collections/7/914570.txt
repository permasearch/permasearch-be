At her first performance in 2006 for the Williamsburg Live Songwriting Competition, Del Rey met Van Wilson, an A&R representative for 5 Points Records,[40][41] an independent label owned by David Nichtern.[41] In 2007, while a senior in college, Del Rey submitted a demo tape of acoustic tracks titled No Kung Fu to 5 Points Records,[34] who subsequently offered her a recording contract for $10,000.[34] Del Rey used the money to relocate to Manhattan Mobile Home Park, a trailer park in North Bergen, New Jersey,[8][22] and subsequently began working with producer David Kahne,[41] with whom she released a three-track EP titled Kill Kill in October 2008 as Lizzy Grant.[42] She explained that "David asked to work with me only a day after he got my demo. He is known as a producer with a lot of integrity and who had an interest in making music that wasn't just pop."[43] Her album, however, was shelved, causing her to shift her focus. Instead, she began to work in community service. "Homeless outreach, drug, and alcohol rehabilitation—that's been my life for the past five years", she told Vogue UK in 2012.[8] Her debut full-length album, titled Lana Del Ray, was released in January 2010.[44] Her father, Robert Grant, helped with the marketing of the album,[44] which was available for purchase on iTunes for a brief period before being withdrawn.
