Ketchup is one of the many products that is leachable; meaning that the water within the product migrates together as the larger molecules within the product sediment, ultimately causing water to separate out. This forms a layer of water on top of the ketchup due to the molecular instability within the product.[39] This instability is caused by interactions between hydrophobic molecules and charged molecules within the ketchup suspension.
