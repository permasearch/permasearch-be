As an example, during the combustion of wood, oxygen from the air is reduced, gaining electrons from carbon which is oxidized.[3] Although oxidation reactions are commonly associated with the formation of oxides from oxygen molecules, oxygen is not necessarily included in such reactions, as other chemical species can serve the same function.[3]
