DeVoe was the second-to-last member to join New Edition (Johnny Gill being the last) after being brought in by his uncle and the group's choreographer, Brooke Payne. In 1981, the group took second place at a talent show which caught the eye of record producer, Maurice Starr, who signed them to his Streetwise record label. New Edition went on to become the biggest-selling boy band group from the mid to late 1980s.
