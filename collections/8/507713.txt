Rosaline is used as a name for only one other Shakespearean characterâ€”the one of the main female figures in Love's Labours Lost (1598), although Rosalind is the name of the main female character in As You Like It.  Scholars have found similarities between them: both are described as beautiful, and both have a way of avoiding men's romantic advances. Rosaline in Love's Labours Lost constantly rebuffs her suitor's advances and Romeo's Rosaline remains distant and chaste in his brief descriptions of her.  These similarities have led some to wonder whether they are based on a woman Shakespeare actually knew, possibly the Dark Lady described in his sonnets, but there is no strong evidence of this connection.[12]
