As many songs written during the time spent with The Real People, "Don't Go Away" shares similarities with one of brothers Griffiths' compositions, "Feel the Pain", both in music and lyrics. Lyrics in the chorus of "Don't Go Away" are lifted verbatim from "Feel the Pain". In an interview with Mojo magazine, Chris Griffiths states: "...there’s one called “Don’t Go Away” which is very similar to a song we had called “Feel the Pain” but I dunno how much I can say about that, la, you know what I mean?"[5]
