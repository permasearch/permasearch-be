Traci joins the cast in season two. The season chronicles her co-parenting struggles with Drew, including jealously over Drew's taste in women (Traci calls them "popcorn hoes"), and a failed attempt at opening a sneaker boutique together. She briefly dates fitness model DaShaun Johnson, but the two part ways after Drew exposes his criminal past. Traci is initially friends with Shay, however the two have a falling out when Shay turns violent at one of her events, and Traci is caught in the crossfire.
