Shipbuilding became a major wartime industry, focused on merchant ships and tankers.[26] Merchant ships were often sunk until the convoy system was adopted using British and Canadian naval escorts. Convoys were slow but effective in stopping u-boat attacks.[27]  The troops were shipped over on fast passenger liners that could easily outrun submarines.[28]
