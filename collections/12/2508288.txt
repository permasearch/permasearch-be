This hornet often attacks both colonies of other Vespa species (Vespa simillima being the usual prey species) and honey bee hives to obtain the adults, pupae and larvae as food for their own larvae; sometimes they also cannibalize each other's colonies. A single scout, sometimes two or three, cautiously approaches the hive, producing pheromones to lead its nest-mates to the hive. The hornets can devastate a colony of honeybees, especially if it is the introduced western honey bee; a single hornet can kill as many as 40 bees per minute due to its large mandibles, which can quickly strike and decapitate prey. The honeybees' stings are ineffective because the hornets are five times the size and heavily armored. Only a few hornets (under 50) can exterminate a colony of tens of thousands of bees in a few hours. The hornets can fly up to 100 km (60 mi) in a single day, at speeds up to 40 km/h (25 mph)[20]
