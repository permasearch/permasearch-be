Britain's school system, despite efforts to address issues of discrimination,[50] has often been accused of racism through undermining the self-confidence of all Black children and maligning the culture of their parents.[51] Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, a disproportionate number of Caribbean migrant children were classified as "educationally subnormal" and placed in special schools and units.[52] By the end of the 1980s, the chances of white school leavers finding employment were four times better than those of Black pupils. In 2000â€“01, Black pupils were three times more likely than white pupils and ten times more likely than Indian pupils to be officially excluded from school for disciplinary reasons. These chronic problems have contributed to the group being disproportionately at the lower end of the socio-economic spectrum and thus have continued to face challenging social problems into the 21st century.[53]
