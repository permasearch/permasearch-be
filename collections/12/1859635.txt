To the west of the Gap of Rohan lived the Dunlendings, a native people who had been largely hostile towards the DÃºnedain and their Allies for a long time (although they tolerated the exiled Dwarves of Durin's Folk in Dunland).  The Dunlending Lord Wulf led a victorious Army of Dunlendings and briefly usurped the throne of Rohan during the long winter, avenging the murder of his father Freca by Helm Hammerhand.
