Porphyria is a group of diseases in which substances called porphyrins build up, negatively affecting the skin or nervous system.[1] The types that affect the nervous system are also known as acute porphyria, as symptoms are rapid in onset and last a short time.[1] Symptoms of an attack include abdominal pain, chest pain, vomiting, confusion, constipation, fever, high blood pressure, and high heart rate.[1][2][4] The attacks usually last for days to weeks.[2] Complications may include paralysis, low blood sodium levels, and seizures.[4] Attacks may be triggered by alcohol, smoking, hormonal changes, fasting, stress, or certain medications.[2][4] If the skin is affected, blisters or itching may occur with sunlight exposure.[2]
