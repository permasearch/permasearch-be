The Kingdom of Romania had joined the Allied Powers in World War I and had received Transylvania from Austriaâ€“Hungary. After Germany and Italy awarded parts of Transylvania back to Hungary and Southern Dobruja back to Bulgaria and after the Soviet Union had taken Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, the Fascist Iron Guard party came to power and Romania joined the Tripartite Pact on November 23, 1940.  This was due to the Romanian desire for protection against the Soviet Union.
