Taking over from the winner of the show, Pop Idol, runner up Gareth Gates scored a No. 1 with his debut single, "Unchained Melody". Incredibly he spent one further week at the summit than Will Young did, becoming the second single of the year to have a four-week run at #1. However, the single itself sold less than Will Young's, selling only 1.3 million copies, but nonetheless it became the 77th million selling single in the UK and the last one until 2004. Overall, it is the 37th biggest selling single in the UK. The more incredible thing about this song is that it is the fourth single to reach the summit 4 times by different artists. First was Jimmy Young in 1955, then a re-issue of The Righteous Brothers in 1990, then the acting duo Robson & Jerome took it the top in 1995 and finally Gareth Gates in 2002. Robson & Jerome's version remains the biggest selling to date.
