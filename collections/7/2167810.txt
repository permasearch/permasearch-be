The VTi 1.5Â L engine and body remained the same with the addition of a sports collapsible antenna mounting on the rear roof. The CVT paddle shift system was altered for easier use. The paddle system is down gears on the left and up gears on the right. The previous model had a shifter for both up down at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions.
