The 2006 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Roger D. Kornberg for creating detailed molecular images of RNA polymerase during various stages of the transcription process.[1] In most prokaryotes, a single RNA polymerase species transcribes all types of RNA. RNA polymerase from E. coli consists of five different subunit types. The beta (β) subunit has a molecular weight of 150,000, beta prime (β′) 160,000, alpha (α) 40,000, and sigma (σ) 70,000. The σ subunit can dissociate from the rest of the complex, leaving the core enzyme. The complete enzyme with σ is termed the RNA polymerase holoenzyme and is necessary for correct initiation of transcription, whereas the core enzyme can continue transcription after initiation.[2]
