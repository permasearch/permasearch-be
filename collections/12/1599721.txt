Jack Berger (Ron Livingston) is Carrie's intellectual counterpart, a sardonic humorist writer. Hailing from Downer's Grove, Carrie first meets him when he walks into a meeting between her and her publisher. Theirs is a relationship of witty banter and common thoughts, and honesty.[citation needed] Berger's advice to Miranda when she questions the lack of a phone call after a first date, "He's just not that into you," became a pop culture catchphrase. Berger's and Carrie's relationship is then strained by their career issues; a book deal of his falls through just as her columns are being published as such. He memorably breaks up with her on a Post-It: "I'm sorry, I can't, don't hate me."
