The Beluga sturgeon can take up to 20 years to reach maturity. The fish harvested for caviar are often nearly 900 kg (2,000 lb). The eggs themselves are the largest of the commonly used roes, and range in color from dark gray (almost black) to light gray, with the lighter colors coming from older fish, and being the most valued. A pearly white variety, called Almas (Persian for diamond), taken from a centennial female sturgeon,[citation needed] is the rarest type of Beluga available, with an extremely small production and prices reaching almost £25,000 ($35,300) per kilogram.[8]
