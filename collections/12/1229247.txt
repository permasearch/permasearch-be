After the collapse of public enterprises during the late 1980s, privatisation became strongly popular.[121] Menem privatised almost everything the state owned, except for a couple of banks.[86] In terms of service there were indisputable improvements. For example, before the telephone privatisation, to get a new line it was not unusual to wait more than ten years, and apartments with telephone lines carried a big premium in the market. After privatisation the wait was reduced to less than a week.[121] Productivity increased as investment modernised farms, factories and ports.[86] However, in all cases, there were large outlays of employees.[121] In addition, the process of privatisation was suspected of corruption in many cases.[121] Ultimately, the privatised enterprises became private (rather than public) monopolies.[86] Their tariffs on long-term contracts were raised in line with American inflation, even though prices in Argentina were falling.[86]
