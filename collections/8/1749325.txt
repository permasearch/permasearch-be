Where the terms of the contract are ambiguous or susceptible to more than one meaning, evidence of surrounding circumstances and context may be admissible to assist in its interpretation.[95] The High Court has recently reiterated the Codelfa ruling regarding the use of existence evidence in the interpretation of contacts.[117]  For example, this would commonly invite one to examine the commercial purpose of the transaction, its background and context, common practices etc.[118][119][120]  Moreover, courts tend to favour an interpretation that produces a reasonable commercially accepted result and avoids unjust or inconvenient consequences to both parties.[121] It is also important to note that the subjective intention of the parties is irrelevant. The construction of contractual documents is determined by what a reasonable person in the position of the party would have understood the words to mean.[117][122] With regard to a recent judgment made by the High Court in Western Export Services Inc v Jireh International Pty Ltd, Justices Gummow, Heydon and Bell agree the position of the Australian courts: where a court is not justified in disregarding unambiguous language simply because the contract would have a more commercial and businesslike operation if an interpretation different to that dictated by the language were adopted.[123] This High Court decision defends the original NSW Court of Appeal judgment and ultimately upholds the rule observed in Codelfa[95] and Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust v South Sydney City Council.[118]
