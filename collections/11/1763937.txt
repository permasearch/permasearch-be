The foreign relations of Mexico are directed by the President of Mexico[130] and managed through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.[131] The principles of the foreign policy are constitutionally recognized in the Article 89, Section 10, which include: respect for international law and legal equality of states, their sovereignty and independence, non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other countries, peaceful resolution of conflicts, and promotion of collective security through active participation in international organizations.[130] Since the 1930s, the Estrada Doctrine has served as a crucial complement to these principles.[132]
