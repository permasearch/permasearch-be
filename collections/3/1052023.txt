The third classification was the mountains classification. Points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit of the most difficult climbs first. The climbs were categorized, in order of increasing difficulty, as fourth-, third-, second-, and first-category and hors catÃ©gorie.[83] Double points were awarded on the summit finish of the Col d'Izoard on stage 18.[83] The leader wore a white jersey with red polka dots.[86]
