In late 2014, Winslet appeared alongside Matthias Schoenaerts in Alan Rickman's period drama A Little Chaos about rival landscape gardeners commissioned by Louis XIV to create a fountain at Versailles.[115] Despite receiving little praise from critics, Winslet's performance of assistant designer Sabine de Barra earned positive reviews. The Guardian noted that "Winslet manages emotional honesty within anachronistic confines"[116] and Vanity Fair said, "She glows with ambition and ache, playing a woman with a tragic past seeking refuge in the meticulousness and inventiveness of her work".[117] The same year, she also narrated Roald Dahl's children's novel Matilda, for which AudioFile in its review said, "She (Winslet) saves her panache for her characterizations. While Winsletâ€™s Matilda is modestly soft-spoken, she scales her vocal register as the ranting Wormwood parents, booms as Miss Trunchbull, and breathily voices the adored Miss Honey".[118] She won the Odyssey Award for her performance.[119]
