Because folktales, myths, and legends are, in essence, reported speech, it follows that the hearsay marker would be used with them. Many of these types of stories are passed down through generations, furthering this aspect of reported speech. A difference between simple hearsay and folktales can be seen in the frequency of the â€“sh(i) marker. In normal conversation using reported speech, the marker is used less, to avoid redundancy.
