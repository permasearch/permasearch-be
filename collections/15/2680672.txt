Alec starts to drink to soothe his sorrows, and burns all of Maire's possessions because "she's gone". When Tom치s finds out, he tries to stop Alec, blaming him for Maire's death, and runs away to Katie's. She explains how sad Alec is about losing Maire. The next day, Tom치s goes to feed Smudge, asking it to pass on a message to Maire, asking her 'what he should to do'. A rainbow appears, the 'end' of it bathing Tom치s and Smudge in colours, and Tom치s has 'received' the guidance he was looking for.
