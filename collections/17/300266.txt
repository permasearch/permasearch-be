One of the earliest motorised vehicles was the charabanc, which was used for short journeys and excursions until the early years of the 20th century.[citation needed] The first "motor coaches" were purchased by operators of those horse-drawn vehicles in the early 20th century[3] by operators such as Royal Blue Coach Services, who purchased their first charabanc in 1913[4] and were running 72 coaches by 1926.[5]
