TCS established the first software research center in India, the Tata Research Development and Design Centre, in Pune, India in 1981. TRDDC undertakes research in Software engineering, Process engineering and systems research. Researchers at TRDDC also developed MasterCraft (now a suite of digitization and optimization tools)[87] a Model Driven Development software that can automatically create code based on a model of a software, and rewrite the code based on the user's needs.[88] Research at TRDDC has also resulted in the development of Sujal, a low-cost water purifier that can be manufactured using locally available resources. TCS deployed thousands of these filters in the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster of 2004 as part of its relief activities.[89] This product has been marketed in India as Tata swach, a low cost water purifier.[90]
