In 1994, Jason Taylor was a homeschool football player in Pennsylvania who engaged a legal battle against the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA, the leading oversight association governing U.S. collegiate athletics) and its classification of homeschool athletes as essentially high school dropouts. Taylor's legal victory has provided a precedent for thousands of other homeschool athletes to compete in colleges and attain the same opportunities in education and professional development that other athletes enjoy.[citation needed] Other homeschool students who have risen to the top of collegiate competition include NCAA 2005 champion tennis player, Chris Lam, Kevin Johnson of the University of Tulsa basketball team, 2010-2011 Big South Player of the Year Jesse Sanders of the Liberty University Flames and the 2007 Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow from the University of Florida .[citation needed] In 2012, another homeschool student was a Heisman Trophy finalist: Collin Klein of Kansas State University.[citation needed]
