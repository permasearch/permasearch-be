The first likely description of the disease was in 1841 by Charles Oscar Waters.[7] The condition was described in further detail in 1872 by the physician George Huntington, after whom it is named.[7] The genetic basis was discovered in 1993 by an international collaborative effort led by the Hereditary Disease Foundation.[8][9] Research and support organizations began forming in the late 1960s to increase public awareness, to provide support for individuals and their families, and to promote research.[9][10] Current research directions include determining the exact mechanism of the disease, improving animal models to aid with research, testing of medications to treat symptoms or slow the progression of the disease, and studying procedures such as stem cell therapy with the goal of repairing damage caused by the disease.[8]
