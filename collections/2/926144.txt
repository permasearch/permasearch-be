In 1998, Adonis "Donnie" Johnson is shown in a juvenile hall detention center fighting with other children. He is separated and taken back to his cell. Mary Anne Creed (Phylicia Rashad), Apollo's widow, meets with Adonis and adopts him; informing him that he is Apollo Creed's son (sired from an extramarital affair). In the present day, Adonis (using his biological mother's last name Johnson) is a wealthy young college graduate working at a securities firm. However, on weekends, he sneaks out to Tijuana to fight professional boxing matches against unheralded opponents, and maintains an undefeated 15-0 record. Soon Adonis quits his job to pursue his dream of becoming a boxer. Mary Anne vehemently objects, remembering how her husband was killed in the ring 30 years earlier (Rocky IV) and how he suffered after every fight before then. He finds it hard to get anyone in Los Angeles to train him due to his father's death in the ring, particularly after he suffers an embarrassing loss in a sparring match to light heavyweight contender Danny "Stuntman" Wheeler (Andre Ward). Undaunted, Adonis decides to travel to Philadelphia in hopes of seeking out his father's best friend and former rival, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone).
