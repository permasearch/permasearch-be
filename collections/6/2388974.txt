The Grand Staircase was one of the most impressive features on board the Titanic and the centre of First-Class activity. The main stairwell was located in the forward part of the ship and began on the Boat Deck, extending six flights down to E-Deck. B and D Decks contained entry foyers on either side where First-Class passengers would embark and disembark, the D-Deck entryway leading directly into the Reception Room. Each level was constructed in solid English oak with sweeping curves and the surrounding spaces panelled in the sleek neoclassical William and Mary style. The balustrades displayed distinctive wrought iron grilles with ormolu swags in the style of Louis XIV.[99] The A-Deck level was undoubtedly the most spectacular and is the most recognisable due to its frequent depiction in film.
