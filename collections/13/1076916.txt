In Europe, airbags were almost unheard of until the early 1990s. By 1991, four manufacturers – BMW, Honda, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo – offered the air bag on some of their higher-end models, but shortly afterwards, airbags became a common feature on more mainstream cars, with Ford and Vauxhall/Opel being among the manufacturers to introduce the air bag to its model ranges in 1992. The likes of Citroen, Fiat, Nissan, Peugeot, Renault and Volkswagen followed shortly afterwards.
