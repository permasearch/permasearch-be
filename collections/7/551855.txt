The manga has been generally well received in Japan, with the compilations appearing as topsellers multiple times.[23][24][25] It also has one million copies in print as of January 2017.[26] The manga's first volume has also sold well in North America.[27] Rebecca Silverman from Anime News Network admitted Boruto appealed to her despite having never gotten into the Naruto manga. She praised how the writers managed to deal with the protagonist's angst without coming across as "teen whining" as well as how Sasuke Uchiha decides to train him. Amy McNulty found it appealing to fans of the original Naruto series, stating that while Mitsuki does not have a large role in the story, the sidestory helps to expand his origins. Nik Freeman, another writer from the same site, criticized Boruto's lack of development when comparing him with his first introduction in the Naruto's finale and there were multiple differences as to why both the young Naruto and Boruto vandalized their city. Nevertheless, Freeman also liked Mitsuki's backstory as he did not feel it rehashed stories from the past.[28] Reviewing, the first chapter online, Chris Beveridge from the Fandom Post was more negative, complaining more about the large focus between Naruto and Boruto's poor relationship, the rehash elements of Boruto: Naruto the Movie and criticized the adaptation of Kishimoto's artwork. Nevertheless, she praised the relationship between Naruto and Sasuke as well as the foreshadowing of an older Boruto fight.[29] Melina Dargis from the same site reviewed the first volume, commenting she was looking forward to the development of the characters despite having already watched the Boruto movie and was also pleased by seeing Mitsuki's role in his own sidestory.[30] Leroy Douresseaux from Comic Book Bin recommended it to Naruto fans, explaining how the new authors managed to use the first volume to establish the protagonists' personalities.[31]
