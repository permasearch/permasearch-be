The first British Grand Prix dates back to 1927, however it was not until 1948 when the trophy was first awarded. Stirling Moss was the first Briton to win the British Grand Prix Cup and to also receive the RAC Motor Sports Members' badge. Since then twelve British drivers have won the British Grand Prix.
