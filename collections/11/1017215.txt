"Don't" was planned to be released as the first single from the album until March 2014, when "Sing" was chosen.[19] Billboard speculated that the provocative, "Don't fuck with my love", chorus prompted the change.[3] Sheeran debuted a snippet of the song in a commercial for Beats by Dr. Dre in May 2014.[19]
