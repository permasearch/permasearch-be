On January 22, 2010, Hicks Sports Group officially reached a formal agreement to sell the Texas Rangers to the group headed by Greenberg and Ryan (later called Rangers Baseball Express) for approximately $570 million.[22] Under the provisions of the deal, former owner Hicks stayed on as a limited minority partner, but was not allowed to retain a seat on the board of governors. Co-lead investors Dallas businessmen Ray Davis and Bob R. Simpson were named co-chairmen.[22] Hicks also sold much of the land surrounding Rangers Ballpark to Rangers Baseball Express in a separate deal.
