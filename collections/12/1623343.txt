The merit system is criticized that it leads to uncooperative behaviors between employees creating conflict that produces low work ethics. Merit system is based on performance compensation that encourages competition among employees, creating a competitive environment that puts employees at odds with one another. This can lead to unwanted behaviors of conduct that can affect the productivity of the work place. Disrupting team unity to look better on reviews and personal goals become more important than team goals.[8]
