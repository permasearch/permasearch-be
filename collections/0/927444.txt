In 1999, before control was passed to TfL, London Underground was split up so that a publicâ€“private partnership (PPP) arrangement could be put in place, with London Underground remaining a public company running the trains while private companies were responsible for upgrading the railway. Three packages of 30-year franchises were drawn up, covering the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines (JNP), the Bakerloo, Central Victoria and Waterloo and City lines (BCV) and the sub-surface lines, the Metropolitan, District, Circle, East London and Hammersmith & City lines (SSL).[127] In 2003 the BCV and SSL contracts were won by Metronet (a consortium of Balfour Beatty, WS Atkins, Bombardier, EDF Energy and Thames Water), while JNP was won by Tube Lines;[128] these were known as the "infracos" (infrastructure companies). In 2000 overall control of the system passed to TfL, which had been opposed to the arrangement.[129][130] Metronet went into administration in 2007, and TfL took over responsibilities, and TfL also took over Tube Lines in 2010.[128]
