The following season City failed to capitalise on the gains made in the first two full seasons of Mancini's reign. While City rarely seemed likely to drop below second in the table, they posed little title challenge all season. In the Champions League, the club was eliminated at the group stage for a second successive season, while a second FA Cup final in three seasons ended in a 1â€“0 defeat to relegated Wigan Athletic.[39] Mancini was dismissed two days later, ostensibly as he had failed to reach his targets for the season,[40] but BBC Sports Editor David Bond reported he had been sacked for his poor communication and relationships with players and executives.[41] In his place was appointed the Chilean Manuel Pellegrini.[42] In Pellegrini's first season, City won the League Cup[43] and regained the Premier League title on the last day of the season.[44]
