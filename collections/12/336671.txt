The original network version of the U.S. Millionaire and the subsequent primetime specials were hosted by Regis Philbin.[27] When the syndicated version was being developed, the production team felt that it was not feasible for Philbin to continue hosting, as the show recorded four episodes in a single day, and that the team was looking for qualities in a new host: it had to be somebody who would love the contestants and be willing to root for them.[1] Rosie O'Donnell was initially offered a hosting position on this new edition, but declined the opportunity almost immediately.[28] Eventually Meredith Vieira, who had previously competed in a celebrity charity event on the original network version, was named host of the new syndicated edition.[29]
