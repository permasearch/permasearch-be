Nicholson first came to Hollywood in 1954, when he was 17, to visit his sister (i.e. his biological mother). He took a job as an office worker for animators William Hanna and Joseph Barbera at the MGM cartoon studio. They offered him a starting-level job as an animator, but he declined, citing his desire to become an actor.[16]
