Retroactive interference (RI) is a phenomenon that occurs when newly learned information interferes with and impedes the recall of previously learned information.[20] RI is a result of decreased recall of the primary studied functions due to the learning and recall of succeeding functions.[21] RI is a classic paradigm that was first officially termed by Muller.[22] These memory research pioneers demonstrated that filling the retention interval (defined as the amount of time that occurs between the initial learning stage and the memory recall stage) with tasks and material caused significant interference effects with the primary learned items.
