Piku Banerjee (Deepika Padukone) is a Bengali architect residing in Delhi, with her 70-year-old father, Bhashkor (Amitabh Bachchan). Bhashkor has problems with chronic constipation and traces every problem to his bowel movements. His habits often lead to quarrels with the servants and irritates Chhobi Mashi (Moushumi Chatterjee), who often visits them. Piku loves her father and, as her mother has died, takes good care of him but gets extremely irritated with him at times because of his eccentricities. Her colleague, Syed Afroz (Jisshu Sengupta) is a good friend, and she is a regular client of Syed's friend, Rana Chaudhary's (Irrfan Khan) taxi business. Rana has his own family problems with his mother and sister.
