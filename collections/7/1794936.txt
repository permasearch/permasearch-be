On eviction night, all HouseGuests except for the Head of Household and the two nominees vote to evict one of the two nominees.[13] This compulsory vote was conducted in the privacy of the Diary Room by the host Julie Chen. In the event of a tie, the Head of Household cast the deciding vote, announcing it in front of the other HouseGuests.[14] Unlike other versions of Big Brother, the HouseGuests may discuss the nomination and eviction process openly and freely.[13] The nominee with the greater number of votes will be evicted from the House on the live Thursday broadcast, exiting to an adjacent studio to be interviewed by Chen.[14] HouseGuests may voluntarily leave the House at any time and those who break the rules may be expelled from the house by Big Brother.[15][16] The final seven HouseGuests evicted during the season will vote for the winner on the season finale. These "Jury Members" will be sequestered in a separate house and will not be allowed to watch the show except for competitions and ceremonies that include all of the remaining HouseGuests. The jury members will not be shown any Diary Room interviews or any footage that may include strategy or details regarding nominations.[17] This season was the first to have two double eviction nights. It was also the first to have two vetos at one veto ceremony.
