BMS continued to grow and by April 1997, it was the largest sports arena in Tennessee and one of the largest in the country, seating 118,000. The speedway also boasted 22 new skyboxes. For the 1998 Goody's 500, the speedway featured more than 131,000 grandstand seats and 100 skyboxes. Improvements to the speedway since Smith took possession are in excess of $50Â million. Under Smith's ownership, all seating sections have been renamed for past race winners and NASCAR champions.
