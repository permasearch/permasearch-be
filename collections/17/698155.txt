The A.V. Club wrote "The musical's oft-repeated question, 'Who lives, Who dies, Who tells your story?' is answered not with a self-congratulatory pat on the back about the Hamilton's importance but with a salute to a woman whose face can't be found on any currency. It's a breathtaking and unexpected finale—the equivalent of ending Steve Jobs with a five-minute monologue from Kate Winslet's character, Joanna Hoffman, about her own achievements."[10] The New Yorker notes "The last verse—unexpectedly, and powerfully—belongs to Eliza".[11] CentreOnTheAisle said that "Act two, while engaging, doesn't reach the heights of its predecessor, until the show's plaintive 'Finale' in a hauntingly beautiful performance" by Eliza Hamilton.[12]
