There is an unofficial (but previous National Champion) croquet team.[108] Legend has it that in the early 1980s, a Mid and a Johnnie (slang for a student enrolled at St. John's College, Annapolis), were in a bar and the Mid challenged the Johnnie by stating that Midshipmen could beat St. John's at any sport. The St. John's student selected croquet. Since then, thousands attend the annual croquet match between St. John's and the 28th Company[109] of the Brigade of Midshipmen (originally the 34th Company before the Brigade was reduced to 30 companies).[110] As of 2017, the Midshipmen had a record of 7 wins and 28 losses to the St John's team.[111]
