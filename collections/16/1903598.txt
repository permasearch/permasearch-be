Krypton compounds with other than Kr-F bonds (compounds with atoms other than fluorine) have also been described. KrF 2 reacts with B(OTeF 5) 3 to produces the unstable compound, Kr(OTeF 5) 2, with a krypton-oxygen bond. A krypton-nitrogen bond is found in the cation [HC≡N–Kr–F]+, produced by the reaction of KrF 2 with [HC≡NH]+[AsF− 6] below −50 °C.[15]
