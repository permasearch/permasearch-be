When WTBS became WPCH-TV, Canadian television providers were only permitted to continue carrying the Atlanta station, and not the TBS pay-TV channel. The national TBS subscription feed, which had been created as a separate national feed in 1981, later to be split off from WTBS in the 1990s and which for a time was carried in place of that station by some Canadian television providers, was technically a separate channel and had never been formally approved by the CRTC as an eligible-for-carriage foreign channel that could be carried as a substitute for the over-the-air Atlanta station.[77] Indeed, in informing the CRTC of WTBS' change of call sign and branding, Turner Broadcasting apparently did not make any request to have the TBS cable channel approved in its place.[78]
