Daisy Irene Adams (née Woodward; 30 June 1880 – 8 December 1993) was for about nine months the oldest person in the UK, between 17 March 1993 and her death on 8 December 1993. She was from Church Gresley, Derbyshire. She died at the age of 113 years and 161 days, and outlived her husband and three of her five children. Her husband died at the first day of the Battle of the Somme, meaning that she was widowed in her thirties. Adams was a teetotaler and ate little. Her son Ted put her longevity down to "living a quiet life".[25]
