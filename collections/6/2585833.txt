Dasa also means "slave, servant" in Rig Vedic passages. In VIII.56.3, a man named Dasyave Ṿrka ('Wolf to the Dasyu") gives the poet "a hundred donkeys", "a hundred wooly ewes, a hundred slaves (dāsá) and garlands beyond that."[23] In Mandala 7, example of the master-servant relationship exists. In the Varuna Suktas, god is always shown as very great and a devotee very small.[24]
