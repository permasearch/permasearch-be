All Housing Benefit decisions of a Local Authority are subject to appeal through the Tribunals service. There is no direct right of appeal against the LHA rate awarded to an individual tenant, or the local rent level specified by the rent officer for the Broad Rental Market Areas. However, their decisions are open to Judicial Review and they have already been subject to challenge.
