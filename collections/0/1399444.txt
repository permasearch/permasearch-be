Bardeen received his Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering in 1928 from the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison.[10] He graduated in 1928 despite taking a year off during his degree to work in Chicago.[11] He had taken all the graduate courses in physics and mathematics that had interested him, and, in fact, graduated in five years, one more than usual; this allowed him time to also complete a Master's thesis, supervised by Leo J. Peters. He received his Master of Science degree in electrical engineering in 1929 from Wisconsin.[4][10]
