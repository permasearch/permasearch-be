On 4 February 2008, Hamilton was verbally heckled and otherwise abused during pre-season testing at the Circuit de Catalunya in Catalonia by several Spanish spectators who wore black face paint and black wigs, as well as shirts bearing the words "Hamilton's familly [sic]".[108] Hamilton became widely unpopular in Spain because of his rivalry with Spanish former teammate Fernando Alonso. The FIA have warned Spanish authorities about the repetition of such behaviour.[109] In reaction to this behaviour, the FIA announced on 13 February 2008 that it will launch a "Race Against Racism" campaign.[110]
