American Cocker Spaniels in UK and USA/Canada surveys had a median lifespan of about 10 to 11 years,[30] which is on the low end of the typical range for purebred dogs, and one to two years less than other breeds of their size.[31] The larger English Cocker Spaniel typically lives about a year longer than the American Cocker Spaniel.[30] In a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey, the most common causes of death were cancer (23%), old age (20%), cardiac (8%), and immune-mediated (8%).[32] In a 2003 USA/Canada Health Survey with a smaller sample size, the leading causes of death were cancer, hepatic disease, and immune-mediated.[33]
