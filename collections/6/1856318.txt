Drop City, a counterculture artists' community, was formed in 1965 on land about 4 mi (6 km) north of Trinidad. Founded by art students and filmmakers from the University of Kansas and University of Colorado at Boulder, Drop City became known as the first rural "hippie commune",[25] and received national attention from Life and Time, as well as from reporters around the world.[26] Drop City was abandoned by the early 1970s, but influenced subsequent alternative-living projects across the country.
