After The Brady Bunch, McCormick made guest appearances on many television series such as Happy Days, Donny & Marie, Love Boat, Vega$, Streets of San Francisco, and Fantasy Island, along with supporting roles in The Idolmaker and B movies such as A Vacation in Hell (1979), Skatetown, U.S.A. (1979) and Return to Horror High (1987). McCormick later claimed she failed to get a role as a prostitute or heroin dealer for the movie Midnight Express because she continued to be identified with her Brady Bunch role.[7] McCormick was the first actress to play Rebecca Crane on the soap opera Passions, but she was not put on contract. She also performed in several musical stage productions during the 1980s and 1990s, portraying such characters as Wendy Darling in Peter Pan and Betty Rizzo in Grease.[8] In 1997, she portrayed country singer Barbara Mandrell in the television biopic Get to the Heart: The Barbara Mandrell Story. In 2003 she appeared as herself on an episode of the sitcom Scrubs with references being made to her Marcia Brady character.
