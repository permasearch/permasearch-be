the q-th root of bp. Finally, any irrational number (a real number which is not rational) y can be approximated to arbitrary precision by rational numbers. This can be used to compute the y-th power of b: for example       2   ≈ 1.414...   {\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}\approx 1.414...}   and      b   2      {\displaystyle b^{\sqrt {2}}}   is increasingly well approximated by      b  1   ,  b  1.4   ,  b  1.41   ,  b  1.414   , . . .   {\displaystyle b^{1},b^{1.4},b^{1.41},b^{1.414},...}  . A more detailed explanation, as well as the formula bm + n = bm · bn is contained in the article on exponentiation.
