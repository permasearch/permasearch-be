The 1998 Vikings team is historically known for its offense, which featured veteran quarterback Randall Cunningham, Hall of Fame wide receiver Cris Carter, and rookie wide receiver Randy Moss. The team scored 556 points during the season, which was an NFL record at the time, and Moss set an NFL record by catching 17 touchdown passes, the most ever by a rookie. On special teams, Gary Anderson became the first placekicker in NFL history to convert every field goal and extra point that he attempted. The Vikings defense ranked sixth in the league in points allowed and was led by Hall of Fame defensive tackle John Randle.
