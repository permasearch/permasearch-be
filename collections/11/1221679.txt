Agent Carter, released on the Iron Man 3 Blu-ray release on September 24, 2013, as well as part of the digital download release on September 3, 2013,[17] was seen as a good way of bridging that film with the then upcoming Captain America: The Winter Soldier. It had previously been considered to be released on other home media releases as well.[5] It sees Hayley Atwell reprise her role as Peggy Carter,[17] along with Dominic Cooper, Neal McDonough, and Chris Evans reprising their roles as Howard Stark, Timothy "Dum Dum" Dugan, and Steve Rogers / Captain America, respectively, the latter via archive footage. The short film introduces Bradley Whitford as Agent John Flynn and Shane Black as the Disembodied Voice.[18][19] It was directed by Louis Dâ€™Esposito and written by Eric Pearson.[10] The short was filmed over five days,[16] and reused visual effects shots of 1940s New York from Captain America: The First Avenger to save money.[5] Christopher Lennertz collaborated with D'Esposito again on the short, composing music for it. He also composes the music for the MCU television series Marvel's Agent Carter, which is directly related to the short.[15][7]
