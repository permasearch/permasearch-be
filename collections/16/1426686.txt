McGovern intended to sharply reduce defense spending[187] and supported amnesty for draft evaders as well as abortion rights. With some of his supporters believed to be in favor of drug legalization, McGovern was perceived as standing for "amnesty, abortion and acid".[186] Nixon dismissed the Democratic platform as cowardly and divisive.[188] He was further damaged by the widespread perception that he mismanaged his campaign, chiefly due to the incident with Eagleton.[189] McGovern claimed that the "Nixon Administration is the most corrupt administration in our national history," but his attacks had little effect.[190] Nixon, meanwhile, appealed to many working class Democrats who were repelled by the Democratic Party's positions on racial and cultural issues.[191] Despite new limits on campaign fundraising imposed by the Federal Election Campaign Act, Nixon vastly outraised McGovern, and his campaign dominated radio and television advertising.[192]
