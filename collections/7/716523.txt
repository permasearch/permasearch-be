Amnesty International accused Indian security forces were using "arbitrary and excessive force" to deal with the protests in Kashmir. It also stated that their actions were a violation of international standards and were leading to a worsening of the human rights crisis in the state. The organisation also criticised the use of pellet guns stating they had been used a 100 times in Kashmir during the first week of September 2016 even though its use was meant to be rare. It called for their ban stating they were dangerous and also expressed concern at the deployment of PAVA shells in the state as they could be used in an "arbitrary or indiscriminate manner".[359][360][361] While, following a seminar on human rights abuses in Kashmir, Amnesty International was accused of sedition in India.[362]
