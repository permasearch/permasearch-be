European Russia is the part of Russia situated in the far West of the country that is considered to be part of Europe. The other, much larger part of the country, situated to the East, is considered to be part of Asia. The specific boundaries between continents are largely a matter of geographical convention and different boundaries have been in use, however the eastern boundary of Europe is generally considered to be along the Ural Mountains, the Ural River, the Caucasus Mountains and the Turkish Straits. Europe is also a subcontinent within Eurasia in geological terms,[1] making the whole of Russia a part of the Eurasian continent.
