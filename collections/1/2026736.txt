After the crew finishes constructing an episode, the production team sends it to animators in Korea. The animation is produced by Sunmin Images Pictures Company and Rough Draft Korea. The production team and animators communicate by email and sometimes use video chat when animating a major episode. Before sending the episode to one of the studios, animation director Nick DeMayo and his team create a plan for the animators after reviewing the animatics.[64] They then add character movements on exposure sheets to guide the animators. Mouth assignments for the characters, describing mouth shapes and timing for lip-syncing, follow.[65] The episode is then sent to one of the animation studios. The black-and-white version is sent first, followed about two weeks later by the colored version[66] The animation is drawn and inked on paper, then scanned and colored digitally. The crew then arranges a "work print" meeting to discuss the episode and review it for errors. DeMayo notes any errors, removes them and sends the episode back to the animation studio or to Cartoon Network's post-production department to fix any remaining issues.[67] Minor animation mistakes or omissions are fixed by the crew.[68]
