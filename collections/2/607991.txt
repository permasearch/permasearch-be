The walls on both the northern and southern sides of the lobby house storefronts and escalators to a mezzanine level.[254][g] At the west end of the lobby is an aluminum relief of the skyscraper as it was originally built (i.e. without the antenna).[257] The relief, which was intended to provide a welcoming effect,[258] contains an embossing of the building's outline, accompanied by what the Landmarks Preservation Commission describes as "the rays of an aluminum sun shining out behind [the tower] and mingling with aluminum rays emanating from the spire of the Empire State Building". In the background is a state map of New York with the building's location marked by a "medallion" in the very southeast portion of the outline. A compass is located in the bottom right and a plaque to the tower's major developers is on the bottom left.[259]
