Robert Schomburgk's 1840 commission also included a survey of the colony's eastern boundary with the Netherlands' colony of Suriname, now the independent nation of Suriname. The 1899 arbitration award settling the British Guianaâ€”Venezuela border made reference to the border with Suriname as continuing to the source of the Courantyne River, which it named as the Kutari River. The Netherlands raised a diplomatic protest, claiming that the New River, and not the Kutari, was to be regarded as the source of the Courantyne and the boundary. The British government in 1900 replied that the issue was already settled by the long acceptance of the Kutari as the boundary.
