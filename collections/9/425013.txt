"Lonely Is the Night" was written by Albert Hammond with famous songwriter Diane Warren, while production was done by John Boylan.[2] Lyrically, the song talks about the difficulty of dealing with a long-distance relationship. In the beginning, Russell Hitchcock sings that he thought he'd live well without his girlfriend, "Really thought that I could live without you, Really thought that I could make it on my own," he sings. However, he realizes that he's lost without the one he loves, "Now I'm so lost without you, now you're not here and now I know." In the chorus, he sings about how difficult it is to spend the night away from his love. "Lonely is the night when I'm not with you, lonely is the night ain't no light shining through, till you're in my arms till you're here by my side, lonely am I."[3]
