2D graphics models may combine geometric models (also called vector graphics), digital images (also called raster graphics), text to be typeset (defined by content, font style and size, color, position, and orientation), mathematical functions and equations, and more.  These components can be modified and manipulated by two-dimensional geometric transformations such as translation, rotation, scaling. In object-oriented graphics, the image is described indirectly by an object endowed with a self-rendering methodâ€”a procedure which assigns colors to the image pixels by an arbitrary algorithm.  Complex models can be built by combining simpler objects, in the paradigms of object-oriented programming.
