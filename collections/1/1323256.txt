After an endorsement by League president and chairman of Liverpool John McKenna on account of their longer membership of the League, Arsenal won the vote by eighteen votes to Spurs' eight (Barnsley got five, Wolves four, Nottingham Forest three, Birmingham two and Hull City one) and were thus elected to the First Division.[14] It has been frequently alleged that Arsenal chairman Sir Henry Norris used underhand dealings in order to bring this about, although nothing has been proven.[15] The decision infuriated Tottenham and their supporters, although eleven years previously albeit under different circumstances and involved entirely separate leagues that do not have automatic right to move between them, Tottenham themselves had been elected to join the Football League Second Division despite only finishing 7th in the 1907â€“08 Southern League.[16] Tottenham were initially unsuccessful in their attempt to join the Football League, but at the last minute Stoke resigned from the league for financial reason, and Tottenham reapplied to replace Stoke, and narrowly won election to the Second Division over Lincoln, Rotherham and Southport (Tottenham won one more vote than Lincoln).[17]
