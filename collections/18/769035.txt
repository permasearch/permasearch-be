Asda originally had a "simple and fresh" store format, which under Archie Norman's team and the later mid-'90s focus on a Walmart style strategy became more emphasised. The stores had a simplistic three zone layout but built on a Walmart larger footprint format â€“ Asda's average store is almost 20% bigger than its rivals, with a range of over 30,000 different products in its largest stores.[citation needed]
