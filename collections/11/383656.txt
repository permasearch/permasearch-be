The English, led by Humphrey Gilbert, had claimed St. John's, Newfoundland, in 1583 as the first North American English colony by royal prerogative of Queen Elizabeth I.[60] In the reign of King James I, the English established additional colonies in Cupids and Ferryland, Newfoundland, and soon after established the first successful permanent settlements of Virginia to the south.[61] On September 29, 1621, a charter for the foundation of a New World Scottish colony was granted by King James to Sir William Alexander.[62] In 1622, the first settlers left Scotland. They initially failed and permanent Nova Scotian settlements were not firmly established until 1629 during the end of the Anglo-French War.[62] These colonies did not last long except the fisheries in Ferryland under Sir David Kirke.[63] In 1631, under Charles I of England, the Treaty of Suza was signed, ending the war and returning Nova Scotia to the French.[64] New France was not fully restored to French rule until the 1632 Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye.[65] This led to new French immigrants and the founding of Trois-Rivi√®res in 1634.[66]
