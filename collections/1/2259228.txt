In the Dominican Republic, moonshine is called cleren in the towns near the border with Haiti and pitrinche in the eastern towns. It is made from sugar or fermented sugar cane. Its production is illegal but the law is rarely enforced. Another form is berunte, fermented from either corn (which is the most common), rice, melon, pineapple or wheat.
