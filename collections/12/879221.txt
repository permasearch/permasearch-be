The Geordie word netty,[53] meaning a toilet and place of need and necessity for relief[53][54][55] or bathroom,[53][54][55] has an uncertain origin,[56] though some have theorised that it may come from slang used by Roman soldiers on Hadrian's Wall,[57] which may have later become gabinetti in the Romanic Italian language[57] (such as in the Westoe Netty, the subject of a famous painting from Bob Olley[57][58]). However, gabbinetto is the Modern Italian diminutive of gabbia, which actually derives from the Latin cavea ("hollow", "cavity", "enclosure"), the root of the loanwords that became the Modern English cave,[59] cage,[60] and gaol.[61] Thus, another explanation would be that it comes from a Modern Romanic Italian form of the word gabinetti,[56] though only a relatively small number of Italians have migrated to the North of England, mostly during the 19th century.[62]
