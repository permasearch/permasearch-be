While working at Henley's, Hitchcock began to dabble in creative writing. The company's in-house publication The Henley Telegraph was founded in 1919, and he often submitted short articles,[16] eventually becoming one of its most prolific contributors.[17][18] His first piece, "Gas" (1919), published in the first issue, tells of a young woman who imagines that she is being assaulted one night in Parisâ€”only for the twist to reveal that it was all just a hallucination in the dentist's chair induced by the anaesthetic.[19]
