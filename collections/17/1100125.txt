It is often reported that, when a pianist hears a well-trained piece of music, synonymous fingering can be involuntarily triggered.[23] This implies that there is a coupling between the perception of music and the motor activity of those musically trained individuals.[23] Therefore, one's muscle memory in the context of music can easily be triggered when one hears certain familiar pieces. Overall, long-term musical fine motor training allows for complex actions to be performed at a lower level of movement control, monitoring, selection, attention, and timing.[24] This leaves room for musicians to focus attention synchronously elsewhere, such as on the artistic aspect of the performance, without having to consciously control one's fine motor actions.[24]
