There is no reliable worldwide database listing all cave diving fatalities. Such fractional statistics as are available, however, suggest that very few divers have ever died while following accepted protocols and while using equipment configurations recognized as acceptable by the cave diving community.[1] In the very rare cases of exceptions to this rule there have typically been unusual circumstances.[1] Much the same can be said for other modes and applications of diving. There is little doubt that competence, good preparation and appropriate equipment reduce the risk of all hazardous activities.
