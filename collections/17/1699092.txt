The decision to condition on the margins of the table is also controversial.[17][18] The p-values derived from Fisher's test come from the distribution that conditions on the margin totals. In this sense, the test is exact only for the conditional distribution and not the original table where the margin totals may change from experiment to experiment. It is possible to obtain an exact p-value for the 2x2 table when the margins are not held fixed. Barnard's test, for example, allows for random margins. However, some authors[14][15][18] (including, later, Barnard himself)[14] have criticized Barnard's test based on this property. They argue that the marginal success total is an (almost[15]) ancillary statistic, containing (almost) no information about the tested property.
