In Texas no city has formally declared "sanctuary" status, but a few do not fully cooperate with federal immigration authorities and have drawn a negative response from the legislature.[25] Bills seeking to deprive state funding from police departments and municipalities that do not cooperate with federal authorities had been introduced into the Texas Legislature several times.[25] On February 1, 2017, Texas Governor Greg Abbott blocked funding to Travis County, Texas due to its recently-implemented de facto sanctuary city policy.[26][27] On May 7, 2017, Abbott signed a bill into law effectively banning sanctuary cities by charging county or city officials who refuse to work with federal officials and by allowing police officers to check the immigration status of those they detain if they choose.[28][29]
