Reviews have generally been very favorable. Allmusic gave the album four stars, saying that the score "manages to be appropriately dark and disturbing, as well as compulsively listenable";[12] Salon praised the "terrific musical score";[13] and The Observer of the University of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College called the score "heart-stopping".[14] Filmcritic.com, in a negative review of the score, spoke of "the driving, thumping, angry, brutal violin score which drums like a hammer and chain beating you into submission."[15]
