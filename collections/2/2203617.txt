Penny boards are distinguished by a plastic deck, offered in an array of colours. Due to their 'secret formula' the boards have its ability to survive the full weight of a car and return to its original shape. Different parts of the Penny board structure are available in a variety of colours and designs, which can be chosen by the buyer to create their own customised Penny board, based on personal preference. Penny boards are easier to carry around, compared to wooden skateboards. Penny boards can be ridden barefoot. Penny Skateboards sells t-shirts and stickers [6][7] promoting barefoot riding, and have encouraged the practice via their social media accounts, particularly during the summer.[8][9][10]
