In the 2007 NSWRL Premier League the North Sydney Bears made the Grand Final facing off against Sydney rivals Parramatta. They were beaten 20-15 by Weller Hauraki, scoring a controversial try with just 13 seconds to go, which many believed should not have been allowed due to a forward pass.[25] North Sydney finished the 2008 season as NSW Cup minor premiers and were eliminated in the finals in straight sets.
