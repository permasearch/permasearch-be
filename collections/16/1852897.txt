"He Wasn't Man Enough" received extremely positive reception from contemporary music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic highlighted the track as an album highlight, which along with "Gimme Some" was a "skimmering beat".[1] David Browne from Entertainment Weekly gave it a positive review, certificating it with a B rating. He said "From producer Rodney Jerkins' cushiony pulse to its premise (one woman warning another about her ex-beau), the amenable single "He Wasn't Man Enough" sounds mightily familiar. But it's still no "Scrubs", largely thanks to Braxton's husky, mumbly delivery."[8] NME gave it a positive review, saying that for the track, "Braxton can probably claim the best set of tonsils in soul-pop".[9] Popmatters gave it a positive review, saying "The lead single sees Toni tapping into the recent success of female assertiveness (TLC, Kelis, Destiny's Child, and Pink) with the hit single “He Wasn’t Man Enough". Produced by the ubiquitous Darkchild, the track seems to be an attempt to make some headway within the lucrative urban R&B market.[5]
