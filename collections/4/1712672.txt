Mounting evidence suggests H. pylori has an important role in protection from some diseases.[99] The incidence of acid reflux disease, Barrett's esophagus, and esophageal cancer have been rising dramatically at the same time as H. pylori's presence decreases.[100] In 1996, Martin J. Blaser advanced the hypothesis that H. pylori has a beneficial effect by regulating the acidity of the stomach contents.[51][100] The hypothesis is not universally accepted as several randomized controlled trials failed to demonstrate worsening of acid reflux disease symptoms following eradication of H. pylori.[101][102] Nevertheless, Blaser has reasserted his view that H. pylori is a member of the normal flora of the stomach.[103] He postulates that the changes in gastric physiology caused by the loss of H. pylori account for the recent increase in incidence of several diseases, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, and asthma.[103][104] His group has recently shown that H. pylori colonization is associated with a lower incidence of childhood asthma.[105]
