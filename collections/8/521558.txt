In the 2017 reboot, Webby is slightly older and smarter, with her character wearing a pink and blue sweater vest, a purple skirt, and a smaller hairbow on her right-side, while she is revealed to be an enthusiastic adventure fan and Clan McDuck historian who idolizes Donald Duck as one of the greatest adventurers of all time.[3] The nephews find her slightly intimidating upon their first meeting, but soon accept her as a close new friend.[4][5]
