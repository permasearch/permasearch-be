Because stereotypes simplify and justify social reality, they have potentially powerful effects on how people perceive and treat one another.[78] As a result, stereotypes can lead to discrimination in labor markets and other domains.[79] For example, Tilcsik (2011) has found that employers who seek job applicants with stereotypically male heterosexual traits are particularly likely to engage in discrimination against gay men, suggesting that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is partly rooted in specific stereotypes and that these stereotypes loom large in many labor markets.[14] AgerstrÃ¶m and Rooth (2011) showed that automatic obesity stereotypes captured by the Implicit Association Test can predict real hiring discrimination against the obese.[80] Similarly, experiments suggest that gender stereotypes play an important role in judgments that affect hiring decisions.[81][82]
