Marshall left all his personal papers and notes to the Library of Congress. The Librarian of Congress, James H. Billington, opened Marshall's papers for immediate use by scholars, journalists and the public, insisting that this was Marshall's intent. The Marshall family and several of his close associates disputed this claim.[29] The decision to make the documents public was supported by the American Library Association.[30] A list of the archived manuscripts is available.[31]
