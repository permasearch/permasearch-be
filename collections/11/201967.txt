In Alberta, the GDL program is first employed when an individual acquires at Class 7 Learner's License and lasts a minimum of 3 years if the individual obtains their class 7 when 15 instead of 14 and earns a class 5 non-GDL license at the age of 18. The point of the GDL program is to impose certain restrictions on new drivers and to have them earn enough road experience before becoming fully licensed.
