The UP legislature consisted of a Legislative Council of 52 elected and 6 or 8 nominated members and a Legislative Assembly of 228 elected members: some from exclusive Muslim constituencies, some from "General" constituencies, and some "Special" constituencies.[6] The Congress won a clear majority in the United Provinces, with 133 seats,[7] while the Muslim League won only 27 out of the 64 seats reserved for Muslims.[8]
