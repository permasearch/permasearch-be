The two kings find five beautiful mermaids on the beach and bring them to the castle to turn them into human princesses of the castle. Things go bad when the mermaids were actually seducing the kings to take over the castle, and they also turn Mikayla into a mermaid and cause her to talk in dolphin chirps. Meanwhile, Lanny falls in love with Amazonia, one of the mermaids, who also responds to Lanny.
