Internet service providers (ISPs) are increasingly providing their business and private customers with public facing IPv6 global unicast addresses. However, if in the local area network (LAN) IPv4 is still used, and the ISP can only provide a public facing IPv6, the IPv4 LAN addresses are translated into the public facing IPv6 address using NAT64, a network address translation (NAT) mechanism. Some ISPs cannot provide their customers with a public facing IPv4 and IPv6, thus supporting dual stack, because some ISPs have run out of IPv4 addresses that are globally routable. Meanwhile, ISP customers are still trying to reach web servers and other destinations that have an IPv4 address.[52]
