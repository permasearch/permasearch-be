Batgirl was considered one of the strongest tie-ins,[52] owing to the pre-existing relationship between Batgirl and the man who crippled her, Joker; highlighting the emotional trauma and desire for revenge that is understandable in Batgirl's character which allowed the story to serve as natural progression for Batgirl instead of a tie-in to the greater Batman story.[53][54][55][56] The art by Ed Benes and Daniel Sampere received a mixed response from reviewers who described it as fair[54] and servicable,[55] but also noted garish colors and inconsistent quality.[54] Newsarama's Aaron Duran complimented Sampere for emphasizing the personal nature of the characters, bringing the reader "uncomfortably" close, but said that the effect gradually becomes desensitizing.[57]
