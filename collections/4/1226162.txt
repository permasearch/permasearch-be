He had a platonic marriage to Chloe Morgan, who was a distant cousin of his grandmother Lila, and later was engaged to Alexis' long-lost sister Kristina Cassadine, whose death he and Alexis blamed on Sonny Corinthos. Most recently, Ned had a relationship with Skye Chandler. For a time he pretended to be the father of Alexis' daughter, Kristina Corinthos-Davis and had custody of the little girl when Alexis was on trial for the murder of Luis Alcazar and while she was sentenced to probation afterwards. Alexis did not want the Quartermaines to be involved in the girl's life, and he later decided to give up contact with her.
