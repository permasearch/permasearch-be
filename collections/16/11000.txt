In Japan, Toyota currently maintains separate dealership sales channels.[57] The first sales channel established in 1946 called "Toyota Store"[58] (トヨタ店 Toyota Mise) sells large luxury sedans such as the Toyota Century, and the Toyota Crown. In 1955, the "Toyopet Store" (トヨペット店 Toyopetto-ten) arrived, originally established to sell the Toyota Corona and the Toyopet ToyoAce truck. (Toyota's five channel dealerships in Japan chronology in Japanese.) Toyota sought out to use a hierarchical marketing approach, similar to methods used in North America, but implemented it at all of its dealership chains, with some models being exclusive to particular locations.
