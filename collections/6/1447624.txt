Unfortunately for the German plan, the British had obtained a copy of the main German codebook from the light cruiser SMSÂ Magdeburg, which had been boarded by the Russian Navy after the ship ran aground in Russian territorial waters in 1914. German naval radio communications could therefore often be quickly deciphered, and the British Admiralty usually knew about German activities.
