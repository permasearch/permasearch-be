In the US, NBC's F1 commentary team is formed by lap-by-lap announcer Leigh Diffey and analysts David Hobbs and Steve Matchett. However, they call Monaco, Canada and America on location. Hobbs and Matchett previously worked on F1 broadcasts on the defunct Fox-owned network Speed, along with former F1 lap-by-lap announcer Bob Varsha. Former GP2 commentator Will Buxton serves as pit reporter.
