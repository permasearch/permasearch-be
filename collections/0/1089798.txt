A correspondence school was established by the Knights in February 1922 to serve veterans in areas outside of cities.[75]  By the end of that year, more than 10,000 students had enrolled from every state in the union.[68]    The goal was to extend to veterans "in the smaller communities and in the rural districts of the advantages of free educational opportunities through correspondence courses."[75]  Students were permitted to take one course at a time.[76]
