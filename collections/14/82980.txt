In October 2015, ABC ordered a put pilot for a half-hour live-action comedy series Marvel's Damage Control, based on the comics construction company of the same name. The series is being developed by Ben Karlin for ABC Studios and Marvel Television, with Karlin also writing the script for the project and serving as executive producer.[290][291] In January 2016, ABC Entertainment president Paul Lee said Damage Control was "going to be coming out this season," seemingly implying it would air in the 2016â€“17 television season.[292]
