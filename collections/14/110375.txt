Haiti also suffers from severe environmental degradation. Deforestation is rampant in Haiti; today less than 4 percent of Haitiâ€™s forests remain, and in many places the soil has eroded right down to the bedrock.[163] Haitians burn wood charcoal for 60% of their domestic energy production. Because of Haiti running out of plant material to burn, Haitians have created an illegal market for coal on the Dominican side. Conservative estimates calculate the illegal movement of 115 tons of charcoal per week from the Dominican Republic to Haiti. Dominican officials estimate that at least 10 trucks per week are crossing the border loaded with charcoal.[164]
