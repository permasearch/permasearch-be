Presley, who received no formal music training and could not read music, studied and played by ear. He also frequented record stores that provided jukeboxes and listening booths to customers. He knew all of Hank Snow's songs,[34] and he loved records by other country singers such as Roy Acuff, Ernest Tubb, Ted Daffan, Jimmie Rodgers, Jimmie Davis, and Bob Wills.[35] The Southern gospel singer Jake Hess, one of his favorite performers, was a significant influence on his ballad-singing style.[36][37] He was a regular audience member at the monthly All-Night Singings downtown, where many of the white gospel groups that performed reflected the influence of African-American spiritual music.[38] He adored the music of black gospel singer Sister Rosetta Tharpe.[35] Like some of his peers, he may have attended blues venuesâ€”of necessity, in the segregated South, only on nights designated for exclusively white audiences.[39] He certainly listened to the regional radio stations, such as WDIA-AM, that played "race records": spirituals, blues, and the modern, backbeat-heavy sound of rhythm and blues.[40] Many of his future recordings were inspired by local African-American musicians such as Arthur Crudup and Rufus Thomas.[41][42] B.B. King recalled that he had known Presley before he was popular, when they both used to frequent Beale Street.[43] By the time he graduated from high school in June 1953, Presley had already singled out music as his future.[44][45]
