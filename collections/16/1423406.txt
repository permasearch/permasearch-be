In May 2005, Tiffany released the album Dust Off and Dance. It was dedicated to her new husband, but recorded as a thank you to her fans (particularly her gay and European fanbase) for reminding her about the fun to be had with her career.[22] The album consisted of Eurodance and Hi-NRG style songs. The singles from Dust Off and Dance, such as "Ride It", "Fly", "Be with U Tonite", "Na Na Na", and "Artificial Girlfriend", all charted on listener-sponsored radio stations that also streamed online, such as WMPH and C895Worldwide. A few of the singles made the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart.
