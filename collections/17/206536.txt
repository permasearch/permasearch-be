In the beginning of season 6, we find that Addison rejected Sam and is now pursuing a relationship with Jake. Jake and Addison move in together later in the season after she admits to being in love with him. She then proposes marriage. Although initially he does not give her an answer, over the course of the episode he gains closure with his wife and realizes that Addison is who he wants to spend his life with. When Addison gets home, Jake has lit candles and lined the living room with rose petals, leading to the deck where he is waiting for her in a suit and tie. He tells her to ask him again, and gives her a ring, after which point the two are engaged. In the finale episode of Private Practice, Jake and Addison get married and are beginning the rest of their lives with Henry.[30]
