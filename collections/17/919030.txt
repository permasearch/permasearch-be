At birth, Taylor was 9 inches (22.86 cm) long and weighed 10 ounces (283 grams).[25] She suffered digestive and respiratory problems, together with a brain hemorrhage. She was discharged from the Baptist Children's Hospital on 20 February 2007.[25] As of 2013, Taylor was in kindergarten and at the small end of the normal growth curve with some developmental delays.[27]
