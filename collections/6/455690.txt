In Jamaican cuisine, chicken feet are mainly used to make chicken foot soup.[11] The soup contains yams, potatoes, green/yellow banana, dumplings and special spices in addition to the chicken feet, and is slow cooked for a minimum of two hours. Chicken feet are also curried or stewed and served as a main part of a meal.
