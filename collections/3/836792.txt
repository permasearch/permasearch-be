In the second season, Van and Cheyenne start college. His football scholarship is suspended when he injures his knee, so they are forced to move back in with Reba when they lose their off-campus housing. Van takes the semester off and becomes a house dad while Cheyenne continues school. They struggle financially and even apply for food stamps at one point, forcing Reba to take a job at Brock's office to help. Cheyenne again tries to get Van to reconcile with his wealthy parents so they can help with finances, but they shower Elizabeth with extravagant gifts, and it becomes a battle of who can be the better grandparents between them and Reba. Van eventually returns to playing football, making Cheyenne feel lonely as he has less time to spend with her.
