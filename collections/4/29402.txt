Several series of original English-language manga have been produced by HarperCollins with TOKYOPOP.[54] With the shutdown of TOKYOPOP, subsequent manga volumes have been published under the HarperCollins name alone. Four of the manga series consist of three volumes, though The Rise of Scourge is a standalone book.
