NASA satellites show sea levels rising at a rate of 3.22 millimeters per year. The UN Inter overnmental Panel on Climate Change published also a report which shows that the sea levels might peak a level of 0.76 meters in 2100. The calculations for the year 2500 show a rise of 1.8 meters.[9] Specifically in the UAE, reports expect a land loss of 1–6% (1,555– 5,000 km2) by 2100.[16]
