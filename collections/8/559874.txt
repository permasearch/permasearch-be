Charter Communications became one of the first multiple system operators to provide NFL Network, in 2004.[45] Initially the deal called for the network to be carried on Charter's digital-basic programming and included NFL HD and NFL On Demand.[46] However, in December 2005, the network had pulled itself from Charter and filed a breach of contract suit against the provider in the New York Supreme Court over contract language regarding distribution.[34] It was reported that NFL Network wanted a 125% rate increase in carriage fees and placement on Charter's expanded basic tiers.[47]
