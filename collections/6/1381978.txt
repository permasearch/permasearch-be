The Select was a continuation of the first generation Rogue sold alongside an all-new Rogue that went on sale in 2013 as a 2014 model.  Since the production capacity allowed for the first generation to be built in conjunction with the 2nd generation, it allowed for a lower entry price to Rogue customers as well as fleet sales. It went on sale in January 2014 as a 2014 model year vehicle and was continued through 2015.  Nissan then announced that 2015 would be the final year.[19] The Rogue Select was not offered in Canada.
