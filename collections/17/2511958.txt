There is some discrepancy as to where "The Five and a Half Minute Hallway" appears. It is quoted by different characters at different times to have been located in each of the cardinal directions. This first happens when ZampanÃ² writes that the hallway is in the western wall (House of Leaves, page 57), directly contradicting an earlier page where the hallway is mentioned to be in the northern wall (House of Leaves, page 4); Johnny's footnotes point out the contradiction.
