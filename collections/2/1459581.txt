A sarpanch is an elected head of the village-level statutory institution of local self-government called the panchayat (village government) in India (gram panchayat).[1] The sarpanch, together with other elected panchas (members), constitute the gram panchayat. The sarpanch is the focal point of contact between government officers and the village community. Recently, there have been proposals to give sarpanches small judicial powers under panchayati. In some states of India such as Bihar, sarpanch has been empowered to look into various civil and criminal cases, and given judicial power to punish and impose fine on those violating rules.[2]
