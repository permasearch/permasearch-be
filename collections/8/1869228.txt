The objective consists of adjusting the parameters of a model function to best fit a data set. A simple data set consists of n points (data pairs)     (  x  i   ,  y  i   )    {\displaystyle (x_{i},y_{i})\!}  , i = 1, ..., n, where      x  i      {\displaystyle x_{i}\!}   is an independent variable and      y  i      {\displaystyle y_{i}\!}   is a dependent variable whose value is found by observation. The model function has the form     f ( x , β )   {\displaystyle f(x,\beta )}  , where m adjustable parameters are held in the vector      β    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\beta }}}  . The goal is to find the parameter values for the model that "best" fits the data. The least-squares method finds its optimum when the sum, S, of squared residuals
