Presently, the candidates for a job in professional umpiring must meet several requirements in order to be considered. An applicant must have a high school diploma or a G.E.D., must be athletic, and also must have 20/20 vision, though they are permitted to wear glasses or contact lenses.[19] They must also have good communication skills, good reflexes and coordination, and must have trained at one of the two professional umpire schools.
