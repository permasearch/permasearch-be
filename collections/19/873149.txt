Most of the Tang artists outlined figures with fine black lines and used brilliant color and elaborate detail.  However, one Tang artist, the master Wu Daozi, used only black ink and freely painted brushstrokes to create ink paintings that were so exciting that crowds gathered to watch him work.  From his time on, ink paintings were no longer thought to be preliminary sketches or outlines to be filled in with color.  Instead, they were valued as finished works of art.
