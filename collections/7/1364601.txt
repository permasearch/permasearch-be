The same report lists the following as some drawbacks to the double-hull design, including higher build costs,[88] greater operating expenses (e.g. higher canal and port tariffs),[88] difficulties in ballast tank ventilation,[88] the fact that ballast tanks need continuous monitoring and maintenance,[88] increased transverse free surface,[88] the greater number of surfaces to maintain,[88] the risk of explosions in double-hull spaces if a vapor detection system not fitted,[89] and that cleaning ballast tanks is more difficult for double hull ships.[89]
