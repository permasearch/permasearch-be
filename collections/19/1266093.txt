A bear claw is a sweet, yeast-raised pastry, similar to a Danish, originating in the United States during the mid-1920s.[1][not in citation given] A bear claw is usually filled with almond paste,[2] and sometimes raisins, and often shaped in a semicircle with slices along the curved edge, or rectangular with partial slices along one side.[3] As the dough rises, the sections separate, evoking the shape of a bear's toes, hence the name.[4]
