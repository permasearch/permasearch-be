At Comeback Canyon, Bob is working with Blake and Jackie, both of whom are fierce competitors. "Because there's a red line at the ranch, usually the person coming into Comeback Canyon has an advantage," explains Bob. But this week, both women lost three pounds the week before, so they're pretty evenly matched. That said, Jackie is up first on the scale. She loses six pounds, or 2.41%, which means she now weighs 243 pounds. Blake is up next, and is worried because she has had a bunch of injuries and has been wearing two boots since Week 3. At 196 pounds, she needs to lose at least five pounds to beat Jackie. Unfortunately, she loses just one pound, or 0.51%. She's embarrassed, but Bob assures her there's nothing to be embarrassed about. She has grown up tremendously, opened up little by little and feels great now. When she first got to the ranch, she wanted to lose weight to make her parents proud, but she has since learned it needs to be about her. Although she's sad to see Blake leave, Jackie is incredibly proud of herself - she's the first contestant to win two weeks in a row at Comeback Canyon and is looking forward to defending her title.
