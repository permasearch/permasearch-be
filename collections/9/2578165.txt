The Garda Special Detective Unit (SDU) are primarily responsibility for providing armed close protection to senior officials in Ireland.[19] They provide full-time armed protection and transport for the President, Taoiseach, TÃ¡naiste, Minister for Justice and Equality, Attorney General, Chief Justice, Director of Public Prosecutions, Ambassadors and Diplomats deemed 'at risk' (such as the Ambassadors, Embassies and Diplomatic Residences of the United Kingdom, United States, Israel), as well as foreign dignitaries visiting Ireland and citizens deemed to require armed protection as designated so by the Garda Commissioner.[20] The Commissioner is also protected by the unit. All cabinet ministers are afforded armed protection at heightened levels of risk when deemed necessary by Garda Intelligence,[21] and their places of work and residences are monitored.[22] Former Presidents and Taoisigh are protected if their security is under threat, otherwise they only receive protection on formal state occasions.[23] The Emergency Response Unit (ERU), a section of the SDU, are deployed on more than 100 VIP protection duties per year.[24]
