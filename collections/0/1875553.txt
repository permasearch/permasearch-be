Attempts to derail the train using a portable derailer failed and police shot at an emergency fuel cutoff switch, which had no effect because the button must be pressed for several seconds before the engine is starved of fuel and shuts down. A northbound freight train, Q63615, was directed onto a siding where the crew uncoupled its locomotive, #8392 (another EMD SD40-2), and waited for the runaway train to pass. #8392 had a crew of two: Jess Knowlton, an engineer with 31 years of service; and Terry L. Forson, conductor with one year's experience.[6] Together, they chased the runaway train. An EMD GP38 locomotive was prepared further down the line to couple to the front of the runaway to slow it further, if necessary.
