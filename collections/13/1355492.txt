In 2011, Sydney had the driest February in 30 years with only 18 mm (0.71 in) of rain falling, which is well below than the average 118 mm (4.6 in). Some of the western suburbs recorded the lowest total February rainfall on record.[103] In September 2013, the combination of dry weather, warm temperatures and strong winds brought early-season bushfires. Major bushfires impacted western Sydney and the Blue Mountains, resulting in some evacuations, closed roads, and destroyed homes.[58]
