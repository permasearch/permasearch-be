Many times Howard was upset that he was not getting the ball enough, and he felt that Kobe Bryant was shooting too much.[62] Moving forward, Howard said he needed to "bring it" and dominate in more ways than just scoring.[63] In the following game against Memphis, he had only two points and four rebounds in 14 minutes before he sat out the rest of the game after aggravating his shoulder injury.[64] He returned the following game showing no ill effects from the injury.[65] On January 30, Howard left the Phoenix Suns game early after re-aggravating his shoulder. He was listed as day to day and missed subsequent games.[66][67] Bryant said that Howard "worries too much" and "doesn't want to let anyone down", and urged him to play through the pain when Pau Gasol was sidelined with a torn plantar fascia.[68] Howard returned the next game after commenting that Bryant was "not a doctor, I'm not a doctor. That's his opinion."[69]
