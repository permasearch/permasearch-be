The J.H. Filbert company, based in Baltimore, Maryland, developed the product in 1979 as a low-cost alternative to butter for the food service industry.[5] The name originated from a comment by the husband of a company secretary as he sampled the product, and it was first marketed to retail consumers in 1981.[1][5] The company was acquired by Unilever in 1986. Unilever expanded sales of the product, previously only available primarily in the Washington, DC/Baltimore area, throughout the entire United States in 1988, and later to the United Kingdom, Canada and Mexico in 1991.[6][7][8][9] The product was put on the market in Germany in 2011 and in Chile in 2012.[citation needed]
