President Stark sends a drone to track the killers, but it is shot down and its datacore claimed by the Blue. President Stark discovers certain anomalies regarding past events, leading him to believe that events like Sharpe's murder were caused by a third party. Meanwhile, Hank McCoy shows Rogers the results of "Project Bellcurve", a procedure capable of depowering superhumans. Numerous resources from the Iron are needed to continue the project, for which Rogers sends a team composed of Parker, Elektra, Azari, and Venom/Clint Barton to infiltrate Stark's territory. At the same time, Stark sends Jennifer Walters to infiltrate the Blue and continue investigating Sharpe's murder.[17]
