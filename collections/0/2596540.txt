Stress affects many memory functions and cognitive functioning of the brain.[9]  There are different levels of stress and the high levels can be intrinsic or extrinsic.  Intrinsic stress level is triggered by a cognitive challenge whereas extrinsic can be triggered by a condition not related to a cognitive task.[7]   Intrinsic stress can be acutely and chronically experienced by a person.[7] The varying effects of stress on performance or stress hormones are often compared to or known as "inverted-u"[9]  which induce areas in learning, memory and plasticity.[7] Chronic stress can affect the brain structure and cognition.
