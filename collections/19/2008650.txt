Old English had multiple generic nouns for "woman" stretching across all 3 genders: for example, in addition to the neuter wif and the masculine wifmann listed above, there was also the feminine frowe.[2]:6 For the gender-neutral nouns for "child", there was the feminine byren in addition to the neuter bearn and the neuter cild (compare English child). And even with nouns referring to persons, one could not always determine gender by meaning or form: for example, with 2 words ending in -mæg, there was the female-specific neuter noun wynmæg, meaning "winsome maid" or attractive woman; as well as the gender-neutral noun meaning "paternal kindred" or member of father's side of the family, but which was grammatically feminine: fædernmæg.[2]:7-8
