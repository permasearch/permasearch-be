The work of constructing the ships was difficult and dangerous. For the 15,000 men who worked at Harland and Wolff at the time,[81] safety precautions were rudimentary at best; a lot of the work was dangerous and was carried out without any safety equipment like hard hats or hand guards on machinery. As a result, deaths and injuries were to be expected. During Titanic's construction, 246 injuries were recorded, 28 of them "severe", such as arms severed by machines or legs crushed under falling pieces of steel. Six people died on the ship herself while she was being constructed and fitted out, and another two died in the shipyard workshops and sheds.[82] Just before the launch a worker was killed when a piece of wood fell on him.[83]
