The Ritz Health Club contains a swimming pool, the largest in all of the Parisian hotel palaces at 1,700 square metres (18,000 sq ft) and billed by the Ritz as "the finest indoor pool in Paris".[49][59] The pool's construction was inspired by the baths of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome and features reliefs on the ceilings and jet streams and underwater sounds in the pool. The health club offers a range of health treatments, from reflexology to Swedish massage and shiatsu.[60]
