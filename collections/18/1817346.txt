Universal praise was given to the technical milestones achieved by the game's graphics and presentation. Edge felt that Cocoon in particular was an "inspired setting [...] blessed with a vibrancy and vivid colour that often leaves you open-mouthed".[112] GameSpot called the art design "magnificent".[115] Further praise was given to the pre-rendered animation sequences[111][134][135] and the almost seamless transition of visual quality between these and the realtime gameplay.[134] Many also appreciated the game's soundtrack,[111][115] with Masashi Hamauzu providing "a score with catchy hooks and blood-pumping battle melodies", according to Wired.[135]
