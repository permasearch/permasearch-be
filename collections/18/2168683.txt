Also in Arkham City's Industrial District, Batman can locate a small boat in the harbor that doesn't register anything out of the ordinary on his Detective Mode vision. When he lands on this boat and uses his Cryptographic Sequencer gadget to unlock a secret and hidden door, it opens to reveal several indications as to Scarecrow's activities. The most obvious sign is a nearly comatose test subject, one of the Joker's henchmen, tied to a chair and mostly unconscious. Looking further, you can see a flood of crawling cockroaches up the walls, as well as a document from Falcone Shipping indicating Crane's importation of live insects for undisclosed medical research.[99] While monitoring radio frequencies in Arkham City, the player can also discover hidden broadcasts of a mysterious voice reading a sequence of numbers. When translated, the frequencies reveal three different phrases: the first says, "I will return Batman!" The second says, "You will pay for what you have done to me!" And the final code says, "Fear will tear Gotham to shreds!"[100]
