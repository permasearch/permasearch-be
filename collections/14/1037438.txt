Vertical B2B is generally oriented to manufacturing or business. It can be divided into two directions -- upstream and downstream. Producers or commercial retailers can have a supply relationship with upstream suppliers, including manufacturers, and form a sales relationship.[8] As an example, Dell company is working with upstream suppliers of integrated circuit microchips and computer printed circuit boards (PCBs).
