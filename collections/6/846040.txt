Shortly after the premiere of Sesame Street, the CTW was approached by producers, educators, and officials in other nations, requesting that a version of the show be aired in their countries. Former CBS executive Mike Dann left commercial television to become vice-president of the CTW and Cooney's assistant;[note 17] Dann began what Charlotte Cole, vice president for the CTW's International Research department, called the "globalization" of Sesame Street.[115] A flexible model was developed, based upon the experiences of the creators and producers of the original show. The shows came to be called "co-productions", and they contained original sets, characters, and curriculum goals. Depending upon each country's needs and resources, different versions were produced, including dubbed versions of the original show and independent programs. By 2009, Sesame Street had expanded into 140 countries;[116] The New York Times reported in 2005 that income from the CTW's international co-productions of the show was $96 million.[117]
