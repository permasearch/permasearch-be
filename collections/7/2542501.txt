Some research has shown that parents who have access to paid sick leave are more likely to take time away from work to care for their sick kids,[9] and other research finds that most children recover faster from illness when cared for by their parents.[10] However, 53 percent of working mothers and 48 percent of working fathers donâ€™t have paid sick days to care for children.[11] Without paid time off, workers may be forced to send sick children to school where they spread illness and experience negative short- and long-term health outcomes.[12] The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) asks workers to stay at home if they are sick and to keep sick kids out of school.[13] During the 2009 H1N1 crisis, the CDC recommended that anyone with flu-like symptoms remain at home.[14] According to a report from the Institute for Women's Policy Research, more than 8 million workers went to their jobs while sick between September and November 2009 during the H1N1 pandemic.[15]
