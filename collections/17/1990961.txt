The film was shot in Woodstock, Illinois, 60 miles (97 kilometres) northwest of Chicago near the Wisconsin border, because Punxsutawney "didn’t have a town center that looked good on camera", according to Ramis,[7] and because Punxsutawney's remote location magnified the logistical problems and expense of filming there.[12][13] Woodstock was a suitable replacement for Pennsylvania in the winter months; further, Ramis knew the area as a Chicago native and recognized it would be easy to obtain licenses to film there and operate the film's production during the winter months.[13] Punxsutawney officials, miffed that their town had been passed over, refused to allow the real Punxsutawney Phil to appear in the movie,[7] but sent representatives to Woodstock to make sure the ceremony was being depicted accurately;[14] according to producer Trevor Albert, the Punxsutawney officers "were actually very pleased" with their recreation of Gobbler's Knob, the site near Punxsutawney used for the Groundhog Day ceremonies.[13] Filming began on March 16, 1992, and continued through May. Much of the filming was done in colder-than-normal weather, with Murray saying that temperatures were often under 20 °F (−7 °C), and had snowfall that lasted through May.[13]
