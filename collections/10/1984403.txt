The GTX is based almost entirely from the Viper, albeit with a few changes. The exhaust system has been changed into Devon's own stainless steel variant, a revised intake system, a new one-piece carbon fiber superstructure, carbon fiber body panels, new cast-aluminum unequal-length front and rear suspension wishbones, new coil-over shocks, and StopTech race-inspired aftermarket brakes. The GTX was also intended to produce 650 hp (485 kW; 659 PS) at 6100 rpm from the Viper-derived 8.4-liter Viper V10.[72]
