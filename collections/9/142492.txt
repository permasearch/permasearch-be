Erin is excited to have Andy back from his Outward Bound program, but is surprised to see a more confident and cocky Andy. A new love interest for her is introduced in the new guy Pete. In the episode "The Boat", Erin and Pete go out for drinks. There are multiple other instances in the beginning of season 9 in which Pete and Erin bond while Andy is on his boat trip. In the episode "Customer Loyalty", Erin seems to miss Pete when they are split up by Nellie. Erin decides to break up with Andy prior to his return, but when he returns she cannot find the confidence to break up. After telling Pete and giving him a kiss, she runs back up to Andy's office and breaks up with him. By the time he decides to quit his job and seek fame and fortune, though, Erin feels kinder towards him and gives him sound advice before being greatly moved by his farewell rendition of "I Will Remember". In "Finale", she is reunited with her birth parents, who had seen the documentary and showed up at a Q&A forum with the office members. It is indicated that she is still dating Pete, as they are shown dancing at Dwight and Angela's wedding.
