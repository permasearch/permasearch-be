Starr left the band shortly after the Hollywood Rock concert in Rio de Janeiro on January 22, 1993,[66] stating that he wanted to spend more time with his family.[67] Staley told Rolling Stone in 1994 about Starr leaving the band, "It was just a difference in priorities. We wanted to continue intense touring and press. Mike was ready to go home."[68] Years later, Starr claimed that he was fired due to his drug addiction.[68][69]
