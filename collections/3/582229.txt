CATS' Sprinter Enhanced Bus Service connects the airport to the uptown Charlotte Transportation Center (this route used to be known as the "Route 5-Airport"). It arrives and departs in front of Zone D Baggage Claim in the commercial lanes, and is easily identifiable by its green livery and "Sprinter" decals.
