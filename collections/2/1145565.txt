The next day, Emma and Andi visit the Novoas at their house. Meanwhile, Emma and Andi take a visit to Daniel and see that Mia and Daniel are a couple but they acting like they don't know him. Emma then tells Andi that she will be going to train to be a Guardian at the W.I.T.s Academy. Andi gets excited to hear this. She packs when they get home, and Emma gives her the Hex. Emma and Andi soon arrive at Iridium High, where Jax, Diego, Gigi, and the Panthers were waiting for Andi. The Panthers give Andi a portrait of them with Diego, and after everyone else says their heartfelt goodbyes, Andi goes through the portal and teleports to a ruined area. Andi is about to start on her way to the academy, but a force-field blocks her move, and she starts getting trapped in a liquid capsule; this leads up to the premiere of WITS Academy.
