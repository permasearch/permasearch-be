Windmills were used to pump water for salt making on the island of Bermuda, and on Cape Cod during the American revolution.[11] In Mykonos and in other islands of Greece windmills were used to mill flour and remained in use until the early 20th century.[16] Many of them are now refurbished to be inhabited.[17]
