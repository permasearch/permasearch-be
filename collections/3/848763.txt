Immediately prior to the 2007 NHL trade deadline, the Blues traded several key players, including as Bill Guerin, Keith Tkachuk and Dennis Wideman, in exchange for draft picks, though they later re-signed Tkachuk during the subsequent off-season. Brad Boyes, picked up from the Boston Bruins in exchange for Wideman, became the fastest Blues player to reach 40 goals since Brett Hull, doing so during the 2007–08 season. During the 2007 off-season, the Blues signed free agent Paul Kariya to a three-year contract worth $18 million, re-signed defenseman Barret Jackman to a one-year contract, lost their captain Dallas Drake to the Detroit Red Wings, and traded prospect Carl Soderberg to the Bruins in exchange for yet more depth in the goal crease, Hannu Toivonen.
