Madison Square was laid out in 1837 and named for James Madison, fourth President of the United States. In the center of the square is an 1888 statue by Alexander Doyle memorializing Sgt. William Jasper, a soldier in the Siege of Savannah who, though mortally wounded, heroically recovered his company's banner.[10] Savannahians sometimes refer to this as Jasper Square, in honor of Jasper's statue.[13] Madison Square features a vintage cannon from the Savannah Armory.[9] These now mark the starting points of the first highways in Georgia, the Ogeechee Road leading to Darien and the Augusta Road.[10][17] The square also includes a monument marking the center of the British resistance during the Siege.[3] Madison Square is located on Bull, between Harris and Charlton Streets.
