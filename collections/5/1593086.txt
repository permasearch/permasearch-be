Meanwhile, James Boswell was in Paris, and offered to escort Thérèse to Rousseau.[40][39] (Boswell had earlier met Rousseau and Therese at Motiers; he had subsequently also sent Therese a garnet necklace and written to Rousseau seeking permission to occasionally communicate with her).[40] Hume foresaw what was going to happen: "I dread some event fatal to our friend's honor."[40][39] Boswell and Therese were together for more than a week, and as per notes in Boswell's diary they consummated the relationship, having intercourse several times.[40][39] On one occasion, Therese told Boswell: "Don't imagine you are a better lover than Rousseau."[40]
