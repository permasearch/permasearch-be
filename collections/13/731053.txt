The batch window is further complicated by the actual run-time of a particular batch activity. Some batches in banking can take between 5-9 hours of run time, coupled with global constraints some batch activity is broken up or even stalled to allow periodic use of databases mid batch (usually in read-only) to support automated testing scripts that may run in the evening hours or outsourced\contract testing and development resources abroad. More complex problems arise when institutions both have batch activities that may be dependent meaning both batches have to complete in the same batch window.
