The optimal exercise routine, use of noninvasive ventilation during exercise, and intensity of exercise suggested for people with COPD, is unknown.[92][94][95] Performing endurance arm exercises improves arm movement for people with COPD, and may result in a small improvement in breathlessness.[96] Performing arm exercises alone does not appear to improve quality of life.[96] Breathing exercises in and of themselves appear to have a limited role.[22] Pursed lip breathing exercises may be useful.[21][22] Tai chi exercises appear to be safe to practice for people with COPD, and may be beneficial for pulmonary function and pulmonary capacity when compared to a regular treatment program.[97] Tai Chi was not found to be more effective than other exercise intervention programs.[97] Inspiratory and expiratory muscle training (IMT, EMT) is an effective method for improving activities of daily living (ADL). A combination of IMT and walking exercises at home may help limit breathlessness in cases of severe COPD.[98] Additionally, the use of low amplitude high velocity joint mobilization together with exercise improves lung function and exercise capacity.[99] The goal of spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) is to improve thoracic mobility in an effort to reduce the work on the lungs during respiration, to in turn increase exercise capacity as indicated by the results of a systemic medical review.[99]
