Section 4207 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (H.R. 3590) amends Section 7 to add a "break time for nursing mothers" provision. It specifies that employers shall provide break time for nursing mothers to express milk and that "a place, other than a bathroom, that is shielded from view and free from intrusion from coworkers and the public" should be available for employees to express milk.[48]
