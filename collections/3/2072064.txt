In 2005, a partnership of Comcast, Sony and several merchant banks bought United Artists and its parent, MGM, for $4.8Â billion.[14] Though only a minority investor, Sony closed MGM's distribution system and folded most of its staff into their own studio,[14] and the movies UA had completed and planned for release - Capote, Art School Confidential, The Woods, and Romance and Cigarettes[citation needed] - were reassigned to Sony Pictures Classics.[14]
