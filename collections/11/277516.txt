A five-man syndicate, headed by Sonny Werblin, saved the team from certain bankruptcy, purchasing the lowly Titans for $1 million.[15] Werblin renamed the team the New York Jets since the team would play in Shea Stadium near LaGuardia Airport.[16] The new name was intended to reflect the modern approach of his team. The Jets' owners hired Weeb Ewbank as the general manager and head coach.[15] Ewbank and quarterback Joe Namath led the Jets to prominence in 1969, when New York defeated the heavily favored Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III[6] and solidified the AFL's position in the world of professional football.[17]
