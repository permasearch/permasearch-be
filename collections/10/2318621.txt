While much of Lahore's Mughal era fabric lay in ruins by the end of the 18th century, the Sikh rulers plundered most of Lahore's most precious Mughal monuments, and stripped the white marble from several monuments to send to different parts of the Sikh Empire.[54] Monuments plundered of their marble include the Tomb of Asif Khan and the Tomb of Nur Jahan.[55] The Shalimar Gardens were plundered of much of its marble which was transported to decorate the Ram Bagh Palace in nearby Amritsar, while the gardens' costly agate gate was stripped and sold by Lehna Singh Majithia, one of the governors of Lahore during Sikh rule.[56] Ranjit Singh's army also desecrated most of the important Mughal mosques in Lahore and some were confiscated including the Abdullah Khan Masjid. The Badshahi Mosque was also confiscated and converted into an ammunition depot and a stable for Ranjit Singh's horses.[57] The Golden Mosque in the Walled City of Lahore was also converted to a gurdwara for a period of time,[58] while the Mosque of Mariyam Zamani Begum was repurposed into a gunpowder factory.[59] Ranjit Singh's son, Sher Singh, continued the pattern of desecrating Mughal mosques by mounting weaponry to Badshahi Mosque's minarets in order to target his political opponents in the nearby Lahore Fort, destroying the fort's historic Diwan-e-Aam.[57]
