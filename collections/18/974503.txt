Note: Because a club sport can exist if there are only two competing schools, any competitive athletic activity could be considered a collegiate club sport. Therefore, many non-conventional sports are played at the club level, for example orienteering. Lists of collegiate club sports are not always definite due to the fact that the sport may only be competed in between two schools or colleges and may not have a governing body or publication.
