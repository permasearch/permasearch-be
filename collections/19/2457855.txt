Transvaginal ultrasonography is a cheap and readily available imaging test that is typically used early during the evaluation of gynecologic symptoms.[21] Ultrasound imaging, like MRI, does not use radiation and is safe for examination of the pelvis and female reproductive organs.[22] Overall, it is estimated that transvaginal ultrasonography has a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 85% for the detection of adenomyosis.[10]
