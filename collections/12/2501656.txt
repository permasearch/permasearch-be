The franchise moved once again in 1983, becoming the Las Vegas Stars. The Stars became the first professional sports team to play in Las Vegas since the Las Vegas Wranglers baseball club who played from 1947–52 and 1957–58. The Stars inaugural season was quite successful, posting an 83–60 record and winning the first half championship for the Southern Division leading to a playoff berth, eventually losing to the Albuquerque Dukes.  The following season, the Stars posted another successful campaign going 71–65 and winning their second division championship (first half), but ultimately losing in the league semifinals to the Hawaii Islanders.  After a dismal '85 campaign, the Stars returned to their winning ways posting an 80–62 record and winning the second half of the Southern Division.  In the league semifinals, the Stars defeated the Phoenix Firebirds 3-2 and went on to win their first PCL Championship, defeating the Vancouver Canadians in five games.  The Stars won their second PCL Championship two years later, once again defeating Vancouver, this time in four games.
