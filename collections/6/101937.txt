The new cap was slightly higher than the highest official wage bill in the 2009â€“10 season. Also, due to the complex nature of French club administration, clubs were seen as likely to find creative ways to skirt the cap.[57] This was publicly admitted in 2014 by Mourad Boudjellal, owner of current Top 14 power Toulon. Boudjellal found a loophole that allowed him to set up a separate company to supplement the salary of star Jonny Wilkinson by a six-figure amount while staying under the cap.[58]
