The composition of the cyst wall is variable in different organisms. The cyst walls of bacteria are formed by the thickening of the normal cell wall with added peptidoglycan layers whereas the walls of protozoan cysts are made of chitin,[3] a type of glycopolymer. Nematode cyst walls are composed of chitin reinforced by collagen.
