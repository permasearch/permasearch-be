The Supreme Court recognized a different kind of paren patriae suit in Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. Co.[9] While the earlier cases were common-law actions to prevent or repair harm to a state's "quasi-sovereign" interests. Georgia now sought relief under the federal antitrust statute, alleging that 20 railroads had conspired to restrain trade and to fix prices in a manner that would favor shippers in other States (particularly Northern States) to the detriment of Georgia shippers and the state's economy. The Court upheld Georgia's claim as parens patriae with respect to injunctive relief, but did not consider whether the antitrust laws also authorized damages for an injury to the State's economy, because the ICC's approval of the challenged rates barred any damage recovery.
