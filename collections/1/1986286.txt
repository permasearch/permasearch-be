Michael Obeng says his wife Veronika Obeng agreed to do the series which originally was called Second Wives Club in 2015. Michael agreed to participate in the show in hopes to promote his business, and because he thought it would spotlight their happy marriage. Veronika officially filed for divorce in 2016. Michael filed a lawsuit against the network in January 2016. The lawsuit states "The series was nothing about the couple's happy marriage." Obeng claimed that he was required to display an "unrealistic and manufactured personality" which could harm his business if the show is allowed to air. In a letter from his lawyer which was sent to E! Entertainment in August 2016, Obeng demanded that his children not to be included in the show. The letter identified the show under a new name Famously Married. Obeng is suing NBCUniversal the parent company of the E! Network. The suit seeks an injunction barring the network from airing or promoting the episode in which Obeng appears.[11]
