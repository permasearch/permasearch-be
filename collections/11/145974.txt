The scientific goals of ALMA include studying the origin and formation of stars, galaxies, and planets with observations of molecular gas and dust, studying distant galaxies towards the edge of the observable universe and studying relic radiation from the Big Bang.[80] A call for ALMA science proposals was issued on 31 March 2011,[81] and early observations began on 3 October.[82][83]
