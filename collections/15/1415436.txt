Pesticide use has increased since 1950 to 2.5Â million short tons annually worldwide, yet crop loss from pests has remained relatively constant.[158] The World Health Organization estimated in 1992 that three million pesticide poisonings occur annually, causing 220,000 deaths.[159] Pesticides select for pesticide resistance in the pest population, leading to a condition termed the "pesticide treadmill" in which pest resistance warrants the development of a new pesticide.[160]
