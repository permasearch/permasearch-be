New demographic trends emerged, including a later age of marriage and a smaller difference in age between groom and bride,[22] the birth of two children in quick succession, few children born out of wedlock, and a low divorce rate.[23] Lifetime employment became the norm for Japanese men, especially during the post-war economic boom of the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. A middle class ideology established a gendered family pattern with separate social spheres: a salaried husband to provide the family income, a housewife to manage the home and nurture the children, and a commitment by the children to education.[24] Better health and nutrition meant a rapid extension of life expectancy, and government policies have encouraged people to form sansedai kazoku (三世代家族, "three-generation families") to manage a rapidly aging society.[21]
