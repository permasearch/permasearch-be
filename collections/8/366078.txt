Polygraphy has been faulted for failing to trap known spies such as double-agent Aldrich Ames, who passed two polygraph tests while spying for the Soviet Union.[64][91] However Ames did fail several tests while at the CIA that were never acted on.[92] Other spies who passed the polygraph include Karl Koecher,[93] Ana Belen Montes,[94] and Leandro Aragoncillo.[95] However, CIA spy Harold James Nicholson failed his polygraph examinations, which aroused suspicions that led to his eventual arrest.[96] Polygraph examination and background checks failed to detect Nada Nadim Prouty, who was not a spy but was convicted for improperly obtaining US citizenship and using it to obtain a restricted position at the FBI.[97]
