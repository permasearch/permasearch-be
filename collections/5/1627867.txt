The episode is primarily a musical. The show's composer Daniel Ingram created seven songs with episode's writer, M.A. Larson who wrote two songs.[5] Ingram wrote most of the songs lyrics for "I've Got to Find a Way", "A True, True Friend", "Celestia's Ballad", "Behold, Princess Twilight Sparkle", and, with assistance from Larson, "What My Cutie Mark is Telling Me". The lyrics for both "Morning in Ponyville" and "Life in Equestria" were written by Larson. Under the title "Find a Way", a full version of the song "I've Got to Find a Way" is included on the album "Songs of Ponyville".
