Tailors started to take premises around Savile Row in the late 18th century, first in Cork Street, about 1790, then by 1803 in Savile Row itself.[8] In 1846, Henry Poole, credited as creator of the dinner jacket or tuxedo,[15] opened an entrance at 37 Savile Row from his late father's tailoring premises at 4 Old Burlington Street.[16][17] As tailoring moved into the street, the house frontages were altered to bring natural light into the tailors' working area with the addition of glass frontages and light wells.[18] The houses have been much altered over time; the original Burlingtonian design has been mostly lost, though No. 14 still retains much of the original external features.[4]
