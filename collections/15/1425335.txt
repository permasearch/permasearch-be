Between May and December 2017, the GE collaboration resulted in moving the engines to the wing leading edge from its trailing edge, it features a T-tail and a higher wing aspect ratio. The final engine configuration is a core with billions of operational hours – suggesting the CFM56 – and a new low-pressure section optimised for supersonic speed. Managing the high intake temperatures at high-altitudes is a key challenge for the initial design.[15] An engine for supersonic flight needs a lower bypass ratio than modern turbofans, having a higher flow speed for better efficiency, but this is limited by noise regulations at takeoff, and a lower compression core like the CFM56 is better suited to higher temperatures encountered supersonically.[16]
