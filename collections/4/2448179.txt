Meanwhile, Hacker is doing his best to placate his visitors, who are concerned that new legislation will allow certain areas of the countryside to lose their protected status, in particular the aforementioned badger colony at a place called Hayward's Spinney. After Bernard ushers them out, and Sir Humphrey joins them, Hacker is livid. His announcements to parliament and the press had proclaimed that the legislation would mean "no loss of amenity", and now he has discovered that this is not the case. Sir Humphrey indicates that the actual wording was "no significant loss of amenity", which apparently makes all the difference. He is able to persuade Hacker that Hayward's Spinney is not significant and therefore he should have nothing to worry about. However, Hacker presses the point that he should have been informed. He is surprised by Sir Humphrey's explanation, that "there are some things it is better for a minister not to know." His Permanent Secretary goes on to clarify that Hacker would not have made such a convincing case for the legislation had he been lobbied by the environmentalists beforehand. Nevertheless, the Minister is unimpressed and tells Sir Humphrey that he is about to announce a re-organisation to ensure that it doesn't happen again. Sir Humphrey is incensed and (eventually) tells Hacker that the incumbent minister is not there to run the department; he re-iterates a minister's responsibilities as defined to Bernard earlier. Hacker is not having any of it: he wants access to all departmental paperwork from now on.
