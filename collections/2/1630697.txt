Due to a state of war existing between the Republic of Armenia and Azerbaijan, the government of Azerbaijan not only bans entry of citizens from Armenia, but also all citizens and nationals of any other country who are of Armenian descent, to the Republic of Azerbaijan[400][401] (although there have been exceptions, notably for Armenia's participation at the 2015 European Games held in Azerbaijan).
