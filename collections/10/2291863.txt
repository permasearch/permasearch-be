SCI can also be of a nontraumatic origin. Nontraumatic lesions cause anywhere from 30 to 80% of all SCI;[57] the percentage varies by locale, influenced by efforts to prevent trauma.[58] Developed countries have higher percentages of SCI due to degenerative conditions and tumors than developing countries.[59] In developed countries, the most common cause of nontraumatic SCI is degenerative diseases, followed by tumors; in many developing countries the leading cause is infection such as HIV and tuberculosis.[60] SCI may occur in intervertebral disc disease, and spinal cord vascular disease.[61] Spontaneous bleeding can occur within or outside of the protective membranes that line the cord, and intervertebral disks can herniate.[9] Damage can result from dysfunction of the blood vessels, as in arteriovenous malformation, or when a blood clot becomes lodged in a blood vessel and cuts off blood supply to the cord.[62] When systemic blood pressure drops, blood flow to the spinal cord may be reduced, potentially causing a loss of sensation and voluntary movement in the areas supplied by the affected level of the spinal cord.[63] Congenital conditions and tumors that compress the cord can also cause SCI, as can vertebral spondylosis and ischemia.[2] Multiple sclerosis is a disease that can damage the spinal cord, as can infectious or inflammatory conditions such as tuberculosis, herpes zoster or herpes simplex, meningitis, myelitis, and syphilis.[9]
