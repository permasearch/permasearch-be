Sufficient habitat complexity is a crucial requirement for the presence of this species, in order to support its various behaviours-basking, foraging, and hibernationâ€”as well as to offer some protection from predators and human harassment.[3] It is found in a variety of habitats, including: chalky downs, rocky hillsides, moors, sandy heaths, meadows, rough commons, edges of woods, sunny glades and clearings, bushy slopes and hedgerows, dumps, coastal dunes, and stone quarries. It will venture into wetlands if dry ground is available nearby and thus may be found on the banks of streams, lakes, and ponds.[24]
