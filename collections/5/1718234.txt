BSM is a set of management software tools, processes and methods to manage IT via a business-centered approach.[1] BSM technology tools are designed to help IT organizations view and manage technology environments to better support and maintain the main services they provide to the business.[2] BSM tools are critical enablers for the increasingly popular process that focuses on IT Service Management (ITSM) approach. BSM consists of both structured process and enabling software. The Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), a set of IT management frameworks and concepts, has recently identified BSM as a best practice for IT infrastructure management and operations.[citation needed]
