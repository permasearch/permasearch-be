At first, it looked like Ruth was the final piece the team needed in 1935. On opening day, he had a hand in all of the Braves' runs in a 4-2 win over the Giants. However, that proved to be the highest the Braves were over .500 all year. Events went downhill quickly. A 4â€“20 May ended any realistic chance of contention.  Ruth's deterioration mirrored that of the team.  While his high living of previous years had begun catching up with him a year earlier, his conditioning rapidly declined in the first month of 1935.  While he was still able to hit at first, he could do little else. He could no longer run, and his fielding was so terrible that three of the Braves' pitchers threatened to go on strike if Ruth were in the lineup. Ruth soon discovered that he was vice president and assistant manager in name only, and Fuchs' promise of a share of team profits was hot air. In fact, Ruth discovered that Fuchs expected him to invest some of his money in the team.[4]
