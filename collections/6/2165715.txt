Due to the temperate climate and relatively close proximity to the studios in Hollywood, a number of movies and television series have been filmed in Thousand Oaks. Thousand Oaks Boulevard can for instance be seen in the Oscar-winning film It Happened One Night (1934), while Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis stop at a service station on Live Oak Street in Hollywood or Bust (1956). Hills nearby California Lutheran University (CLU) were used in the filming of Welcome to Hard Times (1967).[197] Spartacus (1960) was also filmed by CLU.[49]
