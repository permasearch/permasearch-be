A similar controversy arose after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published on May 5, 2009, its notice of proposed rulemaking for the new Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS).[141][142][143] EPA's proposal included the carbon footprint from indirect land-use changes.[144][145] On the same day, President Barack Obama signed a Presidential Directive with the aim to advance biofuel research and commercialization. The Directive asked a new Biofuels Interagency Working Group comprising the Department of Agriculture, EPA, and DOE,[146][147] to develop a plan to increase flexible fuel vehicle use, assist in retail marketing and to coordinate infrastructure policies.
