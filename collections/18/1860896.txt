Michael calls Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) an "Oscar Mayer Weiner Lover", a reference to both the sausage of the same name, as well as Oscar's homosexuality. Andy and Kevin hold a meeting with the head of the "Five Families" of the office building, a reference to the "Five Families" from The Godfather trilogy. Michael later tries to call a "hot and juicy redhead" named Wendy, but it turns out it was the number for Wendy's, the fast-food restaurant.[6]
