Approximately 62% of Utahns are reported to be members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or LDS (Mormons), which greatly influences Utahn culture and daily life.[9] The LDS Church's world headquarters is located in Salt Lake City.[10][11] Utah is the only state with a majority population belonging to a single church.[12]
