The XR 600R was used in Baja races. It was introduced in 1985, and was updated in 1988 when the original dual progressively opening carburetors were replaced with a larger single carburetor. The 600 was updated again in 1992. The XR won many desert races in the hands of Johnny Campbell and GNCC races in the hands of Scott Summers.[citation needed] Its engine was very similar to the XR 400 and XR 250 engines, (though larger and heavier) with the same RFVC valve train. In 2000, the XR 650R replaced the XR 600R.
