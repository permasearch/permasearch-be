The Nation is a daily newspaper published in Lagos, Nigeria. According to a 2009 survey it was the second-most-read newspaper in Nigeria, and this result was repeated in a 2011 report by The Advertisers' Association of Nigeria (ADVANS).[2] The paper's website says it stands for freedom, justice and the market economy. Its target audience is the business and political elite, the affluent, the educated and the upwardly mobile.[3] The Nation has printing plants in Lagos, Abuja and Port Harcourt.[4] The newspaper covers business and economy, public policies, the democratic process and institutions of democracy, sports, arts and culture.[5] The newspaper became the first of its kind to gain nationwide circulation across the 36 states of Nigeria within 2 years of operation. This was a result of its popular 8 pages pull out Thursday publication titled Campuslife, a medium specially dedicated to student journalists and writers across the tertiary institutions in Nigeria. The Campuslife pull-out with late Ngozi Agbo (nÃ©e Nwozor) as pioneer editor helped the newspaper to become a household name across Nigeria, and several student journalists and correspondents whom the paper gave the opportunity to write for it as undergraduates are now renowned in their various professions.[6][7]
