Unicode supports explicit slashed zero, but only via a pair of combining characters, not as a distinct single character (or codepoint, in Unicode parlance). It is treated literally as "a zero that is slashed", and it is coded as two characters: the commonplace zero and then the "combining long solidus overlay" (U+0338). These combining characters overlay the preceding character, creating a composite glyph.
