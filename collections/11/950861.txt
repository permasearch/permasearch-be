An onside kick is considered successful if the kicking team regains the ball. Between 2001 and 2010, surprise onside kicks were successful 60% of the time, while expected onside kicks were successful less than 20% of the time.[4] Another study of just the 2005 and 2006 seasons also found similar disparities depending on whether the defense expects an onside kick.[5] Accordingly, some analysts have suggested that the surprise onside kick is underutilized.[6] In 2014, the Indianapolis Colts routinely used the onside kick, with three in the first 6 games of the season, often at the start of the game. Each of these was successful.
