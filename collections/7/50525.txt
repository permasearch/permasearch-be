Most turloughs have a springy, short-cropped turf of grasses, sedges, and herbs. In the Burren, the high-water mark is often shown by the shrubby cinquefoil (Dasiphora fruticosa) with its attractive yellow flowers, and meadow rue. Just below the high-water mark, dog violets are abundant and in some turloughs there may be a dense sward of the rare sky-blue turlough violet about one metre further down. Other characteristic plants of turlough sides include marsh orchids and speedwell. About halfway down the sides, and across the bottom of shallow turloughs, silverweed (Argentina anserina) may blanket almost all other plants.
