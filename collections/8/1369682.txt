Unlike Ireland which uses the name "Ã‰ire/Ireland" to identify itself at international meetings,[citation needed] the English name usually appears to identify the Philippines (e.g., when there are meetings in the United Nations or the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) in this setting. This is also the tradition even if the meeting is held within the Philippines.
