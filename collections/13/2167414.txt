Children infected with rotavirus usually make a full recovery within three to eight days.[20] However, in poor countries treatment for severe infections is often out of reach and persistent diarrhea is common.[21] Dehydration is a common complication of diarrhea,[22] and a child with a significant degree of dehydration may have a prolonged capillary refill, poor skin turgor, and abnormal breathing.[23] Repeat infections are typically seen in areas with poor sanitation, and malnutrition,[15] stunted growth, and long-term cognitive delays can result.[17]
