Manziel was nationally recruited out of high school as a dual-threat quarterback,[1] and he debuted for the Texas A&M Aggies as a redshirt freshman in Kevin Sumlin's Air Raid offense[2] during A&M's first season in the Southeastern Conference (SEC) in 2012. He broke numerous NCAA Division I FBS and SEC records, which included becoming the first freshman and fifth player in NCAA history to pass for 3,000 yards and rush for 1,000 yards in a season.[3] At the end of the regular season, he became the first freshman to win the Heisman Trophy,[4] Manning Award,[5] and the Davey O'Brien National Quarterback Award.[6] Manziel capitalized on his redshirt freshman season by leading Texas A&M to a 41â€“13 victory over Oklahoma in the Cotton Bowl.[7]
