Max Holden arrives to Llanview in 1987 to seek a loan from fellow Texan and family friend Maria Roberts (BarBara Luna), who agreed to give him the money he needed on the condition that Max lure Tina Lord (Andrea Evans) away from her son, Cord (John Loprieno). Max soon falls for Tina, while she was still in love with Cord. While Max and Tina are marrying in ceremony, she accidentally says Cord's name during her vows, and Max then calls off his relationship with her. Max's brother Steve Holden (Russ Anderson) comes to town in 1987 and soon becomes involved with and marries Gabrielle Medina (Fiona Hutchison), Max's ex-girlfriend and mother to his son, Al. Gabrielle still cares for Max, however, and the relationship with Steve falls apart in 1988. Later in 1988, at the double wedding of Cord and Tina and Asa and Renée Divine (Patricia Elliott), Steve noticed that the wedding cake had been wired to explode. Steve throws himself in front to the bomb to protect his fiancée Brenda McGillis (Brenda Brock) and is killed instantly as it explodes. Brenda later discovers she was pregnant with Steve's child.
