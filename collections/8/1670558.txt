Traditionally, state funerals are reserved for all former Governors-General, as well as Prime Ministers who die in office, such as John Ballance in 1893, Joseph Ward in 1930[43] and Michael Joseph Savage in 1940.[44] The funeral of John Ballance occurred in Whanganui after a lying in state in the New Zealand Parliament and a rail journey from Wellington. It was a Masonic funeral carried out at the Whanganui cemetery where he was interred.[45] Both funerals of Ward and Savage were held in Sacred Heart Cathedral adjacent to the New Zealand Parliament.[44] In the case of Savage, his body lay in state in the Parliament building, where 50,000 people filed past it, before the Requiem Mass at the Cathedral.[44] Others to receive state funerals include Sir Frederic Truby King (1937) who founded the Plunket Society, the unidentified victims of the Tangiwai rail disaster (1953),[46] Victoria Cross recipient Jack Hinton (1997),[47] the mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary (2008)[48] and the Unknown Warrior whose reinterment (from the Caterpillar Valley Cemetery on the Somme in France) took place on Armistice Day, 11 November 2004 and whose tomb at the New Zealand National War Memorial represents all New Zealand soldiers who died in war.[49] The offer of a state funeral was refused by the family of former Prime Minister David Lange.[50]
