Modern psychiatric hospitals evolved from, and eventually replaced the older lunatic asylums. The development of the modern psychiatric hospital is also the story of the rise of organized, institutional psychiatry. The moral treatment and care of the mentally ill, as opposed to isolation, was first pioneered in the Islamic world by physicians whose treatment of mental patients was regarded as a religious obligation based on the Quranic verse Do not give the property with which God has entrusted you to the insane, but feed and clothe them with this property and speak kindly to them.[4] It greatly differed from the reigning view in which the insane were viewed as under the influence of the Devil therefore needing to be isolated from society. The first psychiatric hospital was built by the Muslims in Baghdad in 705 AD, under the leadership of the Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid ibn Abd al-Malik.[5] Others would rapidly follow, with some of the more famous ones being built in Cairo in 800 AD and in Damascus in 1270 AD. The physicians of the Islamic world would invent and use a variety of treatments, including occupational therapy, music therapy, as well as medication.[4]
