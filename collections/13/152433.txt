After the 1984 Oyster Bowl, Virginia Tech led the series 49–25–5. At 79 games, it is the second-longest series for the Hokies and fourth-longest for the Keydets. Due to the long pause of the VMI-VPI series, the Virginia–Virginia Tech rivalry has emerged as the dominant one in the state. However, in 2017, Virginia tech and VMI agreed to a one-time rivalry matchup on September 5, 2026 at Lane Stadium.
