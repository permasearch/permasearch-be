Edwards syndrome, also known as trisomy 18, is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all, or part of a third copy of chromosome 18.[2] Many parts of the body are affected.[2] Babies are often born small and have heart defects.[2] Other features include a small head, small jaw, clenched fists with overlapping fingers, and severe intellectual disability.[2]
