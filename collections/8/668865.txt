The city population was 116,989 at the 2010 census.[2] As of August 1, 2017, the city had an estimated population of 168,140.[3] Frisco was the fastest-growing city in the United States in 2009,[4] and also the fastest-growing city in the nation from 2000 to 2009. In the late 1990s, the northern Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex suburban development tide hit the northern border of Plano and spilled into Frisco, sparking explosive growth into the 2000s. Like many of the cities in the booming northern suburbs of Dallas, Frisco serves as a bedroom community for many professionals who work in the Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex.
