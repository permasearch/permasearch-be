Washington state, particularly Seattle, used a flashing yellow ball in the left turn signal for the same purpose. Seattle also used a 4-lamp signal at about 20 locations, with a red ball, a steady yellow ball, a flashing yellow ball, and a dual-mode yellow and green arrow; during the permissive turn, the flashing yellow ball was displayed.[22]
