Climatologically, tropical cyclones are steered primarily westward by the east-to-west trade winds on the equatorial side of the subtropical ridgeâ€”a persistent high-pressure area over the world's subtropical oceans.[72] In the tropical North Atlantic and Northeast Pacific oceans, the trade winds steer tropical easterly waves westward from the African coast toward the Caribbean Sea, North America, and ultimately into the central Pacific Ocean before the waves dampen out.[64] These waves are the precursors to many tropical cyclones within this region.[63] In contrast, in the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific in both hemispheres, tropical cyclogenesis is influenced less by tropical easterly waves and more by the seasonal movement of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone and the monsoon trough.[73] Additionally, tropical cyclone motion can be influenced by transient weather systems, such as extratropical cyclones.
