Larvae of some species of moths in the Tineidae, Gelechioidae, and Noctuidae (family/superfamily/families, respectively), besides others, feed on detritus, or dead organic material, such as fallen leaves and fruit, fungi, and animal products, and turn it into humus.[23]:567 Well-known species include the cloth moths (Tineola bisselliella, Tinea pellionella, and Trichophaga tapetzella), which feed on detritus containing keratin, including hair, feathers, cobwebs, bird nests (particularly of domestic pigeons, Columba livia domestica) and fruits or vegetables. These species are important to ecosystems as they remove substances that would otherwise take a long time to decompose.[94]
