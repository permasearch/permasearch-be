Some sources also claim that the Indo-Greeks may have reached the Shunga capital Pataliputra in northeastern India.[95][96] However, the nature of this expedition is a matter of controversy. One theory is that Indo-Greeks were invited to join a raid led by local Indian kings down the Ganges river. The other is that it was a campaign likely made by Menander. Irrespective it appears that Pataliputra, if at all captured, was not held for long as the expedition was forced to retreat, probably due to wars in their own territories.[97] Menander's reign saw the end of the Indo-Greek expansion.
