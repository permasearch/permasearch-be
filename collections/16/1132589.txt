Sociologists have differed over the exact number of components of religiosity. Charles Glock's five-dimensional approach (Glock, 1972: 39) was among the first of its kind in the field of sociology of religion.[10] Other sociologists adapted Glock's list to include additional components (see for example, a six component measure by Mervin F. Verbit).[11][12][13]
