Henderson's eight steals during the 1989 ALCS broke Lou Brock's postseason record for a single series.[96][97] His record for the most postseason stolen bases was broken by Kenny Lofton's 34th career steal during the 2007 ALCS;[98] however, Lofton accomplished his total in 95 postseason games compared to Henderson's 60.[30][99] Henderson is the only American League player to steal more than 100 bases in a single season, and he is the all-time stolen base leader for the Oakland A's.[30][100]
