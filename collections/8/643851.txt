Since Ford's death in 2006, the only former presidents who remain technically eligible to seek another term are Jimmy Carter (elected in 1976, defeated in 1980) and George H. W. Bush (elected in 1988, defeated in 1992); both are now nonagenarians and neither has announced any plans to ever run again.
