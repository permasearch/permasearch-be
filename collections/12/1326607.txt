The movement of blood through the human body was thought to be known due to the work of the Greek physicians.[62] However, there was the question of how the blood flowed from the right ventricle of the heart to the left ventricle, before the blood is pumped to the rest of the body.[62] According to Galen in the 2nd century, blood reached the left ventricle through invisible passages in the septum.[62] By some means, Ibn al-Nafis, a 13th-century Syrian physician, found the previous statement on blood flow from the right ventricle to the left to be false.[62] Ibn al-Nafis discovered that the ventricular septum was impenetrable, lacking any type of invisible passages, showing Galen's assumptions to be false.[62] Ibn al-Nafis discovered that the blood in the right ventricle of the heart is instead carried to the left by way of the lungs.[62] This discovery was one of the first descriptions of the pulmonary circulation,[62] although his writings on the subject were only rediscovered in the 20th century,[63] and it was William Harvey's later independent discovery which brought it to general attention.[64]
