Hayward's takeover greatly improved the club's financial health, having endured a turbulent 1980s in which the club twice was declared bankrupt.[19][24] In 1982 the club was "saved" from liquidation when it was purchased by two Saudi brothers, Mahmud and Mohammad Bhatti, as part of their company Allied Properties.[19] However, their failure to sufficiently invest in the club saw it face several winding-up orders as well as successive relegations through the football divisions.[21][22][23] In 1986 the official receiver was again called in and a deal eventually brokered for Wolverhampton City Council to purchase the club's stadium for £1.12 million, along with the surrounding land, while a local developer, Gallagher Estates, in conjunction with the Asda supermarket chain, agreed to pay off the club's outstanding debts in return for the building of an Asda superstore on land adjacent to the stadium.[10][24][52]
