The Brahmi script for Konkani fell into disuse[72] Later, some inscriptions were written in old Nagari. However, owing to the Portuguese conquest in 1510 and the restrictions imposed by the inquisition, some early form of Devanagari was disused in Goa.[71] The Portuguese promulgated a law banning the use of Konkani and Nagari scripts.[16]
