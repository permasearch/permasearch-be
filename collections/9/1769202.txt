While the situation envisaged in respect of unascertained goods is analogous to that above, the price is usually ascertained, but the res vendita is not. The subject matter has not yet been appropriated to the contract: for example, 100 bags of maize at R55 per bag from a warehouse containing 10,000 bags. Risk in the res vendita does not pass until goods answering the description in the contract have been appropriated to the contract. For appropriation to occur, there must be some overt act by the seller, such as a setting aside or marking of the relevant goods.[59]
