Jailbreaking in general means breaking the device out of its "jail",[5] a metaphor used in Unix-style systems, for example in "FreeBSD jail". A jailbroken iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad running iOS can still use the App Store, iTunes, and other normal functions, such as making telephone calls.[6] Furthermore, a jailbroken device can be reverted to a standard 'jailed' device by restoring the device in Recovery Mode, although any incompatible software installed while jailbroken will be deleted.
