By 2014, Slattery held the rank of Commander in the United States Navy and was the Executive Officer of the Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer USS Nathan James (DDG-151). That year, the Nathan James took on paleomicrobiologists Dr. Rachel Scott (Rhona Mitra) and Dr. Quincy Tophet (Sam Spruell) as the Nathan James conducted operations at the Arctic. However, their mission, unknown to even them, was just a cover for Drs. Scott and Tophet, who were actually collecting samples of a deadly virus that has infected 80 percent of the human population while they have been at sea, including his own son, Lucas.[2]
