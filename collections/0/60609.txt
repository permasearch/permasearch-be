In early 2000, both Roberson and Luckett were replaced with Williams and Farrah Franklin; however, Franklin quit after five months, leaving the group as a trio. Their third album, Survivor (2001), which contains themes the public interpreted as a channel to the group's experience, contains the worldwide hits "Independent Women", "Survivor" and "Bootylicious". In 2002, they announced a hiatus and re-united two years later for the release of their fourth and final studio album, Destiny Fulfilled (2004). Destiny's Child has sold more than sixty million records worldwide to date.[2] Billboard magazine ranks the group as one of the greatest musical trios of all time,[3] the ninth most successful artist/band of the 2000s,[4] placed the group 68th in its All-Time Hot 100 Artists list in 2008[5] and in December 2016, the magazine ranked them as the 90th most successful dance club artist of all-time.[6] The group was nominated for 14 Grammy Awards, winning twice for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and once for Best R&B Song.
