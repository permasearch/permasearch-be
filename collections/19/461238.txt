Because the versions gathered in fieldwork vary so much, there is no particular version of "On Top of Old Smokey" that can lay claim to being the "authentic" or "original" version. The version that Sharp and Karpeles collected from Memory Shelton can be read on line (see Sharp and Karpeles (1917), in References below), and the version by Pete Seeger that greatly popularized the song in modern times (see below) is also on line.[19]
