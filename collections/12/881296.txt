Oldman studied with the Young People's Theatre in Greenwich during the mid-1970s,[3][12] while working jobs on assembly lines, as a porter in an operating theatre, selling shoes and beheading pigs in an abattoir.[3] He later won a scholarship to attend the Rose Bruford College in Sidcup, Southeast London, from which he graduated with a BA in Acting in 1979.[3][12] Oldman describes himself as 'shy' although a diligent worker during his time at Rose Bruford, where he performed roles such as Puck in the performance of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. After leaving school, Oldman was the first in his class to receive professional work.[13] Oldman stated on The South Bank Show that it had nothing to do with being better than someone else, rather his diligence and application.[14]
