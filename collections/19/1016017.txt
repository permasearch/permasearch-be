In August 2013, Glynne signed a contract with Atlantic Records, consequently leaving her job at the time in brand management for a drinks company.[1] The same year, deep house producer Route 94 approached Glynne about rewriting and providing vocals for a song of his, called "My Love", which at the time contained a sample that he was prohibited from using.[2] It was released on DJ Annie Mac's compilation album Annie Mac Presents in October 2013 and led to Glynneâ€™s discovery by British electronic group Clean Bandit who approached her to feature on their song "Rather Be".[2] Released as a single in January 2014, "Rather Be" debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the third fastest-selling single and the most streamed song of 2014.[3] The track attained number-one and top-five positions on charts across Europe and Oceania, and was a top ten hit on the US Billboard Hot 100. In February 2014, Route 94's "My Love" was released as a single; it also debuted at number one in the UK.[4]
