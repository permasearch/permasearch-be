Daniel and Barbara believed that Schuler drove erratically due to a medical issue, such as a stroke.[24] According to Barbara, Schuler was obese for much of her life and suffered from diabetes, although additional sources cite Diane as only having had gestational diabetes, a temporary condition related to a prior pregnancy, rather than a chronic condition. Barbara has also mentioned an abscess that had persisted in her mouth for seven weeks before her death, and a lump in her leg, about which he said, "[It] might have been an embolism".[24] The results of an autopsy conducted by a Westchester County medical examiner one day after the accident found that Schuler had not suffered a stroke, aneurysm, or heart attack.[37]
