Reynolds and her daughter Carrie both made their Broadway debut in the play.[44] The production broke records for the highest weekly gross of any musical.[43] For that production, she received a Tony nomination. Reynolds also starred in a self-titled Broadway revue, Debbie, in 1976.[45] She toured with Harve Presnell in Annie Get Your Gun,[46] then wrapped up the Broadway run of Woman of the Year in 1983.[47] In the late 1980s Reynolds repeated her role as Molly Brown in the stage version of The Unsinkable Molly Brown, first opposite Presnell (repeating his original Broadway and movie role)[46] and later with Ron Raines.[48]
