Many muskets were produced locally by various gunsmiths in the colonies, often reusing parts from other weapons. These are known as "Committee of Safety" muskets, as they were funded by the fledgling local government. Because of the need to produce as many weapons as quick as possible, and also out of fear of prosecution by the British government, many of the muskets did not bear a maker's mark. Also, the muskets took a long reloading time so during bayonet charges the Americans were vulnerable to the British. Some were simply marked as property of a state, or "US," U:STATES," or "UNITED STATES." [2]
