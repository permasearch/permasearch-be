According to some, prior to the sixth century, the Church's teachings on morality were incoherent.[7] Catholic researchers such as Bernard Hoose and Mark Jordan have found that claims to a continuous teaching by the Church on matters of sexuality, life and death and crime and punishment are "simply not true". Not only was there "inconsistency, contradiction and even incoherence" in the Church's doctrines but the researchers' work has led them to conclude that "the tradition itself is not the truth guarantor of any particular teaching.".[8] However others disagree and argue differently.
