Despite Sony's early emphasis on Remote Play and original PlayStation game support, it was used very sparingly between the PS3 and PSP, with very few PS3 titles allowing for its use. The feature was even removed from several titles before their final release, most notably Gran Turismo HD and Formula One Championship Edition.[12] Most titles were small PlayStation Network-only titles. The late 2007 PS3 title Lair was notable for being one of the few original, physical Blu-Ray disc releases work between the PS3 and PSP.
