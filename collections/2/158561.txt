Sampson played a role in the controversial recruitment of star player Eric Gordon, who signed with Indiana after reneging on an early verbal commitment to the University of Illinois. Sampson was criticized by fellow coaches for failing to communicate with Illinois coach Bruce Weber about the recruitment,[7] and some observers said that Sampson's recruitment of the verbally-committed Gordon was unethical.[8]
