The Late Show with Stephen Colbert has garnered mostly positive reviews.[51] The Guardian's Brian Moylan praised the show's humor: "This opener was by no means a perfect show, but there were enough really inventive jokes to make Colbert already seem like an innovator."[52] Robert Lloyd of Los Angeles Times deemed it a "strong start,"[53] while Variety's Brian Lowry felt it a "mostly terrific" debut, commenting, "Colbert looks like he has the skill set to settle in and make this job his own, night in and night out."[54] Many critics considered the show's more political segments as reminiscent of The Colbert Report.[53][55] An early interview with Vice President Joe Biden also received praise: Robert Rorke of the New York Post commented that the review gave Biden "that essential sense of humanity that makes people believe in a candidate."[56]
