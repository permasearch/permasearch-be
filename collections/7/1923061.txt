Celine Dion covered "Alone" for her ninth English-language studio album Taking Chances (2007). It was released as the second single in Europe and North America, and third in the United Kingdom, while "Eyes on Me" was released as the second single in the United Kingdom instead. "Alone" was produced by Ben Moody, ex-member of Evanescence. The version received mixed reviews from music critics, who thought that the cover was too similar with the original, considering it a dull and carbon-copy version.
