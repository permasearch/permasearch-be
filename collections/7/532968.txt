In October 1928, before the lease had been finalized, Rockefeller started asking for recommendations for architects.[54] By the end of the year, Rockefeller hosted a "symposium" of architectural firms so he could solicit plans for the new complex. He invited seven firms, six of which specialized in Beaux-Arts architecture, and asked the noted Beaux-Arts architects John Russell Pope, Cass Gilbert, and Milton B. Medary to judge the proposals.[40][54][55][56] Rockefeller requested that all the plans be submitted by February 1929,[55][57] and the blueprints were presented in May of that year.[57][58] All of the proposals called for rentable space of 4 to 5 million square feet (0.37×10^6 to 0.46×10^6 m2), but these plans were so eccentric that the board rejected all of them.[41][59][60] For the time being, Morris was retained until a more suitable architect could be found.[61] However, by the end of 1928, Morris had been fired without pay.[62] He was eventually paid $50,000 for his contributions to the project, and many of his ideas were included in the final design.[63]
