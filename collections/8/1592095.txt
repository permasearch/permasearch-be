Paralysis occurs often in bearded dragons when they are fed food that is too big for them. Bearded dragons will try to eat worms or crickets that are too big for them, but this can be extremely harmful. Food should not be bigger than the space between their eyes. If a dragon eats food that is too big for them, there will be pressure put on their spinal cord during digestion. This pressure can lead to paralysis or death.[19]
