In a Preview Guide for winter anime of 2012, Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network gave High School DxD a joking rating of "boobs", writing "this is a fanservice show, one that yet again plays with the master/slave relationship, except this time the female character is the one in the "master" role [...] I have no clue where the story is going, but they really want you to think that all the bloody "death 'n demons" stuff is super edgy and totally dark, so I can't imagine this show not just wallowing in overwrought angsty nonsense when it isn't overanimating the breasts of every female character." He opined that the show's premise feels juvenile.[70] This sentiment was echoed by Rebecca Silverman, who found DxD to be "for the most part [...] just a romp through harem land" that fails to set itself apart from other harem shows of a similar genre.[71] Similarly, Carl Kimlinger complained that although DxD has "a pretty decent idea for a story", the anime "tries so hard to pander to our baser instincts [fanservice] that it basically smothers it." He labelled Issei as a "loathsome little creature" and found Rias to be uninteresting.[72]
