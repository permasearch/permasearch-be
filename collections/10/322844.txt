The chancel, according to Hall, contains "artistic work of a kind seldom seen anywhere".[71] The raised tiled floor of the chancel curves outward into the body of the church, and is approached by seven marble steps. The sanctuary is raised further, and enclosed by a marble altar rail behind which is an altar carved from white Carrara marble by L.M. Avenali. The altar supports a "simple unadorned brass cross that reflects the colors of the mosaics surrounding it."[77] The cross was made by William van Erp and was dedicated to the memory of Jane Stanford in 1948.
