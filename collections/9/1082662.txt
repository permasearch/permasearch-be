This half is an all-star season which features a return of fourteen of the strongest contestants from both the first and second generation cast.[3][13] This is the first season to feature characters from two different generations competing together. The theme for this season is "Heroes vs. Villains" which means the competitors were separated into teams based on their past performance; with protagonists or "Heroes" from each season having to face off against each season's antagonists or "Villains".[14] Both the season's first title, "All-Stars" and the "Heroes vs. Villains" theme take after respective seasons from Survivor.
