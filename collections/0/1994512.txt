Jon Carroll of the San Francisco Chronicle lauded the video's humor and Stoklasa's insights into filmmaking, despite the occasionally sophomoric tone of Mr. Plinkett.[24] Even without the Mr. Plinkett voice, the analysis and critique from Stoklasa was considered to be "plenty fascinating", but with it, the review becomes a "deep-dish analysis packaged like a gonzo stand-up comedy routine".[5] The review was considered to be "an epic, well-edited well-constructed piece of geek film criticism" by Peter Sciretta of /Film.[25] Damon Lindelof, in a Twitter message on the video, noted that "Your life is about to change. This is astounding film making."[26]
