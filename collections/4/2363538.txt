There is a musical version, premiered in Manchester (1963) before transferring to the London West End, entitled Pickwick, by Cyril Ornadel, Wolf Mankowitz, and Leslie Bricusse. It originally starred Harry Secombe (later cast as Mr Bumble in the film version of Oliver!). Although it was a major success in London, running for 694 performances, Pickwick failed in the United States when it opened on Broadway in 1965; in 1969 the BBC filmed the musical as the TV movie Pickwick. Both versions featured the song If I Ruled the World, which became a hit for Secombe, and other singers such as Tony Bennett and Sammy Davis Jr..
