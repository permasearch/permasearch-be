For 2009, the base Charger police car came with the 3.5L V6 and a 5-speed automatic transmission. The rear is slightly updated, moving the "CHARGER" badge to the right, and replacing the left with the badge reading "DODGE." The V8 version uses the Charger Daytona R/T engine, rated 370 horsepower (280 kW) and 395 lb·ft (536 N·m) of torque.
