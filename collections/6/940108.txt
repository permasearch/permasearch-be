Bracegirdle describes his music as being strongly influenced by the relaxed, summer atmosphere of Ibiza, where he was taken on holidays as a child.[31] In an interview in 2012, Bracegirdle stated that he does not draw inspiration from dance music; but from film soundtracks and musicians like Brian Eno and Trevor Horn.[32] He wrote "I have a lot of time for producers like myself, BT, Eric Prydz, but as I said, they are not really an influence upon me. It's artists such as Vangelis that inspired me many years back".[32]
