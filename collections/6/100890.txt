Vettori was able to get Sourav Ganguly (22) to hit an easy catch to Darren Gough at mid-off, while Yousuf Youhana fell for just 4 as Ponting took another catch off Warne's bowling. The partnership between Rahul Dravid (71 not out) and keeper-batsman Kumar Sangakkara (24) was seen as potentially a ray of hope, as both men were capable of remaining calm and playing shots, however Sangakkara edged a Gough delivery to Gilchrist. Pakistani all-rounder Abdul Razzaq (11) began promisingly, but became another victim of the desire to raise the scoring rate, being stumped by Gilchrist off Vettori.
