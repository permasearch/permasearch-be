Both medications and neurorehabilitation have been shown to improve some symptoms, though neither changes the course of the disease.[95] Some symptoms have a good response to medication, such as an unstable bladder and spasticity, while others are little changed.[5] For neurologic problems, a multidisciplinary approach is important for improving quality of life; however, it is difficult to specify a 'core team' as many health services may be needed at different points in time.[5] Multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs increase activity and participation of people with MS but do not influence impairment level.[96] There is limited evidence for the overall efficacy of individual therapeutic disciplines,[97][98] though there is good evidence that specific approaches, such as exercise,[99][100] and psychology therapies, in particular cognitive behavioral approaches are effective.[101]
