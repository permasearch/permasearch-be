The Hiptop/T-Mobile Sidekick's importance to the Deaf was further solidified in March 2003 when it became the first cellular phone capable of placing unassisted TTY and Relay Operator calls (see Telecommunications Relay Service) through the phone's web browser[23] using a system developed by Jon B. Sharpe at Lormar Logic Company. Lormar Logic enhanced the TTY/Relay Operator system in August 2003 by developing a means for the deaf to place calls through AOL Instant Messenger.[24]
