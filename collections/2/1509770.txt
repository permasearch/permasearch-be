Within the North Indian Ocean between 45°E – 100°E, tropical cyclones are named by the India Meteorological Department (IMD/RSMC New Delhi) when they are judged to have intensified into a cyclonic storm with 3-minute sustained wind speeds of at least 34 kn (39 mph; 63 km/h).[17] There are eight lists of names which are used in sequence and are not rotated every few years; however, the names of significant tropical cyclones are retired.[18]
