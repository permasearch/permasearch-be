In late March 2008, it was announced that Hughes would make a return to General Hospital.[13] Hughes reappeared on April 25, 2008 and concluded her return stint on May 7, 2008.[2] Days later, it was announced that Hughes would soon join the cast of The Young and the Restless and was slated to begin airing on June 19, 2008.[14] At the time, Hughes was not contractually obligated to ABC, so accepted the four episode guest stint.[15] However, Michael Logan of TV Guide later reported that ABC pressured Hughes into dropping out of the role in favor of a "big" storyline for the summer on GH. Hughes who was scheduled to start taping on May 28, was never actually replaced and her character was never introduced onscreen.[16] On December 11, 2011, TV Guide confirmed that Hughes would return to General Hospital starting in mid January and would reappear just in time for February Sweeps.[17][18] Hughes first airdate was slated for the week of February 13, 2012.[19] On April 6, 2012, executive producer, Frank Valentini announced on Twitter that Hughes had been placed on contract with the series.[20]
