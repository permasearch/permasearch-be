Technology makes it possible for human resources professionals to train new staff members in a more efficient manner. This gives employees the ability to access onboarding and training programs from anywhere. This eliminates the need for trainers to meet with new hires face to face when completing necessary paperwork to start. Training in virtual classrooms makes it possible for the HR professionals to train a large number of employees quickly and to assess their progress through computerized testing programs.[30] Some employers even incorporate an instructor with virtual training so that new hires are receiving the most vital training. Employees can take control of their own learning and development by engaging in training at a time and place of their choosing, helping them manage their work-life balance. Managers are able to track the training through the internet as well, which helps to reduce redundancy in training and training costs. Skype, virtual chat rooms , and interactive training sites are all resources that enable a more technological approach to training to enhance the experience for the new hire.
