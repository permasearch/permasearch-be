On 7 April 2009, Waylett and a friend were pulled over by police. The officers then searched their vehicle, finding a knife and eight bags of cannabis.[7] Other images on the camera led police to Waylett's mother's house, where additional cannabis plants were discovered being grown. Waylett was charged a month later for possession of the drug.[8] He appeared in court on 16 July and pleaded guilty to growing the plants in his mother's home, but claimed that they were for his personal use and not for distribution.[9] On 21 July, he was sentenced to 120 hours of community service.[10][11][12] He had previously been accused of using cocaine in October 2006.[13][14]
