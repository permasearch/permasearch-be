Modern Family employs an ensemble cast. The series focuses on Jay Pritchett (Ed O'Neill), his daughter Claire Dunphy (Julie Bowen), and his son Mitchell Pritchett (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) who live in Los Angeles. Claire is a homemaker mom married to Phil Dunphy (Ty Burrell); they have three children, Haley (Sarah Hyland), the typical teenager,[13] Alex (Ariel Winter), the smart middle child,[14] and Luke (Nolan Gould), the offbeat only son.[15] Jay is married to a much younger Colombian woman, Gloria (Sof√≠a Vergara), and is helping her raise her pre-teen son, Manny (Rico Rodriguez). Mitchell and his partner Cameron Tucker (Eric Stonestreet) have adopted a Vietnamese baby, Lily (twins Ella Hiller and Jaden Hiller). Ed O'Neill, who is probably the best known actor of the series initially had lost the part to Craig T. Nelson although he was eventually cast after Nelson turned down the part due to money problems.[16] It was also difficult for Julie Bowen as she was pregnant with twins while filming the pilot episode.[17] Eric Stonestreet had to try harder for the part of Cameron Tucker, due to him being an unknown actor at the time.[17] Jesse Tyler Ferguson initially auditioned for the role of Cameron, but the producers thought he was better suited for Mitchell.[17]
