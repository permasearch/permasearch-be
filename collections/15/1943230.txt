As most of the customers tried to hide beneath tables and service booths, Huberty turned his attention toward six women and children huddled together.[12] He first shot and killed 19-year-old María Colmenero-Silva with a single gunshot to the chest, then fatally shot 9-year-old Claudia Perez[1] in the stomach, cheek, thigh, hip, leg, chest, back, armpit, and head with his Uzi. He then wounded Perez's 15-year-old sister Imelda once in the chest[13] with the same weapon, and fired upon 11-year-old Aurora Peña with the shotgun. Peña—initially wounded in the leg—had been shielded by her pregnant aunt, 18-year-old Jackie Reyes. Huberty shot Reyes 48 times with the Uzi.[14] Beside his mother's body, 8-month-old Carlos Reyes sat up and wailed, whereupon Huberty shouted and killed the infant with a single pistol shot to the center of the back.
