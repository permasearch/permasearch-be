In Game 3, Washington got the start they wanted, as Ovechkin opened the scoring for the Caps. Fellow Russians Evgeni Malkin and Ruslan Fedotenko scored in the second and third period, respectively, to give the Pens a 2–1 lead in the game. With 1:23 left in regulation, Nicklas Backstrom tied the game for Washington. The Caps were unable to build off of his goal in overtime, as Penguins' defenceman Kris Letang's shot deflected off Capitals' defenceman Shaone Morrisonn past goalie Semyon Varlamov and into the net to give Pittsburgh a 3–2 overtime win and cut Washington's series lead in half.[17] In Game 4, Washington scored first once more (from Nick Backstrom assisted by Alex Semin), but just like the previous game, Pittsburgh took the lead, this time from a power play goal by Sergei Gonchar and even-strength goals from Bill Guerin and Ruslan Fedotenko. Winger Chris Clark scored in the second period for Washington to make it 3–2. The Caps and Pens traded goals until the end of the game for a 5–3 final score in favor of Pittsburgh. The series was tied 2–2 heading back to the Verizon Center.[18]
