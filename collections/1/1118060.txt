The cover art of the single was designed by the Japanese artist Takashi Murakami. Though "Can't Tell Me Nothing" didn't impact pop radio as significantly as the album's subsequent singles, West took pride in the fact that he had attained his very first street anthem with the song.[5][6] The song is featured as the sixth track on Now That's What I Call Music! 26. It was nominated for "Track of the Year" at the 2007 BET Hip Hop Awards. It was also featured in the movie The Hangover.
