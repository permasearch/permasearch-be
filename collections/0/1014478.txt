The five program component scores are skating skills, transitions, performance, composition, and interpretation. Each mark has individual characteristics to be evaluated and they are scored from 0.25 to 10.00 in quarter-point increments. This scale from zero to ten is an absolute scale, so if 6.00 is considered "above average" then each judgeâ€™s understanding of a 6.00 should remain the same throughout an event and their judging careers.
