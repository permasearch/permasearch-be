The actual shift points are determined by the DSG's transmission ECU, which commands a hydro-mechanical unit.[2] The transmission ECU, combined with the hydro-mechanical unit, are collectively called a mechatronics[2] unit or module. Because the DSG's ECU uses fuzzy logic, the operation of the DSG is said to be adaptive;[dubious â€“ discuss] that is, the DSG will "learn" how the user drives the car, and will progressively tailor the shift points accordingly to suit the habits of the driver.[citation needed]
