The automatic identification system (AIS) is an automatic tracking system used on ships and by vessel traffic services (VTS).  When satellites are used to detect AIS signatures, the term Satellite-AIS (S-AIS) is used.  AIS information supplements marine radar, which continues to be the primary method of collision avoidance for water transport.[citation needed]
