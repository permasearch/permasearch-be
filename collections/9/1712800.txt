Hardball, however, deeply hurt and shamed by the compromises Woodman forced him to endure, and Komodo's attempt to bail him out of Hydra by telling his secrets to his field leader Gravity, mercilessly kills Congressman Woodman in front of his subordinates. His ersatz coup d'Ã©tat pays off, and Hardball is appointed as the new Supreme Leader of the organization, severing every tie with his former life.[17] His joining Hydra, however, was revealed to be caused simply by his having nowhere else to go. He surrenders to the Shadow Initiative, and is sent to the Negative Zone prison, destroying his Hydra cell.[18]
