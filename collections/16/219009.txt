Infected insect cells[17] (Sf9, Sf21, High Five strains) or mammalian cells[18] (HeLa, HEK 293) allow production of glycosylated or membrane proteins that cannot be expressed using yeast or prokaryotic cells (E. coli).[19] It is useful for production of proteins in high quantity. Genes are not expressed continuously because infected host cells eventually lyse and die during each infection cycle.[20]
