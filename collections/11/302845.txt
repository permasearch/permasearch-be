"The Boy Is Mine" was a song Brandy wrote with Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins, his brother Fred Jerkins III, Japhe Tejeda, and LaShawn Daniels. The singer came up with its concept while watching an episode of The Jerry Springer Show tabloid talk show, where love triangles among the guests was the theme.[5] Created as a solo track, Brandy originally recorded the song alone.[6] After listening to the result, however, she and Jerkins thought it would work better as a duet,[7] an idea which was further inspired by Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson's 1982 hit duet "The Girl Is Mine".[8] At Brandy's request, her label Atlantic Records approached fellow R&B teen singer Monica to collaborate:[9] The pair had seen each other in passing at award shows and other live events, and Brandy thought a duet would help combat ongoing rumors that the singers were rivals.[7] With the permission of Clive Davis, who headed Monica's record company Arista Records, Monica eventually signed on to the project.[9]
