However, further work with long tide gauges records[13] revealed that sea level acceleration may have started earlier, over 200 years ago. They reconstructed global mean sea level since 1700 from tide gauge records and concluded that sea-level acceleration up to the present has been about 0.01 mm yr−2; and began at the end of the 18th century. Sea level rose by 6 cm during the 19th century and 19 cm in the 20th century. They also discovered quasi-periodic fluctuations with a period of about 60 yr superimposed on the long-term history. On the basis of this analysis, they conclude that if the conditions that established the acceleration continue, then sea level will rise 34 cm over the 21st century.
