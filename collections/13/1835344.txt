Most of the episodes were written by the French writers Jean Chalopin and Haskell Barkin. Writers at DIC also included Larry DiTillio, Barbara Hambly and J. Michael Straczynski. Straczynski wrote about a quarter of the episodes attempting, in his words, to "hijack a dopey concept and make it into something more".[3] Haim Saban and Shuki Levy provided the music for the show.[4]
