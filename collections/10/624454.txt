The majority of the caves are vihara halls with symmetrical square plans. To each vihara hall are attached smaller square dormitory cells cut into the walls.[82] A vast majority of the caves were carved in the second period, wherein a shrine or sanctuary is appended at the rear of the cave, centred on a large statue of the Buddha, along with exuberantly detailed[clarification needed] reliefs and deities near him as well as on the pillars and walls, all carved out of the natural rock.[83] This change reflects the shift from Hinayana to Mahāyāna Buddhism. These caves are often called monasteries.
