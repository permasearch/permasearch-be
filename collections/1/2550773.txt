As Ultimate Spidermonkey, he is a bulky purple gorilla-like being with four sharp spider legs sprouting from his back, and he had lost his tail and his extra arms. In this state, Ultimate Spidermonkey is stronger and can spit stronger webs from his mouth in a larger amount, which are waterproof. He was first seen in the pilot episode of Ben 10 Ultimate Alien, to fight Bivalvan, being the first ultimate form of Ben 10: Ultimate Alien. In "For a Few Brains More", Albedo uses another form of Ultimate Spidermonkey that has six arms, six eyes, darker fur/skin and spikes on his chin.
