The workhouse was not just a custodial institution. At least some of its proponents hoped that the experience of incarceration would rehabilitate workhouse residents through hard labor.[7] Supporters expressed the belief that forced abstinence from "idleness" would make vagrants into productive citizens.[7] Other supporters argued that the threat of the workhouse would deter vagrancy, and that inmate labor could provide a means of support for the workhouse itself.[7] Governance of these institutions was controlled by written regulations promulgated by local authorities, and local justices of the peace monitored compliance.[8]
