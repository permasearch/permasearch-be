The population has also been shaped by international migration. After World WarÂ II and the division of the Korean Peninsula, about four million people from North Korea crossed the border to South Korea. This trend of net entry reversed over the next 40 years because of emigration, especially to the United States and Canada. South Korea's total population in 1955 was 21.5 million,[168] and has more than doubled, to 50 million, by 2010.[169]
