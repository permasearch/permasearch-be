13 Healey Road is owned by the Morgan family,[15] who move in during May 2016. Tori Morgan (Penny McNamee) is the first to arrive, and is followed by her three brothers, Justin (James Stewart), Brody (Jackson Heywood) and Mason Morgan (Orpheus Pledger) follow in June. In November, their half-sister, Raffy Morrison (Olivia Deeble) moves in with them, after her cousin, Hope Morrison (Jessica Falkholt), is sent to prison. Justin's fiancÃ©e Phoebe Nicholson (Isabella Giovinazzo) moves in 2017, but moves out that same year to tour the United States. Justin throws Brody out of the house after he learns Brody has been lying to him about his drug addiction. Later on as part of Brody being out on Bail he moves back home. Raffy moves out when Brody's drug addiction got worse and she moves in with John Palmer (Shane Withington) and Marilyn Chambers (Emily Symons). Raffy moves back in with the Morgan's when Justin asks her to.
