In 1964, Howard McNear suffered a massive stroke that left him with limited mobility in his arms and legs. He was also unable to stand for long periods of time.[2] After returning to the series a year and a half later, Floyd is only seen sitting or apparently standing behind the barber's chair. Scenes with Floyd standing were accomplished with the use of a special brace that was hidden from view behind the barber's chair.
