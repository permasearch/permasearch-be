Critical response to Kyra was largely positive, with SpoilerTV's Gavin Hetherington calling Kyra a "great highlight of the season".[20] Moviepilot's John Collins wrote that Carpenter was one of his favorite guest stars to appear on the series.[21] The character was described as a "tasty demon seer" by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer,[22] and identified as the most memorable incarnation of the Seer by entertainment news website Hypable's Karen Rought.[2] Rought wrote that the role suited Carpenter due to her previous performance as Chase.[2] Charmed Magazine's Tara Dilullo agreed and determined that Carpenter was the perfect actress to play Kyra as she "spent the better part of her career facing down the supernatural with a snark and a smile".[4] Carpenter's appearance on Charmed was cited by reader Patrick Kelly, in an article from Today, as an indicator of her popularity among the 16- to 39-year-old male demographic.[23]
