Erin (Mary Elizabeth McDonough), the fourth-born and second daughter of Olivia Walton (nÃ©e Daly) and John Walton Sr. In the early episodes, it is unclear which is older: Ben or Erin. But in season 5's "The Career Child" it is finally revealed that Erin is slightly older (most likely 1- 1 1/2 years older than Ben). In this episode, John makes a comment about how fast his children are graduating from high school. It is Erin's graduation day and Ben pipes up that he's the next one in line. Erin is very close to her older sister Mary Ellen, though they often fight. Erin is considered the pretty one in the family, not the scholar, and she falls in love many times throughout her teenage years. In the season five episode "The Elopement," set in 1937, her age is given as 16, indicating she was born in 1921 (or late 1920). She works as a telephone operator early in season five while she is finishing high school. She struggles to find her place, as she is not as musical as Jason, not a scholar like John-Boy, and not interested in medicine like Mary Ellen. She takes a part-time job at a business college to buy a typewriter for John-Boy when the owner sees her answering and assisting callers at the unattended front desk.  She is allowed to work her way through the business school and later becomes the Executive Secretary to a loudmouthed businessman; during the war she is the plant's executive manager. Almost all of her romances are ill-fated; the boy either dies or proves to have poor character. Eventually she meets and marries Paul Northridge and they have three children: Susan, Amanda, and Peter. It is later revealed (in the fourth of the six post-series reunion movies) that they are divorced as Paul had become unfaithful. Erin has earned a teaching certificate, and by the final reunion movie she is a school principal.
