In 2015, the International Energy Agency reported that the Fukushima accident had a strongly negative effect on nuclear power, yet “the prospects for nuclear energy remain positive in the medium to long term despite a negative impact in some countries in the aftermath of the accident.” The IEA noted that at the start of 2014, there were 72 nuclear reactors under construction worldwide, the largest number in 25 years, and that China planned to increase nuclear power capacity from 17 gigawatts (GW) in 2014, to 58 GW in 2020.[137]
