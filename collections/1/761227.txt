The Caribs had a tradition of keeping bones of their ancestors in their houses. Missionaries, such as PÃ¨re Jean Baptiste Labat and Cesar de Rochefort, described the practice as part of a belief that the ancestral spirits would always look after the bones and protect their descendants. The Caribs have been described as vicious and violent people in the history of the people who battled against other tribes.
