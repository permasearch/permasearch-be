During the 2000â€“01 season, McGrady defied the expectations of many,[17] emerging as one of the best players in the NBA, with Milwaukee Bucks General Manager Ernie Grunfeld going so far as to call him "one of the top five talents in the league".[13] McGrady's play earned him his first All-Star Game appearance and, behind averages of 26.8 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 4.6 assists per game, he was selected to his first All-NBA Team, being named to the All-NBA Second Team.[1] He was also voted the league's Most Improved Player.[14] With a 43-39 record, the Magic entered the playoffs as the East's seventh seed, drawing a matchup with the Bucks.[18] In Game 3 of the series, McGrady notched 42 points, 10 rebounds, and 8 assists in a performance that Bill Simmons later called McGrady's "superstar audition tape".[17] Orlando was eventually eliminated by Milwaukee in four games.[19]
