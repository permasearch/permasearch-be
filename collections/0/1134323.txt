Liane Bonin Starr from HitFix gave a good review to the episode and saying that the end was shocking and the season finale will be explosive. Starr also praises Trevino's portrayal as Julian: "It's still a little unnerving to see Caroline talking to Julian when he's inhabiting Tyler's body. Kudos to Michael Trevino for making Julian distinct as a character, and making his reaction to Maria's death — yanking out Stefan's heart — both wrenching and utterly believable."[7]
