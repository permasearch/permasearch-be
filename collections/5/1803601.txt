The album's title, like that of Rubber Soul, is a pun,[67] referring to both a kind of handgun and the "revolving" motion of a record as it plays on a turntable.[273] Gould views the title as a "McLuhanesque pun", since, more so than on their previous albums, the focus of Revolver appears to rotate from one Beatle to another with each song.[251][nb 19]
