The Inter-Cities Fairs Cup was established on 18 April 1955, two weeks after the European Cup, to promote trade fairs by playing various cities against each other. From 1958 onwards, the organisers reverted to club participation, but the teams still had to come from cities staging trade fairs. Real Madrid never participated in Fairs Cup before it was subsumed into the UEFA Cup in 1971.[52]
