"How Am I Supposed to Live Without You" was supposed to be recorded by the duo Air Supply. But when Arista President Clive Davis asked for permission to change the lyrics of the chorus, Bolton refused, and Davis released the song.[1] Subsequently Laura Branigan recorded it as written, and it became the first major hit for the two songwriters. The song was also performed by actress Lisa Hartman on the soap opera Knots Landing.[citation needed] Bolton's own rendition became a worldwide hit in early 1990.
