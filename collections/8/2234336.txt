On June 15, 1977, the Rangers purchased Ellis from the Oakland Athletics. Ellis had a resurgent second half of the 1977 season,[89] going 10â€“6 with a 2.90 ERA.[4] Ellis complained about manager Billy Hunter's liquor policy in 1978.[90] Hunter, responding to a raucous team flight, banned liquor on team flights; Ellis vowed that he would bring liquor on the plane to Toronto anyway.[91] Ellis led a player insurrection against manager Billy Hunter's authoritarian style, declaring that Hunter "may be Hitler, but he ain't making no lampshade out of me."[92] The Rangers organization blamed Ellis for the team's disappointing finish in 1978 and indicated that they would look to trade Ellis.[93] However, owner Brad Corbett sided with Ellis over Hunter, firing Hunter after the season.[94]
