On October 17, 2010, Kanye West revealed through Twitter that My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy had been rejected by certain stores because of the cover art.[113][114] The artwork, by George Condo, shows West being straddled by an armless winged female (a phoenix).[115] Both are nude, and one nipple of the phoenix's breasts and her buttocks are visible. Condo said that Kanye wanted a cover image that would be banned.[116] The painting is centered with a thin yellow border on a red background. The artwork follows along the apparent theme of the album, as well as West's music film Runaway.[117] This is one of five covers; all of them were included with its purchase.[115] A second cover, with a painting of a ballerina by Condo, was posted on the Amazon.com pre-order page.[118] It was intended to be the original artwork for Runaway, but West used a photograph of a ballerina instead.[118]
