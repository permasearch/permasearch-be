In Group 14 elements (the carbon group), lone pairs can manifest themselves by shortening or lengthening single (bond order 1) bond lengths,[18] as well as in the effective order of triple bonds as well.[19][20] The familiar alkynes have a carbon-carbon triple bond (bond order 3) and a linear geometry of 180Â° bond angles (figure A in reference [21]). However, further down in the group (silicon, germanium, and tin), formal triple bonds have an effective bond order 2 with one lone pair (figure B[21]) and trans-bent geometries. In lead, the effective bond order is reduced even further to a single bond, with two lone pairs for each lead atom (figure C[21]). In the organogermanium compound (Scheme 1 in the reference), the effective bond order is also 1, with complexation of the acidic isonitrile (or isocyanide) C-N groups, based on interaction with germanium's empty 4p orbital.[21][22]
