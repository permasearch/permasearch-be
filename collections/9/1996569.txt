The new project began to develop under the working title of "Steelemore" as a collaboration between Steele and Littlemore,[23] with Pnau partner Peter Mayes listed as a producer and occasional co-writer.[27] As Steele was living in Perth and Littlemore was in Sydney the two spent time writing songs separately while meeting occasionally in Sydney to decide on the musical direction and style.[20] When they had accumulated enough material Mayes and duo began to record the album throughout 2007 with the assistance of Jonathan Sloan.[6][28]
