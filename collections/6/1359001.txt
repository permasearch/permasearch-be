In microeconomics, neoclassical economics represents incentives and costs as playing a pervasive role in shaping decision making. An immediate example of this is the consumer theory of individual demand, which isolates how prices (as costs) and income affect quantity demanded.[41] In macroeconomics it is reflected in an early and lasting neoclassical synthesis with Keynesian macroeconomics.[69][134]
