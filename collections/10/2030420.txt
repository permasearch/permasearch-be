Interior trims differed on each bodystyle for which the 4-4-2 option was offered, much like the early 1964â€“66 models. For the base Cutlass hardtop coupe, a baseline two-spoke steering wheel, and vinyl or cloth/vinyl bench seat was standard along with rubber floor mats (carpeting was optional); Cutlass S sport coupe and Holiday hardtop coupe featured full carpeting, deluxe steering wheel, courtesy lighting, and bench seats with cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl upholstery or optional Strato bucket seats; and the Cutlass Supreme convertible came with more woodgrain interior accents than the "S" along with an all-vinyl notchback bench seat with armrest or no-cost Strato bucket seats, between which a center console was an extra-cost option. An AM/FM stereo radio with a tape player was $363.[4]
