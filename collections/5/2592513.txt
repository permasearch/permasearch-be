One likely candidate for the original purpose of torsion is defence against predators in adult gastropods. By moving the mantle cavity over the head, the gastropod can retract its vulnerable head into its shell. Some gastropods close the entrance to their shell with a tough operculum which is attached to the dorsal surface of their foot. In evolutionary terms the appearance of an operculum occurred shortly after that of torsion, a possible link with the role of torsion, though there is not sufficient evidence either for or against this hypothesis. The English zoologist Walter Garstang wrote a famous poem in 1928, The Ballad of the Veliger, in which he argues with gentle humour in favour of the defence theory, including the lines[1]
