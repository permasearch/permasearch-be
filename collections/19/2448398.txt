By the summer of 1906, a machine producing 50 kilohertz was installed at the Brant Rock station, and in the fall of 1906, what was called an electric alternating dynamo was working regularly at 75 kilohertz, with an output of 0.5 kW.[30] Fessenden[145] used this for wireless telephoning to Plymouth, Massachusetts, a distance of approximately 11 miles (18 km).[30] In the following year machines were constructed having a frequency of 96 kilohertz[146] and outputs of 1 kW and 2 kW. Fessenden believed that the damped wave-coherer system was essentially and fundamentally incapable of development into a practical system.[30] He would employ a two-phase high frequency alternator method[147] and the continuous production of waves[148] with changing constants of sending circuit.[30][149] Fessenden would also use duplex and multiplex commutator methods.[150] On December 11, 1906, operation of the wireless transmission in conjunction with the wire lines took place.[151][30] In July 1907 the range was considerably extended and speech was successfully transmitted between Brant Rock and Jamaica, on Long Island, a distance of nearly 200 miles (320 km), in daylight and mostly over land,[152] the mast at Jamaica being approximately 180 feet (55 m) high.[30]
