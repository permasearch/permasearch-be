Due to their mouth shape hedgehogs should not be fed any nuts; as they prove to be a choking hazard. Nut butters are acceptable but are very high in fat so they should probably be avoided. Hedgehogs should never be fed avocados[dubious â€“ discuss], onions, grapes or raisins, chocolate, any raw meat or egg yolks, or any canned or processed food.
