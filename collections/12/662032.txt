Oliver injects humor into his presentation, including satirical analogies, and allusions to popular culture and celebrities. The show includes a panel in the upper-left corner that frequently displays a photo or graphic for that accompanies subject at hand, which aids in the humor. A full-screen graphic will show and play a video clip (such as a news show or documentary's excerpt) when Oliver is citing it.[13] He often coins a hashtag for use in social media related to his segment, some of which go viral.[14]
