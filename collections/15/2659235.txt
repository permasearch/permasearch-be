A fascinator is a headpiece, a style of millinery. Fascinators were originally a form of lightweight knitted head-covering. Since the 1990s the term refers to a type of formal headwear worn as an alternative to the hat; it is usually a large decorative design attached to a band or clip, sometimes incorporating a base to resemble a hat, in which case it may be called a hatinator.
