A fully qualified domain name (FQDN), sometimes also referred to as an absolute domain name,[1] is a domain name that specifies its exact location in the tree hierarchy of the Domain Name System (DNS). It specifies all domain levels, including at least a second-level domain and a top-level domain.[2] A fully qualified domain name is distinguished by its lack of ambiguity: it can be interpreted only in one way.
