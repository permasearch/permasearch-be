The Dodgers returned home on May 8 for a series against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Alex Wood struck out 11 batters in five innings. This was a Dodger record for most strikeouts in a start of five or fewer innings, breaking the mark previously held by Sandy Koufax (1961) and Vicente Padilla (2009).[59] Chris Taylor hit a grand slam in the first inning and the Dodgers cruised to a 12–1 win.[60] Julio Urías took a no-hitter into the 7th in the next game, but was broken up by the Pirates, who scored two runs in the 7th to tie the game and John Jaso hitting the go-ahead home run an inning later to lead 3-2. At the bottom of the 9th inning, Cody Bellinger drove in Corey Seager with a game-tying single, sending the game in extras and Austin Barnes drove in pinch runner Ross Stripling with a walk-off double in the 10th for a 4–3 Dodgers win.[61] Bellinger homered again in the next game and Maeda allowed two runs in 8  1⁄3 innings as the Dodgers finished off the series sweep with a 5–2 win.[62]
