The goodness of God means that "God is the final standard of good, and all that God is and does is worthy of approval."[9] Romans 11:22 in the King James Version says "Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God". Many theologians consider the goodness of God as an overarching attribute - Louis Berkhof, for example, sees it as including kindness, love, grace, mercy and longsuffering.[10] The idea that God is "all good" is called his omnibenevolence.
