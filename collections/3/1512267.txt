The Mexican League was founded in 1925 by sportswriter Alejandro Aguilar Reyes and former baseball player Ernesto Carmona.[7] The league included six teams (74 Regimiento, México, Agrario, Nacional, Guanajuato and Águila). Puebla's 74 Regimiento won the initial league championship. Since then, the league has expanded to 16 teams, divided equally into a north and a south zone, the champions of which meet to contest a best-of-seven game playoff series. The season begins in mid-March with the playoffs running through mid-August.
