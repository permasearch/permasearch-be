Blunt's debut single in the UK was "High" (co-written with Ricky Ross of Deacon Blue). This song initially peaked below the Top 100 of the UK Singles Chart, however after the subsequent success of "You're Beautiful" it finally made the Top 75 before being re-released.[37] The song was chosen to appear in a Vodafone commercial in Italy, and was a Top 10 hit in that country.[33]
