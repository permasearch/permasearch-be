The transition from synthesizers to more guitar-oriented and organic instrumentation continued with Counterparts (1993)[42] and its follow-up, Test for Echo (1996), again both produced in collaboration with Peter Collins. Musically, Counterparts[42] and Test For Echo are two of Rush's most guitar-driven albums. The latter album also includes elements of jazz and swing drumming by Peart, which he had learned from Freddie Gruber during the interim between Counterparts and Test For Echo.[43] In October 1996, in support of Test For Echo, the band embarked on a North American tour, the band's first without an opening act and dubbed "An Evening with Rush". The tour was broken up into two segments spanning October through December 1996 and May through July 1997.
