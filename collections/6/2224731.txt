Typically in the United States, vintage clothing shops can be found clustered in college towns and artsy neighborhoods of cities.  Sizing is a major factor â€“ in most locations in the United States, the majority of the population would be unable to find vintage clothing that fits.  In contrast to thrift stores that sell both vintage and contemporary used clothing, vintage clothing shops are usually for-profit enterprises, with the market mixed between small chains and independent stores.  These stores typically range from 200 to 5,000 square feet in size, and will usually have a fitting room.  In addition to selling clothing and accessories, many vintage clothing stores also buy clothing from the public in exchange for cash or store credit.
