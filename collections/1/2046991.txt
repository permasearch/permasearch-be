Gluttony (グラト二ー, Guratonī), the Voracious, typically appears in the company of Lust. He is an obese, simple-minded homunculus whose thoughts rarely stray far from eating. He has powerful jaws and acidic saliva and can and will eat almost anything. He particularly likes eating people, and the only way he can find enjoyment in a battle is if he can eat his opponent afterward.[ch. 2]
