After starting 2014 with an embarrassing 28–17 loss to San Francisco, Dallas went on a roll, winning their next 6 games. It was their longest winning streak since 2007. The highlight of this streak was defeating the defending Super Bowl XLVIII Champion Seahawks 30–23 in Seattle. The Seahawks' loss in that game was only their 2nd home loss in the past three seasons. The streak was ended by their division rival Redskins in overtime 20–17. However, Romo once again injured his back. He was out the next game against Arizona where backup Brandon Weeden started. The Cardinals won 28–17. Romo returned in Week 10 as Dallas played in London, England for the first time ever against Jacksonville in NFL International Series. The Cowboys beat the Jaguars 31–17. Dallas entered their annual Thanksgiving home game with an 8–3, identical with their opponents the Eagles. Philadelphia got off to a fast start and Dallas was never able to catch up. The Eagles won 33–10. They would rebound the next week over the Bears in Chicago 41–28 for win number 9 to clinch their first winning season since 2009.
