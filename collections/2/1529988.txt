A balcony roundabout is just an elevated roundabout. They are constructed in such a way that vulnerable road users can go underneath the roundabout and choose the direction they want to go. Footpaths and cycle paths along the different roads connect to the square under the roundabout. Vulnerable road users do not interfere with other traffic on the roundabout, making them much safer for them.
