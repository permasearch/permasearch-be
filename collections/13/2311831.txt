The ancient Maya domesticated a separate species of stingless bee. The use of stingless bees is referred to as meliponiculture, named after bees of the tribe Meliponiniâ€”such as Melipona quadrifasciata in Brazil. This variation of bee keeping  still occurs around the world today.[14] For instance, in Australia, the stingless bee Tetragonula carbonaria is kept for production of their honey.[15]
