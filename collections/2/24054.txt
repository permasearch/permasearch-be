Germany had been de facto divided, and two independent states, the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic[298] were created within the borders of Allied and Soviet occupation zones, accordingly. The rest of Europe was also divided into Western and Soviet spheres of influence.[299] Most eastern and central European countries fell into the Soviet sphere, which led to establishment of Communist-led regimes, with full or partial support of the Soviet occupation authorities. As a result, East Germany,[300] Poland, Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Albania[301] became Soviet satellite states. Communist Yugoslavia conducted a fully independent policy, causing tension with the USSR.[302]
