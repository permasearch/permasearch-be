In a 1993 review, the EPA, considered glyphosate to be noncarcinogenic and relatively low in dermal and  oral acute toxicity.[50]  The EPA considered a "worst case" dietary risk model of an individual eating a lifetime of food derived entirely from glyphosate-sprayed fields with residues at their maximum levels. This model indicated that no adverse health effects would be expected under such conditions.[50] In 2015, the EPA initiated a review of glyphosate's toxicity and in 2016 reported that glyphosate is likely not carcinogenic.[9][135]
