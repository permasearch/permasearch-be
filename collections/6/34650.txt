Along the Pacific Coast of Mexico and South America, tsunami surges were reported, but in most places caused little or no damage.[186] Peru reported a wave of 1.5 m (5 ft) and more than 300 homes damaged.[186] The surge in Chile was large enough to damage more than 200 houses,[187] with waves of up to 3 m (9.8 ft).[188][189] In the Galápagos Islands, 260 families received assistance following a 3-metre (9.8 ft) surge which arrived 20 hours after the earthquake, after the tsunami warning had been lifted.[190][191] There was a great deal of damage to buildings on the islands and one man was injured but there were no reported fatalities.[190][192]
