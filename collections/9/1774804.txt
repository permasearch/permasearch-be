The strike lasted four days. Non-union truck drivers joined the first day; the movie theaters and night clubs closed down. While food deliveries continued with the permission of the strike committee, many small businesses closed, posting signs in support of the strikers.[51] Reports that unions in Portland and Seattle would also begin general strikes picked up currency.[52]
