In July 1759, Mi'kmaq and Acadians killed five British in Dartmouth, opposite McNabb's Island.[57] By June 1757, the settlers had to be completely withdrawn from Lawrencetown (established 1754) because the number of Indian raids prevented settlers from leaving their houses.[77] In nearby Dartmouth, in the spring of 1759, another Mi'kmaq attack was launched on Fort Clarence, located at the present day Dartmouth Refinery, in which five soldiers were killed.[78] Before the deportation, the Acadian population was estimated at 14,000. Most were deported,[79] but some Acadians escaped to Quebec, or hid among the Mi'kmaq or in the countryside, to avoid deportation until the situation settled down.[80]
