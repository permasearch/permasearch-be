The School presents an Evening Lecture Series in the Fall and Spring semesters, generally twice a week, featuring an international roster of speakers including artists talking on their own work and critics and scholars covering a range of historic subjects.  The School's exhibition program, in its committed gallery space, was described by critic Mario Naves in the New York Observer as "one of the cityâ€™s most significant venues for contemporary art." [2]
