During a briefing, early in the film, an officer states that a SEAL on a previous mission in the Afghan mountains was bitten by a rattlesnake. As the four-man SEAL team are fighting and withdrawing down a rocky slope, one of them encounters a large rattlesnake which is heard rattling before it is seen on screen. Rattlesnakes are found in almost every mainland country of the Americas, from Canada to Argentina, excluding Panama, Ecuador, and Chile, but they do not occur outside the Americas. The venomous snakes encountered in the rocky valleys of the Pashtun region would be the Saw-scaled viper (Echis carinatus) and the Levant viper (Macrovipera lebetina), with an outside chance of a rare Persian horned viper (Pseudocerastes persicus). The sound of the saw-scale viper rubbing its scales together as a defensive warning is not dissimilar to that made by a small rattlesnake vibrating its tail. It is likely that U.S. troops, upon hearing this sound, would automatically attribute it to the familiar rattlesnake from back home.[citation needed]
