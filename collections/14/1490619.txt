Vale Park has been Port Vale's home ground since 1950; it is located on Hamil Road, opposite Burslem Park. Originally planned to be as massive as an 80,000 capacity stadium,[32] the development was known as the "Wembley of the North". However the £50,000 project opened at a capacity of 40,000 (360 seated) – still highly ambitious. The capacity was increased to a sell-out 49,768 for an FA Cup tie with Aston Villa in 1960. However over the years more seats were installed at the expense of standing room, and the stadium became an all-seater venue following the Taylor Report, published in 1990. Fans stood for the last time on Lorne Street at the end of the 1997–98 season. With a decline in attendances following John Rudge's departure corresponding with a halt in work on the now half-finished Lorne Street stand, the current capacity is only an estimate of 19,052 – though the stadium has rarely come close to half-full in the 21st century.
