The optimum umami taste depends also on the amount of salt, and at the same time, low-salt foods can maintain a satisfactory taste with the appropriate amount of umami.[30] One study showed that ratings of pleasantness, taste intensity, and ideal saltiness of low-salt soups were greater when the soup contained umami, whereas low-salt soups without umami were less pleasant.[31] Another study demonstrated that using fish sauce as a source of umami could reduce the need for salt by 10â€“25% to flavor such foods as chicken broth, tomato sauce or coconut curry while maintaining overall taste intensity.[32][33]
