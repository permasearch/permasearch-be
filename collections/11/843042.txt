The benefits of high market share naturally led to an interest in growth strategies. The relative advantages of horizontal integration, vertical integration, diversification, franchises, mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and organic growth were discussed. Other research indicated that a low market share strategy could still be very profitable. Schumacher (1973),[115] Woo and Cooper (1982),[116] Levenson (1984),[117] and later Traverso (2002)[118] showed how smaller niche players obtained very high returns.
