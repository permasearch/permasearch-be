The boys head to Rock Ridge, Colorado, a town where a man died of a heart attack at 44 years of age with no symptoms. Research indicates the man died of "ghost sickness", which infects Dean. The illness causes first a general anxiety that builds into deadly fear. Sam contacts Bobby and learns the ghost they're after is called a Buruburu. Sam and Bobby decide to scare the ghost to death. They wrap an iron chain inscribed with a spell word around his neck and Bobby road-hauls him behind the Impala, re-enacting his death. This successfully scares the ghost to death, just in time to save Dean before his heart fails.
