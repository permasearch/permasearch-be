Human habits are constantly formed to achieve certain results because of one's strong feelings of wanting or wishing for something.

James noted that the laws of habit formation are unbiased, habits are capable of causing either good or bad actions. And once either a good or bad habit has begun to be established, it is very difficult to change.[5]
