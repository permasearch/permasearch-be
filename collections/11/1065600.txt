A manual for health care workers calls I-messages an "important skill", but emphasizes that use of an I-message does not guarantee that the other person will respond in a helpful way. It presents an I-message as a way that one can take responsibility for one's own feelings and express them without blaming someone else.[13] A manual for social workers presents I-messages as a technique with the purpose of improving the effectiveness of communication.[14]
