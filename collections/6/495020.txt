Michele Alboreto started 194 races in a career that spanned 14 seasons. He started with a drive for Tyrrell in 1981, impressing the team enough to secure a three year contract. He won two races with them before moving to Ferrari for five seasons. It was with the Italian team that Alboreto would come close to winning the title â€“ eight podium finishes including two wins was not quite enough to give him the 1985 championship and he finished as the year as the runner-up. On leaving Ferrari Alboreto's career went downhill with only one podium finish in his final six years.[7]
