Regardless of legal troubles, Cuisinart introduced six new products by 1982. These new products had bigger blades, more attachments, and more features. One of the six models sold for $600 retail price. Expanding the diversity of food processor products was Cuisinart's way of creating variety within their market. Critics felt that this wasn't the kind of diversity they needed, that Cuisinart needed to look outside of the world of food processors, and begin broadening their marketplace there. Kerry Hannon, a writer for Forbes commented that  "Sontheimer's market blindness ... kept him from capitalizing on the quality of image that the Cuisinart name conveyed. He introduced a line of high-priced cookware into a jam-packed and fading market. But more natural line extensions like blenders, for example, eluded him."[1]
