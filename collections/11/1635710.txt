"Alive and Schticking" received less positive reviews as well. Gail Pennington of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch wrote that the live episode "proved once and for all that Will & Grace should have been buried before now,"[30] and Jeffrey Robinson of DVD Talk pointed out that its underlying storyline "is a little too over-the-top."[31] Jessica Banov of The Fayetteville Observer wrote, "The first live showÂ ... was so-so. The lighting was weird, and I'm not sure what was up with Debra Messing's hair. But it was funny to see Messing and Sean Hayes break from their scripts to giggle."[32] Cinquemani commented that Baldwin's "absurd" role as Malcolm "is proving to be one of Will & Grace's most enduring guest stars."[25] David Blum of The New York Sun reported that the producers of Will & Grace wasted Baldwin's "prodigious talents on a supporting role this past season, when it's clear he could effortlessly carry his own network series."[33] Kauffman concluded that Grace's joke about George Bush being brain dead "just falls amazingly flat".[27]
