A densely overgrown identical twin of the house was later found at La Frontera as well, and it too was cut into pieces and moved, but to nearby Georgetown and restored. It is known locally as the Burkland-Frisk house as it was built by an early settler in Williamson County, Leonard Frisk, and was later owned by Tony Burkland, a relative of the Frisk family. The house originally set across the street from the Chainsaw house, on Quick Hill Road. But it was later moved to another location within La Frontera and was not originally recognized as a twin because of the dilapidated condition of the house and it being completely overgrown with plants and trees.[4] It was moved in 2006 and restored by the developers of La Frontera, Don Martin and Bill Smalling (1953â€“2008). It sits on San Gabriel Village Blvd prominently overlooking the South San Gabriel River [5] and is used as an office.
