The two teams were drawn against each other again in two legs in the first knockout round of the 2003–04 UEFA Champions League knockout stage.[94] The first match was held in Stuttgart on 25 February 2004 at Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion, which Chelsea also won 1–0 after an own goal scored by Fernando Meira,[95] while a scoreless draw played on 9 March 2004 in Stamford Bridge was enough for Chelsea to advance to the quarter-finals with a 1–0 aggregate win.[96]
