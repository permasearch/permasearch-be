Individuals with Intermittent Explosive Disorder, also known as impulsive aggression, have exhibited serotonergic abnormalities and show differential activation in response to emotional stimuli and situations.[77] Notably, Intermittent Explosive Disorder is not associated with a higher likelihood of diagnosis with any of the other ICDs but is highly comorbid with disruptive behavior disorders in childhood.[77] Intermittent Explosive Disorder is likely to be re-classified in the DSM-V as under the heading of disruptive, impulse control, and conduct disorders.[72]
