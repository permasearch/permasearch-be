Race, nationality, and class all show little correlation with academic misconduct. There is also no correlation between how religious someone is and the likelihood that that person will cheat. A comparison between students of different religions yielded similar results, although the study did show that Jews tend to cheat less than members of other religions.[69]  One of the strongest demographic correlations with academic misconduct in the United States is with language. Students who speak English as a second language have been shown to commit academic dishonesty more and are more likely to be caught than native speakers, since they will often not want to rewrite sources in their own words, fearing that the meaning of the sentence will be lost through poor paraphrasing skills.[70]  In the University of California system, international students make up 10% of the student body but comprise 47% of academic dishonesty cases.[71] In British universities, students from outside of the European Union make up 12% of the student body but comprise 35% of academic dishonesty cases.[72]
