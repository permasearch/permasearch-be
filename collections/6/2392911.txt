Before British colonisation, local media was very active.[6] In 1836, the country's first newspaper, The Maulmain Chronicle, was published[7] followed by The Rangoon Chronicle in 1853,[8] later renamed to The Rangoon Times.  King Mindon was an advocate of press freedom and encouraged the creation of Burma's first Burmese-language newspaper, Yadanapon Naypyidaw Thadinsa (ရတနာပုံနေပြည်တော်သတင်းစာ) to report on him and the Queen, even if it portrayed them in a negative light.[6][9]
