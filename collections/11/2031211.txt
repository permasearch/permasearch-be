I realize I'm very late to this discussion, but I think someone's misread Ol' Stan's comments (or maybe he stated them wrong, he does do that sometimes, bless him). I've never heard him say the name Mjolnir was made up, but rather that Uru, the name of the mystic material Thor's hammer is made from (in Marvel comics anyway) was made up.69.212.125.129 (talk) 19:17, 17 October 2013 (UTC)
