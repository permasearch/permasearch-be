Although these are considered the most well known in-house tuning divisions, Mercedes-AMG has a considerably different philosophy than BMW M. Mercedes-AMG has created high-performance versions of many of its nameplates, including flagship sedans and SUVs, while BMW M has emphasized tuning only vehicles with "Lateral agility" (which has long been only their 3 Series, 5 Series, and roadsters).[10] Compared to BMW M, Mercedes-AMG is "less narrow in its sporting focus, yet still combining sledgehammer performance with relaxed handling, cultured comfort, and practicality".[11]
