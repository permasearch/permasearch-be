The stable growth of HeLa enabled a researcher at the University of Minnesota hospital to successfully grow polio virus, enabling the development of a vaccine,[7] and by 1952, Jonas Salk developed a vaccine for polio using these cells.[4][8] To test Salk's new vaccine, the cells were put into mass production in the first-ever cell production factory.[9]
