In 2018 from January 4 2018 to 14 January, Kyle Knight and Deirdre O'Leary both from Canada made a South to North crossing of the Empty Quarter on foot from just north of Thabhloten, Saudi Arabia (next to the Saudi-Oman Boarder) to Shaybah, Saudi Arabia (next to the Saudi-UAE boarder). [17] It is claimed to be the first South-North crossing on foot and the fastest known time directly though the Saudi Arabian part of the Empty Quarter. The 300km took 9 days, 12 hours, 59 minutes to cross with 5,791m of elevation gain. [18]
