Booth's age is never specified. However, in Season 3 it is stated that he is 35 years old[19] and that Brennan is five years younger than him[20] and in Season 4 the "squints" celebrate his 36th birthday,[21] also in the episode Women in Limbo of season 1, it is stated that Brennan is born in 1976, which should put Booth's birthday in 1971. In season 11, Booth (and his brother, Jared) is mentioned as now being in his (early) 40s.
