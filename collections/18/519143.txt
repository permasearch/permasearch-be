The navigational treaty convention, the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea—for instance, as appears in the Merchant Shipping (Distress Signals and Prevention of Collisions) Regulations of 1996 (and comparable US documents from the US Coast Guard),[7]—sets forth the rights of way for maritime vessels, whether by sail or powered, and whether a vessel is overtaking, approaching head-on, or crossing.[7]:11-12 To set forth these navigational rules, the terms starboard and port are absolutely essential, and to aid in in situ decision-making, the two sides of each vessel are marked, dusk to dawn, by navigation lights, the vessel's starboard side by green and its port side by red.[7]:15 Aircraft are lit in the same way.
