Steve Grogan set a Patriots record with five touchdown throws in a 56â€“3 Patriots massacre of the Jets at Schaefer Stadium; his touchdown record stood until Tom Brady broke it against the Dolphins in 2007. Following the game a scuffle ensued in the crowded locker room between cornerback Raymond Clayborn and Boston Globe writer Will McDonough. Harold Jackson caught three passes, all for touchdowns. Stanley Morgan caught two, and Andy Johnson, Allan Clark and Don Westbrook also scored a touchdown each.
