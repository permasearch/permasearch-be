Tragedy struck the following year with the sudden death of Cormac McAnallen, at the age of 24. Tyrone, however, came back the following year to win the title for the second time. They played five matches in the Ulster championship, including replays in the second round against Cavan and the final against Armagh, which they lost. Having beaten Monaghan in the qualifiers, Tyrone had yet another drawn game in the quarter-final, against Dublin – a match notable for Eoin Mulligan's stunning solo goal. In the semi-final, they met Armagh for the third time, winning 1–13 to 1–12 with an injury-time free kick by Peter Canavan. In the 2005 final, they defeated Kerry for the second time in three years to win the All-Ireland, sparking emotional scenes among the Tyrone team and fans, in remembrance of Cormac McAnallen.
