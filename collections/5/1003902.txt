As of 2017 in Wake County, North Carolina, nearly 500 residents are suing a Smithfield subsidiary, Murphy-Brown, in 26 lawsuits, alleging nuisance and ill health caused by smells, open-air lagoons, and pig carcasses. Residents say their outdoor activities are limited as a consequence, and that they are unable to invite visitors to their homes. Smithfield has said the complaints are without merit.[90]
