SIG released an altered version of the double-action only (DAO) pistols called the DAK (for Double Action Kellermann, after the designer of the trigger system, Harald Kellermann of Eckernförde, Germany).[31] The DAK capability is available in 220, 226, 229 and 239 models. When firing the pistol the first trigger pull is 29 N (6.5 lbf) (compared to 44 N (10 lbf) for the standard DAO). After the pistol fires and the trigger is released forward, the trigger has an intermediate reset point that is approximately halfway to the rest position. The trigger pull from this intermediate reset point is 38 N (8.5 lbf). If the trigger is released all the way forward, this will engage the primary trigger reset and have a trigger pull of 29 N (6.5 lbf). To engage the intermediate reset, the trigger must be held to the rear while the slide is cycled, either manually or by the recoil of a round being fired. The pistol can be cocked by pulling the trigger just past the trigger reset, then stopping, then releasing.
