The elements of groups 4-11 are generally recognized as transition metals, justified by their typical chemistry, i.e. a large range of complex ions in various oxidation states, coloured complexes, and catalytic properties either as the element or as ions (or both). Sc and Y in Group 3 are also generally recognized as transition metals. However, the elements La–Lu and Ac–Lr and Group 12 attract different definitions from different authors.
