On the same day, Shaanxi's Tongmenghui, led by Jing Dingcheng (景定成) and Qian ding (錢鼎) as well as Jing Wumu (井勿幕) and others including Gelaohui, launched an uprising and captured Xi'an after two days of struggle.[75] The Muslim general Ma Anliang led more than twenty battalions of Hui Muslim troops to defend the Qing imperials and attacked Shaanxi, held by revolutionary Zhang Fenghui (張鳳翽).[76] The attack was successful, but after news arrived that Puyi was about to abdicate, Ma agreed to join the new Republic.[76] The revolutionaries established the "Qinlong Fuhan Military Government" and elected Zhang Fenghui, a member of the Yuanrizhi Society (原日知會), as new governor.[75] Xi'an Manchu city (滿城) finally fell on 24 October, after a massacre of 20,000 Manchus in living there.[77][78] Many of its Manchu defenders committed suicide, including Qing general Wenrui (文瑞), who threw himself down a well.[77]
