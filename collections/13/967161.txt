In one scene, six year’s worth of character development gets thrown out the window. It’s maddening. I know the counter-argument to this, that Theon will always be haunted by his time spent being abused by Ramsay, and Reek will always be in there somewhere. But we’ve done this already. We’ve had him suffer and suffer and suffer and be a coward and refuse to be rescued by his own sister in an earlier season because he was just that broken. We spent the last year and a half watching Theon crawl his way back to being Theon again, in some capacity, and now the show does him this disservice, having him revert back to being a coward in the goofiest way possible.[9]
