The core cast was augmented by various recurring characters throughout the series, portrayed by Beverly Callard, Lee Oakes, Hayley Bishop, Alison Mac, Thomas Nelstrop, and Jonathon Dutton. The title was inspired by the 1980 hit single "Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps Please" by Splodgenessabounds.[1] On 23 July 2011, it was confirmed that the series would not be returning due to BBC Three wanting to make room for new comedies and feeling that the series had come to a natural end following the departures of most of the main cast members.[2]
