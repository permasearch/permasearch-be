By the time he began the serial, Seth had developed a style derivative of The New Yorker stylists of the 1930s and 1940s.[1] In the book's appendix Seth describes Peter Arno as "possibly The New Yorker's greatest stylist". Seth appropriates the sophisticated, jaded satirical mood,[20] thick brushline, and compositional sense of Arno's work.[21] Seth's brushline is simple and organic, and he gives attention to buildings, landscapes, weather conditions, and other background details.[22] The brushstrokes broaden into thick black shadows, sometimes flattening figures to near-abstract silhouettes.[23] A greyish-blue wash accents the otherwise black-and-white cartooning. The novel is printed on yellow paper, giving an aged feeling to the book.[4]
