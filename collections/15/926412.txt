In August 2016, T-Mobile introduced T-Mobile ONE. It will be the only rate plan offered in the future, with plans to gradually phase out Simple Choice.[118] It combines unlimited voice minutes, text messaging, and high-speed data (the top 1% of users—currently 50 GB/month—may be deprioritized under congested conditions), replacing Binge On, Music Freedom, and Data Stash. Video streaming is limited to 1.5 Mbit/s, allowing 480p resolution in most cases, and mobile hotspot (tethering) is limited to 3G speeds. The $10/line/month ONE Plus add-on allows HD streaming and adds 10 GB of mobile hotspot at 4G LTE speeds; the $25/line/month ONE Plus International additionally provides international calling and texting and unlimited mobile hotspot at 4G LTE speeds. Subscribers who do not enable auto-pay are charged a $5/line/month fee; otherwise, as of January 22, 2017, all taxes and regulatory fees are included in the plan cost.[119][120] The plan has been criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others for potentially violating net neutrality rules and making previously-included features paid extras.[121][122][123] Subscribers on Simple Choice can keep their current plans.[118]
