De Gaulle and Churchill had a complex relationship during the wartime period. De Gaulle did show respect and admiration for Churchill, and even some light humorous interactions between the two have been noted by observers such as Duff Cooper, the British Ambassador to the French Committee of Liberation.[135] Churchill explained his support for de Gaulle during the darkest hours, calling him "L'homme du destin".[135][136]
