In less than five minutes, seven or eight 1000-pound bombs,[7][27] one 500-pound bomb, one 750-pound bomb, and several missile and rocket warheads heated by the fire exploded with varying degrees of violence.[27] Several of the explosions of the 1000-pound Korean War-era AN-M65 Composition B bombs were estimated to be as much as 50% more powerful than a standard 1000-lb bomb, due to the badly degraded Composition B.[16] The ninth explosion was attributed to a sympathetic detonation between an AN-M65 and a newer 500-lb M117 H6 bomb that were positioned next to each other. The other H6-based bombs performed as designed and either burned on the deck or were jettisoned, but did not detonate under the heat of the fires.[7] The ongoing detonations prevented fire suppression efforts during the first critical minutes of the disaster.[16]
