These pranks make Marty miss an appointment with his boss, Universal Pictures president Marcus Duncan. After Marty's film Whitaker and Fowl proves to be a critical and commercial failure, Marcus loses confidence in him and threatens to pull the plug on Big Fat Liar. Jason approaches Marty and agrees to help in exchange for his confession. Guided by Jason, Marty makes a successful presentation which gets Big Fat Liar green-lit, but Marcus warns Marty any mistakes will make Universal pull funding and end his career. Marty betrays Jason again and calls security to arrest him and Kaylee. Marty's assistant, Monty Kirkham, decides to help Jason and Kaylee expose him, having grown tired of his repeated verbal abuse. They rally all of his employees and devise a plan to expose him for good, while Jason has his parents fly to Los Angeles.
