The Detour was a choice between Spin It or Bull It. In Spin It, teams donned safety gear and then replaced two blades on a 400-year-old Mallorcan windmill. Once a mechanic checked their work, they received their next clue from a pair of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza impersonators. In Bull It, the team would wear a special two-person bull outfit, with the person in front unable to see where they were going. The team member in back would verbally guide their partner in the front to circle eight matadors and then strike a target of a ninth to launch a final dummy matador. The entire course had to be completed within two minutes for the team to get their next clue.
