Tui na (推拿) is a form of massage akin to acupressure (from which shiatsu evolved). Asian massage is typically administered with the person fully clothed, without the application of grease or oils[citation needed]. Techniques employed may include thumb presses, rubbing, percussion, and assisted stretching.
