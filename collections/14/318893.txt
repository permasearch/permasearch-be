There are also abuses of media rights and access. The Zimbabwean government is accused of suppressing freedom of the press and freedom of speech.[119] It has been repeatedly accused of using the public broadcaster, the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation, as a propaganda tool.[127] Newspapers critical of the government, such as the Daily News, closed after bombs exploded at their offices and the government refused to renew their license.[128][129] BBC News, Sky News, and CNN were banned from filming or reporting from Zimbabwe. In 2009 reporting restrictions on the BBC and CNN were lifted.[130] Sky News continue to report on happenings within Zimbabwe from neighbouring countries like South Africa.[131][132]
