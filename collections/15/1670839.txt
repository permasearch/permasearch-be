The Dutch government instituted religious freedom for Catholics in 1848.[citation needed] In 1853, Pius erected the Archdiocese of Utrecht and four dioceses in Haarlem, Den Bosch, Breda and Roermond under it. As in England, this resulted in a popular outburst of anti-Catholic sentiment that soon subsided.[53]
