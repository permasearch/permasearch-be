While rigid lenses have been around for about 120 years, soft lenses are a much more recent development. The principal breakthrough in soft contact lenses made by Otto Wichterle led to the launch of the first soft (hydrogel) lenses in some countries in the 1960s and the approval of the "Soflens" daily material (polymacon) by the FDA in the US in 1971. Softs are usually comfortable right after insertion, while rigids require a period of adaptation before some comfort, if any, is achieved.
