Kerri Hoskins, who played the character in Mortal Kombat 3 and in the theatrical show Mortal Kombat: Live Tour, revealed in a 2010 interview with The Gaming Liberty that she had also auditioned for the role of Sonya in Annihilation, but "didn't make the last cut of three girls" due to having no acting experience.[59] She enthused that her experience in the Live Tour "was a riot" and that she felt "like a rock star." Hoskins also explained that the show emphasized getting young audiences into the martial arts, while the actors would travel to schools to give motivational speeches to students.[59]
