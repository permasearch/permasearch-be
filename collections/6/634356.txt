The 16th century scholar Leo Africanus (c. 1494â€“1554) of Al-Andalus identified the Moors as the native Berber inhabitants of the former Roman Africa Province (Africans). He described Moors as one of five main population groups on the continent alongside Egyptians, Abyssinians (Abassins), Arabians and Cafri (Cafates).[1]
