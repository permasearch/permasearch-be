The Chinese emperors, their families and officials used large seals known as xǐ (玺; 璽), later renamed bǎo (宝; 寶; "treasure"), which corresponds to the Great Seals of Western countries. These were usually made of jade (although hard wood or precious metal could also be used), and were originally square in shape. They were changed to a rectangular form during the Song dynasty, but reverted to square during the Qing dynasty.
