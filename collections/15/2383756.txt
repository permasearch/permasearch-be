The Liberator also became an avowed woman's rights newspaper when the prospectus for its 1838 issue declared that as the paper's object was "to redeem woman as well as man from a servile to an equal condition," it would support "the rights of woman to their utmost extent."[8] In January and February 1838, the Liberator published Sarah Grimké's "Letters on the Province of Woman" in the paper, and later in the year published them in pamphlet form as Letters on the Equality of the Sexes, and the Condition of Woman.[9] During the following decades, the Liberator promoted women's rights by publishing editorials, petitions, convention calls and proceedings, speeches, legislative action, and other material advocating woman suffrage, equal property rights, and women's educational and professional equality. The Liberator's printers: Isaac Knapp, James Brown Yerrinton (1800–1866) and James Manning Winchell Yerrinton (1825–1893), and Robert Folger Wallcut (1797–1884), printed many of the woman’s rights tracts used in the 1850s.
