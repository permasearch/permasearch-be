IH Cub Cadet was a premium line of small tractors, established in 1960 as part of International Harvester. The IH Cub Cadet was an entirely new line of heavy-duty small tractors using components from the previous Cub series tractors.[2] In 1981, IH sold the Cub Cadet division to the MTD corporation CCC, which took over production and use of the Cub Cadet brand name (without the IH symbol), to present day (2018).[2] The Cub Cadet Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of MTD, produced Cub Cadets for both lawn equipment dealers (branded as Cub Cadet Corporation tractors, in traditional white/yellow livery) and IH agricultural dealers (in red/white livery) until the IH ag division was sold to Tenneco in 1985.
