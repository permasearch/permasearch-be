The Oxford English Dictionary conjectures that this expression could also have derived from U.S. military slang for sycophants, "brown-nosers", while mentioning the popular etymology that derives it from the awards system of the Brownies of the Girl Guides or Girl Scouts. "Brownie" itself in the sense of "brown-noser" was in use in the 1940s. It has been suggested that the term was given impetus though its coincidence with related scatological slang.[6]
