This Leg's Detour was a choice between Water and Waffle. In Water, teams used materials provided (pontoons, rope, and wood) to build a raft to search the Lieve canal (in Dutch) for the two halves of their next clue. In Waffle, teams had to build a waffle stand and then bake and decorate eighteen Belgian waffles to the chef's satisfaction before receiving their next clue.
