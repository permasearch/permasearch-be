In June 2010, users of Office Live Workspace, released in October 2007,[9] were migrated to Windows Live Office. The migration included all existing workspaces, documents, and sharing permissions.[10] The merger of the two services was a result of Microsoft's decision to merge its Office Live team into Windows Live in January 2009,[11] as well as several deficiencies with Office Live Workspace, which lacked high-fidelity document viewing and did not allow files to be edited from within the web browser.[12] Office Live Workspace also did not offer offline collaboration and co-authoring functionality – instead documents were "checked out" and "checked in", though the service did integrate with SharedView for real-time screen sharing.
