Japanese law admits a very wide range of unusual base ingredients, such as perilla leaf, sesame and chestnut,[19] and shōchū made from most if not all of these exists. For example, there is a milk shōchū brand called Makiba-no Yume.[36] Others are generic shōchū mixed with a particular fruit juice or extracts.
