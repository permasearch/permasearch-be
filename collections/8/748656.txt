Chorismate synthase (CS) catalyzes the last step in the shikimate pathwayâ€”the formation of chorismate. There are two classes of CS, both of which require FMN, but are divided on their need for NADPH as a reducing agent. The proposed mechanism for CS involves radical species. The radical flavin species has not been detected spectroscopically without using a substrate analogue, which suggests that it is short-lived. However, when using a fluorinated substrate, a neutral flavin semiquinone was detected.[22]
