Various manufacturers of the game have created dozens of officially licensed versions, in which the names of the properties and other elements of the game are replaced by others according to the game's theme. The first such license was awarded in 1994, to the company that became USAopoly, starting with a San Diego edition of Monopoly and later including themes such as national parks, Star Trek, Star Wars, Nintendo, Disney characters, Pok√©mon, Peanuts, various particular cities (such as Las Vegas and New York City), states, colleges and universities, the World Cup, NASCAR, individual professional sports teams, and many others.[190] USAopoly also sells special corporate editions of Monopoly.[191] Official corporate editions have been produced for Best Buy, the Boy Scouts of America, FedEx, and UPS, among others.[192] In 1995, a second license was awarded to Winning Moves Games in Massachusetts.[193] Winning Moves has produced a new board game and card games based on Monopoly in the United States. Winning Moves also produces official localized editions of the game in the UK, France, Germany and Australia.[194][195][196][197] The Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Edition Monopoly is a special case, having been originally produced by Winning Moves in the UK, and resold by USAopoly within the US.[198] A third license was awarded in 2000 by Hasbro to Winning Solutions, Inc., which produces specialty deluxe editions mostly for sale by specialized retailers.[199] Other licensed localized editions of the game are being published in Nigeria and The Netherlands, among other locations.[200][201]
