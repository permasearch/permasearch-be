However, contrary to these statements, he admits that as the trade deficit declines "GDP would rise and unemployment would fall", further stating: "Countries that import more than they export contributes to the weakness of their economie".[86] He notes that trade deficits caused by free trade destroy manufacturing jobs: the increase in the "value of the dollar will lead to larger trade deficits and fewer manufacturing jobs".[89] Moreover, even if according to him, the United States must not use protectionism, he admits that if manufacturing industry recovers through protectionists measures, skilled jobs would be created, even if they would be fewer and different from the manufacturing jobs lost in recent decades: "Advanced manufacturing technologies, including robots, mean that the few jobs created will require higher skills and will be placed in different locations from the jobs lost".[89]
