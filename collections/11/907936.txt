"Love Runs Out" was originally intended to be the first single from Native, but was eventually passed over in favour of "If I Lose Myself". Tedder told Capital FM, "We have a new single that's not even on the album that's about to drop. I can't quote the date," and "I wanted ["Love Runs Out"] to be the first single, a few of us in the band did, but I could not finish the chorus. And you can't have a song without a chorus."[1]
