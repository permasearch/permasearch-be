The measures of taxation in the reign of Augustus were determined by population census, with fixed quotas for each province.[238] Citizens of Rome and Italy paid indirect taxes, while direct taxes were exacted from the provinces.[238] Indirect taxes included a 4% tax on the price of slaves, a 1% tax on goods sold at auction, and a 5% tax on the inheritance of estates valued at over 100,000 sesterces by persons other than the next of kin.[238]
