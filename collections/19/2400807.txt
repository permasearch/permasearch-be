Using data from mtDNA analysis, scientist have found that evolution of hammerhead sharks has probably begun with a taxon that had a highly pronounced cephalofoil (most likely that similar to the winghead shark, Eusphyra blochii), and has later been modified through selective pressures. Thus, judging by their smaller cephalofoils, bonnethead sharks are the more recent developments of a 25-million-year evolutionary process.[citation needed]
