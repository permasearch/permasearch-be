The British-American musician Slash has sported a top hat since he was in Guns N' Roses, a look that has become iconic for him.[31] Panic! at the Disco's Brendon Urie is also a frequent wearer of top hats.  He has been known to wear them in previous live performances on their Nothing Rhymes with Circus tour and in the music videos, "The Ballad of Mona Lisa" and "I Write Sins Not Tragedies". Top hats have also become ubiquitous among the steampunk subculture, often adorned with goggles and feathers.
