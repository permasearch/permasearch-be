Johnny Jones was an early settler in Otago. When the whaling boom ended, he switched to farming in 1840. He was the first P훮keh훮 who settled large numbers of immigrants on the east coast of the South Island, and he imported sheep amongst other stock for this purpose.[4] One of the first to bring substantial numbers of sheep to Canterbury was John Deans in 1843. As was usual at the time, the sheep were bought in Australia.[5] John Cracroft Wilson's endeavours of setting up as a sheep farmer in 1854 demonstrate the hardship that early settlers and stock often faced. He had a disastrous journey from Sydney where much of his stock died and 1,200 sheep had to be jettisoned. After landing in Lyttelton, his stock was transferred to the nearby Gollans Bay (the bay in Lyttelton Harbour beneath Evans Pass[6]), where he lost more stock to tutu poisoning and southerlies.[7]
