As in China and Korea, Japan employed different shaku for different purposes. The "carpentry" shaku (曲尺, kanejaku) was used for construction. It was a little longer in the 19th century prior to its metric redefinition.[a] The "cloth"[11] or "whale" shaku (鯨尺, kujirajaku), named for tailors' and fabric merchants' baleen rulers, was ¼ longer[11] and used in measuring cloth. (A longer unit of about 25 cloth shaku was the tan.)[11] Traditional Japanese clothing was reckoned using the "traditional clothing" shaku (呉服尺, gofukujaku), about ​1⁄5 longer than the carpentry shaku. The Shōsōin in Nara has ivory 1-shaku[which?] rulers, the kōgebachiru-no-shaku (紅牙撥鏤尺).
