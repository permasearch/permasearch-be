If the trapezoid is divided into four triangles by its diagonals AC and BD (as shown on the right), intersecting at O, then the area of     △   {\displaystyle \triangle }   AOD is equal to that of     △   {\displaystyle \triangle }   BOC, and the product of the areas of     △   {\displaystyle \triangle }   AOD and     △   {\displaystyle \triangle }   BOC is equal to that of     △   {\displaystyle \triangle }   AOB and     △   {\displaystyle \triangle }   COD. The ratio of the areas of each pair of adjacent triangles is the same as that between the lengths of the parallel sides.[6]
