Upon discovering her pregnancy, Quinn convinces Finn that he is the father, despite the fact that they never actually had a sexual encounter. Quinn claims that due to his premature ejaculation problem, and during their time in a hot-tub, Finn had ejaculated in the tub and Quinn had received the sperm. The real father is Finn's best friend Puck (Mark Salling), who offers to support Quinn and the baby, but is rejected for his irresponsibility.[6] Quinn decides to have the baby adopted, and agrees to give it to Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig), the wife of glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison), who is faking a pregnancy.[7] When news of her pregnancy is revealed to the school, Quinn is cut from the cheerleading squad and her popularity declines.[8] Her parents evict her, and Quinn moves in with Finn and his mother.[9] She begins to reconsider having the baby adopted, and gives Puck a chance to prove himself, but he is not reliable so she returns to her plan of giving the baby to Terri.[10] Quinn blackmails Sue into letting her rejoin the Cheerios, but ultimately decides against it, preferring to remain with the glee club, where she feels accepted.[11] Finn learns the truth about the baby's paternity from Rachel, and breaks up with Quinn. Puck again offers to support her, but she turns him down and tells him that she wants to handle the pregnancy by herself.[12] She moves in with Puck's family,[13] but after forming a friendship with fellow New Directions member Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley), Quinn lives with her family instead.[14] She gives birth to a daughter, named Beth by Puck, who is adopted by Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel), coach of rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline and Rachel's biological mother.[15]
