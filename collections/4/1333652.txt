Reality series that are self-contained and originally aired on network television, such as Fear Factor, America's Funniest Home Videos, Wipeout and Cops, typically follow similar patterns to other network series in that once such a show reaches 100 episodes, it can (and often is) sold into syndication, albeit typically at a price somewhat lower than scripted programming, and can be aired daily.
