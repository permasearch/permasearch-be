The Carter Administration increasingly became locked in a debate about continued support for the monarchy.[138] As early as November, ambassador William Sullivan sent a telegram to Carter ([138] the "Thinking the Unthinkable" telegram). The telegram effectively declared his belief that the Shah would not survive the protests, and that the US should consider withdrawing its support for his government and persuading the monarch to abdicate. The United States would then help assemble a coalition of pro-Western military officers, middle class professionals, and moderate clergy, with Khomeini installed as a Gandhi-like spiritual leader.[138]
