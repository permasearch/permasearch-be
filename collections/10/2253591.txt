Little cigars (sometimes called small cigars or miniatures in the UK) differ greatly from regular cigars.[36] They weigh less than cigars and cigarillos,[40] but, more importantly, they resemble cigarettes in size, shape, packaging, and filters.[41] Sales of little cigars quadrupled in the U.S. from 1971 to 1973 in response to the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act, which banned the broadcast of cigarette advertisements and required stronger health warnings on cigarette packs. Cigars were exempt from the ban, and perhaps more importantly, were taxed at a far lower rate. Little cigars are sometimes called "cigarettes in disguise", and unsuccessful attempts have been made to reclassify them as cigarettes. In the United States, sales of little cigars reached an all-time high in 2006, fueled in great part by favorable taxation.[26] In some states, however, little cigars have successfully been taxed at the rate of cigarettes, such as Illinois,[42] as well as multiple other states.  This has caused yet another loophole, in which manufacturers classify their products as "filtered cigars" instead to avoid the higher tax rate.  Yet, many continue to argue that there is in fact a distinction between little cigars and filtered cigars.  Little cigars offer a similar draw and overall feel to cigarettes, but with aged and fermented tobaccos, while filtered cigars are said to be more closely related to traditional cigars, and are not meant to be inhaled.[43] Research shows that people do inhale smoke from little cigars.[44]
