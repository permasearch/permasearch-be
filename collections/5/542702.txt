The Times Union is Albany's primary daily newspaper and the only one based close to the city; its headquarters moved from within city limits to suburban Colonie in the 1960s after a dispute with Mayor Corning over land needed for expansion.[270] Its circulation totals about 73,000 on weekdays and 143,000 on Sundays.[271] Serving Albany to a lesser degree are The Daily Gazette, based in Schenectady,[272] and The Record, of Troy.[273] Metroland is the alternative newsweekly in the area, publishing each Thursday,[274] while The Business Review is a business weekly published each Friday.[275] The Legislative Gazette, another weekly newspaper, focuses exclusively on issues related to the Legislature and the state government.[276]
