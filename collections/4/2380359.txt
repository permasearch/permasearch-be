West Indies beat India 5â€“0 at home next year,[59] and in 1963, they beat a fine English team by three matches to one.[60] The Lord's Test of this series saw a famous finish. With two balls left, England needed six runs to win, and West Indies one wicket. The non-striker was Colin Cowdrey, who had his left arm in a sling, having fractured it earlier in the day. However, David Allen safely played out the last two balls and the match ended in a draw.[61] Worrell retired at the end of the series.[62] The selectors picked Garry Sobers to succeed him.[63]
