Ryan Middleton from Music Times states "The song starts out with Rihanna's vocals and mostly cooing with a soft build that "drops" into a steady house, four-on-the-floor rhythm and deep bass stabs, using Rihanna's voice as the main element for the melody. It doesn't have the soaring, pop radio synths one might expect from these two, but then again this isn't 2011 and a simple revamp of 'We Found Love,' would be disappointing. The drop may be a little disappointing for fans upon first listen, but give a second, third or fifth spin and there is an earworm quality to this one that will stick with you for a while. It may not have the lasting power of 'We Found Love,' but it will dominate the radio all summer."[15] He praised the song for creating a catchy hit, however he criticized Harris for failing to create anything new. NPR listed it at 89 on its "Top 100 Songs of 2016" list,[16] while Fuse considered it the 10th best song of the year.[17]
