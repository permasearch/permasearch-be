M.2 modules are rectangular, with an edge connector on one side (75 positions with up to 67 pins, 0.5 mm pitch, pins on opposing sides of the PCB are offset from each other), and a semicircular mounting hole at the center of the opposite edge.  Each pin on the connector is rated for up to 50 V and 0.5 A, while the connector itself is specified to endure up to 60 mating cycles.[11]:6  The M.2 standard allows module widths of 12, 16, 22 and 30 mm, and lengths of 16, 26, 30, 38, 42, 60, 80 and 110 mm.  Initial line-up of the commercially available M.2 expansion cards is 22 mm wide, with varying lengths of 30, 42, 60, 80 and 110 mm.[2][4][11][12]  M.2 module codes contain both the width and length of a particular module; for example, 2242 as a module code means that the module is 22 mm wide and 42 mm long, while 2280 denotes a module 22 mm wide and 80 mm long.
