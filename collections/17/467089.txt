Punic, the Semitic language of the Carthaginians, continued to be used in North Africa during the Imperial period.[72] Before the Roman conquest in 146 BC, nearly all Punic inscriptions had been votives to the deities Tanit and Ba'al or funerary commemorations, but during the Roman era a broader range of content is found in Neo-Punic, often appearing with parallel texts in Latin or Greek.[73] A striking occurrence of Neo-Punic is found at the otherwise thoroughly Roman temple of Roma and Augustus, built 14–19 AD at Leptis Magna.[74] One of the latest Neo-Punic inscriptions on a monument dates to the reign of Domitian (81–96 AD).[75] No inscription in Punic script on stone can be dated later than the 2nd or 3rd century.[76] Latin script was used to write Punic in the 4th and 5th centuries.[77]
