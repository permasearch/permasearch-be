Jenna Boyd was born in Bedford, Texas and moved with her parents and younger brother Cayden (also an actor) to Los Angeles to pursue her acting career. After a few small roles on television and film, Boyd's big break came when she was cast in The Missing, alongside Cate Blanchett and Evan Rachel Wood. Boyd's performance was praised in critical reviews of this film, although the film itself was not particularly well received. Previously she had been in Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star playing the daughter of a family hired by the title character (David Spade) to help him recapture his childhood. In 2005 Boyd played the Leukemia-suffering Bailey Graffman in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. Her recent roles include the Lifetime miniseries The Gathering in which she played the daughter of a doctor (Peter Gallagher) searching for his wife and in the Ghost Whisperer episode "Children of Ghosts" she played a troubled teenager living in a foster home. In 2017, she played Paige Hardaway, the "practice girlfriend" of the autistic main character, Sam Gardener, in the Netflix Original Series Atypical.
