"Old Dan Tucker" was, of course, intended for stage performance. The verses are not only to be played but also acted out and danced to. Minstrels could begin leaping about at the introduction and coda, beginning the full music at the vocal section.[39] Performers probably included instrumental versions of the chorus while they played, a rare practice in early minstrelsy.[3]
