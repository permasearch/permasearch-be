This may not be the actual explanation; salt was a valuable commodity in ancient times,[3] and as such a symbol of trust and friendship. A German proverb held that "whoever spills salt arouses enmity".[4] According to Charles Nodier, among "savages", the "action of spilling salt ... indicates among them the refusal of protection and hospitality from such strangers as they may have reason to suspect are thieves and murderers."[5]
