The Fort at Number 4 in Charlestown, New Hampshire was the northernmost English settlement on the Connecticut River until the end of the French and Indian War in 1763. Abenaki Indians resisted British attempts at colonization, but Colonists began settling north of Brattleboro, Vermont following the war.[25] Settlement of the Upper Connecticut River Valley increased quickly, with population assessments of 36,000 by 1790.[25]
