A chalupa (Spanish pronunciation: [tʃaˈlupa]) is a specialty of south-central Mexico, including the states of Puebla, Guerrero, and Oaxaca. Chalupas are made by pressing a thin layer of masa dough around the outside a small mold, in the process creating a concave container resembling the boat of the same name, and then deep frying the result to produce crisp, shallow corn cups. These are filled with various ingredients such as shredded chicken, pork, chopped onion, chipotle pepper, red salsa, and/or green salsa.[1][2][3]
