Xiao-Mei (Gwendoline Yeo) is an illegal immigrant from China, sold by her uncle to Maxine Bennett (Jane Lynch) as a servant. After being liberated by the authorities, Father Crowley takes her to the Solises. Discovering Xiao-Mei could not be deported if she was the mother of an American citizen, Gabrielle suggested Xiao-Mei be their surrogate. However, Xiao-Mei did not understand the process Gabrielle and Carlos are proposing and initially refuses, thinking that she will be worthless if she does not preserve her virginity until marriage. Gabrielle convinces her that experience is what men want and Xiao-Mei agrees to have the baby. One day, Xiao-Mei catches Carlos in the master bath before the appointment at the fertility clinic, and undresses, preparing for sex. Gabrielle is unhappy that Xiao-Mei has misunderstood and Carlos does not correct her misconception. Later on, Gabrielle suspects Xiao-Mei is sleeping with Carlos and takes her to the hospital, and it is revealed she is no longer a virgin. Gabrielle puts baby monitors in the house to check on Xiao-Mei and Carlos, and eventually discovers that they were indeed having sex. Horrified, Gabrielle kicks Carlos out and asks for a divorce but tells Xiao-Mei to stay, causing tension between them to the point that she runs away once. Her water breaks at Bree's wedding and she looks quite guilty after giving birth to a black baby boy. Eventually Xiao-Mei moves to Chinatown to work for her friend in her restaurant.[citation needed]
