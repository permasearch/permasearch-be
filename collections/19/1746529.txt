The body has different types of hair, including vellus hair and androgenic hair, each with its own type of cellular construction.  The different construction gives the hair unique characteristics, serving specific purposes, mainly warmth and protection.[citation needed] Most humans develop the longest thickest hair on their scalps and (mostly observed in males) faces. This hair will usually grow to several feet before terminating, but many humans develop much longer hair.
