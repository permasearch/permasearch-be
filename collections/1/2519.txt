During season five Katherine struggles with being human again. She learns that her long-lost daughter, Nadia, is a vampire in Mystic Falls. Silas drains Katherine of all of her blood, to get the cure, and Katherine returns to life. However, she rapidly descends into old age from the 500 years of her existence. She uses her Traveler heritage to transfer her consciousness into Elena's body as hers dies, eventually taking control of Elena's body and masquerading as Elena to win Stefan's affection. Stefan and Caroline learn her identity and Stefan stabs her with the Traveler's Knife, releasing Katherine's soul from Elena's body. However, Katherine had injected Elena's body with Dr. Wes Maxfield's experimental "Ripper Serum", to turn Elena into a vampire who feeds from other vampires along with werewolf venom. An unknown force denies Katherine access to the Other Side and she was left in a dark void.
