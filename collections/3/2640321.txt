The two fundamental reference points in the anatomy of a rowing stroke are the catch where the oar blade is placed in the water,[1] and the extraction (also known as the 'finish', 'release' or 'tapping down') where the oar blade is removed from the water.[2] After the blade is placed in the water at the catch, the rower applies pressure to the oar levering the boat forward which is called the drive phase of the stroke.[3] Once the rower extracts the oar from the water, the recovery phase begins, setting up the rower's body for the next stroke.[4]
