The group established a routine of recording during the week and playing tourist on the weekends. Paul temporarily joined a local country club, where he would spend most mornings. The band would be driven to the studio in the early afternoon where recording would last into the late evening and sometimes early morning. To make up for the departed band members, Paul would play drums and lead guitar parts with Denny playing rhythm guitar and Linda adding keyboards.[2] The first track they recorded at Apapa was "Mamunia",[15] the title for which McCartney appropriated from the name of a hotel in Marrakesh where Wings had stayed in April 1973.[16]
