After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Penn founded the J/P Haitian Relief Organization,[51] which has been running a 55,000 person tent camp.[52] Due to his visibility as an on-the-ground advocate for rescue and aid efforts in the aftermath, Penn was designated by president Michel Martelly as Ambassador-at-Large for Haiti, the first time that a non-Haitian citizen has been designated as such in the country's history. Penn received the designation on January 31, 2012.[53]
