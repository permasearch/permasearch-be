Metro's zero-tolerance policy on food, trash and other sources of disorder embodies the "broken windows" philosophy of crime reduction. This philosophy also extends to the use of station restroom facilities. A longstanding policy, intended to curb unlawful and unwanted activity, has been to only allow employees to use Metro restrooms.[105] Station managers may make exceptions for passengers with small children, the elderly, or the disabled.[110] Metro now allows the use of restrooms by passengers who gain a station manager's permission, except during periods of heightened terror alerts.[111]
