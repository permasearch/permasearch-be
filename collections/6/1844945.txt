Eclipsing variables are star systems that vary in brightness because of one star passing in front of the other rather than from any intrinsic change in luminosity. W Ursae Minoris is one such system, its magnitude ranging from 8.51 to 9.59 over 1.7 days.[50] The combined spectrum of the system is A2V, but the masses of the two component stars are unknown. A slight change in the orbital period in 1973 suggests there is a third component of the multiple star system—most likely a red dwarf—with an orbital period of 62.2±3.9 years.[51] RU Ursae Minoris is another example, ranging from 10 to 10.66 over 0.52 days.[52] It is a semidetached system, as the secondary star is filling its Roche lobe and transferring matter to the primary.[53]
