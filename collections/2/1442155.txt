In Dogon thought, male and females are born with both sexual components. The clitoris is considered male, while the foreskin is considered female.[20] (Originally, for the Dogon, man was endowed with a dual soul, and circumcision eliminates the superfluous one.[24]) Rites of circumcision thus allow each sex to assume its proper physical identity.
