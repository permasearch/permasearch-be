As part of oral rehydration therapy, WHO recommends supplemental zinc (10 to 20Â mg daily) for ten to fourteen days, to reduce the severity and duration of the illness and make recurrent illness in the following two to three months less likely. Preparations are available as a zinc sulfate solution for adults, a modified solution for children and in tablet form.[34]
