The Incas built suspension rope bridges using grass. These bridges, which were made from ropes ingeniously tied together, formed a narrow but effective structure. This was the only way to cross rivers on foot. If only one of their hundreds of bridges was damaged, a major road could not fully function. Fortunately, every time a bridge broke, the locals would repair it as quickly as possible.
