In Radiator Springs, McQueen initially resumes his ungrateful, obnoxious, selfish, and sarcastic ways. He is sentenced by bitter local judge Doc Hudson to repair a road that he damaged, but instead he attempts escape. He is quickly recaptured and eventually fixes the road in order to regain his freedom. He doesn't do it properly at first, but to take a break, he tries to accept help from Doc, but blows him off. In the process, McQueen learns about the history of Radiator Springs and begins to relate to its inhabitants. A tow truck named Mater befriends him and he falls in love with a sports car named Sally Carrera. He also learns old racing moves from Doc, who is revealed to be a former Piston Cup champion whose racing career was cut short by a serious crash. After fixing the road, and staying there, McQueen is free to leave Radiator Springs and resume his journey to California. However, he selflessly delays his departure to show appreciation for his new friends by performing good deeds. During his time at Radiator Springs, McQueen's personality slowly begins to change. He begins to care about others rather than just himself and no longer disrespects them. He also isn't as cocky as he once was while on the race track.
