Using deficit spending, a government-sponsored programme for economic renewal focused on public works projects. In public work projects of 1934, 1.7 million Germans immediately were put to work, which gave them an income and social benefits.[60] The most famous of the projects was the high speed roadway, the Reichsautobahn, known as the German autobahns.[61] Other capital construction projects included hydroelectric facilities such as the Rur Dam, water supplies such as Zillierbach Dam, and transportation hubs such as Zwickau Hauptbahnhof.[62] Over the next five years, unemployment plummeted and average wages both per hour and per week rose.[63]
