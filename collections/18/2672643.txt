Republicans elected with Tea Party support in 2010, most notably Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin, have launched major efforts against public sector unions due in part to state government pension obligations along with the allegation that the unions are too powerful.[23] Walker was challenged by a coalition of unions and Democrats, but beat back a recall effort and was reelected in 2014.[24]
