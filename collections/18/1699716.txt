While practical restraints currently limit the Forensic Anthropology Research Facility to only around seven acres[19] in the Texas Hill Country, Freeman Ranch has about 4,200 acres (17Â km2) available.[20] Freeman Ranch is a working ranch that also serves as an educational model for ranch management. It is an area of land for educational outreach and research. Researchers and students visit the ranch and participate in educational activities and projects. Researchers and students are allowed to conduct experiments and studies at the ranch, including forensic anthropology.[21]
