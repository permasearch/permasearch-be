Approximately 90% of the metabolism of ethanol occurs in the liver.[5][6] This occurs predominantly via the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, which transforms ethanol into its metabolite acetaldehyde (ethanal).[5][6] Acetaldehyde is subsequently metabolized by the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase into acetate (ethanoate), which in turn is broken down into carbon dioxide and water.[5] Acetate also combines with coenzyme A to form acetyl-CoA, and hence may participate in metabolic pathways.[7] Alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase are present at their highest concentrations in the liver, but are widely expressed throughout the body, and alcohol dehydrogenase may also be present in the stomach and small intestine.[7] Aside from alcohol dehydrogenase, the microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system (MEOS), specifically mediated by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2E1, is the other major route of ethanol metabolism.[5][6] CYP2E1 is inducible by ethanol, so while alcohol dehydrogenase handles acute or low concentrations of ethanol, MEOS is predominant with higher concentrations or with repeated/chronic use.[5][6] A small amount of ethanol undergoes conjugation to form ethyl glucuronide and ethyl sulfate.[7] There may also be another metabolic pathway that metabolizes as much as 25 to 35% of ethanol at typical concentrations.[8]
