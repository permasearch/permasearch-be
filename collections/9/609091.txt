The brachial plexus is a bundle of nerves innervating the shoulder and arm and can be blocked at different levels depending on the type of upper extremity surgery being performed.  Interscalene brachial plexus blocks can be done before shoulder, arm, and elbow surgery.[11] The interscalene block is done at the neck where the brachial plexus emerges between the anterior and middle scalene muscles.  Lidocaine is injected first to numb the skin and then a blunt needle is used to protect the nerves from damage as the physician places the needle very close to the nerves. The needle goes in about 3–4 cm and a single shot of local anesthetic is injected or a catheter is placed.[11] The most common local anesthetics used at the site of the nerves are bupivicaine, mepivicaine, and chloroprocaine.[11]  There is a very high chance that the phrenic nerve, which innervates the diaphragm, will be blocked so this block should only be done on patients who have use of their accessory respiratory muscles.[11] The block may not affect the C8 and T1 roots which supply part of the hand, so it is usually not done for hand surgeries.[11]
