The origin of the lineage stems from Infante Alfonso de la Cerda (1270â€“1333), son of the heir to the throne, Infante Ferdinand de la Cerda who died before his father, Alfonso X. The Alfonso X always stated his successor was his grandson Alfonso de la Cerda, instead of his second son, Infante Sancho. This motivated Sancho to revolt against his father. After a long civil war Sancho was finally crowned. Following an unsuccessful invasion by Aragon and Portugal, a peace settlement removed the Infante de la Cerdas from contention for the Castilian throne.[2]
