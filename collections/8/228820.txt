Another indication of official acceptance of the concept of Scottish nationality can be found on the website of the Court of the Lord Lyon (a part of the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service[9] with both criminal and civil jurisdiction). This states, when referring to the Saltire or Scottish flag: "this is the correct flag for all Scots or Scottish corporate bodies to fly to demonstrate their loyalty and their Scottish nationality".[10] (The same statement is to be found, attributed to the Scottish Parliament Public Information Service in 2002, recorded on a commercial website which was archived in May 2006.[11] Both dates precede May 2007 when the Scottish National Party first formed the Scottish administration.)
