In general, Triple DES with three independent keys (keying option 1) has a key length of 168 bits (three 56-bit DES keys), but due to the meet-in-the-middle attack, the effective security it provides is only 112 bits.[13] Keying option 2 reduces the effective key size to 112 bits (because the third key is the same as the first). However, this option is susceptible to certain chosen-plaintext or known-plaintext attacks,[18][19] and thus, it is designated by NIST to have only 80 bits of security.[13] This can be considered broken, as the whole 3des keyspace can be searched thoroughly by affordable consumer hardware today (2017).[citation needed]
