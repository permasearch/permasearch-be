Closing credits, however, bear the standard all persons fictitious disclaimer for a work of fiction.[6] Regarding this apparent discrepancy, the Coen brothers claimed that they based their script on an actual criminal event, but wrote a fictional story around it. "We weren't interested in that kind of fidelity", Joel Coen said. "The basic events are the same as in the real case, but the characterizations are fully imaginedÂ ... If an audience believes that something's based on a real event, it gives you permission to do things they might otherwise not accept."[7]
