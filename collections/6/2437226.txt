Language differences are another common barrier to educational success. Migrant students that speak a language other than the region's dominant language struggle with basic comprehension and literacy, which affects success in school.[2][3] Even students who are fluent in the regions dominant language but face challenges with the written or academic form of the language are often placed in lower-level or special education classes that have the potential to undermine their academic proficiency. Additionally, while a student may have a high level of language acquisition, cultural differences that include short answer responses, unexpected expressions, and mannerisms, can be misunderstood as language deficit. Schools that have contemplated a separate program for second language learning face challenges with limited resources and an insufficient amount of participating students. Language challenges amongst migrant students create a significant barrier given that language deficiency is often tied to alienation and ridicule from peers, and in some cases, academic punishment.[6]
