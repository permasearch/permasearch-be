Almirola started the 2017 season without a teammate, and finished 4th at the 2017 Daytona 500. Almirola was hit with a 35 point penalty loss after the Talladega race. During the Go Bowling 400 at Kansas Speedway on May 13, Almirola was involved in a violent crash along with Joey Logano and Danica Patrick. After Logano's brake rotor exploded, he collided with Patrick, sending both straight into the wall. Almirola attempted to avoid the wreck, but instead slammed into Logano. Although he was conscious, Almirola was cut out of his car, placed onto a stretcher and airlifted to the University of Kansas Hospital.[16] Almirola was diagnosed with a compression fracture of his T5 vertebrae, released from the University of Kansas Hospital after overnight observation and will travel back to North Carolina, where he will have a follow-up consultation with his doctors in Charlotte. Almirola was also reported to have the ability to walk the day after his violent wreck. He expected to miss 8â€“12 weeks.[17] He was replaced by Regan Smith for the Monster Energy Open, which led up to the Monster Energy NASCAR All-Star Race the Coca-Cola 600, and the AAA 400 Drive for Autism.[18] Darrell Wallace Jr.[19] and Billy Johnson also substituted for Almirola.[20] On June 29, Almirola stated he would undergo track tests in Charlotte or Darlington before being medically cleared to race in low-banking tracks like Indianapolis or New Hampshire to decrease stress on his back.[21] On July 12, he announced he had been cleared to return to racing at Loudon's Overton's 301.[22]
