PTSD can affect several parts of the brain such as the amygdala, hippocampus, and the prefrontal cortex. The amygdala controls our memory and emotional processing; the hippocampus helps with organizing, storing and memory forming.  Hippocampus is the most sensitive area to stress.[50] The prefrontal cortex helps with our expression and personality and helps regulate complex cognitive and our behavior functions.
