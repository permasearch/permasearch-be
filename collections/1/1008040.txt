Since his first game, Mario has usually had the role of saving the damsel in distress.[54] Originally, he had to rescue his girlfriend Pauline in Donkey Kong from Donkey Kong.[65] Pauline was soon replaced by a new damsel in distress, Princess Peach, in Super Mario Bros.,[3] but returned in the Game Boy remake of Donkey Kong in 1994, and in Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis in 2006, although the character is now described as "Mario's friend".[66] Mario has rescued Princess Peach multiple times since Super Mario Bros.[54] In a role reversal, Peach rescues Mario in Super Princess Peach.[67] Mario rescued Princess Daisy of Sarasaraland in Super Mario Land,[68] but Luigi seems to be more linked to her. In Super Smash Bros. Melee, the text explaining Daisy's trophy states that "after her appearance in Mario Golf, gossips portrayed her as Luigi's answer to Mario's Peach".[69]
