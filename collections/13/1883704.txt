The killing of polio workers seen the previous year continued in 2013. Seven clinic workers whose duties included vaccination were killed in Swabi, Pakistan on New Year's Day. The Pakistani government began providing police and paramilitary protection to a renewed vaccination campaign,[40] but amid worries that this would inspire hostility, some escorts have been refused. Both escorting officers[41][42][43] and polio workers continue to be killed in Pakistan, where vaccination has been said to violate Islamic law.[44][45] In February a pair of similar attacks in Nigeria killed nine female polio vaccinators following a local cleric's condemnation of vaccination.[46] The security situation in Afghanistan improved in May when the Afghani Taliban announced it would support polio eradication, pledging to do nothing to hinder the campaign as long as no foreigners were involved in the vaccinations.[47] In December 2013, three polio workers were killed in northwest Pakistan and three more were killed in Karachi in January 2014.[48]
