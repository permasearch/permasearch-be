Stan Freberg Presents The United States of America, Volume Two was planned for a release during America's Bicentennial in 1976, but did not emerge until 1996. In his autobiography, Freberg detailed his efforts to have the songs and skits produced on Broadway; when this failed, he used material omitted from the original album in the sequel.
