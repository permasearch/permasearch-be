Two new game elements were introduced in this season. Leg 1 introduced the Hazard, a penalty that one team incurs for being the last team to finish the starting-line task. According to Keoghan, the Hazard was added to "test people's mental strength out of the gate", and claims it had a "rolling effect" throughout the rest of the Race.[8] Leg 2 was the first time in which two teams were eliminated at the Pit Stop (In Season 10, two teams were eliminated during the first leg, but not both at the Pit Stop. In Season 15, two teams were eliminated after the first episode).[7]
