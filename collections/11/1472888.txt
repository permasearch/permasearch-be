In December 2009 the rhinos were moved to the Ol Pejeta Conservancy for a "Last Chance To Survive" breeding program, along with three other northern white rhinoceroses. It was hoped that Ol Pejeta would provide a more natural habitat and better hormonal balance for the animals to induce breeding.[5][20] However, breeding attempts with Sudan at Ol Pejeta Conservancy were unsuccessful.[21]
