For the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California, composer John Williams wrote "Olympic Fanfare and Theme", which is played in a medley with "Bugler's Dream." It consists of Williams's arrangement of "Bugler's Dream" which is similar to Arnaud's original but with a repeat of the theme with a full orchestra, followed by Williams's composition.[6] Williams's arrangement of Arnaud's "Bugler's Dream" as well as "Olympic Fanfare and Theme" are both commonly used in recent Olympic coverage by NBC. It is also commonly played during graduation ceremonies in the United States.
