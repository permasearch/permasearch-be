The Tate Modern considers Kahlo "one of the most significant artists of the twentieth century",[242] while according to art historian Elizabeth Bakewell, she is "one of Mexico's most important twentieth-century figures".[243] Kahlo's reputation as an artist developed late in her life, and even further posthumously, as during her lifetime she was primarily known as the wife of Diego Rivera and as an eccentric personality among the international cultural elite.[244] She gradually gained more recognition in the late 1970s, when feminist scholars began to question the exclusion of female and non-Western artists from the art historical canon, and the Chicano Movement lifted her as one of their icons.[245][246] The first two books about Kahlo were published in Mexico by Teresa del Conde and Raquel Tibol in 1976 and 1977, respectively,[247] and in 1977, The Tree of Hope Stands Firm (1944) became the first Kahlo painting to be sold in an auction, netting $19,000 at Sotheby's.[248] These milestones were followed by the first two retrospectives ever staged on Kahlo's oeuvre in 1978, one at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City and another at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago.[247]
