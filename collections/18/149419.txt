Initially, only teams from the US competed in the Series but it has since become a worldwide tournament. The tournament has gained popular renown, especially in the United States, where games from the Series and even from regional tournaments are broadcast on ESPN. In 2006, the age limit was changed to include players who turn 13 after April 30 of the same year, rather than after July 31, as had previously been the case. As the Series takes place in August, many of the players will have already turned 13 before the Series starts. In 2014 Little League originally voted to change the age cut off from April 30th to December 31st. However, this caused outrage by parents because the players born between May 1 and August 31, 2005 would have lost their 12 year old season because they would be considered to be 13 years old even though they have not reached their 13th birthday. Effective November, 2015, a new implementation plan was established, which "grandfathers" players born between May 1 and August 31, 2005 as 12-year-olds for the 2018 seasons, using the current April 30 age determination date for the 2018 season. Beginning with 2019, a new determination date of August 31 will be used, which will ban 13 year old players from participating in the Series. Thus, players would have to have their 13th birthday after August 31st.
