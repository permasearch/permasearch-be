For aerodynamic aircraft which operate relative to the air, winds affect groundspeed,[89] and in the case of lighter-than-air vehicles, wind may play a significant or solitary role in their movement and ground track.[90] The velocity of surface wind is generally the primary factor governing the direction of flight operations at an airport, and airfield runways are aligned to account for the common wind direction(s) of the local area. While taking off with a tailwind may be necessary under certain circumstances, a headwind is generally desirable. A tailwind increases takeoff distance required and decreases the climb gradient.[91]
