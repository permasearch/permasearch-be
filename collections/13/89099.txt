Deer mouse pups usually disperse after weaning and before the birth of the next litter, when they are reaching sexual maturity. Occasionally juveniles remain in the natal area, particularly when breeding space is limited.[17] Most deer mice travel less than 152 m (499 ft) from the natal area to establish their own home range.[18]
