As pregnancy tests, quantitative blood tests and the most sensitive urine tests usually detect hCG between 6 and 12 days after ovulation.[25] It must be taken into account, however, that total hCG levels may vary in a very wide range within the first 4 weeks of gestation, leading to false results during this period.[26] A rise of 35% over 48 hours is proposed as the minimal rise consistent with a viable intrauterine pregnancy.[24]
