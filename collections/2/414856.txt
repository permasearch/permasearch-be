The first film differs significantly from the novel.  The setting is moved from England to Vermont, the character of Ian is introduced much earlier in the story and several character names were changed.[4] A new introduction to the story was also written, to introduce important backstory.[3] However, author Robin Jones Gunn felt that "the heart of the story I'd written was still there".[4]
