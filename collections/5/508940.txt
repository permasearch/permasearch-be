The cut-and-thrust mortuary sword was used after 1625 by cavalry during the English Civil War. This (usually) two-edged sword sported a half-basket hilt with a straight blade some 90–105 cm long. Later in the 17th century, the swords used by cavalry became predominantly single-edged. The so-called walloon sword (épée wallone)[57] was common in the Thirty Years' War and Baroque era.[58] Its hilt was ambidextrous with shell-guards and knuckle-bow that inspired 18th century continental hunting hangers.[59] Following their campaign in the Netherlands in 1672, the French began producing this weapon as their first regulation sword.[60] Weapons of this design were also issued to the Swedish army from the time of Gustavus Adolphus until as late as the 1850s.[61]
