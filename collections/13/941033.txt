Michael Silverstein has argued that "nonreferential" or "pure" indices do not contribute to an utterance's referential meaning but instead "signal some particular value of one or more contextual variables."[14] Although nonreferential indexes are devoid of semantico-referential meaning, they do encode "pragmatic" meaning.
