In practice, the federation faced insurmountable problems, and the union slid into civil war between 1838 and 1840.[5] Its disintegration began when Nicaragua separated from the federation on November 5, 1838, followed by Honduras and Costa Rica[6] (other sources give Nicaragua's secession date as April 30).[7] Because of the chaotic nature of this period an exact date of disestablishment does not exist, but on May 31, 1838, the congress met to declare that the provinces were free to create their own independent republics.[7] In reality, this merely legally acknowledged the process of disintegration that had already begun.[8] The union effectively ended in 1840, by which time four of its five states had declared independence. The official end came only upon El Salvador's self-proclamation of the establishment of an independent republic in February 1841.
