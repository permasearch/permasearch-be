Described by Revolver Magazine as "oversexed, under-thought, and relentlessly fun",[7] the album's style is often described as "glam metal" and was strongly influenced by East-Coast bands like Aerosmith and Kiss and It is a sound dominated by distorted power chords and catchy melodies. Reflecting a period before the band's music began to take on the influence of Californian, Van Halen styled stadium rock, the album is characterized by more traditional heavy metal sounds.
