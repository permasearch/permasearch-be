Ash Murphy (played by Todd Stashwick) is a corrupt prison guard at Tramble who is bribed by Boyd in order to gain access to Dickie Bennett in solitary confinement. Ash overhears Dickie telling Boyd about Mags' fortune he is to inherit from Ellstin Limehouse. Ash then sets out on his own agenda to get the money, going as far as to threaten to make Dickie's life in prison miserable if he doesn't tell him where the money is located. Along with a prison medic named Lance, Ash orchestrates a huge prison fight that results in both Dickie and Dewey (the latter having jumped in to defend Dickie and becomes a liability) being badly injured and slips both men unnoticed out of the prison in a coroner's van. Ash is unable to get Dickie into Noble's Holler due to a roadblock and decides to get Dickie to lead Limehouse to them with the money. While bringing food to the motel they are staying at, Ash attempts to shoot at Raylan, resulting in him being run over twice and telling Raylan they are meeting at Limehouse at Mags' old general store with the money.
