Common starlings can eat and damage fruit in orchards such as grapes, peaches, olives, currants and tomatoes or dig up newly sown grain and sprouting crops.[39][118] They may also eat animal feed and distribute seeds through their droppings. In eastern Australia, weeds like bridal creeper, blackberry and boneseed are thought to have been spread by common starlings.[119] Agricultural damage in the US is estimated as costing about US$800 million annually.[114] This bird is not considered to be as damaging to agriculture in South Africa as it is in the United States.[65]
