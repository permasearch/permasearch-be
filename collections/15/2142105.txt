Some modern researchers argue that Crimea's geopolitical position[which?] fueled Soviet perceptions of Crimean Tatars as a potential threat.[47] This belief is based in part on an analogy with numerous other cases of deportations of non-Russians from boundary territories, as well as the fact that other non-Russian populations, such as Greeks, Armenians and Bulgarians were also removed from Crimea.[citation needed]
