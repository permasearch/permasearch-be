During the Great Chilean earthquake, several landslides west of Tralcán Mountain blocked the outflow of Riñihue Lake. Riñihue Lake is the lowest of the Seven Lakes chain and receives a constant inflow from the Enco River.[22] The blocked San Pedro River, which drains the lake, passes through several towns before reaching the city of Valdivia near the coast.[23]
