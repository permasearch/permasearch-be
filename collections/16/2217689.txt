It has to be noted that this list gives only an overview, and certainly does not mention all of the Protestant denominations. An exact number of Protestant denominations is difficult to calculate and depends on definition. It has to be noted that a group that fits the generally accepted definition of Protestant might not officially use the term. Therefore, it should be taken with caution.
