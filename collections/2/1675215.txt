The five members of Supertramp make cameo appearances in the video.  At the beginning, John Helliwell is a street musician playing an alto saxophone.  Before the first chorus, Dougie Thomson appears as the bus driver (this was the last filmed video where Thomson would appear with his then trademark moustache and beard).  Hodgson plays the a guitar-playing bus passenger.  Lastly, Rick Davies and Bob Siebenberg play the two pickup truck rednecks.
