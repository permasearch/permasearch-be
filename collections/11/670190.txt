In 1949, the Chippewa served on the route, except during summers, when Chippewa was transferred to the Anacortes-Sidney route.[3] From 1951 to 1968, the main ferry on the route was the Illahee which ran along with the Quinault (1951-1953), Evergreen State (1954-1959), and Tillikum (1959-1968), with the steam ferry San Mateo occasionally running as an extra boat.[1]
