In June 2007 Tata Motors launched the passenger variant of the Ace, named Magic featuring an all-steel cabin. It offers a flexible seating capacity of 4-7 passengers with adequate legroom. Powered by a 16 bhp (12 kW), 702 cc water-cooled diesel engine, the Magic offers high fuel efficiency and very low maintenance. The Magic's turning radius of 4.3 metres (14.1 ft) is nimble enough to navigate the bylanes and traffic of India's crowded cities. The Magic has a clearly visible instrument cluster, utility tray and a digital clock in the dashboard and also a provision for fitting a radio.
