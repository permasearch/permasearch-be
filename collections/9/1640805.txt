Since the merger in 2007, MTR has consistently achieved a 99.9% on-time rate, meaning out of the 5.2 million passengers on average each working day, 5.195 million passengers arrive within 5 minutes of scheduled time.[91] This makes MTR one of the most efficient rapid transit systems on the planet.[92] MTR must report all delays of more than eight minutes to the government. There were 143 reportable incidents in 2013.[91] MTR is fined HK$1 million for having delays of 31 minutes to an hour, with higher fines for longer delays.[93]
