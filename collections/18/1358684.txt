A series of experiments eventually led to the discovery of Okazaki fragments. The experiments (see below) were conducted during the 1960s with Reiji Okazaki, Tsuneko Okazaki, Kiwako Sakabe and their colleagues during their research on DNA replication of Escherichia coli.[3] In 1966, Kiwako Sakabe and Reiji Okazaki first showed that DNA replication was a discontinuous process involving fragments.[4] The fragments were further investigated by the researchers and their colleagues through their research including the study on bacteriophage DNA replication in Escherichia coli.[5][6][7]
