The first run of three episodes screened on BBC Four from 19 May 2005. A further three episodes were transmitted 20 October â€“ 3 November 2005. The six episodes were repeated on BBC Two in early 2006, and later on BBC America together as a single series. The subsequent DVD release of all six episodes calls them The Complete First Series. An hour-long Christmas special, "The Rise of the Nutters", aired in January 2007 with a further ten episodes planned for later on in the year, however this did not occur. Instead, another one-off hour-long episode "Spinners and Losers" aired on 3 July 2007.[1] It was followed by a 15-minute extra which was made available through BBC Red Button.
