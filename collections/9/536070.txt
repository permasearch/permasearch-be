The age of consent is 18 regardless of sexual orientation and/or gender.[16]  Although Djiboutian law establishes that parties to a marriage should be 18 or over, there is an exemption in cases where minors may marry with the consent of their guardians.  Effectively this means the age of consent is lower than 18, especially in rural areas; in 2007, 13.6% of married women under the age of 50 married before the age of 18.[17]
