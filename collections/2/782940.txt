In the United Kingdom, the reserve powers of the monarch (which are typically referred to as the "royal prerogative")[33] are not explicitly stated in constitutional enactments, and are the province of convention and common law.[34] In Australia, however, the powers are explicitly given to the Governor-General in the constitution; it is their use that is the subject of convention.[35]
