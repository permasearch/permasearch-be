LCUs operate on the premise that the territorial boundary of the LGU, with all the education infrastructure and facilities built by the province, city, or municipality, is the university campus itself. It means that an LCU has free access to all the structures found in the LGU, including its library, sports complex, hospitals, business establishments, and barangay centers.[1]
