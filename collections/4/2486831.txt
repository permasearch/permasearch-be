Despite Montreal's rapid growth in the second half of the 20th century, this configuration remained unchanged for 41 years. In 1998, the off-island suburbs (Laval, Montérégie, etc.) became area code 450, which now completely surrounds 514. This left 514 as the Island of Montreal and a few surrounding smaller islands.
