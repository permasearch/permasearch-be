A more formal greeting commonly used among religiously observant Jews is Ketivah VaChatimah Tovah (Hebrew: כְּתִיבָה וַחֲתִימָה טוֹבָה‎‎), which translates as "A good inscription and sealing [in the Book of Life]",[32] or L'shanah tovah tikatevu v'tichatemu meaning "May you be inscribed and sealed for a good year".[33][34] After Rosh Hashanah ends, the greeting is changed to G’mar chatimah tovah (Hebrew: גמר חתימה טובה‎‎) meaning "A good final sealing", until Yom Kippur. After Yom Kippur is over, until Hoshana Rabbah, as Sukkot ends, the greeting is Gmar Tov (Hebrew: גְּמָר טוֹב‎‎), "a good conclusion".
