During the 2007 postseason, with Crisp struggling, Ellsbury started in center field for Game 6 of the 2007 American League Championship Series (ALCS) against the Cleveland Indians, and started the remainder of the postseason for the Red Sox. In 11 postseason games, he hit .360 in 25 at-bats with two stolen bases.[36] With his two doubles off Josh Fogg in the top of the third inning of Game 3 of the 2007 World Series on October 27, Ellsbury became the first rookie to hit two doubles in the same inning of a World Series game. After hitting another double off Brian Fuentes in the eighth inning, he became the fourth rookie ever to hit three doubles in a World Series game. His four hits, including a single in the first inning, made him only the third rookie to ever accomplish the feat in the World Series, after Freddie Lindstrom in the 1924 World Series and Joe Garagiola in the 1946 World Series.[37] He batted .438 with four doubles and a stolen base for the World Series.[36] The Red Sox eventually won the World Series in a 4-game sweep over the Rockies, giving Ellsbury his first career championship title.
