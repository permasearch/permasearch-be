Leaving Spartan Stadium for the first time on the season, the Spartans traveled to take on rival Michigan in a matchup for the Paul Bunyon Trophy. No. 7-ranked Michigan looked like the better team to start the game as they went 64 yards on 16 plays, but stalled on the MSU 11-yard line and settled for a 30-yard field goal to take an early 3–0 lead. The unranked Spartans were forced to punt on their first possession and, after a first down for Michigan, MSU took control of the game. Joe Bachie stripped Michigan's Ty Isaac and Chris Frey recovered the fumble at the Michigan 46-yard line. The Spartans drove straight down the field and Brian Lewerke scrambled in from 14 yards out to give the Spartans a 7–3 lead. The MSU defense forced Michigan to punt and the Spartan offense stalled at the Michigan 47. Following another punt by the Wolverines, the Spartans capped off an 83-yard drive with a Madre London 16-yard run to put the Spartans up 14–3. Another forced fumble by the Spartan defense ended a Michigan drive at the Spartan 29-yard line with just over a minute remaining in the half. The Spartans happily went to the locker room with a 14–3 lead.
