That's Just the Way I Want to Be is a 1970 (see 1970 in music) album by Blossom Dearie. It is noteworthy among her recordings in that, for the first time, the focus is on Dearie as a songwriter with her co-writing nine of the album's 12 tracks). She took the opportunity to pay tribute to some of her well-known contemporaries: John Lennon (the object of her praise in "Hey John"), Georgie Fame and Dusty Springfield. The last song, "I Like London In The Rain", contains an opening breakbeat that has been sampled by hip hop producers.
