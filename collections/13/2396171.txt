Many practitioners combine their polytheistic world-view with a pantheistic conception of the natural world as being sacred and imbued with a divine energy force permeating all life.[67] Heathenry is animistic,[57] with practitioners believing in nonhuman spirit persons commonly known as "wights" (vættir) that inhabit the world,[68] each of whom is believed to have its own personality.[13] Some of these are known as "land spirits" (landvættir) and inhabit different aspects of the landscape, living alongside humans, whom they can both help and hinder.[69] Others are deemed to be household deities and live within the home, where they can be propitiated with offerings of food.[70] Some Heathens interact with these entities and provide offerings to them more often than they do with the gods and goddesses.[71] Wights are often identified with various creatures from Northwestern European folklore such as elves, dwarves, gnomes, and trolls.[72] Some of these entities—such as the Jötunn of Norse mythology—are deemed to be baleful spirits; within the community it is often deemed taboo to provide offerings to them, although some practitioners still do so.[73] Many Heathens also believe in and respect ancestral spirits.[74]
