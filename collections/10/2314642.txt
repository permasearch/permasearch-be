Like people, some horses are "easy keepers" and prone to obesity, while others are "hard keepers" and need a great deal of food just to maintain a slim build. The average riding horse weighs roughly 1,000 pounds (450Â kg), but the weight of a horse can be more closely estimated using a weight tape, which can be purchased from a feed store or tack shop.
