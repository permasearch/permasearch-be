I SING about de long-tail blue, So often you want someting new; Wid your desire I'll now comply, An' sing about de blue-tail fly.  Jim Crack com', I don't care,  Jim Crack com', I don't care,  Jim Crack com', I don't care.   Ole Massa well a-day.  When I was home, I used to wait On Massa—han' him roun' de plate; I pass'd de bottle when he was dry, An' brush'd away de blue-tail fly.    Jim Crack com', &c  Ole Massa ride in de arternoon, I follows him wid a kickeribroom; De pony rear'd when he was dry, An' bitten by de blue-tail fly.    Jim Crack com', &c.  De pony jump'd, he rear'd, he pitch'd, He tumbled Massa in a ditch; De wonder was he didn't die, When bitten by de blue-tail fly.    Jim Crack com', &c.  Dey buried him 'neath a simmon tree; His paragraph is dere, you'll see; Beneath de shade he's forced to lie, All by de means ob de blue-tail fly.    Jim Crack com', &c.  Ole Massa's dead, so let him res'; Dey say all tings is for de bes'. I shall neber forget to de day I die, Ole Massa an' de blue-tail fly.    Jim Crack com', &c.
