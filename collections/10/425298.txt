The Holy See has named him a Commander of the Order of Saint Sebastian for his charitable works. At the ceremony, Michael and Kay have an uneasy reunion after nine years. Kay wants their son, Anthony, to have nothing to do with the Corleone "legacy", and tells Michael that both she and Anthony know the truth about Fredo's death. Michael had initially wanted Anthony to finish law school, but consents to Anthony becoming an opera singer.
