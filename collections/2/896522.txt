In August 2013, the selection committee headed by Michael Ferreira recommended sport shooter Ronjan Sodhi for the award, with some committee members questioning the process of selection.[34] A committee member noted that discus thrower Krishna Poonia, and Paralympic athlete H. N. Girisha were shortlisted and Sodhi was not the initial choice. However, Girisha's name was removed, and the final voting was done between Sodhi and Poonia.[35] Poonia was accused of lobbying for the award by one of the committee member Anjali Bhagwat,[36] but the accused met the then Union Sports Minister Jitendra Singh to promote her case and also rubbished the lobbying allegations.[37][38] The Ministry conducted a separate enquiry by Secretary of Department of Sports and decided not to increase the number of awards "to maintain the stature of the awards".[37]
