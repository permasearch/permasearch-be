The island has almost 5 miles of waterfront pathways, and a greenway under the Hell Gate Viaduct is almost completed. By 2015 a connection to the South Bronx Greenway was planned to be completed, with additional waterfront pathway sections, a naturalized "living shoreline," and further environmental restoration.[26] Greenway segments are part of the East Coast Greenway, a 3,000 mile long trail system connecting Maine to Florida.
