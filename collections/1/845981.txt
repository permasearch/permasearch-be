The Division Bell deals with themes of communication and the idea that talking can solve many problems.[1] In the Studio radio host Redbeard suggested that the album offered "the very real possibility of transcending it all, through shivering moments of grace".[2] Songs such as "Poles Apart" and "Lost for Words" have been interpreted[by whom?] as references to the estrangement between Pink Floyd and former band member Roger Waters, who left in 1985; however, Gilmour denied this, and said: "People can invent and relate to a song in their personal ways, but it's a little late at this point for us to be conjuring Roger up."[3] The title refers to the division bell rung in the British parliament to announce a vote.[4][nb 1] Drummer Nick Mason said: "It does have some meaning. It's about people making choices, yeas or nays."[3]
