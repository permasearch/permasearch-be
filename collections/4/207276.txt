Spider monkeys form loose groups, typically with 15 to 25 individuals,[23] but sometimes up to 30 or 40.[24][25] During the day, groups break up into subgroups of two to eight animals. The size of subgroups and the degree to which they avoid each other during the day depends on food competition and the risk of predation. The average subgroup size is between 2 and 8[26] but can sometimes be up to 17 animals.[25] Also less common in primates, females rather than males disperse at puberty to join new groups. Males tend to stick together for their whole lives. Hence, males in a group are more likely to be related and have closer bonds than females. The strongest social bonds are formed between females and their young offspring.[27]
