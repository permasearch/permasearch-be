Some reviewers recognised an improved draw distance over Grand Theft Auto III, although many identified frame rate drops during hardware-intense sequences.[8][43][44] The changes in character models polarised reviews; while GameSpy's Padilla and IGN's Perry noted the improvement in character models,[43][44] Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell considered it "maddening to see that characterÂ ... models haven't been smartened up at all".[4] The game's artificial intelligence and long load times were frequently criticised in reviews,[4][8][13] and many reviewers noted the awkward camera angles and environment during gameplay.[2][13][42]
