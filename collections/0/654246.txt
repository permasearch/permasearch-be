The circle changeup is one well-known grip.[5] The pitcher forms a circle with the index finger and thumb and lays the middle and index fingers across the seams of the ball. By pronating the wrist upon release, the pitcher can make the pitch break in the same direction as a screwball. More or less break will result from the pitcher's arm slot. Pedro Mart√≠nez used this pitch throughout his career to great effect, and many considered it to be his best pitch.[6]
