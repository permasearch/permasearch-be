On April 4, the forts of Loreto and Guadalupe surrendered. Unlike at Puebla, Díaz forgave all the officers taken prisoner in the hills of Loreto and Guadalupe.[13] He declared later:"The executions (of Puebla) caused me a painful impression, and since then I decided to stop them..."[10] The decision of Díaz caused him great problems with Benito Juárez, with whom he had an acrimonious relationship despite his wins for the Republican cause.[14]
