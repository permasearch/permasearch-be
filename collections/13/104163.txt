In 1688, the Spanish sent three more expeditions, two by sea and one by land. The land expedition, led by Alonso De Le贸n, discovered Jean Gery, who had deserted the French colony and was living in Southern Texas with the Coahuiltecans.[42] Using Gery as a translator and guide, De Le贸n finally found the French fort in late April 1689.[43] The fort and the five crude houses surrounding it were in ruins.[31] Several months before, the Karankawa had attacked the settlement. They destroyed the structures and left the bodies of three people, including a woman who had been shot in the back.[43] A Spanish priest who had accompanied De Le贸n conducted funeral services for the three victims.[31] The chronicler of the Spanish expedition, Juan Bautista Chapa, wrote that the devastation was God's punishment for opposing the Pope, as Pope Alexander VI had granted the Indies exclusively to the Spanish.[43][44] The remains of the fort were destroyed by the Spanish, who also buried the French cannons left behind.[45] The Spanish later built a fort on the same location.[46]
