Sarah Hart is the only one person at John's new school in Ohio, other than Sam, that offered to be close with him. John and Sarah officially became a couple after the Haunted Hayride in book one. Sarah is portrayed as an intelligent and extremely beautiful teenage girl with straight blond hair past her shoulders, ivory skin, high cheekbones, and soft blue eyes. Originally a cheerleader, she dated Mark, John's rival at school. After her parents realized what a bad influence Mark was, they sent her away for the summer. Upon her return, inspired by the sights she had seen during her time away, she quit the cheerleading squad and broke up with Mark. She is passionate about photography and animals. She became friends with John when they met and soon started a relationship. After John saves her from a house fire, she realizes he is not human and John is then compelled to tell her the truth. Despite knowing that he is not human, Sarah finds herself deeply in love with John and confesses it to him, which he does the same. After the Mogadorians try to kill John, he leaves her, unwillingly, at the end of I Am Number Four, promising to come back.
