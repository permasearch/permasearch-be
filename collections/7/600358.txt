The leadership in Hanoi was despondent at the outcome of their offensive.[162][163] Their first and most ambitious goal, producing a general uprising, had ended in a dismal failure. In total, about 85,000â€“100,000 communist troops had participated in the initial onslaught and in the follow-up phases. Overall, during the "Border Battles" of 1967 and the nine-month winter-spring campaign, 45,267 communist troops had been killed in action.[164]
