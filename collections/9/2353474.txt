The second season of In the Dark began with the release of its first two episodes on May 1, 2018, with one new episode being released each Tuesday through July 3, 2018.  Season 2 explored the legal odyssey surrounding Curtis Flowers, who was accused of shooting four people to death inside Tardy Furniture, a Winona, Mississippi store, in July 1996.  Flowers, who had worked at Tardy Furniture for only a few days and who has long maintained his innocence, faced trial for the murders 6 times, with the first 5 trials seeing either convictions overturned on suspicious grounds or ending with hung juries.  The 6th and most recent jury trial, in 2010, ended with Flowers' conviction on four counts of capital murder, though his case has been remanded on appeal by the United States Supreme Court to a lower court to review racial bias in jury selection.
