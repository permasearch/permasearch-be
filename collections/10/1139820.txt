The high scorer after Round 3 has a chance to win their total, consisting of both that day's winnings and any money they have banked (see below), and "escape" the show. The clock is set to 60 seconds, and the contestants are asked a series of quick-fire questions on the buzzer. Each correct answer by the high scorer allows them to cash trap one opponent, but a miss deducts 10 seconds from the clock. A correct answer by an opponent has no effect except for the time used to answer, but a miss causes them to become cash trapped.[5]
