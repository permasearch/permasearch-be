The Jamestown area has a few large manufacturing plants that are major employers in this region. These include Bush Industries (makers of ready-to-assemble furniture), Cummins Inc. (manufacturer of diesel engines; the heavy duty engine plant is in the Town of Busti, just west of Jamestown, but still called the Jamestown Engine Plant or JEP), SKF AeroEngine (formerly MRC Bearings), TitanX Engine Cooling Inc., Jamestown Container Companies (corrugated container manufacturer), Truck-Lite (makers of truck lighting systems), "Blackstone Advanced Technologies" (makers of sheet metal), "Jamestown Electroplating Works Inc" (Metal Plating Finishing Service), and "Water Street Brass Corporation" (manufacturer of decorative brass hardware). The area was once known as the "furniture capital of the world" for its many talented furniture and brass hardware manufacturers. Chain stores have opened in recent years in the surrounding area, including Walmart, KMart, Wegmans, Sam's Club, CVS, and Rite Aid.
