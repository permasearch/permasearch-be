Kennedy had already started work on many other of that sessions' songs before he eventually brought the recording of "Dang Me" to his home. Upon playing it, he recalled, "My kids came screaming down the stairs when 'Dang Me' came on. They thought that was the greatest thing they'd ever heard. I started playing it over and over and over again...".[3] Kennedy and Mercury Records chose "Dang Me" (copyrighted by Tree Publishing, BMI) as the first single of the May 1964 LP Roger and Out (Smash SRS-67046).[5] The album was shortly retitled and rereleased that year as Dang Me (Smash SRS-67049)
