In the same year, del Río, along with other Mexican film stars in Hollywood (like Ramón Novarro and Lupe Vélez), was accused of promoting Communism in California. This happened after the mentioned film stars attended a special screening of the Sergei Eisenstein's film ¡Que Viva México!, copies of which were claimed to have been edited by Joseph Stalin,[46] and a film which promoted nationalist sentiment with socialist overtones. In the midst of this scandal, in September 29, 1934, del Rio returned to Mexico. Along with Novarro and Velez, she was invited by Mexican President Abelardo L. Rodriguez at the opening of the Palace of Fine Arts in Mexico City.[47]
