Center Andre Smith was the 1981 Big Eight Player of the Year and twice earned all-conference honors. However, it was the late Jack Moore, a 5–10 playmaker from Muncie, Indiana, who captured the hearts of Nebraska fans in the early 1980s. Moore earned All-Big Eight honors in 1982, when he won the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award, given annually to the nation’s top player no taller than six feet. The first three-time academic All-Big Eight pick in Nebraska history, Moore scored 1,204 points and hit .901 from the free throw line during his career.
