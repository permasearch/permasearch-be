Prior to the Enron scandal, McKinsey helped it shift from an oil and gas production company into an electric commodities trader, which led to significant growth in profits and revenues.[65] According to The Independent, there was "no suggestion that McKinsey was complicit in the subsequent scandal, [but] critics say the arrogance of Enron's leaders is emblematic of the McKinsey culture."[134] The government did not investigate McKinsey, who said they did not provide advice on Enron's accounting,[43] but some questioned whether McKinsey knew about Enron's accounting problems[135] or ignored warning signs.[24]
