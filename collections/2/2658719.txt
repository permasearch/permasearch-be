Before European contact the island was possibly frequented by Eastern Caribbean Ta√≠no people.[8] Christopher Columbus was the first European to encounter the island in 1493. He named it after his brother Bartolomeo. Sporadic visits continued for the next hundred years until formal colonization began taking shape.[9]
