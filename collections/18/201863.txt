In addition, emerging methodologies challenged this point of view during the 1980s. Instead of trying to predict single instances of behavior, which was unreliable, researchers found that they could predict patterns of behavior by aggregating large numbers of observations.[61] As a result, correlations between personality and behavior increased substantially, and it was clear that "personality" did in fact exist.[62] Personality and social psychologists now generally agree that both personal and situational variables are needed to account for human behavior.[63] Trait theories became justified, and there was a resurgence of interest in this area.[64] In the 1980s, Lewis Goldberg started his own lexical project, emphasizing five broad factors once again.[65] He later coined the term "Big Five" as a label for the factors.
