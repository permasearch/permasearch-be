Lawrence has stated that it took her a while to warm up to this, but that she later came to greatly appreciate how Mama "blossomed" and "matured" from her early years on "The Family". She added that she still favors the adjustments in Mama's character and has credited who Thelma Harper is today partly to Korman. "The Family" sketch writers, however, who based "The Family" characters on their real-life family members, disfavored the less aggressive Mama. In February 2013, Lawrence remarked that "The Family" sketch version of Mama was created by writers who hated their mothers.[2][21][22]
