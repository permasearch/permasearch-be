On 27 December 2014, it was announced that Torres' move to Milan would be made permanent on 5 January 2015,[131] but two days later, he agreed to rejoin La Liga club Atlético Madrid on loan until the end of the 2015–16 season.[132] The loan was agreed after Alessio Cerci went the opposite way from Atlético to Milan on the same day, 5 January.[133] Torres' unveiling at the Vicente Calderón Stadium on 4 January 2015 drew a crowd of 45,000 persons.[134] He played the first match of his second spell on 7 January 2015, starting in the first leg of a Copa del Rey last 16 tie against Real Madrid. He had no shots on target and was replaced by Koke after 59 minutes, but Atlético won 2–0.[135] Eight days later in the second leg, he scored two goals – in the first minute of each half – as Atlético advanced, his first goals in an away Madrid derby.[136] Torres scored in the first minute again in the quarter-finals, albeit in a 2–3 home defeat against Barcelona.[137]
