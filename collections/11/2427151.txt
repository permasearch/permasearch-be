The Secret Square game is played as the first game on a given broadcast (or the first complete game, if a show began with a game already in progress) during the daytime series. In this game, a randomly selected Secret Square is shown only to the home audience by the shot of the television camera. A contestant who picked that panelist during the game won a bonus prize package if they correctly agreed or disagreed with the star. Secret Square prize packages added cash on the daytime edition, which started at around $1,000 (for the 1966 episodes; the base amount increased in the later years from 1967 to 1980 (by which time a new Secret Square package was worth around $3,500 to $4,500) and grew daily until won. The question for the star was sealed in a special envelope and was almost always multiple choice.
