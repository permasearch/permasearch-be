Bullseye is a toy horse who was introduced in Toy Story 2. He is the first toy with which Woody interacted in Al's penthouse. He was very happy to finally see Woody after a long time in storage. Bullseye is shown to loathe fights as he hides in a can when Jessie jumps on Woody. He is also upset at Woody's intention to abandon the Roundup gang to return to Andy, as Bullseye does not want Woody to leave. When Woody ultimately decides to return to Andy's room, it is Bullseye's loyalty that causes Woody to try to get the other toys to join him. At the airport, after Bullseye escapes from Al's case, Woody and Buzz Lightyear mount Bullseye and gallop across the airfield to rescue Jessie from being sent to Japan. Although Woody gets separated from Buzz, Buzz commandeers Bullseye to follow Woody, as they are seen galloping next to the wheels of the plane Woody and Jessie are on as it heads down the runway. The mission finally ends when Woody and Jessie swing down from the plane and land on Bullseye right behind Buzz, seconds before the plane takes off. After the toys return home, both Bullseye and Jessie become part of Andy's toys. Bullseye has every letter of Andy's name printed on the sole of each of his hooves.
