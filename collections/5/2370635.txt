The Kokoda Track Foundation, established in 2003, helps villages along the track with education and healthcare.  There is a proposal to turn the track into an Australian heritage destination on a par with ANZAC Cove at Gallipoli.[5] Creation of the heritage area, is in part a response to the issue of an Australian gold mining company wanting to mine on or near the track. As of  2007[update], the idea was backed by the Australian government and Papua New Guinea's foreign minister.[5]
