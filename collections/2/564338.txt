Alexie has described his life at the reservation school as challenging because he was constantly teased by other kids as well as endured abuse he described as "torture" from teachers who were white nuns. They called him "The Globe" because his head was larger than usual, due to the hydrocephalus as an infant. Until the age of seven, Alexie suffered from seizures and bedwetting; he had to take strong drugs to control them.[10][11] Because of his health problems, he was excluded from many of the activities that are rites of passage for young Indian males.[11] Alexie excelled academically, reading everything available, including auto repair manuals.[12]
