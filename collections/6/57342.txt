‘’Shringar ras’’ (Compassion) was the theme of the next act. Singh played the role of the female lead who donated her eyes to the character of Ahlawat (Visually challenged) after her death. This emotional act brought tears in the eyes of the audience and gave a score of fifteen to Singh and a low score of twelve to Ahlawat. Johar stated that Ahlawat has a very good personality, and he is extremely good looking, however, he needs to work on his expressions and acting skills. Singh talked about her sadness as she is tagged as a bad omen in the academy. The contestants think that if they are paired-up with her, then they are eliminated in that week. Johar and Shetty condemned this kind of negativity and advised Singh to concentrate on her skill-building journey.
