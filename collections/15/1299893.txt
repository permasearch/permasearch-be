Joseph Wilson Swan was born in 1828 at Pallion Hall in Pallion, in the Parish of Bishopwearmouth, Sunderland, County Durham. His parents were John Swan and Isabella Cameron.[6] Swan was apprenticed for six years to a Sunderland firm of druggists, Hudson and Osbaldiston.[3] However, it is not known if Swan completed his six-year apprenticeship, as both partners subsequently died.[3] He was said to have had an enquiring mind,[3] even as a child. He augmented his education with a fascination of his surroundings, the industry of the area, and reading at Sunderland Library.[3] He attended lectures at the Sunderland Atheneum.[7] Swan subsequently joined Mawson's, a firm of manufacturing chemists in Newcastle upon Tyne, started in the year of Swan's birth by John Mawson[3] (9 September 1819 – 17 December 1867), the husband of his sister, Elizabeth Swan (22 Nov 1822 – 2 August 1905). In 1846, Swan was offered a partnership at Mawson's.[3] This company subsequently existed as Mawson, Swan and Morgan until 1973, formerly located on Grey Street in Newcastle upon Tyne, near Grey's Monument. The premises, now occupied by burger chain restaurant Byron, can be identified by a line of Victorian-style electric street lamps in front of the store on Grey Street.
