Film critic Subhash K Jha rated it 3.5/5 and quotedÂ : "Zoya, God bless her aesthetics, sucks us into the beauty of the moment, not giving us any reason to believe that life's most precious truths are swathed in squalor."[59] Blessy Chettiar of DNA India, noted the music of the film and Farhan Akhtar's acting as highlights of the film: "For all this, the storywriters use heavy doses of symbolism. Deep-sea diving at Costa Brava, sky-diving in Sevilla and the San Fermin bull run in Pamplona, not to forget the Tomatina festival in Bunyol, where Arjun finally lets go. Fears are drowned, let open in the sky and finally at the mercy of raging bulls", he wrote, giving it 3 stars.[60] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN stated, "Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara takes the light-hearted tone of a fun, all-boys road trip through Spain to give you a deep and heartfelt message on why we should live life by seizing the moment and following our hearts." He also praised the performance of the cast, highlighting it as one of the main positives of the film, but points out that the film's length "sucks some fun of out of the ride" and gave a rating of 3.5 stars.[49] On the contrary, Raja Sen of Rediff held that the film "tried too hard to be cool" and gave it 1.5/5 stars.[61]
