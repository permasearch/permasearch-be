The arrival of White led to much optimism in Pittsburgh â€“ McNally stated that, "We had calculated on a championship without him, and since we have him it looks like we can't miss."[48] White did not disappoint: he led the league in rushing with 567 yards on 152 attempts.[49] However, the team was unable to capitalize on White's performance compiling a record of just two wins against nine losses, including a season-ending string of six straight defeats. After the season, White sailed on to England and never again played for the Pirates. White would go on to become one of the longest serving justices in the history of the U.S. Supreme Court.[50]
