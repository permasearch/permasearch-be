FASB Accounting Support Fees are collected under the authority of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Fees are assessed and collected from issuers of publicly-traded securities and allocated based on the average market capitalization of each issuer. The FASB accounting support fees are reviewed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) each year to ensure compliance with the statute.[14]
