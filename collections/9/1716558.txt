The Hart family becomes concerned when Van continuously sits at home watching football instead of attending church. After many failed attempts in talking him into going, Reba and Barbra Jean confront him on his refusal. Van confesses that he no longer believes in God, mostly because he had to leave football, greatly disappointing Reba and Barbra Jean. To try to bring Van to God, they drag him to Reverend Parks, who tells Reba and Barbra Jean that he can't help the people who don't want help. Reba in a heated discussion finally admits to the Reverend that she too has had her doubts.
