During the New Order-regime the "Tentara Nasional Indonesia" (Indonesian National Armed Forces/TNI) changed its name to "Angkatan Bersenjata Republik Indonesia" (Republic of Indonesia Armed Forces/ABRI), by then including the POLRI (Indonesian National Police) (the latter having been included in 1962 as part of the Ministry of Defense, even before the New Order began).
