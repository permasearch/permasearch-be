Each heavy chain and light chain gene contains multiple copies of three different types of gene segments for the variable regions of the antibody proteins. For example, the human immunoglobulin heavy chain region contains 2 Constant (Cμ and Cδ) gene segments and 44 Variable (V) gene segments,[2] plus 27 Diversity (D) gene segments and 6 Joining (J) gene segments.[3] The light chains also possess 2 Constant (Cμ and Cδ) gene segments and numerous V and J gene segments, but do not have D gene segments. DNA rearrangement causes one copy of each type of gene segment to go in any given lymphocyte, generating an enormous antibody repertoire; roughly 3×1011 combinations are possible, although some are removed due to self reactivity.
