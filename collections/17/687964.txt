The group heads back to Camp Half-Blood, minus Rachel, and prepares to fight. The enemy army floods out of the Labyrinth, led by Kampê. Daedalus arrives as the tide begins to turn in the Titans' favor, bringing Mrs. O’Leary and a giant Briares. Briares kills Kampe, Grover rescues Camp Half-Blood by causing a Panic, and the remaining campers drive the enemy into a retreat. Nico helps Daedalus to pass on and thus destroy the Labyrinth, which is tied to his life force; the inventor gives Annabeth a laptop he salvaged from his workshop and leaves Mrs. O'Leary in the care of Percy. After a memorial service for the dead campers and Grover being banished by the Council of Elders for blasphemy, Percy leaves camp for the school year.
