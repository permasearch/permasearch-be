Solar power in the People's Republic of China is one of the biggest industries in mainland China. In 2007 China produced 1700 MW of solar panels, nearly half of the world production of 3800 MW, although 99% was exported.[16] Chinese solar panel production reportedly quadrupled between 2009 and 2011 to surpass the entire global demand. As a result, the EU accused China of dumping its solar panels in Europe at below-cost prices, involving 20 billion U.S. dollars of trade between the two powers.[17] As well, solar water heating is extensively implemented.[18] By the end of March 2015 China had an installed capacity of 33.12 GW of solar power[19] with recent announcements that a target of an additional 15GW of solar power to be installed by the end of 2015.[20] Large PV power plants in China include the 200MW Golmud Solar Park.
