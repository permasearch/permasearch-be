The 2013 Fusion is available in S, SE, and Titanium trim levels. Ford assembled five different powertrains for the second generation, including two hybrid variants. All available engines are four-cylinder offerings, dropping the previous model's 3.0L V6 as the top tier engine choice, as part of Ford's push to phase out the aging Duratec 30, as well as the Sport package's 3.5L V6 as a performance option. In the 2017 update, the Sport model returned, powered by a 2.7L turbocharged V6.
