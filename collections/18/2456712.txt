On 2 January 1861 Frederick William died and William ascended the throne as William I of Prussia. In July a student from Leipzig tried to assassinate William, but he was only lightly injured.[4] Like Frederick I of Prussia, William travelled to KÃ¶nigsberg and there crowned himself at the Schlosskirche.[5] William chose the anniversary of the Battle of Leipzig, 18 October, for this event, which was the first Prussian crowning ceremony since 1701 and the only crowning of a German king in the 19th century.[4] William refused to comply with his brother's wish, expressed in Frederick William's last will, that he should abrogate the constitution.[4]
