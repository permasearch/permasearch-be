Recycled aluminium uses 5% of the energy that would be needed to create a comparable amount from raw materials.[7] The benefit with respect to emissions of carbon dioxide depends on the type of energy used. Electrolysis can be done using electricity from non-fossil-fuel sources, such as nuclear, geothermal, hydroelectric, or solar. Aluminium production is attracted to sources of cheap electricity. Canada, Brazil, Norway, and Venezuela have 61 to 99% hydroelectric power and are major aluminium producers. The use of recycled aluminium also decreases the need for mining bauxite.
