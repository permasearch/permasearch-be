Another notable factor in the evolution of golf has been the development of golf clubs.  The earliest golf clubs were made of wood that was readily available in the area.  Over the years, Hickory developed into the standard wood used for shafts and American Persimmon became the choice of wood for the club head due to its hardness and strength. As the golf ball developed and became more durable with the introduction of the "gutty" around 1850, the club head was also allowed to develop, and a variety of iron headed clubs entered the game.  The introduction of steel shafts began in the late 1890s, but their adoption by the governing bodies of golf was slow.  In the early 1970s, shaft technology shifted again with the use of graphite for its lightweight and strength characteristics.  The first metal "wood" was developed in the early 1980s, and metal eventually completely replaced wood due to its strength and versatility.[53]  The latest golf club technology employs the use of graphite shafts and lightweight titanium heads, which allows the club head to be made much larger than previously possible.  The strength of these modern materials also allows the face of the club to be much thinner, which increases the spring-like effect of the club face on the ball, theoretically increasing the distance the ball travels.  The USGA has recently limited the spring-like effect, also known as the Coefficient of Restitution (COR) to .83 and the maximum club head size to 460cc in an attempt to maintain the challenge of the game.[54]
