Families did not migrate en masse, but younger members of families did, so much so that emigration almost became a rite of passage, as evidenced by the data that show that, unlike similar emigrations throughout world history, women emigrated just as often, just as early, and in the same numbers as men. The emigrant would send remittances reaching Â£1,404,000 by 1851[111] back to family in Ireland, which, in turn, allowed another member of the family to leave.
