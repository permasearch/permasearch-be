A brown tabby tom with amber eyes, Shortwhisker was formerly a kittypet named Hutch. During his time in SkyClan, Shortwhisker was nervous around other cats, similar to Ravenpaw in ThunderClan. He overcame his fear and fought in the battle against the rats. After the battle, he realizes that Clan life isn't suited for him, a decision that Firestar and Leafstar respect, and reverts to Hutch. Hutch also promised to spread the word to other cats about SkyClan.[11]
