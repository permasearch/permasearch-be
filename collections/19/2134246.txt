Arsenal opened the 2013–14 season with a home defeat to Aston Villa, which prompted boos from the supporters.[240] The club's transfer inactivity over the summer was criticised, but Wenger assessed: "We could have won the game today with the players on the pitch, I'm convinced of that."[240] In the final week of the transfer window, he re-signed Flamini and sanctioned the club record signing of Mesut Özil from Real Madrid, totalling £42.5 million.[241] Wenger was instrumental in the latter deal; he phoned and spoke to the German in his native language, convincing him that a move to England would enhance his career.[242] Arsenal's form thereafter improved and Aaron Ramsey's goalscoring spree elevated the team to first position by the New Year. Poor performances in the big games, however, blighted Arsenal's title credentials, with a 6–0 loss to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge being described as "a good hiding [as] you don't prepare all week to experience that."[243] The defeat marked Wenger's 1,000th match in charge of Arsenal.[244] Arsenal consolidated fourth position in the league, and Wenger guided his team to FA Cup success, as they came from two goals down to beat Hull City in the final, and clinch Arsenal their first trophy in nine years.[245] At the end of the season, Wenger signed another three-year extension to his Arsenal contract.[246] He strengthened the squad by signing Alexis Sánchez from Barcelona in July 2014, and during the course of 2014–15, promoted Francis Coquelin and Héctor Bellerín into the first team.[247][248] Wenger won his sixth FA Cup in May 2015, which placed him alongside George Ramsay as the most successful manager in the competition's history.[249] Wenger further guided the club to improved league finishes in the following two seasons, finishing runners-up in the 2015–16 season.
