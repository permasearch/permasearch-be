The U.S. Army created Fort McDowell on the Verde River in 1865 to forestall Native American uprisings.[31] The fort established a camp on the south side of the Salt River by 1866, which was the first non-native settlement in the valley after the decline of the Hohokam. In later years, other nearby settlements would form and merge to become the city of Tempe,[32] but this community was incorporated after Phoenix.
