Gun possession in Switzerland is relatively high compared to most European countries (the rate of Swiss households containing at least one firearm was estimated at 24.45% by the 2016 figures of GunPolicy.org,[98] – lower than Germany, France, and Austria[99] – though including militia-issued firearms). The Swiss have universal conscription for military service.[100] A recent referendum in 2011 on a call to force military weapons to be kept at military sites was defeated.[101] Weapons may voluntarily be kept in the local armory and there is no longer an obligation to keep the weapon at home.
