To eliminate the threat posed by Ungern, Bolshevik Russia decided to support establishing a communist Mongolian government and army. This Mongolian army took the Mongolian part of Kyakhta from Chinese forces on March 18, 1921, and on July 6 Russian and Mongolian troops arrived in KhÃ¼ree. Mongolia declared its independence again on July 11, 1921.[32] As a result, Mongolia was closely aligned with the Soviet Union over the next seven decades.
