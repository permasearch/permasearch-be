The commercial reception was unspectacular initially, with the record-buying public wary after Wings' preceding releases.[54][55] On the UK Albums Chart, Band on the Run climbed to number 9 on 22 December,[56] remaining there for a second week before dropping to number 13.[57] On America's Billboard Top LPs & Tape chart, it peaked at number 7 on 2 February 1974 and then spent the next six weeks in the lower reaches of the top ten.[58] The album went on to achieve considerable success, however, thanks to the popularity of the two singles culled from it â€“ "Jet" and the title track.[5][24] Writing in 1981, Bob Woffinden described Band on the Run as the first Beatles-related release to be "planned with a marketing strategy",[54] as Capitol Records now assumed a fully active role in promoting the album following the removal of Klein's ABKCO Industries as managers of Apple. Although McCartney had been reluctant to issue album tracks as singles,[59] the public's apparent disinterest in Band on the Run led to him ceding to the recommendations of Capitol's head of marketing, Al Coury,[60] who had similarly pushed for the inclusion of "Helen Wheels". McCartney therefore authorised single edits for the two new A-sides.[27]
