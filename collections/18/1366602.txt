The emergence of Orientalizing motifs in Greek pottery begins to be clearly attested at the end of the Late Geometric Period, though two schools of thought exist regarding the question of to whether or not Geometric art itself was indebted to eastern  models.[15] In Attic pottery, the distinctive Orientalizing style known as "proto-Attic" was marked by floral and animal motifs; it was the first time discernibly Greek religious and mythological themes were represented in vase painting. The bodies of men and animals were depicted in silhouette, though their heads were drawn in outline; women were drawn completely in outline.  At the other important center of this period, Corinth, the orientalizing influence started earlier, though the tendency there was to produce smaller, highly detailed vases in the "proto-Corinthian" style that prefigured the black-figure technique.[16]
