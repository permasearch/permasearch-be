Earphones known as Apple EarPods are included with the iPhone 5 and other devices announced at the Apple media event on September 12, 2012. They superseded earphones that were included with previous generation iPhones and iPods.[75] According to technology commentators, the redesign of the earphones is aimed to improve sound quality by allowing air to travel in and out more freely.[76][77] Apple states that the redesign of their earphones allows it to "rival high-end headphones that cost hundreds of dollars more".[76] Reviews by Gizmodo and TechRadar reported that although the redesigned earphones sounded better than its predecessor, reviewers felt that quality of sound produced is poor.[78]
