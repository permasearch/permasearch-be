Chase was the original anchor for the Weekend Update segment of SNL, and his catchphrase introduction, "I'm Chevy Chase... and you're not" became well known. His trademark conclusion, "Good night, and have a pleasant tomorrow" was later resurrected by Jane Curtin and Tina Fey. Chase also wrote comedy material for Weekend Update. For example, he wrote and performed "The News for the Hard of Hearing". In this skit, Chase would read the top story of the day, aided by Garrett Morris, who would repeat the story by loudly shouting it. Chase claimed that his version of Weekend Update would later be the inspiration for other news satire shows such as The Daily Show and The Colbert Report.[25] (Weekend Update was later revived as a segment on The Chevy Chase Show,[26] a short-lived late-night talk-show produced by Chase and broadcast by Fox Broadcasting Company.)
