Dental caries (cavities), described as "tooth decay", is an infectious disease which damages the structures of teeth.[38] The disease can lead to pain, tooth loss, and infection. Dental caries has a long history, with evidence showing the disease was present in the Bronze, Iron, and Middle ages but also prior to the neolithic period.[39] The largest increases in the prevalence of caries have been associated with diet changes.[40] Today, caries remains one of the most common diseases throughout the world. In the United States, dental caries is the most common chronic childhood disease, being at least five times more common than asthma.[41] Countries that have experienced an overall decrease in cases of tooth decay continue to have a disparity in the distribution of the disease.[42] Among children in the United States and Europe, 60â€“80% of cases of dental caries occur in 20% of the population.[43]
