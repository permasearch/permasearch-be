Branham stated that his first exposure to Pentecostalism was in 1936; however, the First Pentecostal Baptist Church he attended prior to 1933 believed in most of the basic doctrines of Pentecostalism. As a result, Branham appears to have been exposed to Pentecostalism from the date of his conversion to Christianity.[7] Pentecostalism is a renewal movement that started in the early 20th century that stresses a post-conversion baptism with the Holy Spirit for all Christians, with speaking in tongues ("glossolalia") as the initial evidence of this baptism.[8] Oneness Pentecostalism is a subset of churches within Pentecostalism that adhere to a more modalistic view of God and hold to a baptismal formula in the name of Jesus, rather than rather than the more common Trinitarian formula "in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit".[9]
