Brad Keselowski, his rival, had written a sympathetic blog to Busch about their rivalry, claiming that he and Busch first met in early 2001 during a Truck Series race, in which Busch ignored Keselowski's greeting. Busch denied this in the same press conference but confirmed Keselowski's second claim to have met Busch during a 2006 Bristol truck race only to be dismissed by Busch upon first sight.
