When the American Revolution ended the prisoner trade to North America, the abrupt halt threw Britain's penal system into disarray, as prisons and jails quickly filled with the many convicts who previously would have moved on to the colonies.[49] Conditions steadily worsened.[49] It was during this crisis period in the English criminal justice system that penal reformer John Howard began his work.[49] Howard's comprehensive study of British penal practice, The State of the Prisons in England and Wales, was first published in 1777â€”one year after the start of the Revolution.[50]
