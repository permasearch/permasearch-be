Bergoglio was asked in 1992 by Jesuit authorities not to reside in Jesuit houses, because of continued tensions with Jesuit leaders and scholars, a sense of Bergoglio's "dissent", views of his Catholic orthodoxy and his opposition to theology of liberation, and his work as auxiliary bishop of Buenos Aires.[44][45][46] From then on, he did not visit Jesuit houses and was in "virtual estrangement from the Jesuits" until after his election as Pope.[36][44]
