An estimated 98% of South Koreans own mobile phones and use them not only for calling and messaging but also for watching live TV, viewing websites and keeping track of their online gaming statuses. South Korean corporations Samsung and LG are the first and third largest cell phone companies in the world,[citation needed] and South Koreans are usually among the first to experience innovative technology.[citation needed] New phones are expensive in South Korea, but this doesn't stop South Korean consumers changing their phones on average every 11 months.[citation needed]
