One of the largest parades is held in Savannah, Georgia.  The parade held in Savannah is the largest in Georgia.[46]  Many Irish settled in Savannah even in the earliest years since those freed from debtors' prison were invited to join General James Oglethorpe's fledging colony.  There is a Mass at the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist prior to the parade.  In the early 1960s, there was an attempt to dye the Savannah River green, but all it produced was an irregular green stripe in the middle of the river.   In 2006, the TÃ¡naiste was featured in the parade. The parade travels through Savannah's Historic District.
