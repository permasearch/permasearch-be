Nene was briefly replaced with the little known David van Rooyen before public criticism, and a sharp decline in the currency, and the stock market lead to Zuma re-appointing former minister of finance Pravin Gordhan to the position instead. Strong links between both of Van Rooyen's top two advisers and the Gupta family came to light a few months after Nene's dismissal.[84][85] Shortly after Gordhan's appointment an investigation was initiated by the Hawks into allegations of corruption whilst he was head of the South African Revenue Service. The investigation was criticised on legal grounds[86] and for being politically motivated by a number of organisations and individuals including the South African Communist Party.[87] Gordhan stated that the Gupta family was behind the charges. The Gupta family denied being involved in any effort to remove Gordhan from office, [14] however, in 2017, much of Gupta auditor KPMG’s senior leadership in South Africa resigned, and a report, issued by KPMG in 2015, accusing Gordhan of improprieties was withdrawn, after an internal investigation found that the work done by KPMG for Gupta family fell “considerably short” of the firm’s standards, and amid a rising political and public backlash.
