Okara (from the Japanese, おから, okara; known as 雪花菜, xuěhuācài, in Chinese, lit. "snowflake vegetable"; 豆腐渣, dòufuzhā, also Chinese, lit. "tofu sediment/residue"; and 콩비지, kongbiji, in Korean), is a tofu by-product sometimes known in the west as "soy pulp" or "tofu lees",[56] consisting of the fiber, protein, and starch left over when soy milk has been extracted from ground soaked soybeans.[57] It is mainly used as animal feed in most tofu producing cultures, but is sometimes used in Japanese and Korean cuisines, such as in the Korean stew kongbiji jjigae (콩비지찌개). It is also an ingredient for vegetarian burgers in many Western nations.
