On July 13, a march was organized to protest Smith's beatings and police brutality in the city. During the rally, an unknown woman smashed the windows of the 4th Precinct with a metal bar.[2] Looting began soon after and spread quickly along Springfield Avenue, the neighborhood's business district. Molotov cocktails were thrown into shops and entire buildings soon caught fire. A car was burned and shortly after a policeman was injured by a flying brick. In response, shotguns were issued to some police officers. By midnight, looting spread to other areas in proximity to the march and all police were placed on emergency duty. At 1:00 A.M. police were told to "fire if necessary." Within the next two hours, National Guard and state troopers were dispatched to deal with the crowds.[13]
