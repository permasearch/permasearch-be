England's first competition organized by a national body, the FA Cup, began in the 1871–72 season, making it one of the oldest football competitions in the world.[1][2] Arsenal hold the record number of wins, 13.[3] League football began the next decade with the founding of The Football League in 1888–89. The Football League was renamed the First Division upon expansion of the league in 1892, which remained the highest division of the English football league system until 1992, when the Premier League was founded. Manchester United have won the most top division titles, with 20.[4] The English equivalent of the super cup began in 1898 with the inauguration of the Sheriff of London Charity Shield, pitting the best professional and amateur sides of the year against each other.[5] The trophy would develop into the FA Charity Shield in 1908, which was later renamed the FA Community Shield in 2002. The Football League created its own knockout competition in 1960, the League Cup.[6] The Anglo-Italian League Cup was created in 1969 to match English cup winners against the winners of the Coppa Italia, and was permanently disbanded in 1976.[7] In 1985, the Full Members Cup and Football League Super Cup were created as substitutes for UEFA competitions after UEFA responded to the Heysel Stadium disaster by banning English clubs.[8][9] They finished in 1986 and 1992 respectively. The Football League Centenary Trophy marked The Football League's 100th birthday, in the 1988–89 season.[10]
