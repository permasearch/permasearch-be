Joe Davis became a professional billiards player at the age of 18, having won the Chesterfield Championship at age 13. In 1926 he reached his first World Professional Billiards Championship final but was unsuccessful against defending champion Tom Newman.  He reached the final again the following year and was runner-up again to the same opponent.  It was to be a case of third time lucky for Davis when he defeated Newman in 1928 to become the world champion at English billiards for the first time. He would defend his title for the next three years â€“ against Newman again in 1929 and 1930 and New Zealander Clark McConachy in 1932.  He contested the final two more times in 1933 and 1934 losing on both occasions to Australian Walter Lindrum.
