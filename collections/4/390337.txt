This season adapts material from issues #13â€“38 of the comic book series and introduces notable comic characters, including Michonne (Danai Gurira), Axel (Lew Temple), The Governor (David Morrissey) and Tyreese Williams (Chad L. Coleman). It also marks the return of Merle Dixon (Michael Rooker), the volatile older brother of Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus), who went missing in the first season, and also features the return of Morgan Jones (Lennie James), the first survivor Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) encountered and befriended, who he lost contact with in season one. As in the comics, this season is mainly set in both an abandoned prison and an active rural town of survivors.
