A passage about rain is not considered appropriate to (Northern Hemisphere) spring and summer, when rain does not fall in Israel. Nevertheless, given the importance of moisture during the dry summer of Israel, many (though not all) versions of the liturgy insert the phrase "מוריד הטל‬," "He causes the dew to fall," during every Amidah of the dry half of the year. The "mention" of rain (or dew) starts and ends on major festivals (Shemini Atzeret and Passover)[28] because they are days of great joy, and because they are days of heavy attendance at public prayers. Therefore, the seasonal change in the language of the prayers is immediately and widely disseminated.[citation needed]
