Other electroplating processes may use a nonconsumable anode such as lead or carbon. In these techniques, ions of the metal to be plated must be periodically replenished in the bath as they are drawn out of the solution.[2] The most common form of electroplating is used for creating coins, such as US pennies, which are made of zinc covered in a layer of copper.[3]
