The teardrop tattoo or tear tattoo is a symbolic tattoo of a tear that is placed underneath the eye. The tattoo can have various meanings: it can signify that the wearer has killed someone[1] or has spent time in prison;[2] that the wearer was raped while incarcerated and tattooed with a tear drop below the eye by the offending party and his accomplices,[3][4] or it can acknowledge the loss of a family or fellow gang member. Sometimes, only the wearer will know the exact meaning of the tattoo.[4][5] The tattooâ€™s meaning also can change depending on whether the tear is empty or is filled with ink. [1]
