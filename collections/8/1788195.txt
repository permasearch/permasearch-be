Diagnosis of epilepsy can be difficult. A number of other conditions may present very similar signs and symptoms to seizures, including syncope, hyperventilation, migraines, narcolepsy, panic attacks and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES).[82][83] In particular a syncope can be accompanied by a short episode of convulsions.[84] Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, often misdiagnosed as nightmares, was considered to be a parasomnia but later identified to be an epilepsy syndrome.[85] Attacks of the movement disorder paroxysmal dyskinesia may be taken for epileptic seizures.[86] The cause of a drop attack can be, among many others, an atonic seizure.[83]
