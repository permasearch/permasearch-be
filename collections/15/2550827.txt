Fasttrack is a Citrakayah (a play on Citroen) from the planet Chalybeas (From "Chalybeate" mystical waters containing salts of iron possessed by the extinct "Chalybes" community in accordance to the enchanted strength element). Fasttrack is a blue and black alien with two mask-like projections on his eyes. He moves at high speed like XLR8, and also has enhanced strength as he was strong enough to carry both Hulka and Tack without losing any speed, however, he doesn't easily stop from running, probably because he can't manipulate friction as XLR8 does. He made his first on-screen appearance in "Basic Training" where he saves Tack and Magister Hulka from a malfunctioned grenade. He has the ability to run through the time and space barrier and he is stronger than XLR8. Like Jetray, Fasttrack did not appear in Omniverse, but he was mentioned several times when Ben tries to use a fast alien but turns into another one instead.
