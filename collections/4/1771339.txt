During his early schooling life, he was interested in art, and has detailed that he would draw popular video game characters such as Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog.[16] During high school, he would skip classes to play video games at an Internet café with friends; on this topic, PewDiePie has commented, "Sweden has a great culture around gaming."[16] In 2008, he graduated from Göteborgs Högre Samskola.[17] He then went on to pursue a degree in industrial economics and technology management at Chalmers University of Technology, but left the university in 2011.[18] On his decision, PewDiePie has stated, "Thinking about it now, it was utterly absurd. To get into Chalmers for industrial economics you need straight A's, but somehow I was happier selling hot dogs and making my own gaming-videos."[15] While his reason for leaving Chalmers has often been reported as a want to focus on his YouTube career,[19] in 2017, PewDiePie clarified, "Why does everyone get this story wrong? [...] I dropped out of university because I didn't like it. To drop out of university to pursue YouTube, that'd just be fucking stupid."[20] He added that "industrial management and economics [was] boring as hell [...] [and] I couldn't relate to fucking anyone."[20]
