According to Ransome, every place in his book can be found in the Lake District, but he took different locations and placed them in different ways: the lake is a fictionalised version of Windermere but the surrounding countryside more closely resembles that around Coniston.[6] Wild Cat Island, the location of the island camp, has elements from Peel Island in Coniston and Blake Holme (or Blakeholme) in Windermere.[7] Holly Howe, the farmhouse where the Swallows stay, is based on Bank Ground Farm,[8] which exists to this day. It was featured in the 1974 film.
