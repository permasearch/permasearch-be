When     E [ Y ∣ Z = z , X = 1 ] − E [ Y ∣ Z = z , X = 0 ]   {\displaystyle E[Y\mid Z=z,X=1]-E[Y\mid Z=z,X=0]}   does not depend on     Z   {\displaystyle Z}  , the Simpson's paradox is exactly the omitted variable bias for the regression of Y on X where the regressor     X   {\displaystyle X}   is a dummy variable and the omitted variable     Z   {\displaystyle Z}   is a categorical variable defining groups for each value it takes. The application is striking because the bias is high enough that parameters have opposite signs.
