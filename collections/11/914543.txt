The United States, France and the United Arab Emirates are working to develop practical solar desalination.[85] AquaDania's WaterStillar has been installed at Dahab, Egypt, and in Playa del Carmen, Mexico. In this approach, a solar thermal collector measuring two square metres can distill from 40 to 60 litres per day from any local water source â€“ five times more than conventional stills. It eliminates the need for plastic PET bottles or energy-consuming water transport.[86] In Central California, a startup company WaterFX is developing a solar-powered method of desalination that can enable the use of local water, including runoff water that can be treated and used again. Salty groundwater in the region would be treated to become freshwater, and in areas near the ocean, seawater could be treated.[87]
