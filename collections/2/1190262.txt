In 2010 plans were unveiled of an extensive redevelopment programme to enlarge the capacity and develop the facilities.[56] The first stage of this saw a new two-tier Stan Cullis Stand become fully operational for the 2012â€“13 season, raising the current official capacity to 31,700.[49][57] The second stage would see the rebuilding of the oldest stand at the stadium (renamed the Steve Bull Stand in 2003) to increase capacity to around 36,000 but this has been indefinitely postponed.[58]
