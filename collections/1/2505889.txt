The second stage of the Marshall Plan, which began in 1950, concentrated on productivity of the economy.[63] According to Michael J. Hogan, "in the most profound sense, it involved the transfer of attitudes, habits and values as well, indeed a whole way of life that Marshall planners associated with progress in the marketplace of politics and social relationships as much as they did with industry and agriculture."[64] The program, as instructed by American lawmakers,[65] targeted improvement in factory-level productivity, labor-management relations, free trade unions and introduction of modern business practices.[66] The Economic Cooperation Administration, which operated until December 1951, distributed around $300 million in technical assistance and attempted steering the Austrian social partnership (political parties, labor unions, business associations and executive government) in favor of productivity and growth instead of redistribution and consumption.[67]
