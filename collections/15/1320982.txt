On 6 May 2018, a Yemeni ballistic missile hit Saudi military positions in Asir. Two Saudi troops were also killed by Yemeni snipers in the Haskul military base in Jizan. At around the same time, Saudi Arabia was bombing various parts of northern Yemen: a Saudi bombing in Sa'ada killed five members of a family, and Saudi air raids in Hudaydah left two civilians killed. Saudi Arabia also bombed Hajjah, which ended up being bombed 10 times over a 24-hour period.[282]
