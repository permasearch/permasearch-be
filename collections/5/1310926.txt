The first story arc of the title, "The Court of Owls", focuses on Batman's discovery of a secret society in Gotham City that he had never known about before, dating back to the time of Gotham's founding and his ancestor Alan Wayne, and his battles against the Talons, the agents of the Court of Owls.[90] This led to the first major New 52 crossover, "Night of the Owls".[91] The finale of the story sees Thomas Wayne Jr. as the head Talon of the Court of Owls in Gotham.[92]
