The English loanword "schnapps" is derived from the colloquial German word Schnaps [ʃnaps] ( listen) (plural: Schnäpse)[2][3] which is used in reference to spirit drinks.[4] The word Schnaps stems from Low German language and is related to the German term "schnappen", which refers to the fact that the spirit or liquor drink is usually consumed in a quick slug from a small glass (i.e., a shot glass). In British English, a corresponding  term is "dram" [of liquor].[5]
