After Donald catches Leo and the Lab Rats coming home two hours past curfew and grounds them for three weeks, they use Donald's memory-erasing device to make him forget that he grounded them. However, Leo goes too far and accidentally erases 24 years instead of 24 hours, rendering him a teenager. When Chase tries to fix it, he wipes Donald's memory again to 24 years as a four-and-a-half-year old. When Donald discovers that Leo and the Lab Rats were using his memory-erasing device after he returns to normal, he grounds them "forever".
