France even linked the issue of the seat to the ongoing dispute regarding the seat of the European Parliament. Frankfurt was criticised as symbolising German dominance, although the Deutsche Bundesbank had effectively been running the Communities currencies for the previous years, while Luxembourg has a banking tradition that wasn't so careful. London was discredited because the UK remained outside the eurozone.[34] It was also seen as important to locate the bank in a city not already hosting a national government or EU institution, in order to emphasise its independence.[6] Others, such as the former head of the Bundesbank Karl Otto PÃ¶hl, favoured a small country with a stable currency.[34] The advantages of hosting the Bank were also in dispute by some economists. While there was seen by some as little to gain in terms of attracting other banks and financial institutions,[33] others saw it as affecting which cities would be financial hubs in the years to come.[34]
