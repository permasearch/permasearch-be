Sometimes, the recurring material is question is not part of the original composition but is rather tracked after-the-fact, or at least lifted, from existing material into a different section of the film. This includes the Podracing fanfare and the ostinato accompaniment of the Rebel Fanfare,[13][131] which otherwise doesn't appear isolated from the unabridged theme more than once; the mournful writing for French horn at Shmi's funeral, the Arena March from Attack of the Clones[89][56] etc.
