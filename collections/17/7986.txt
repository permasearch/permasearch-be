Parliament finally responded to the protests by repealing the Townshend taxes in 1770, except for the tea duty, which Prime Minister Lord North kept to assert "the right of taxing the Americans".[18] This partial repeal of the taxes was enough to bring an end to the non-importation movement by October 1770.[19] From 1771 to 1773, British tea was once again imported into the colonies in significant amounts, with merchants paying the Townshend duty of three pence per pound.[20] Boston was the largest colonial importer of legal tea; smugglers still dominated the market in New York and Philadelphia.[21]
