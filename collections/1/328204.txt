Linnaeus published Species Plantarum, the work which is now internationally accepted as the starting point of modern botanical nomenclature, in 1753.[104] The first volume was issued on 24 May, the second volume followed on 16 August of the same year.[note 4][106] The book contained 1,200 pages and was published in two volumes; it described over 7,300 species.[87]:47[107] The same year the king dubbed him knight of the Order of the Polar Star, the first civilian in Sweden to become a knight in this order. He was then seldom seen not wearing the order's insignia.[108]
