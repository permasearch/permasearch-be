Her breakthrough came in 2012 with her second studio album, Kiss, which marked a greater shift into mainstream pop music and was a moderate seller worldwide. Its single "Call Me Maybe" became a viral sensation, reaching number one in 18 countries and culminating as the year's best-selling single globally. Jepsen took a brief hiatus from the music industry soon thereafter, making her Broadway debut as the titular character in Cinderella. Jepsen's third studio album, Emotion (2015) is noted for blending her synthpop sound with "indie sensibilities". It was released to critical laudation and grew to become a cult favorite, attracting a more mature audience to her music. While its track "I Really Like You" reached the top five in the United Kingdom, the album failed to match her prior commercial success.
