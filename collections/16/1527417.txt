They could not yet continue into Putnam County. Ernest Fahnestock had donated the first 2,241 acres (907 ha) of the park named for his late brother. Further north, the TSPC had also acquired Lake Taghkanic and 172 acres (70 ha) around it for development when the parkway eventually reached it. But land prices were rising in Putnam County as a result of the parkway,[50] and the county's Board of Supervisors told the state's Department of Public Works (BPW) that it would not support the parkway since they believed the county had enough roads as it was.[46] As a result, the engineers were told to only survey property once it had been acquired, a policy that they found difficult to follow.
