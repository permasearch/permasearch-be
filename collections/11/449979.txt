Neil was replaced by John Corabi (formerly of Angora and the Scream). Although MÃ¶tley's self-titled March 1994 release made the Billboard top ten (#7), the album was a commercial failure. It also prompted negative reactions from many fans due to Neil's absence and its sound. Corabi suggested the band work with Neil, believing the latter would always be seen as the voice of the band. This eventually resulted in his own firing in 1996.[citation needed]
