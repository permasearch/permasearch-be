While no definitive biological significance of Z-DNA has been found, it is commonly believed to provide torsional strain relief during transcription, and it is associated with negative supercoiling.[5][12] However, while supercoiling is associated with both DNA transcription and replication, Z-DNA formation is primarily linked to the rate of transcription.[13]
