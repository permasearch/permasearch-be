Treasurer Magaziner launched BankLocal in early 2017. The nationally-recognized program moves a portion of the State's cash into secure accounts at local banks and credit unions - matching loans made to small businesses in Rhode Island, with a 2-to-1 match for loans to women and minority-owned businesses. In its first year, BankLocal moved more than $19 million into local banks and credit unions, supporting loans to more than 175 small businesses in Rhode Island.[18]
