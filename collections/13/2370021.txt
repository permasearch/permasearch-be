Terminal 1 was opened in 1998, 50 years after the opening of JFK, at the direction of the Terminal One Group, a consortium of four key operating carriers: Air France, Japan Airlines, Korean Air, and Lufthansa.[53] This partnership was founded after the four airlines reached agreement that the then-existing international carrier facilities were inadequate for their needs. Mostly European and some Asian and African carriers land at Terminal 1, such as Alitalia, Austrian Airlines, EVA Air, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Philippine Airlines, Royal Air Maroc, and Saudia.[54][55][56] It was designed by William Nicholas Bodouva + Associates.[57] Terminal 1, along with Terminal 4, is one of two terminals at JFK Airport that has the capability to handle the Airbus A380 aircraft, which are flown by Air France on the route from Paris–Charles De Gaulle, Lufthansa on the route from Frankfurt Airport and Korean Air on the route from Seoul–Incheon. Air France operated Concorde here until 2003. Terminal 1 has 11 gates.
