Since launch, Microsoft has been updating the OS monthly, with updates downloaded from the Xbox Live service directly to the Xbox One and subsequently installed, or by using offline recovery images downloaded via a PC.[4] In November 2015, a major system update known as the New Xbox One Experience was released, which brought very significant changes to the design and functionality of the system.[7] The Windows 10-based Core had replaced the Windows 8-based one in this update, and the new system is sometimes referred to as "Windows 10 on Xbox One".[8][9]
