The first Western major work on the history of China was by Augustinian friar Juan Gonz√°lez de Mendoza. It was a description of a visit to China by three others (including another Augustinian friar), and included the first known depiction of Chinese characters in Western publishing. In 1585 he published it at Rome in Spanish.
