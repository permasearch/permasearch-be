In 2016, the United States Department of Agriculture Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recommended that Americans eat as little dietary cholesterol as possible.[37] Increased dietary intake of industrial trans fats is associated with an increased risk in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular diseases.[38] Trans fats have been shown to reduce levels of HDL while increasing levels of LDL.[39] Based on such evidence and evidence implicating low HDL and high LDL levels in cardiovascular disease (see Hypercholesterolemia), many health authorities advocate reducing LDL-cholesterol through changes in diet in addition to other lifestyle modifications.[40] Rats subjected to high-fat or fructose diets became dyslipidemic.[41] However, well designed, adequately powered randomized controlled trials investigating patient-relevant outcomes of low-fat diets for otherwise healthy people with hypercholesterolaemia are lacking. Moreover, for familial hypercholesterolaemia, large, parallel, randomized controlled trials are still needed to investigate the effectiveness of a cholesterol-lowering diet and the addition of omega-3 fatty acids, soya protein, plant sterols or stanols.[42][43]
