Bulimia is more common among those who have a close relative with the condition.[2] The percentage risk that is estimated to be due to genetics is between 30% and 80%.[4] Other risk factors for the disease include psychological stress, cultural pressure to attain a certain body type, poor self-esteem, and obesity.[2][4] Living in a culture that promotes dieting and having parents that worry about weight are also risks.[4] Diagnosis is based on a person's medical history,[5] however this is difficult as people are usually secretive about their binge eating and purging habits.[4] Furthermore, the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa takes precedence over that of bulimia.[4] Other similar disorders include binge eating disorder, Kleine-Levin syndrome, and borderline personality disorder.[5]
