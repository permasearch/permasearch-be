A prominent feature in the non-dipolar part of the secular variation is a westward drift at a rate of about 0.2 degrees per year.[32] This drift is not the same everywhere and has varied over time. The globally averaged drift has been westward since about 1400 AD but eastward between about 1000 AD and 1400 AD.[34]
