At the start of the 2013–14 season, Cincinnati received just one vote in the Preseason AP Poll. The Bearcats got off to a hot start and picked up their 20th win on January 30, 2014, the fastest they've gotten to 20 wins since the 2001–02 season (went 31–4 that year). They also reached as high as #7 in the AP Poll, their highest since being ranked #6 in the 2003–04 season. On March 8, UC clinched a share of the AAC Conference regular season championship, their first conference title since 2004.[13]
