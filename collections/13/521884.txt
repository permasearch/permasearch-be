Many reviews commented on the reveal of the documentary crew. E! Online named the reveal one of the "Best TV Moments of the Week".[27] Verne Gay of Newsday called the scene a "historic" moment for the show.[28] Serrigran wrote that, between Jim and Pam fighting, and the cameramen making an appearance, the scene was "a lot to take in". However, she felt that the scene was properly done.[19] Jason Hughes of The Huffington Post called the reveal a "huge" and "shocking" moment.[29] Tedder called the reveal "something that we've never seen before on The Office." He admitted that, "the last five minutes of this episode genuinely startled me, which is an impressive feat for a series on its ninth and final season."[21] Porter called the shots with Brian "good" because it reaffirmed that the camera crew was a character, one that had been an integral part of the show.[22] Wilcox wrote that Brian's appearance was a "weird turn", and that it was "kind of funny" that the first time a member of the camera crew intervened with the characters was when Pam needed comforting and not "one of Dwight or Michael's dozens of near-death experiences."[23] Poniewozik enjoyed the reveal of the documentary crew. However, he wrote that, "I don't know if I'm going to like the idea of making Brian an actual player in the events, if indeed that's where the show is going."[18] Adams, on the other hand, said that the reveal of the cameramen was "a Big Moment for The Office, but it has a hollow ring to it" because the cameramen had never before interacted with the members of the office before.[25] Campbell wrote that "the show played its documentary crew trump card WAY  [sic] too early" and noted that the crew had never intervened in past events that were on the same level as Pam crying.[26]
