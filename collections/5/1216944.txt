Ice King is a frequent antagonist and occasional ally of Finn and Jake who kidnaps princesses throughout Ooo to forcefully marry them, Princess Bubblegum being his usual target.[11] His ice-based magic abilities come from a magical crown he wears, which directly causes his insanity.[12] Though defined as completely crazy by many, the character is also lonely and misunderstood, having a generally benevolent relationship with the penguins of his realm. When he briefly had a wife, he actually treated her with great care and love. Whenever he kidnaps princesses, he treats them with care and respect. Aside from the actual imprisonment, their only protests seem to be that they don't like him and he occasionally could become possessive and slightly creepy. Despite rarely meaning harm, Ice King is still potentially very dangerous due to his power and his unstable mind which warps his sense of morality and socially acceptable behavior. Furthermore, unaware that the two learned of his origins as Simon Petrikov before being driven insane by the crown's influence, he is somewhat envious of Finn and Jake for being such good friends.
