Janice Robinson was a singer from the U.S and was the original vocalist on the 1994 & 1995 editions of 'Dreamer'. When the group was unable to reach a deal with Robinson for a follow up single she was replaced by Doris Diggs AKA Tameka Starr. Tameka recorded a version of 'Dreamer' for the Livin' Joy album entitled 'Don't Stop Movin', but the original by Janice Robinson was a hidden track on the album.
