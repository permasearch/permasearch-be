Data following enactment of mandatory insurance showed total emergency visits and spending continued to increase, and low-severity emergency visits decreased less than 2%; researchers concluded, "To the extent that policymakers expected a substantial decrease in overall and low-severity ED visits, this study does not support those expectations."[58] Other analysis concluded that preventable ED visits were reduced 5-8% for non-urgent or primary care ED visits relative to other states.[59] A more complete report released in January 2012 found between 2006 and 2010 emergency department visits and non-urgent visits had dropped 1.9 and 3.8% respectively.[60] A 2014 study found that the law was associated with "a small but consistent increase" in ED use in the state.[61] A 2014 study found that the reform was associated with "significant reductions in all-cause mortality and deaths from causes amenable to health care."[62]
