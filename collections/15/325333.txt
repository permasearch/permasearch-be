Michael Petroni was hired to rewrite the script with Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely,[30] following a draft written by Richard LaGravenese and Steven Knight.[31][32] The previous two films have been described as remaining more faithful to the original stories than the third installment.[33] Apted noted the episodic and disconnected nature of the story would need to be revised for a film version, such as the material involving the Dark Island, the Sea Serpent, and Eustace. They even discussed combining The Voyage of the Dawn Treader with The Silver Chair, much as the BBC combined Dawn Treader and Prince Caspian in its television serial. As a result, some elements were borrowed from The Silver Chair, where Narnians are held hostage and rescued. The author's estate did not initially receive the change well, but it gained favor after review.[31]
