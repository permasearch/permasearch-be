Ebenezer Floppen Slopper's Wonderful Water slides is an abandoned waterpark located on a large hill on Roosevelt Road and Route 83 in Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois.  It first opened on July 5, 1980 with two 800 foot concrete water slides and gradually added 5 additional slides and a wading pool.  The water park became a major summer attraction for residents of surrounding towns and communities as people lined up for rides down the large winding slides.  When the two main slides first began operation, people slid down in groups of up to eight people at a time on rubber mats.  The 5 other slides added to the park included 2 flat racer slides in which people slid down head first on folded rubber mats, 2 semi enclosed tube body slides, and a smaller inner tube slide which emptied into a nearby wading pool.  The slides were also unique in that they were lined with a blue rubber foam material which would prevent injuries from contacts with the slide walls.  Due to the design of the 2 main large concrete slides, especially with the V-shaped configuration of their side walls, people could also slide quite high up the walls of the slides, especially when hitting a turn at high speeds.  Around 1987, the large concrete slides were re surfaced with flat bottoms with humps and bumps in which people went down solo on inner tubes, getting bumped up and down and sideways as they went down the renovated slides and the park was re named "Doc River's Roaring Rapids water park."
