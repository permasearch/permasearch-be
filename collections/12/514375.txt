The NIHSS has been found to be an excellent predictor of patient outcomes. A baseline NIHSS score greater than 16 indicates a strong probability of patient death, while a baseline NIHSS score less than 6 indicates a strong probability of a good recovery. On average, an increase of 1 point in a patientâ€™s NIHSS score decreases the likelihood of an excellent outcome by 17%.[26] However, correlation between functional recovery and NIHSS scores was weaker when the stroke was isolated to the cortex.[24]
