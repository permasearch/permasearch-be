The following day, Donna attended Laura's funeral. At school, Donna was doing her makeup when Audrey came in and told her that she was aware of the secrets surrounding Laura's life, including that she had been seeing Doctor Lawrence Jacoby, something that Donna didn't know. Later, she went to the woods with James to find the other half of the necklace that they buried but they could not find it. Donna later went to the Double R Diner with him, where she met Laura's cousin, Maddy Ferguson. She asked Maddy to assist them in their investigation into Laura's death. Later that night, Maddy called Donna and told her that she found a tape in Laura's hiding place. Donna listened to the tape and realized that it was recorded for Doctor Jacoby. She discovers that a tape recorded the night Laura died is missing. James believes that Jacoby must be in possession of it and suggested they go to Jacoby's office to find the tape, and they could lure him out with a "phone call from Laura." Later, she met Maddy and James in the park, the former wearing a blonde wig to make her look identical to Laura. Maddy deceived Jacoby by speaking as Laura on the phone. Donna and James infiltrated his office as he left. Donna found the missing tape and half of Laura's necklace. At Donna's house, they listened to the tape, in which Laura mentioned a "mystery man" who drove a red corvette.
