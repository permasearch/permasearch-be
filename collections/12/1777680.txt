Many homes were built in the neighborhood during a period of significant growth between 1890 and 1910, largely due to the success of the gold mines in Cripple Creek and Victor and resulting industry in the city of Colorado Springs. There were more than 400 mining companies and three mining exchanges established in Colorado Springs. Colorado Springs Mining Exchange became successful, trading "more shares than any other exchange in the world." The population of the city doubled between 1890 and 1900.[6][7]
