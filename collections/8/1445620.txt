Sexual selection is the ability of male and female organisms to exert selective forces on each other with regard to mating activity.[5] The strongest driver of sexual selection is gamete size. In general, eggs are bigger than sperm, and females produce fewer gametes than males. This leads to eggs being a bigger investment, so to females being choosy about the traits that will be passed on to her offspring by males. The peahen's reproductive success and the likelihood of survival of her chicks is partly dependent on the genotype of the mate.[6] Females generally have more to lose when mating with an inferior male due to her gametes being more costly than the male's.
