Thérèse's time as a postulant began with her welcome into the Carmel, Monday, 9 April 1888.[46]  She felt peace after she received communion that day and later wrote,  "At last my desires were realized, and I cannot describe the deep sweet peace which filled my soul. This peace has remained with me during the eight and a half years of my life here, and has never left me even amid the greatest trials".CITEREFSaint_ThérèseTaylor_(tr.)2006
