Ushuaia suffered several epidemics, including typhus, pertussis, and measles, that decimated the native population. But because the Yámana were not included in census data, the exact numbers lost are not known. The first census was held in 1893, which recorded 113 men and 36 women living in Ushuaia. The prison was formally announced in an Executive order by the then-Acting President Roca in 1896.[10] By 1911 the Yámana had all practically disappeared, so the mission was closed.[18] The population grew to 1,558 by the 1914 census.
