"Measuring" vectors is done by specifying a norm, a datum which measures lengths of vectors, or by an inner product, which measures angles between vectors. Norms and inner products are denoted      |   v   |    {\displaystyle |\mathbf {v} |}   and     ⟨  v  ,  w  ⟩   {\displaystyle \langle \mathbf {v} ,\mathbf {w} \rangle }  , respectively. The datum of an inner product entails that lengths of vectors can be defined too, by defining the associated norm      |   v   |  :=   ⟨  v  ,  v  ⟩     {\displaystyle |\mathbf {v} |:={\sqrt {\langle \mathbf {v} ,\mathbf {v} \rangle }}}  . Vector spaces endowed with such data are known as normed vector spaces and inner product spaces, respectively.[49]
