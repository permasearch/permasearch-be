Bart, and other The Simpsons characters, have appeared in numerous television commercials for Nestl√©'s Butterfinger candy bars from 1990 to 2001, with the slogan "Nobody better lay a finger on my Butterfinger!"[158] Lisa would occasionally advertise it too. Matt Groening would later say that the Butterfinger advertising campaign was a large part of the reason why Fox decided to pick up the half-hour show.[159] The campaign was discontinued in 2001, much to the disappointment of Cartwright.[160] Bart has also appeared in commercials for Burger King and Ramada Inn.[160] In 2001, Kellogg's launched a brand of cereal called "Bart Simpson Peanut Butter Chocolate Crunch", which was available for a limited time.[161][162] Before the half-hour series went on the air, Matt Groening pitched Bart as a spokesperson for Jell-O. He wanted Bart to sing "J-E-L-L-O", then burp the letter O. His belief was that kids would try to do it the next day, but he was rejected.[163]
