The use of a milk derivative prompts some individuals and organisations - such as vegans and Jewish dietary law authorities - to classify the product as "dairy" rather than nondairy. Those who rely on this classification will either not consume the product (e.g. vegans) or will not use or consume it in conjunction with any meat products (e.g. observant Jews).[8] As with other processed food products, low calorie and low fat versions are available for non-dairy creamers. People with milk allergy need to be aware that ""non-dairy creamer" may contain sodium caseinate, a milk protein. It will be in the ingredient list.
