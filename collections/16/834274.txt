LPS lamps are among the most efficient electrical light sources when measured in photopic lighting conditions, producing above 100 and up to 200 lm/W.[8] This high efficiency is partly due to the light emitted being at a wavelength near the peak sensitivity of the human eye. They are used mainly for outdoor lighting (such as street lights and security lighting) where faithful color rendition is not important. Recent studies show that under typical nighttime mesopic driving conditions, whiter light can provide better results at a lower level of illumination.[9]
