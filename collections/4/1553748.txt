Like all things in matter, also humans have a soul that is a dialectic of hun and po (魂魄), respectively the yang spirit or mind, and the yin animal soul that is the body.[93] Hun (mind) is the shen (that gives a form to the qi) of humans, and it develops through the po, stretching and moving intelligently in order to grasp things.[94] The po is the "feminine" soul which controls the physiological and psychological activities of man,[95] while the hun, the god attached to the vital breath, is the "masculine" soul that is totally independent of corporeal substance.[95] The hun is virile, independent and perpetual, and as such it never allows itself to be limited in matter.[95][note 6] Otherwise said, the po is the "earthly" (di) soul that goes downward, while the hun is the "heavenly" (tian) soul that moves upward.[87]
