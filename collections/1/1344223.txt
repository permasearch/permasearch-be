Manganese is essential to iron and steel production by virtue of its sulfur-fixing, deoxidizing, and alloying properties, as first recognized by the British metallurgist Robert Forester Mushet (1811 - 1891) who, in 1856, introduced the element, in the form of Spiegeleisen, into steel for the specific purpose of removing excess dissolved oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus in order to improve its malleability. Steelmaking,[36] including its ironmaking component, has accounted for most manganese demand, presently in the range of 85% to 90% of the total demand.[33] Manganese is a key component of low-cost stainless steel.[31][37]
