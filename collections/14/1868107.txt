About 6 percent of people with type 1 diabetes have celiac disease, but in most cases there are no digestive symptoms[16][6] or are mistakenly attributed to poor control of diabetes, gastroparesis or diabetic neuropathy.[16] In most cases, celiac disease is diagnosed after onset of type 1 diabetes. The association of celiac disease with type 1 diabetes increases the risk of complications, such as retinopathy and mortality. This association can be explained by shared genetic factors, and inflammation or nutritional deficiencies caused by untreated celiac disease, even if type 1 diabetes is diagnosed first.[6]
