There are several different religions that have different perspectives. Islam has a conflicting view regarding the issue, with half believing that it is against the religion. However, Muhammed claims his believers should seek medical attention when in need and saving life is a very important factor of the Islamic religion. Buddhism is mostly against the practice, because it disrespects the bodies of ancestors and nature. Christianity is the most lenient on the topic of organ donation, and believe it is a service of life.[132]
