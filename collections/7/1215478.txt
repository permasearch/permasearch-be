In a second article, a review of Bendix and Guenther Roth's Scholarship and Partisanship: Essays on Max Weber,[135] Parsons continued his line of criticism. Parsons was especially concerned with a statement by Bendix that claimed Weber believed Marx's notion that ideas were "the epiphenomena of the organization of production." Parsons strongly rejected that interpretation: "I should contend that certainly the intellectual "mature" Weber never was an "hypothetical" Marxist."[136] Somewhere behind the attitudes of Bendix, Parsons detected a discomfort for the former to move out of an "idiographic" mode of theorizing.
