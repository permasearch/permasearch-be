One day, as Creasy waits to escort Pita from a piano lesson, a group of civilian thugs and two uniformed Policía Judicial Federal (PJF) officers kidnap her. Creasy opens fire, killing four of the kidnappers (including the corrupt PJF officers), but collapses from multiple gunshot wounds as the abductors escape with Pita. Creasy is hospitalized, charged for murdering the policeman and is suspected in Pita's kidnapping. Miguel Manzano, the honest Director of the Agencia Federal de Investigación (AFI), fears Creasy will be killed by corrupt PJF cops, so has Rayburn help move him to a veterinary hospital.
