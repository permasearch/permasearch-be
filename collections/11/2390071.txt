His first movie was the Charles K. Feldman production What's New Pussycat? in 1965, for which he wrote the screenplay.[10] He was disappointed with the final product, which inspired him to direct every film that he would later write.[10] Allen's first directorial effort was What's Up, Tiger Lily? (1966, co-written with Mickey Rose), in which an existing Japanese spy movie—Kokusai himitsu keisatsu: Kagi no kagi (1965), "International Secret Police: Key of Keys"—was redubbed in English by Allen and friends with fresh new, comic dialogue. In 1967, Allen played Jimmy Bond in the 007 spoof Casino Royale.
