Beginning in 1790, Pennsylvania became the first of the United States to institute solitary confinement for incarcerated convicts.[99] After 1790, those sentenced to hard labor in Pennsylvania were moved indoors to an inner block of solitary cells in Philadelphia's Walnut Street Jail.[99] New York began implementing solitary living quarters at New York City's Newgate Prison in 1796.[99]
