Prior to being cast in Glee, Colfer had no professional acting experience.[4] He originally auditioned for the role of Artie Abrams, performing "Mr. Cellophane" from the musical Chicago. Murphy was so impressed by his performance that the role of Kurt was created for him.[5] To keep the number of students in the glee club constant, a character named Rajish was cut from the show.[6] Kurt's name is inspired by the character Kurt von Trapp from The Sound of Music, a role that Colfer once played as a child.[4] The Hummel surname comes from the popular German Hummel figurines; Colfer explained in an interview that Murphy thought he had their rosy-cheeked complexion.[7] Murphy praised Colfer's abilities despite his lack of formal training, saying, "I just thought he was so talented and gifted and unusual. I've never seen anyone who looks like him or acts like him or sounds like him. You'd think heâ€™d been at Juilliard for six years but he hasn't."[8] Murphy saw something of himself in the young actor, a fact that Colfer says is "completely mind-blowing". Colfer added, "For him to see me in him, I can't even describe it."[8]
