The cutover values for the maximum number of clusters for FAT12 and FAT16 file systems are defined as such that the highest possible data cluster values (0xFF5 and 0xFFF5,[11] respectively) will always be smaller than this value.[11] Therefore, this value cannot normally occur in cluster-chains, but if it does, it may be treated as a normal data cluster, since 0xFF7 could have been a non-standard data cluster on FAT12 volumes before the introduction of the bad cluster marker with DOS 2.0 or the introduction of FAT16 with DOS 3.0,[12] and 0xFFF7 could have been a non-standard data cluster on FAT16 volumes before the introduction of FAT32 with DOS 7.10. Theoretically, 0x0FFFFFF7 can be part of a valid cluster chain on FAT32 volumes, but disk utilities should avoid creating FAT32 volumes, where this condition could occur. The file system should avoid to allocate this cluster for files.[12]
