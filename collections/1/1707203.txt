The mysterious all time master thief mentioned by Isabel as an example for all active robbers, LeMarque actually plays a crucial part in the entire operation carried out by Oceanâ€™s eleven in Twelve. He pits the Night Fox against the Ocean crew with his master plan, which results in him getting back the Coronation Egg he once stole but gave back because his wife insisted on it; the Ocean crew getting their money from the Night Fox needed to pay back Benedict; and LeMarque getting reacquainted with his estranged daughter.
