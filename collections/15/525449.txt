Production on the season began in April 7, 2016, in Vancouver, once Miller and Purcell completed filming for Legends of Tomorrow.[35] Filming concluded in Vancouver on July 11, 2016.[36] On June 1, 2016, Dominic Purcell was almost killed on set in Morocco, after an iron bar used as a set piece had fallen onto his head, which caused a broken nose and a head injury. Purcell was immediately airlifted from Marrakesh to Casablanca for treatment where he recovered. Filming of the series was not substantially disrupted due to the accident.[37][38][39]
