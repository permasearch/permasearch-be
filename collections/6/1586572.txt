From 1991 to 1999 (Poland joining NATO), Norway was the only NATO country to share a land border with Russia. This caused a decrease in allied interest in Norway's border issue, leaving Norway more to itself in managing the relationship.[14] Cooperation concerning conservation of nature started in 1990. It was initially a Norwegian proposal to protect the important bird area and lake of Fj√¶rvann, and resulted in a joint Norwegian and Russian Pasvik Nature Reserve.[32] The Russian part was formally established in 1992 and the Norwegian part the following year.[33]
