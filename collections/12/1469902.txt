In search for a signal, she and Emma trick Ravi and Tiffany into building a router, saying that Gladys wanted a secret art project to commence. They lie when asked about it, and when Lou finds out, she is very hurt and stops talking to Emma. Meanwhile, Grizzly Cabin is entrusted with designing the camp totem pole, and Xander gets very controlling, which upsets Jorge and causes him to quit. Later, Xander and Jorge reconcile and Jorge gets to use his design for the pole. Then Emma and Lou also reconcile when Emma destroys the pole, among other things.
