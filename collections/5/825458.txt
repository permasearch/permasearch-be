Although most of the wars ended with the Peace of Westphalia in 1648,[1][2] religious conflicts continued to be fought in Europe until at least the 1710s.[5] These included the Savoyard-Waldensian Wars (1655–1690)[5][2] the Nine Years' War (1688–1697, including the Glorious Revolution and the Williamite War in Ireland)[2] and the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714).[2] Whether these should be included in the European wars of religion depends on how one defines a 'war of religion', and whether these wars can be considered 'European' (i.e. international rather than domestic).[9]
