This lengthy-titled artwork features a large Tiger Shark suspended in formaldehyde, the most well-known of his series ‘Natural History’. This series is said to “contain some of the artist’s most widely recognized and important works”. The tank in which the shark is floating creates the illusion of the animal being cut into three pieces due to the container looking like three separate blocks. The work itself is very simplistic, featuring only the shark in a watery substance, which at first glance looks clear like glass. The piece itself is fairly old, having been created in 1991. Because of this, the formaldehyde preserving the shark has slowly eaten away at the animal’s body, showing signs of decay.[54]
