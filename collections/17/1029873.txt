On September 3, 1869, following a revolution which overthrew Isabella II, the name was changed to Banco EspaÃ±ol-Filipino. In January 1892, the bank moved from the Royal Custom House in Intramuros to the new business district of Binondo after it found out that Intramuros was becoming "economically inactive". It moved to 4 Plaza Cervantes, which was at that time a prime property owned by the Dominican friars.
