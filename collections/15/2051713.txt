The Islamic calendar is a lunar one, so that there are twelve lunar months in a year of 354 or 355 days, being 11 days shorter than a solar year. Consequently, holy days in Islam migrate around the solar year on a 32-year cycle.[30] Some Islamic states use the Gregorian calendar (as the Common Era calendar) for civil purposes, while retaining the Islamic calendar for religious purposes.
