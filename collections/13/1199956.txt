The largest and most grand of the gardens was the 0.75-acre (0.30Â ha) "Garden of the Nations" (alternatively "Gardens of the Nations"), which was installed on the eleventh-floor roof of 30 Rockefeller Plaza and opened in April 1935.[330][238][334] The construction effort involved 3,000 short tons (2,700 long tons) of soil; 100 short tons (89 long tons) of rock from as far as England; 100,000 bricks; 2,000 trees and shrubs; 4,000 small plants; and 20,000 bulbs for flowers.[321] They were originally composed of thirteen nation-specific gardens whose layouts were inspired by the gardens in the respective countries they represented. Each of the nation-themed gardens were separated by barriers.[330] There was an "International Garden", a rock garden, in the center of the thirteen nation-themed gardens,[320] which featured a meandering stream and 2,000 plant varieties.[40] The Garden of the Nations also contained a children's garden, a modern-style garden, and a shrub-and-vegetable patch.[327] Upon opening, the Garden of the Nations attracted many visitors because of its collection of exotic flora,[335] and it became the most popular garden in Rockefeller Center.[336] In its heyday, the Center charged admission fees for the Garden of the Nations. However, all of the nation-themed gardens were eventually removed, and the rock garden was left to dry up, supplanted by flower beds that were no longer open to the public.[331]
