One major method used to measure visual acuity during infancy is by testing an infant’s sensitivity to visual details such as a set of black strip lines in a pictorial image. Studies have shown that most one-week-old infants can discriminate a gray field from a fine black stripped field at a distance of one foot away.[6] This means that most infants will look longer at patterned visual stimuli instead of a plain, pattern-less stimuli.[7] Gradually, infants develop the ability to distinguish strips of lines that are closer together. Therefore, by measuring the width of the strips and their distance from an infant’s eye, visual acuity can be estimated, with detection of finer strips indicating better acuity. When examining an infants preferred visual stimuli, it was found that one-month-old infants often gazed mostly at prominent, sharp features of an object – whether it is a strong defined curve or an edge.[8] Beginning at two months old, infants begin to direct their saccades to the interior of the object, but still focusing on strong features.[9][10] Additionally, infants starting from one month of age have been found to prefer visual stimuli that are in motion rather than stationary.[11]
