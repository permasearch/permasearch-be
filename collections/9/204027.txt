Soon after Pickett and Fitzhugh Lee left for lunch, Colonel Munford saw the Union attack shaping up as he prepared to have his cavalry division defend the left flank against the attack.[187] Munford sent several couriers to look for Pickett or Fitzhugh Lee to tell them of the impending attack but they could not be found.[188][189] Captain Henry Lee of Fitzhugh Lee's staff also could not find them.[188][189] Munford had his division dismount, and deployed it on the left of Ransom's refused line.[189] Each Confederate unit commander prepared for the attack as best he could, not always in co-operation with each other.[189]
