The dance version of "Baby Shark" was popularized online in a 2007 YouTube video called "Kleiner Hai" published by Alexandra Müller who is also known by her stage name alemuel.[1] This version is set to the theme of Jaws and tells the story of a baby shark who grows up and eats a swimmer.[2] The video gained popularity shortly after[3] and alemuel was offered a record deal by the label EMI Müller[4], which published the song accompanied by disco beats on May 30, 2008. The single peaked at place 25 of the German charts[5] and place 21 of the Austrian charts [6]. Based on the single and the original video, the youtube community created a popular music video which is a typical example of crowdsourcing. The German version of the song remains popular among German youth groups and multiple variations (also in different dialects of German [7]) have been published since it first gained popularity in 2007.
