Weil discovers a flaw in the plan: The Toussaint can only be unclasped using a special magnet carried by the bodyguards hired by Cartier. Nine Ball enlists her younger sister, Veronica, to build a similar magnet in time for the gala. As the gala begins, Daphne consumes soup that Lou spiked, causing her to vomit in the restroom, where Constance takes the necklace. When the necklace is discovered to be missing, the museum is evacuated and searched; Tammy "finds" the duplicate necklace in order to end the search. Meanwhile, Amita retrieves the real necklace and begins disassembling it. She retools it into several pieces of jewelry, and gives them to Constance to slip it to each member of the team. One of the real diamonds is planted on Becker.
