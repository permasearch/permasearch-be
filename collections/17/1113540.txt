The duo, along with some of their friends, including Knowledge and Mark, start transporting drugs from Queens to Omaha, and begin to overrun the drug business there. This is met with jealousy from a local drug dealer Big Head Rico (Tyrin Turner), who informs the police of their activities. This results in a raid at their stash-house, which results in Mark's death and Knowledge's arrest. Knowledge calls Tommy's house from jail and is told by Keisha that Tommy isn't there, nor should he have called since the FBI could have tapped their phone. Knowledge gets angry that Tommy won't come to bail him out, and calls Shameek, aka Father Sha (Method Man), to not only infiltrate Rico's gang, but to handle Tommy. While at a strip club in Omaha, Shameek confronts Rico and informs him that Knowledge sent him here to kill him and his associates. When Rico tries to run from Shameek, Shameek shoots and kills Rico as well as some members of his crew. While reloading, Shameek is shot by the bartender. Stumbling out the club, he manages to evade police.
