Each episode begins with Shaw and Townshend picking up and reviewing the featured car. Shaw will discuss why the car is being restored with the nominee's relatives, while Townshend inspects the car's state, working out the amount of work needed. The car is then winched onto a trailer, and taken to Townshend's workshop, where it is inspected further by all of the restoration team. As the work on restoring the car begins, Shaw is given a list and travels the country to find the needed parts, often portrayed in a comedic, 'blagging' manner. Shaw and Townshend will occasionally break from the restoration, leaving it in the safe hands of the team to visit other restored models of the same car, test driving them and talking with other owners. Towards the end of the restoration, Shaw will invite the nominee's family to discuss setting up a fake scenario or event, in which they can return the car to the owner. The fake event is also usually presented in a comedic manner, with Shaw often being in a form of disguise, before revealing who he is, and his intentions to the owner, who is then presented with their restored car.
