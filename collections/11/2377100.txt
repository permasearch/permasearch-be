The Zaporizhian Sich were a vassal people of Poland–Lithuania during feudal times. Under increasing pressure from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, in the mid-17th century the Sich declared an independent Cossack Hetmanate, initiated by a rebellion under Bohdan Khmelnytsky.  Afterwards, the Treaty of Pereyaslav (1654) brought most of the Cossack state under Russian rule.[5] The Sich with its lands became an autonomous region under the Russian-Polish protectorate.[6]
