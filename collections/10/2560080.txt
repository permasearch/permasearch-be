Rebecca Harding Davis's Life in the Iron Mills, was recognized as a significant short story by writers such as Emily Dickinson, Louisa May Alcott, and Nathaniel Hawthorne among many others. The short story also influenced a lot of women writers after the republication of the story by Tillie Olsen. For example, Life in the Iron Mills inspired Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward to write the short story "The Tenth of January" in 1868, which dealt with a mill that collapsed in Lawrence, Massachusetts. The short story is recognized as the starting point for the use of realism in literature representing the labor force.[26]
