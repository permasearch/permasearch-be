In the video game, Brother 7 is said be God himself and that one becomes a God by sacrificing the other six Brothers where they each fell into the rotating blades. Brother 2 does this while attempting to use Afro to take his place. However, Afro Samurai defeats the rest of the brothers, after his fight with Jinno while Brother 3 throws his own blood into the rotating blades before leaving the rest to the Empty Seven's robots.
