Salt is also a religious symbol. Salt is used to make holy water in the Roman Catholic Church rite,[6] and as such figures as a religious symbol of sanctity, associated with exorcism. The meals served at the witches' sabbath were thought to be salt-free as a consequence.[7] Salt is a symbol of the preserving value of sanctity in Jesus' reference to the "salt of the earth". As an emblem of sanctity and protection, its inadvertent loss may be more than a natural misfortune.
