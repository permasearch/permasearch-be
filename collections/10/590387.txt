These definitions of the metre and nautical mile have been superseded by more precise ones, but the original definitions are still accurate enough for conceptual purposes, and for some calculations. For example, they imply that one kilometre is exactly 0.54 nautical miles. Using official modern definitions, one nautical mile is exactly 1.852 kilometres,[3] which implies that 1 kilometre ≈ 6999539956800000000♠0.53995680 nautical miles.[4] This modern ratio differs from the one calculated from the original definitions by less than one part in ten thousand.
