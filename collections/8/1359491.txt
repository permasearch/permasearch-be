Episode Summary: Courtney Snody (nÃ©e Ames) is a 17-year-old high school senior from Woodland Park, Colorado who is pregnant by her boyfriend Scott Snody. Since getting pregnant, Courtney has decided to be abstinent moving forward until marriage due to her religious convictions, which puts a strain on her committed relationship with Scott. Also, Courtney was born with a cleft lip and cleft palate, which required seven surgeries to correct. Her concerns about their forthcoming baby also having the same issues are confirmed with sonograms. Courtney moves in with Scott before the birth in order to provide the baby a stable family environment, but she insists on sleeping in separate bedrooms in order to stay abstinent, leading to further strain on the relationship. Dayton Cash is born on December 15, 2013, weighing 7 lb. He has a minor cleft lip that will likely be correctable with one surgery, and is otherwise healthy. In the weeks following the birth, the episode focuses on the stresses to Courtney's and Scott's relationship over unequal divisions of household labor and Courtney's continued commitment to her renewed purity pledge.
