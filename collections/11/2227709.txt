Casey is featured briefly in three episodes of Chicago P.D.. Although he is on friendly terms with most characters, he has a notable grudge against Detective Hank Voight due to the fact that he was a victim of Voight's cover as a corrupt cop running with local gangs and was livid by Voight's cover-up of his son's DUI. The animosity has since faded some as Voight saved him from being shot by Jack Nesbitt in the nick of time.
