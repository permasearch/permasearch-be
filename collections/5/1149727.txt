The Chumash reservation, established in 1901, encompasses 127 acres. No native Chumash speak their own language since InesÃ±o, whose last speaker died in 1965. Today, the Chumash are estimated to have a population of 5,000 members. Many current members can trace their ancestors to the five islands of Channel Island National Park.
