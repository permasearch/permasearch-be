On October 28, 1948, Berry married Themetta "Toddy" Suggs, who gave birth to Darlin Ingrid Berry on October 3, 1950.[19] Berry supported his family by taking various jobs in St. Louis, working briefly as a factory worker at two automobile assembly plants and as a janitor in the apartment building where he and his wife lived. Afterwards he trained as a beautician at the Poro College of Cosmetology, founded by Annie Turnbo Malone.[20] He was doing well enough by 1950 to buy a "small three room brick cottage with a bath" on Whittier Street,[21] which is now listed as the Chuck Berry House on the National Register of Historic Places.[22]
