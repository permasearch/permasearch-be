Lawrence's singing debut was in 1986, when he and Joey performed at the 1986 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.  (Matt sang at the 1991 Macy's Parade as well.)  Other musical Matt rarities can be found on two Gimme A Break episodes (Nell's Secret Admirer; Johnny B. Goode & The Window; Part 1; Rock & Roll Music), two Brotherly Love episodes (A Roman Holiday; Silent Night, Art Attack; Pigeon On Your Car) and his last musical moment on Boy Meets World (As Time Goes By; This Dame).  Except for Silent Night and This Dame, Matt also played guitar on the remaining three.
