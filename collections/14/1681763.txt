Tournaments and royal festivities were also staged there.[8] On one occasion, when Catherine of Aragon married Arthur, Prince of Wales in 1501, a grandiose tournament was held in New Palace Yard. A stand was erected for the King on the south side of the yard and challengers exited Westminster Hall on horseback. They proceeded into the yard accompanied by a pageant-car which was drawn by four animals and carried a "fair young lady" on "a goodly chair of cloth of gold". Jousting is last recorded to have taken place in the yard in 1547 when Edward VI was crowned.[9]
