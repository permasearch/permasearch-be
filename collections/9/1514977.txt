The National Highway (NH-181) &( NH-766 ) passes through Bandipur national park. This road has been a major concern as speeding vehicles have killed many wild animals in spite of frequent warnings to travelers from the forest department officials and restriction on movement of vehicles in some stretches between 6 P.M to 6 A.M.[9] This has raised fears of extinction of habitat of wild animals exclusively found in this national park.
