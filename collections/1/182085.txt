Before The Lion King, Henn's experience as a supervising animator was limited to predominantly female characters;[4][33] he had just recently completed work on Ariel from The Little Mermaid (1989), Belle from Beauty and the Beast (1991) and Jasmine from Aladdin (1992).[29] When he became involved with The Lion King, Henn initially expressed interest in animating the film's villain, Scar, because he wanted to do "something different."[4] However, producer Don Hahn felt that he was better suited for animating Simba.[34] Henn approaches animating new characters by "put[ting himself] into the characterâ€™s situation." Simba proved to be a challenge because Henn was faced with the task of creating an animated character who would both appear and behave like a real lion cub. To achieve this, Henn visited zoos, sketched and studied live lion cubs that were brought into the studio for research, and frequently consulted with wildlife experts.[35]
