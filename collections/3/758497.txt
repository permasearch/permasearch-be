The most common oxidation state for sodium is +1. It is generally less reactive than potassium and more reactive than lithium.[13] Sodium metal is highly reducing, with the standard reduction potential for the Na+/Na couple being âˆ’2.71 volts,[14] though potassium and lithium have even more negative potentials.[15]
