There are important differences in social position concerning "races". These differences encompass income, education, housing, etc. According to the 2007 PNAD, White workers wages were almost twice those of Blacks and "pardos".[citation needed] Blacks and "pardos" earned on average 1.8 minimum wages, while Whites averaged 3.4 minimum wages.[citation needed] These differences cannot be exclusively attributed to differences in education: among workers with over 12 years of study, Whites earned on average R$15.90 per hour, while Blacks and "pardos" made R$11.40.[citation needed]
