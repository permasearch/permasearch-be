As the tornado descends onto Wisteria Lane, Karen locates Ida's cat under a nearby car.  Lynnette gets to her and attempts to get Karen to come back in the house, but before she can get Karen to come in, they both see the tornado coming.  They run into Lynette's house where they hide in a bathtub covered with a mattress.
