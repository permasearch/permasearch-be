Jehovah's Witnesses believe death is a state of non-existence with no consciousness. There is no Hell of fiery torment; Hades and Sheol are understood to refer to the condition of death, termed the common grave.[183] Jehovah's Witnesses consider the soul to be a life or a living body that can die.[184] Jehovah's Witnesses believe that humanity is in a sinful state,[184] from which release is only possible by means of Jesus' shed blood as a ransom, or atonement, for the sins of humankind.[185]
