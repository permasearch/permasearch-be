In an early 1992 article published in various daily newspapers across America, the author Jerry Buck noted that Ringwald had described the role as "nerve-wracking", however her portrayal of the real life AIDS patient Alison Gertz fulfilled a personal need to combat the disease. Ringwald had stated "I'd been wanting to do something to help in the fight against AIDS, but I didn't know what to do. I didn't think I would be very good at raising funds, since Madonna and Elizabeth Taylor are doing a terrific job. I wanted to do something to increase public awareness. When the script came along I knew this was it. It shows that AIDS is not just a gay problem and is spreading rapidly among heterosexuals. Young people are very vulnerable because they're experimenting sexually, yet often feel it can't affect them."
