The current R service is the successor to the original Route 2 of the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation. When 2 service began  on January 15, 1916, it ran between Chambers Street on the BMT Nassau Street Line and 86th Street on the BMT Fourth Avenue Line, using the Manhattan Bridge to cross the East River, and running via Fourth Avenue local. Service on the BMT Broadway Line, which at the time was only between Whitehall Street–South Ferry and Times Square–42nd Street, began exactly two years later on January 15, 1918. On July 10, 1919, service was extended to 57th Street–Seventh Avenue with the opening of that station.[4] The Montague Street Tunnel and the 60th Street Tunnel both opened on August 1, 1920, and at that time, the 2 service was rerouted from the Manhattan Bridge to the Montague Tunnel, running local from Queensboro Plaza to 86th Street. The Bay Ridge–95th Street station opened on October 31, 1925, and became the service's new southern terminus. During this time, rush-hour specials to Chambers Street were sporadically added and removed, eventually becoming an addition to the line.[5] At one time, including during 1931, additional midday service operated local between 57th Street and Whitehall Street–South Ferry. The 2 also used the Nassau Street Loop during rush hours, entering Manhattan via the Manhattan Bridge or Montague Street Tunnel and leaving via the other.
