Paramedics arrive at the scene and transport the victims to a nearby medical facility at Dillard. Just as Derek is about to drive away, he is hit by a semi-truck, and is rushed to the ER at the closest hospital. He is unable to speak as the doctors examine him, with him subconsciously telling the doctors to order a head CT. However, Shepherd is rushed into surgery. One of the surgical residents, Dr. Penelope Blake (Samantha Sloyan), who wants to perform a CT is dismissed by her attending and by the time the doctors discover his blown pupil, Shepherd realizes that he will die. He is eventually declared brain-dead after the neurosurgeon arrives too late.
