Christian marriages are based upon the teachings of Jesus and the Paul the Apostle.[214] As of  2015[update] many[quantify] Christian denominations regard marriage as a sacrament, sacred institution, or covenant,[215] but this was not always the case before the 1184 Council of Verona officially recognized marriage as a sacrament.[216][217] Before then, no specific ritual was prescribed for celebrating a marriage: "Marriage vows did not have to be exchanged in a church, nor was a priest's presence required. A couple could exchange consent anywhere, anytime."[217][218]
