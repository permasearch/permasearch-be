Polybius gave a description of the early scutum. He wrote that it was oblong and had a convex surface 2 Â½ feet wide and four feet long. It thickness at the rim was "a palm's breadth" (about four inches). It was "made of two planks glued together, the outer surface being then covered first with canvas and then with calf-skin. 4 Its upper and lower rims are strengthened by an iron edging which protects it from descending blows and from injury when rested on the ground. It also has an iron boss (umbo) fixed to it which turns aside the most formidable blows of stones, pikes, and heavy missiles in general." Polybius, The Histories, 6.23.2-4
