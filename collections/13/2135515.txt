The first inferno match took place in the mid 80's (1987) at the Juan Pachin Vicens coliseum in Ponce, Puerto Rico.[81] The first WWF Inferno Match was between Kane and The Undertaker at the 1998 Unforgiven pay-per-view. Kane had been thrown out of the ring and The Undertaker had no way of attacking him. The match ended in The Undertaker's victory.
