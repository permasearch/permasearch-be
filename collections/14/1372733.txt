In the 1980s, parent media watchdog groups such as the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) criticized MTV over certain music videos that were claimed to have explicit imagery of satanism. As a result, MTV developed a strict policy on refusal to air videos that may depict Satanism or anti-religious themes.[144] This policy led MTV to ban music videos such as "Jesus Christ Pose" by Soundgarden in 1991[145] and "Megalomaniac" by Incubus in 2004;[146] however, the controversial band Marilyn Manson was among the most popular rock bands on MTV during the late 1990s and early 2000s.
