Identical twins Shawn and Taylor Carpenter originally played Will. They were only six weeks old when they started, and they portrayed Will from babyhood until six years old (1995 to 2002).[9][38] In 2002, Days decided they wanted a trained young actor playing Will, and nine-year-old Darian Weiss was cast,[9][39] and the character was rapidly-aged[38] three years. A year later (2003), Christopher Gerse took over as Will. Gerse was able to attend regular school whilst working on Days, including playing on his school's basketball team,[40] just like his character.[citation needed] In 2005, Days were again planning to rapidly age Will, and were "actively seeking out a new actor to play the role" â€” but the plans were shelved when new storyline for the younger Will "became available", and Gerse was retained to "preserve the believability of Alison Sweeney and Bryan Dattilo as his parents".[41] Will was not aged again, and Gerse continued until 2007[9] when Will was written out (by having the character go to live with his uncle and aunt in Switzerland). In addition, for one episode in January 2008, Gerse provided Will's voice for a phonecall.[42]
