To reduce the gap between the rich and the poor, Islamic economic jurisprudence encourages trade,[129] discourages the hoarding of wealth and outlaws interest-bearing loans (usury; the term is riba in Arabic).[130][131] Therefore, wealth is taxed through Zakat, but trade is not taxed. Usury, which allows the rich to get richer without sharing in the risk, is forbidden in Islam. Profit sharing and venture capital where the lender is also exposed to risk is acceptable.[132] Hoarding of food for speculation is also discouraged.[133]
