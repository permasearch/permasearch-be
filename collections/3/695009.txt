As an adult, Calvin O'Keefe is a marine biologist, famous for his work on regeneration in starfish and other animals as well as his environmental work. He is married to Meg, and the father of seven children: Polyhymnia (better known as Poly or Polly), Charles, Alexander (initially called Sandy, later nicknamed Xan), Dennys (Den), Peggy (presumably short for Margaret), Johnny and Mary (nicknamed Rosy). Calvin is described as "a loving father but not over-protective", who "treats his children with respect." Calvin works on the remote fictional island of Gaea off the coast of Portugal for several years before moving the family to fictional Benne Seed Island off the coast of South Carolina.
