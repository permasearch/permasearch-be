In the United States, the name became progressively less used for males, dropping out of the top 1,000 names before 1950.  In the 1980s, the name reappeared, but was used for both males and females, with increasing popularity. Its popularity in the United States peaked at 2007 at 72nd most popular male name and in 2008 as the 127th most popular female name.[3] As a male name, Hayden also made a comeback in Australia in the 1980s and continues to reign in the top 100. In 2014, it came in at No. 66, up from No. 68 in 2013, but down from No. 52 in 2012 and No. 43 in 2011.[4]
