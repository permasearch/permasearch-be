The article appears accurate in it's representation of what the Naturopathic Medicine movement believes, however Naturopathy as defined by it's founder (Dr. Benedict Lust), those organizations and schools created by it's founders (American Naturopathic Association, Benedict Lust School of Naturopathy etc.) is quite different in both philosophy and principles than Naturopathic Medicine. (I have expanded on this in the Traditional Naturopathy section).
