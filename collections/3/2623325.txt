Some important aquatic and terrestrial ecological aspects of this salamander include its diet, predators, and microhabitat preferences. Larvae mainly feed on invertebrates such as insect larvae and worms.[9] Larval growth rates differ depending on the temperature of the water and tend to be higher in the warmer months when water temperature is higher.[8][10] The red salamander generally lays eggs in the fall and hatching season takes place in the late fall and winter.[10] The larval period varies between 27 and 31 months and then metamorphosis takes place in the spring and early summer of the third year.[10] Larval red salamanders are generalists, eating whatever is available.[11] Feeding rates typically increase when water temperature is low and larger individuals feed more than smaller individuals.[11] Although feeding rates appear to increase with increasing size, mortality rates, though, seem to be independent of size or age and survival is estimated to be about 50% per year.[10] The longer larval period ensures that transformation occurs when the salamanders are much larger than other species of salamanders and typically have a short juvenile period, maturing quickly.[8] Males mature at about 53–63 mm (2.1–2.5 in), typically at four years of age, and females mature at about 55–68 mm (2.2–2.7 in), typically at about five years of age.[8]
