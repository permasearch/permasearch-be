Rangel is known for his blunt speaking and candor, which are rarely meant to be taken personally.[49] This tendency has grown as he has gotten older and less bothered by what others think of him.[83] When asked how he would like to be remembered, he said, "Well, as Rhett Butler once said in Gone With the Wind, if I'm gone, quite frankly, I don't give a damn."[83] In any case, he has fairly often made controversial remarks.
