The band, specifically frontman Chester Bennington, lashed out in response to the negative reception of One More Light's material. As documented through Spin magazine, in an interview with Music Week, Bennington, at the accusations that the band had "sold out", suggested that those people should "stab [themselves] in the face" and "move the fuck on" from the band's past sound.[57][50][58] Similarly, in a separate interview with Kerrang, Bennington, in response to claims of selling out with the album, said "If youâ€™re gonna be the person who says like 'they made a marketing decision to make this kind of record to make money' you can fucking meet me outside and I will punch you in your fucking mouth."[59][58] In the same interview, Mike Shinoda also rejected the claims that they had made the album "for monetary reasons", responding; "that's not how I operate."[60] Bennington explained that the accusation of "selling out" angered him because he saw it as a personal attack, concluding that "when you make it personal, like a personal attack against who we are as people, like, dude, shut up. That means that I can actually have feelings about it and most of the time my feelings are 'I want to kill you.'"[60][61]
