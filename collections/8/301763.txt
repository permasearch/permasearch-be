But once magic is stirred up, it isnâ€™t easily contained. One by one, Frosty wins over the other kids of Evergreen, including Tommy's older brother, Charles, Tommy's love interest, Sara Simple (voiced by Tara Strong) (a sharp, independent girl who wants to be an urban planner instead of a "princess"); and the triplets, Sonny, Sully, and Simon Sklarew. Frosty befriends each of them through the simple means of believing in them, which inspires them to begin to believe in themselves.
