Doneness is a gauge of how thoroughly cooked a cut of meat is based on the colour, juiciness and internal temperature when cooked. The gradations of cooking are most often used in reference to beef (especially steak and roasts) but are also applicable to lamb, pork, poultry, veal and seafood (especially fish).
