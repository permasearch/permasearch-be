The test lasts for 57 minutes although candidates with certain special needs can apply for more time.[12] All 50 questions must be answered. The test allows 15 minutes practice time at the start of the exam to get used to answering the questions and how to use the system. To answer a question the candidate simply touches their choice of answer from the listed answers on the computer screen. If a mistake is made the candidate can deselect a choice and reselect a different option. The candidate is allowed to go back to a question at any time and can also flag questions they are unsure of in order to find and return to it quickly and easily later.[11] To pass the test, 43 of the 50 questions (86%) must be answered correctly.[6]
