Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it has an adverse effect on health.[1] Relative weight and body mass index (BMI) are nearly identical and are reasonable estimates of body fatness as measured by percentage body fat.[2] However, BMI does not account for the wide variation in body fat distribution, and may not correspond to the same degree of fatness or associated health risk in different individuals and populations.[3][4][5] Other measurements of fat distribution include the waistâ€“hip ratio and body fat percentage. Normal weight obesity is a condition of having normal body weight, but high body fat percentages with the same health risks of obesity.[6][7]
