Graphics programs can be used to both sharpen and blur images in a number of ways, such as unsharp masking or deconvolution.[3] Portraits often appear more pleasing when selectively softened (particularly the skin and the background) to better make the subject stand out.[citation needed] This can be achieved with a camera by using a large aperture, or in the image editor by making a selection and then blurring it. Edge enhancement is an extremely common technique used to make images appear sharper, although purists frown on the result as appearing unnatural.
