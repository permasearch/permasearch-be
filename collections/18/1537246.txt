Muslims practice a series of life-cycle rituals that differ from those of Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists.[92] Several rituals mark the first days of lifeâ€”including the whispering call to prayer, first bath, and shaving of the head. Religious instruction begins early. Male circumcision usually takes place after birth; in some families, it may be delayed until after the onset of puberty.[92]
