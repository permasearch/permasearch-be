Danny Bennett felt that younger audiences who were unfamiliar with his father would respond to his music if given a chance.[68] No changes to Tony's formal appearance, singing style, musical accompaniment (The Ralph Sharon Trio or an orchestra), or song choice (generally the Great American Songbook) were necessary or desirable.[12][69] Accordingly, Danny began regularly to book his father on Late Night with David Letterman, a show with a younger, "hip" audience.[68] This was subsequently followed by appearances on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, The Simpsons, Muppets Tonight, and various MTV programs.[15][17] In 1993, Bennett played a series of benefit concerts organized by alternative rock radio stations around the country.[68] The plan worked; as Tony later remembered, "I realized that young people had never heard those songs. Cole Porter, Gershwin â€“ they were like, 'Who wrote that?' To them, it was different. If you're different, you stand out."[17]
