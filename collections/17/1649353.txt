Later, it was agreed by a majority of 21–3 that Championship losses were to be incrementally decreased season by season, with clubs able to make a maximum loss of £6 million for the 2012–13 season and £5 million for 2013–14, while from the 2014–15 season clubs will be allowed to make only a £3 million loss and can expect heavy fines or a transfer embargo if losses exceed £6 million. From 2015–16, clubs can deliver a £2 million operating loss on top of accepting £3 million in investment from their owner, which combines to make a £5 million overall loss. Teams that win promotion to the Premier League having failed to adhere to the rules must pay a "Fair Play Tax" on their losses which ranges from 1% on the first £100,000 to 100% on anything over £10 million.[88]
