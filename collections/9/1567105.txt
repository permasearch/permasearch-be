Gibberellins (GAs) are plant hormones that regulate various developmental processes, including stem elongation, germination, dormancy, flowering, flower development and leaf and fruit senescence.[1] GAs are one of the longest-known classes of plant hormone. It is thought that the (albeit unconscious) selective breeding of crops strains that were deficient in GA synthesis was one of the key drivers of the "green revolution" in the 1960's,[2] a revolution that is credited to have saved over a billion lives worldwide.[3]
