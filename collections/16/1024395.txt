The MZR 2.3L DISI turbo engine found in the Mazdaspeed3 and Mazdaspeed6 has been retuned in the North American specification CX-7 to deliver torque at a lower rpm for less turbo lag off the line, at the cost of power. This was achieved thanks to a redesigned, smaller K04 turbocharger. United Kingdom specification CX-7's feature the same, larger K04 turbocharger and transmission found in the Mazdaspeed line.
