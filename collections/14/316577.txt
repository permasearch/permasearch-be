Introduced in 1995, Wags is a tall, brown, furry dog with floppy ears and a happy face.[1] He "loves to sing and dance and kids bring 'bones' that the Wiggly dancers collect from the audience".[1]  The last of the four characters to be introduced, Wags was originally played by Field. Fatt provided the original barking noises for Wags before Paul Field, general manager of The Wiggles and brother of Blue Wiggle Anthony took over. Mic Conway of The Captain Matchbox Whoopee Band fame, has provided Wags's full-spoken dialogue. [12][18]
