Unlike most legendary lawmen of the American West, Earp was relatively unknown until Stuart N. Lake published the first biography of Wyatt Earp,[245]:154â€“161 Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal in 1931,[30] two years after Earp died.[245] Lake portrayed Earp as a "Western superhero" who single-handedly cleaned up a town full of cowboy criminals.[218] In fact, Earp had been a stagecoach guard for Wells Fargo, a full-time gambler, a regular associate of prostitutes, and, occasionally, a lawman.[245]
