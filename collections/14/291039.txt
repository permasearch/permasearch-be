The review in The Observer calls the book "superbly balanced" but it remarks that despite its balance, Auletta's work does not show Google has a real understanding of the media whose operations it is disrupting. The review cites the example of a conversation between Auletta and Sergei Brin. After Brinn suggested that "people don't buy books" and "you might as well put it online", Auletta asked Brinn how does he propose book authors get funding for expenses incurred while writing their books without getting an advance from a publisher.[7][11] According to the review, Brinn did not reply to the question.[7]
