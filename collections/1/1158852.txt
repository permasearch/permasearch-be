American officials said the most likely mutually-agreed-upon choice of venue would be in Southeast Asia or Europe, especially from among the choices of Singapore, Vietnam (Communist country recognized by the US since 1995), Thailand, Switzerland (where Kim and his two siblings had some schooling),[112] or Sweden (whose embassy acts as intermediary for Americans traveling in North Korea).[113] Another possible location of the summit would be Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.[114][115]
