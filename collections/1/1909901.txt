There are currently an estimated 2,000 pig producers in Australia, producing 5 million pigs annually (Productivity Commission).  Although relatively small on the world stage (0.4% world production), the industry provides a significant positive impact on local, regional, state, and national economies through income generation and employment.  The pork industry contributes approximately $970m to Australia's GDP and the supply chain contributes $2.6billion to the GDP. The industry generates over $1.2b of household income, directly employing 6,500 full-time positions, and the supply chain employs 29,000 people.  The Australian pork industry is represented by Australian Pork Limited, a producer-run company created by legislation.
