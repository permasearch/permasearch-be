In theatre, Dalí constructed the scenery for Federico García Lorca's 1927 romantic play Mariana Pineda.[117] For Bacchanale (1939), a ballet based on and set to the music of Richard Wagner's 1845 opera Tannhäuser, Dalí provided both the set design and the libretto.[118] Bacchanale was followed by set designs for Labyrinth in 1941 and The Three-Cornered Hat in 1949.[119]
