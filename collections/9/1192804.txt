Sexual maturity is typically reached at five to ten years of age. In the Northern Hemisphere, whaling records show that males averaged 20–21 m (66–69 ft) and females 21–23 m (69–75 ft) at sexual maturity,[64] while in the Southern Hemisphere it was 22.6 and 24 m (74 and 79 ft), respectively.[65] In the Northern Hemisphere, as adults, males averaged 24 m (79 ft) and females 25 m (82 ft) with average calculated weights of 90.5 and 101.5 tonnes (100 and 112 tons), respectively.[29] Blue whales in the eastern North Pacific population were found to be on average 0.91 meters (3 ft) shorter,[66] therefore with males averaging 23.3 meters (76 ft) and 80.5 tonnes (88.5 tons) and females 24 meters (79 ft) and 90.5 tonnes (100 tons).[29] Antarctic males averaged 25 m (82 ft) and females 26.2 m (86 ft),[37][64][65] averaging 101.5 and 118 tonnes (112 and 130 tons).[29] Pygmy blue whales average 19.2 meters (63 feet) at sexual maturity, with males averaging 21 meters and females 22 meters (69 and 72 feet) when fully grown,[67] averaging 76 and 90 tonnes (83.5 and 99 tons).[29]
