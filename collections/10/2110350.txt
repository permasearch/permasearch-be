In 2011 TopTenReviews found that the 7z compression was at least 17% better than ZIP,[13] and 7-Zip's own site has since 2002 reported that while compression ratio results are very dependent upon the data used for the tests, "usually, 7-Zip compresses to 7z format 30–70% better than to zip format, and 7-Zip compresses to zip format 2–10% better than most other zip-compatible programs".[14]
