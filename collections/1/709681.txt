The robot discovers a skiing magazine and yearns to travel to Earth and experience the sport. It repairs a broken piece of landscape, issues a parking ticket for the rocket, and is annoyed by an oil leak from the craft. The robot sneaks up on Wallace and prepares to strike him, but the money Wallace inserted runs out, and it freezes. Wallace takes the robot's truncheon as a souvenir, inserts another coin, and prepares to leave with Gromit.
