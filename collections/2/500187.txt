In 1808 the State of Georgia gave 100 acres (40 hectares) of land on St. Simons to be used for an Episcopal church and its support. Called Christ Church, Frederica, the structure was finished in 1820. During the Civil War, invading Union troops commandeered the small building to stable horses and virtually destroyed it.[47] The church was restored in 1884 by lumber magnate Anson Phelps Dodge, who became the new Churchâ€™s first rector. Located at 6329 Frederica Road, just south of Fort Frederica National Monument, this historic building is home to an active Episcopal congregation.[48] The adjacent cemetery contains gravesites dating as far back as 1803.[49]
