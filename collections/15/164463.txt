Roughly half of the Israeli-Jewish population attests to keeping kosher at home.[577][578] Kosher restaurants, though rare in the 1960s, make up around 25% of the total as of 2015[update], perhaps reflecting the largely secular values of those who dine out.[576] Hotel restaurants are much more likely to serve kosher food.[576] The non-kosher retail market was traditionally sparse, but grew rapidly and considerably following the influx of immigrants from the post-Soviet states during the 1990s.[579] Together with non-kosher fish, rabbits and ostriches, pork—often called "white meat" in Israel[579]—is produced and consumed, though it is forbidden by both Judaism and Islam.[580]
