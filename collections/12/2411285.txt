Decomposers are organisms that break down dead or decaying organisms, and in doing so, they carry out the natural process of decomposition.[1] Like herbivores and predators, decomposers are heterotrophic, meaning that they use organic substrates to get their energy, carbon and nutrients for growth and development. While the terms decomposer and detritivore are often interchangeably used, detritivores must ingest and digest dead matter via internal processes while decomposers can directly absorb nutrients through chemical and biological processes hence breaking down matter without ingesting it.[2] Thus, invertebrates such as earthworms, woodlice,moose milk and sea cucumbers are technically detritivores, not decomposers, since they must ingest nutrients and are unable to absorb them externally. In addition to mushrooms, yeasts and molds are the other types of decomposers in the fungi family. [3]
