Miley tries to make Lilly's birthday perfect and has promised her that she will return from her out-of-state concert to celebrate. However, when Miley's flight is cancelled, she must find a way to keep her promise, even if it means getting help from unlikely fans of Robby Ray. One fan is obsessed and does not want to land her plane, so they jump out of the plane with parachutes. Meanwhile, Jackson is tired of hearing Lilly whine about Miley's absence, so when Rico arrives with two tickets to a basketball game, he gladly accepts but takes Lilly. In the end Lilly has a great time.
