Speculation that Sheringham would leave United increased just after the 1998–99 season got underway, when Dwight Yorke moved to Old Trafford from Aston Villa. Yorke immediately formed a prolific partnership with Cole as United went on to regain the league title on the final day of the season. Sheringham's first-team chances were relatively limited but he still managed to make enough appearances to qualify for a championship medal at the end of the season – at the age of 33 he had won his first major trophy. A week later he came off the substitutes bench to score United's opening goal in a 2–0 defeat of Newcastle United the FA Cup final to secure the double.[23] Four days after the FA Cup triumph, Sheringham scored a dramatic stoppage-time equaliser against Bayern Munich in the Champions League final, having come on as a substitute earlier in the game. With seconds of stoppage-time remaining, Ole Gunnar Solskjær scored from Sheringham's headed flick-on, and United won a treble of the Premiership, FA Cup and European Cup with Sheringham – having not won a major honour in his 15-year career on leaving Spurs – now having won every top-level trophy in the English game.[24]
