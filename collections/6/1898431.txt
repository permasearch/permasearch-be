When we are working on an article or guideline, we may have differing views on how the text should look. In some cases, the disagreement can flare up into a dispute. Even if there are very different views on what facts should be included or what language should be used, it is important to communicate about these issues with civility. Civility amongst editors is one of Wikipedia's key policies, meant to ensure respectful, decent interaction while we work on the encyclopedia.
