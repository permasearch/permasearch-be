"Lucky" achieved commercial success worldwide, peaking at number one in Austria, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland, while reaching the top ten in several European countries. In the United Kingdom, the song peaked at number five, and is Spears' tenth best-selling single in the country, having sold over 225,000 copies there. An accompanying music video was directed by Dave Meyers, and portrays Spears as herself and a melancholy movie star Lucky, who just wants to have some fun in life. Spears has performed "Lucky" in a number of live appearances and in two of her concert tours.
