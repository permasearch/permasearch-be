Though horrea were built throughout the Roman empire, some of the most studied examples are found in or around Rome, particularly at Ostia, a harbor city that served ancient Rome. The Horrea Galbae, a warehouse complex in the southern part of ancient Rome, demonstrates that these buildings could be substantial, even by modern standards. The horrea complex contained 140 rooms on the ground floor alone, covering an area of some 225,000 square feet (21,000 m²).[4] As a point of reference, less than half of U.S. warehouses today are larger than 100,000 square feet (9290 m²).[5]
