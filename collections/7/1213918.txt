Rather than building a second brewery and potentially putting the company at risk, Pearl decided to purchase an existing brewery to increase production and the distribution network.  Overall, buying out another brewery meant a larger initial investment, but the new brewery would be able to put out Pearl beer almost immediately and therefore help recoup costs more quickly.  From a short list of potentials, the M. K. Goetz Brewing Company in St. Joseph, Missouri, seemed the perfect fit for Pearl’s plans.  Goetz’s historic brewery would allow increased production levels and the ability to use the well-established distribution network to help Pearl reach untapped markets.  In addition, Pearl gained access to the Goetz line of beers, from pilsners to malt liquors.
