Large transnational companies have begun to use fair trade commodities in their products. In April 2000, Starbucks began offering fair trade coffee in all of their stores. In 2005, the company promised to purchase ten million pounds of fair trade coffee over the next 18 months. This would account for a quarter of the fair trade coffee purchases in the United States and 3% of Starbucks' total coffee purchases.[99] The company maintains that increasing its fair trade purchases would require an unprofitable reconstruction of the supply chain.[132] Fair trade activists have made gains with other companies: Sara Lee Corporation in 2002 and Procter & Gamble (the maker of Folgers) in 2003 agreed to begin selling a small amount of fair trade coffee. Nestl√©, the world's biggest coffee trader, began selling a blend of fair trade coffee in 2005.[99] In 2006, The Hershey Company acquired Dagoba, an organic and fair trade chocolate brand.
