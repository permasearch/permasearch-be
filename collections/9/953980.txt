At the ancient Egyptian cities of Taremu and Per-Bast were temples dedicated to the lion goddesses of Egypt, Sekhmet and Bast, and at Taremu there was a temple dedicated to the son of the deity Maahes the lion prince, where lions were kept and allowed to roam within the temple. The Greeks called the city Leontopolis ("City of Lions") and documented that practice. Lions were kept and bred by Assyrian kings as early as 850 BC,[170] and Alexander the Great was said to have been presented with tame lions by the Malhi of northern India.[206] In Ancient Rome, lions were kept by emperors to take part in the gladiator arenas or were used for executions (see bestiarii, damnatio ad bestias, and venatio). Roman notables including Sulla, Pompey and Julius Caesar often ordered the mass slaughter of hundreds of lions at a time.[207] In India, lions were tamed by Indian princes. Marco Polo reported that Kublai Khan kept lions.[208]
