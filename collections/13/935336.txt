The hypoxia leads to an increase in minute ventilation (hence both low CO2, and subsequently bicarbonate), Hb increases through haemoconcentration and erythrogenesis. Alkylosis shifts the haemaglobin dissociation constant to the left, 2,3-DPG increases to counter this. Cardiac output increases through an increase in heart rate.[11]
