A 2017 review study of the existing literature noted that the existing studies had found that sanctuary cities - which adopt policies designed to not prosecute people solely for being an illegal immigrantÂ - either have no impact on crime or that they lower the crime rate.[28] A second 2017 study in the journal Urban Affairs Review found that sanctuary policy itself has no statistically meaningful effect on crime.[198][199][200][201][202] The findings of the study were misinterpreted by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in a July 2017 speech when he claimed that the study showed that sanctuary cities were more prone to crime than cities without sanctuary policies.[203][204] A third study in the journal Justice Quarterly found evidence that the adoption of sanctuary policies reduced the robbery rate but had no impact on the homicide rate except in cities with larger Mexican undocumented immigrant populations which had lower rates of homicide.[205]
