Haiyan's first landfall was at Guiuan in Eastern Samar, where the typhoon touched down at 4:40am.[60][61] Nearly all structures in the township suffered at least partial damage, many of which were completely flattened.[62] For several days following Haiyan's first landfall, the damage situation in the fishing town remained unclear due to lack of communication in and out of the area.[63] The damage could finally be assessed after Philippine Air Force staff arrived in Guiuan on November 10.[64] Prior to this, a local priest was able to take his motorbike from Guiuan to the towns of Cabalogan and Calbayog (also in Samar) armed with photos of the devastation, shot on his mobile phone.[65]
