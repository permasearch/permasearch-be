In the beginning some films mixed some of these new devices, more or less uneasily, with the borrowed U.S. Western devices typical for most of the 1963â€“64 Spaghetti Westerns. For example, in Sergio Corbucci's Minnesota Clay (1964) that appeared only two months after A Fistful of Dollars, you find an American style "tragic gunfighter" hero confronting two evil gangs, one Mexican and one Anglo, and (just as in A Fistful of Dollars) the leader of the latter is also the town sheriff.
