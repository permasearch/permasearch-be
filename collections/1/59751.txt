A CONCACAF bid for the 2026 World Cup is probable, with Canada, USA, and Mexico the most likely nations to bid.[39] Under FIFA rules as of 2016, the 2026 Cup cannot be in either Europe (UEFA) or Asia (AFC),[40][41] leaving an African (CAF) bid, a North American (CONCACAF) bid, a South American (CONMEBOL) bid or an Oceanian (OFC) bid as other possible options.[42] In March 2017, FIFA's president Gianni Infantino confirmed that "Europe (UEFA) and Asia (AFC) are excluded from the bidding following the selection of Russia and Qatar in 2018 and 2022 respectively."[43]
