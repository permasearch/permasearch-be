Team challenge: Bringing everybody outside, Ramsay explains that some chefs use wood planks to cook fish on, which will be their next challenge. Both teams will have three pairs of two and one lone chef cook their fish and produce over a fire pit on top of cedar wood or hickory wood. Ramsay is then joined by Chef Ben Ford (Harrison Ford's son) in the judging. During the challenge, Josh smothered the Red Team's fire causing frustration between him and the team. Both teams tie at 3â€“3, but Ramsay and Ford deem Robyn and Nick's dish the best of the chefs, giving the blue team the win.
