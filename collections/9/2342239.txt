In 2005 military brat and filmmaker Donna Musil released the first documentary ever made exclusively about military brats, Brats: Our Journey Home.[2] To date, the documentary has won six film awards.[2] Musil furthers the premise that military brats form a distinct American subculture with a commonly held sense of identity that is actually a distinct American ethnicity.[2] The documentary also draws on many studies interviews of researchers, counselors and psychologists, along with interviews of numerous former military brats.[2]
