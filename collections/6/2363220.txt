In "China", when Michael demands big ideas to stop China's growing power, Kevin comes up with the idea of an antacid you only take once a week. Michael then asks for any better ideas, and Kevin suggests an antacid you only take every six weeks, causing Stanley to sarcastically ask why not go for a full year, causing Kevin to answer that then it would be too big a pill to swallow. Kevin soon teases Oscar after it turns out Michael was right and he was wrong in a conversation about China's population. Later, Dwight asks Kevin what he would think would make the office building a better place, since he's putting together a "wish list". Kevin then wishes for a million wishes, where Dwight informs him he's not a genie, causing Kevin to tell the "building" to get lost.
