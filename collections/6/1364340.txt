The Nri people of Igbo land have a creation myth which is one of the many creation myths that exist in various parts of Igbo land. The Nri and Aguleri people are in the territory of the Umueri clan who trace their lineages back to the patriarchal king-figure Eri.[29] Eri's origins are unclear, though he has been described as a "sky being" sent by Chukwu (God).[29][30] He has been characterized as having first given societal order to the people of Anambra.[30] The historian Elizabeth Allo Isichei says "Nri and Aguleri and part of the Umueri clan, [are] a cluster of Igbo village groups which traces its origins to a sky being called Eri."[31]
