On Han tomb brick reliefs of Sichuan province, scenes of borehole drilling for mining projects are shown.[146] They show towering derricks lifting liquid brine through bamboo pipes to the surface so that the brine could be distilled in evaporation pans over the heat of furnaces and produce salt.[146] The furnaces were heated by natural gas brought by bamboo pipes, yet gas brought up from 610 m (2,000 ft) below the surface could cause an explosion if it was not properly mixed with oxygen first, so the Han-era Chinese built underground carburetor chambers and siphoned some of the gas off with exhaust pipes.[147] The drill bit for digging boreholes was operated by a team of men jumping on and off a beam while the boring tool was rotated by a draft animal, usually oxen or water buffaloes.[148] Han boreholes dug for collecting brine could reach hundreds of meters (feet) beneath the Earth's surface.[149] Mining shafts dating to the Han dynasty have been found which reach depths of hundreds of meters (feet) beneath the earth, complete with spacious underground rooms structured by timber frames along with ladders and iron tools left behind.[150]
