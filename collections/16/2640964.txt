For reasons unknown, mountain gorillas that have been studied appear to be naturally afraid of certain reptiles and insects. Infants, whose natural behavior is to chase anything that moves, will go out of their way to avoid chameleons and caterpillars. They are also afraid of water and will cross streams only if they can do so without getting wet, such as by crossing over fallen logs. The mountain gorilla's dislike of rain has been observed and noted, as well.[29]
