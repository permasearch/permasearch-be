Back in Oakdale and now a psychologist, Frannie dated Dr. Larry McDermott before eventually marrying businessman Darryl Crawford. When Darryl became the prime suspect in the murder of Carolyn Crawford, his first wife, the evidence mounted against him and Frannie became terribly frightened of her new husband. When Darryl was proven innocent, Frannie couldn't forgive herself for doubting him and gave him a divorce. Frannie then left Oakdale to help refugees in Montega.
