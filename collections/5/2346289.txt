Drummond made her television debut on an episode of Throwdown! With Bobby Flay [39] when the celebrity chef was challenged by her (in a change from the show's normal format) to a special Thanksgiving face-off.[40] Flay traveled to her Oklahoma ranch for the event. The episode aired on the Food Network on Wednesday, November 17, 2010. Drummond's home cooking beat Flay's gourmet-style spread in a tight contest.[41] Music artist and fellow Oklahoma resident Trisha Yearwood was one of the judges.
