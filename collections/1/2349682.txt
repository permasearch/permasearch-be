Melissa is first mentioned in the Pilot by Hanna Marin and her half-sister Spencer Hastings when they meet at the mall. The character makes her first official appearance in the same episode, commending Spencer for her efforts in renovating their barn. Melissa subsequently informs her sister that she alongside her fiancÃ©, Wren Kingston, will be moving into the shed. This announcement angers Spencer because their parents agreed for her to move in instead. Wren later questions his sister-in-law if she's doing okay but Spencer storms out. Kingston proceeds to divulge Melissa that her sister doesn't seem too happy with them moving to the barn, but she assures him she'll get over it. Afterwards, Melissa reappears in a flashback with her ex-boyfriend, Ian Thomas, hanging out at the Hastings residence. Former next-door neighbor Alison DiLaurentis was present in the moment as well. Ali discloses to Melissa that her sister has something to declare, which Spencer abruptly disregards. Melissa and Ian proceed to leave.
