Racial integration was achieved in 1961,[25] with the admission of Hamilton E. Holmes and Charlayne Hunter after notable tension with the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Holmes graduated Phi Beta Kappa and was the first African-American student to attend the Emory University School of Medicine, where he earned his M.D. in 1967, later becoming a professor of orthopedics and associate dean at the school. Hunter (later, Hunter-Gault) graduated with a degree in journalism, and had an outstanding career earning several awards including two Emmys and a Peabody for excellence in broadcast journalism.
