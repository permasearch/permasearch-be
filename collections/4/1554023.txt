Guy Hecker, the only pitcher to have accomplished the feat, also broke the single-game major league record for runs scored with seven.[13] Cal McVey is the sole player to collect six hits in each of two consecutive games.[14][15]  Seven players hit for the cycle during their six-hit game.[16] Zaza Harvey has the fewest career hits among players who have six hits in one game with 86, while Ty Cobb – with 4,189[A] – had more hits than any other player in this group and amassed the second most in major league history.  Cobb, Cal Ripken Jr., and Paul Waner are also members of the 3,000 hit club.[21]
