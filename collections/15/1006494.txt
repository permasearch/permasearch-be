The movement of Alaskan and northern water currents southward down the west coast results in much cooler ocean temperatures than at comparable latitudes on the east coast of the United States, where waters currents come from the Caribbean and tropical Atlantic. The cooler ocean current along the on the west coast also makes summer temperatures cooler on the west coast compared to the east coast. For example, Half Moon Bay at 37 degrees latitude has no month with an average high above 67 °F (19 °C) and San Francisco often stays below 70 °F (21 °C) in summer, while Virginia Beach, VA close to the same latitude has six months when high temperatures are above 70 °F (21 °C).
