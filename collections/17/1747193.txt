The district of Faisalabad is part of the alluvial plains between the Himalayan foothills and the central core of the Indian subcontinent.[57] The alluvial deposits are typically over a thousand feet thick.[58] The interfluves are believed to have been formed during the Late Pleistocene and feature river terraces.[59] These were later identified as old and young floodplains of the Ravi River on the Kamalia and Chenab Plains. The old floodplains consist of Holocene deposits from the Ravi and Chenab rivers.[60]
