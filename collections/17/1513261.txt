In addition to being of great practical importance, fractions are also studied by mathematicians, who check that the rules for fractions given above are consistent and reliable. Mathematicians define a fraction as an ordered pair     ( a , b )   {\displaystyle (a,b)}   of integers     a   {\displaystyle a}   and     b â‰  0 ,   {\displaystyle b\neq 0,}   for which the operations addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are defined as follows:[18]
