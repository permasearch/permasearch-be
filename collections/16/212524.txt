In 1964, Argentina won the Nations' Cup, a friendly tournament organized by the Brazilian Association to commemorate its 50th anniversary. Argentina took part of the championship with the debut of José María Minella as coach, along with the local squad and Portugal. Then called "a little World Cup", the Nations' Cup is considered "the first great title" won by Argentina.[16] The team remained unbeaten winning all the matches played, with a large 3–0 over Brazil.[17] The victory over Brazil was highly praised by the media due to the Brazilian not being defeated as hosts since the 1950 World Cup final.[18] Argentina finished the tournament with no goals received.
