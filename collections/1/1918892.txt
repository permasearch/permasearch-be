As the population continued to increase throughout the late twentieth century, the library system continued to grow.[55] The Clearwater Public Library System now includes five libraries: Clearwater Main, Countryside, North Greenwood, Beach, and East.[55] In recent years, the Clearwater Public Library System has become increasingly digital providing patrons with access to computers, online databases, and an online library catalog.[55] This was made possible by the Greater Clearwater Public Library Foundation, Inc. which formed in 1984.[55] Currently, as a part of the library's Centennial Celebration, a project is commencing to add makerspaces to the libraries. The Main library's makerspace is the "Studio's at Main" and targets creative arts making.[56]
