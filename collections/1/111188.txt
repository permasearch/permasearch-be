Japanese manufacturer Mitsubishi redesigned its 2000 Montero/Shogun/Pajero with a unibody, discarding the previous box-ladder frames, achieving both a lower center of gravity, 300% more torsional rigidity, and longer suspension stroke. Suzuki's 3rd gen Vitara equally switched to a unibody in 2005, while still offering off-road capable selectable four-wheel drive with a lockable central differential along with low ratio gears.[62]
