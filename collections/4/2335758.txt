In the 1970s, Lorraine was in love with a woman named Maddy. Lorraine worked for IBM in San Francisco. One weekend, at the office, Lorraine heard a strange sound. She heard rain and thunder, but when she looked outside it was a clear blue sky. The sound became so loud, Lorraine Screamed: she was a banshee. Maddy was about to be going out on the lake, so Lorraine suspiciously asked her about the weather. Maddy replied it was clear at the lakehouse too, so Lorraine said nothing about what she heard. The thunderstorm she'd heard in her premonition however arrived while Maddy was out on the lake, there was an accident, and Maddy died.
