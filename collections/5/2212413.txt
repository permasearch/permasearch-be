Meanwhile, Audrey walks into the Twin Peaks Savings & Loan bank and chains herself to the bank vault, in protest of the Ghostwood project and its environmental effect on the forest weasel. The elderly bank president, Dell Mibbler, fetches Audrey a glass of water, but fails to understand what Audrey is doing. Andrew and Pete arrive with the safe deposit key, intending to open the box left by Thomas Eckhart. Andrew asks Dell for help in identifying the correct box in the bank vault, which he does, albeit very slowly. As Dell ambles away, Andrew opens the box to reveal a bomb, along with a note: "Got you, Andrew! Love, Thomas." The bomb explodes, blowing out the bank windows. Dell's glasses and some dollar bills fall on a nearby pine tree.
