Meanwhile, Cory and Shawn go through Rachel's underwear, and when Rachel gets mad at them, Topanga and Angela say that they are just being cute. To teach them a lesson, Rachel wears nothing but her lingerie, which angers Topanga and Angela once Cory and Shawn begin to care more about Rachel's sexy body than about them.
