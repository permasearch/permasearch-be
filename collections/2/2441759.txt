A week later, all of the participants were asked whether of not there had been any broken glass in the video. A statistically significant number of participants in group B answered that they remembered seeing broken glass in the video (p < -.05). However, there was not any broken glass in the video. The difference between this group and the others was that they were primed with the word “smashed” in the questionnaire, one week prior to answering the question. By changing one word in the questionnaire, their memories were re-encoded with new details.[24]
