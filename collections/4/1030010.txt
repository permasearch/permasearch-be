Research on magnetic doping has shown that considerable alteration of certain properties such as specific heat may be affected by small concentrations of an impurity; for example, dopant impurities in semiconducting ferromagnetic alloys can generate different properties as first predicted by White, Hogan, Suhl and Nakamura.[27][28] The inclusion of dopant elements to impart dilute magnetism is of growing significance in the field of Magnetic semiconductors. The presence of disperse ferromagnetic species is key to the functionality of emerging Spintronics, a class of systems that utilise electron spin in addition to charge. Using Density functional theory(DFT) the temperature dependent magnetic behaviour of dopants within a given lattice can be modeled to identify candidate semiconductor systems.[29]
