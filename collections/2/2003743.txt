On Sunday, October 1, 2017, Morgan was one of a group of fellow athletes visiting Epcot in Orlando, Florida, who were described in an incident filed by police as being "impaired and verbally aggressive....toward staff and around guests". The group, including Morgan, were removed from the park for "trespass" and no charges were filed. According to a deputy, Morgan was "yelling, screaming and....appeared to be highly impaired". The athlete later posted an apology in a Tweet which read, in part, "I will learn from this and make sure it does not happen again".[193]
