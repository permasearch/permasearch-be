Oliver "Ollie" Jones: Junie B.'s baby brother. He is born in the book Junie B. Jones and a Little Monkey Business. He is said to be ten months old in the month of October, so he is probably born in December. Junie B. often dislikes her brother, and they have somewhat of a sibling rivalry, stating that the family didn't actually need a baby but no one consulted her about it. However, she does show that she cares for him sometimes, like in Junie B., First Grader: Toothless Wonder where Junie B. concludes that Ollie's first tooth was the baby tooth Junie B. lost, and she smiles at him. Ollie's first word was "moo" which was revealed in Junie B., First Grader: BOO...and I MEAN It! which was the reason he was dressed up in a cow suit. In Junie B. Jones and That Meanie Jim's Birthday he is shown to have a hard time getting to sleep.
