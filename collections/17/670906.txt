Similarly, one party may be afforded alternative dispute resolution options.  For example, a loan agreement may provide that if the borrower wishes to bring proceedings against the lender, that can only be done by way of arbitration.  But if the lender wishes to make a claim against the borrower they may do so by way of arbitration or by proceedings in a certain court.  These are various called "option clauses", "asymmetric clauses" or "hybrid clauses".[8]
