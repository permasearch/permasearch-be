While any of the industry's data center resiliency systems were proposed at a time when availability was expressed as a theory, and a certain number of 'Nines' on the right side of the decimal point, it has generally been agreed that this approach was somewhat deceptive or too simplistic, so vendors today usually discuss availability in details that they can actually affect, and in much more specific terms.  Hence, the leveling systems available today no longer define their results in percentages of uptime.
