The structures are relatively small and made of mud bricks. Vernacular architecture of the Christian period is scarce. Architecture of Soba (city) is the only one that has been excavated. The structures are of sun dried bricks, same as present day Sudan, except for an arch. During the Fatimide phase of Islam, about the 11th century Nubia converted to Islam and became arabized.
