As a common example, secondary electron and backscattered electron detectors are superimposed and a color is assigned to each of the images captured by each detector,[45][46] with an end result of a combined color image where colors are related to the density of the components. This method is known as density-dependent color SEM (DDC-SEM). Micrographs produced by DDC-SEM retain topographical information, which is better captured by the secondary electrons detector and combine it to the information about density, obtained by the backscattered electron detector.[47][48]
