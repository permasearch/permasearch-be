While the advantages of latex have made it the most popular condom material, it does have some drawbacks. Latex condoms are damaged when used with oil-based substances as lubricants, such as petroleum jelly, cooking oil, baby oil, mineral oil, skin lotions, suntan lotions, cold creams, butter or margarine.[80] Contact with oil makes latex condoms more likely to break or slip off due to loss of elasticity caused by the oils.[42] Additionally, latex allergy precludes use of latex condoms and is one of the principal reasons for the use of other materials. In May 2009 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted approval for the production of condoms composed of Vytex,[81] latex that has been treated to remove 90% of the proteins responsible for allergic reactions.[82] An allergen-free condom made of synthetic latex (polyisoprene) is also available.[83]
