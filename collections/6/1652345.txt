Quin Rose released a sequel to Heart no Kuni no Alice titled Clover no Kuni no Alice: Wonderful Wonder World on December 25, 2007 playable on a Windows PC. Prototype ported the game to the PS2 on April 15, 2010 and the PSP on March 31, 2011. It follows the first game under the assumption that Alice did not fall in love with anyone, maintaining only friendships with the major characters. She remains in Wonderland as a result and the setting moves from the Country of Heart to the Country of Clover. Clover no Kuni no Alice replaces Julius Monrey and Mary Gowland with Pierce Villiers, the representation of the Dormouse, and Gray Ringmarc, Nightmare's right-hand man who works more in the capacity of a nanny to his master. Heart and Clover were accompanied by a third game, the fan-disc Joker no Kuni no Alice: Wonderful Wonder World developed by Quin Rose and released on October 31, 2009 playable on a Windows PC. Joker no Kuni no Alice is a side-story to the first two games and reintroduces Julius Monrey and Mary Gowland.
