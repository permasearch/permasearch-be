A major issue of the recording sessions was internal strife between band members, namely between Jenkins, and lead guitarist and co-founding band-member Kevin Cadogan.[5] The two actively fought for ownership of the band; Cadogan, under the impression that the band was made as an equal partnership, was outraged to find that Jenkins had made legal changes to make Jenkins the sole owner of the band.[5] Cadogan was further frustrated by Salazar's and Hargreaves' lack of understanding and indifference to the arrangement.[5] The album was almost not made at all, as the band manager informed Cadogan that Jenkins was attempting to remove Cadogan from the band prior to even starting work on the album.[5] Cadogan did everything he could to stay in the band, including trying to push issues aside in order to just work on the album, having the band and sound engineer over to his home in order to record rough album ideas for two weeks.[5] The sessions worked, but were very difficult, and ended up being the only period where the band worked together with one another.[5] The rest of the album was recorded in solitude, with each member coming into the studio to record their parts of the album alone.[4] The recording process spread itself across multiple other studios over time, one of which being one of the studios where Fleetwood Mac's Rumours had been recorded.[6]
