UK soap operas do not incorporate recap sequences at the beginning of each episode, which would be appropriate for the fact that when an episode ends, it picks up the story during the following episode. However, in 2012, Hollyoaks began airing a recap sequence at the beginning of each episode. With the exception of Hollyoaks, soap operas in the UK also lack incidental music, although EastEnders would sometimes feature music that plays over an ending scene if it was dramatic, with an alternative EastEnders theme known as "Julia's theme".
