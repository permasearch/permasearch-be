At the 2010 Sundance Film Festival, Alison Willmore of IFC described it as a "sad, unusual love story."[26] John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter called Catfish "jaw-dropping" and "crowd-pleasing" but said that it "will require clever marketing in order to preserve the surprises at its core."[27] Kyle Buchanan of Movieline asked if "easily the most buzzed-about documentary" at Sundance had "a truth problem", and reported that an audience member questioned whether it was a documentary at all.[7] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times referred to these questions as a "severe cross-examination" and states that "everyone in the film is exactly as the film portrays them."[28]
