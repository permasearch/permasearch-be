Concrete monoblock ties have also been produced in a wider form (e.g. 57 cm (22 in)) such that there is no ballast between the ties; this wide tie increases lateral resistance and reduces ballast pressure.[31][32][33] The system has been used in Germany[34] where wide ties have also been used in conjunction with the GETRAC A3 ballastless track systems.[35][36]
