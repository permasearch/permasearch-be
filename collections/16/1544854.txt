In March 2016, the Indio City Council passed a measure allowing up to 62,000 additional people to attend future Coachellas. As part of the vote, the attendance cap for Coachella was raised from 99,000 to 126,000. The festival capacity will gradually be increased, giving the city time to accommodate the crowds; Goldenvoice increased the venue size by 50 acres along Monroe Street, Avenue 50, Avenue 52, and Polo Road.[66] The 2016 festival was held on April 15–17 and 22–24, featuring the reuniting of original Guns N' Roses members Axl Rose, Slash and Duff McKagan, along with LCD Soundsystem's reunion and Calvin Harris as headliners. Other notable performers include Ellie Goulding, Jack U, Major Lazer, Chvrches, Robert DeLong, Ice Cube, Sia, Death Grips, Grimes, Disclosure, Sufjan Stevens and M83. Ice Cube's appearance featured a reunion of N.W.A., while Guns N' Roses' first weekend performance featured a guest appearance from Angus Young of AC/DC, who headlined the previous year; the cameo occurred the same day that Guns N' Roses' singer Axl Rose was announced as the new singer for AC/DC. Weekend two was marked by several tributes to Prince, the 2008 headliner who died just prior to the weekend's shows. The festival sold 198,000 tickets and grossed $94.2 million.[67][68]
