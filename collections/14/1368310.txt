This 2003 report has been criticized as failing to address a time-line of potential radiological hazard from the wreckage during its time in Puerto Rico since 1963 or while lying as wreckage on the bay floor since 1975. It has been criticized as missing an assessment of the potential radiological hazard from the thousands of tons of irradiated steel missing from the wreck site. The sampling has been criticized as flawed.[citation needed]
