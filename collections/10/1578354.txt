In 1955 Stella Maris College (Montevideo) in Uruguay was established. In 1972 the alumni rugby team was travelling in Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 when it crashed in the Andes, stranding survivors in freezing conditions with little food and no heat for 72 days; 16 of the 45 people on the aircraft survived.
