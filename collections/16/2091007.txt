Pasig is politically subdivided into 30 barangays.[11] Its barangays are grouped into two districts for city council representation purposes.[12] The first district encompasses the southern and western sections of the city, while the second district encompasses the northern and eastern sections. Among these barangays, 27 are located on the northern side or right bank of the Pasig River while 3 (Buting, San Joaquin and Kalawaan) are located on the river's southern side or left bank.
