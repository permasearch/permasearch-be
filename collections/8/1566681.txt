Markov chains are often described by a sequence of directed graphs, where the edges of graph n are labeled by the probabilities of going from one state at time n to the other states at time n+1,     Pr (  X  n + 1   = x âˆ£  X  n   =  x  n   )   {\displaystyle \Pr(X_{n+1}=x\mid X_{n}=x_{n})}  . The same information is represented by the transition matrix from time n to time n+1. However, Markov chains are frequently assumed to be time-homogeneous (see variations below), in which case the graph and matrix are independent of n and are thus not presented as sequences.
