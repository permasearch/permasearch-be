"People Are Crazy" centralizes on the male narrator and an old man whom he meets in a bar. In the first verse, the two of them converse, which leads to the old man saying, "God is great, beer is good / And people are crazy." They continue to converse throughout the second verse as well before parting ways. In the third verse, some time has passed, and the narrator reads the old man's obituary in the paper. He discovers that the now dead old man was a millionaire and "left his fortune to / Some guy he barely knew" (i.e., the narrator).[2] After this discovery, the narrator also declares that "people are crazy." The song is in a 4/4 time signature and a moderate tempo, in the key of F major, using a main chord pattern of F–C–Dm–B♭. Currington's vocals range from B♭3 to D5.[3]
