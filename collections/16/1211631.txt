Kievan Rus' (Old East Slavic: Рѹ́сь (Rus'), Рѹ́сьскаѧ землѧ (Rus'skaya zemlya), Ancient Greek: Ῥωσία, translit. Rhōsía, Latin: Rus(s)ia, Ruscia, Ruzzia, Rut(h)enia,[2][3] Old Norse: Garðaríki) was a loose federation[4] of East Slavic tribes in Europe from the late 9th to the mid-13th century,[5] under the reign of the Rurik dynasty. The modern peoples of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia all claim Kievan Rus' as their cultural ancestors,[6] with Belarus and Russia deriving their names from it.
