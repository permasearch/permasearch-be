He first appeared in "The Princess and the Po" where Po, Master Tigress, and Master Mantis had to bring Princess Mei Li to him in order to achieve peace between the Qidan Clan and Princess Mei Li's kingdom. Once a princess is given to Temutai, she ends up becoming his servant. When Po didn't want Temutai to get Princess Mei Li, he offered to challenge him to a fight to determine the fate of Princess Mei Li. When none of Po's moves can faze Temutai, Po gets an idea from Princess Mei Li and uses the same moves that she used on him to take down Temutai. Temutai admitted defeat and ensured peace between Mei Li's people and the Qidan. As a last act, he had rice balls prepared for Po and the others when they left as per their request.
