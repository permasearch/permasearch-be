In the second week of the season, the Spartans hosted another MAC opponent, the previous year's MAC champion, Western Michigan. The Michigan State defense would hold steady on the opening drive by the Broncos, with Josiah Scott recording his first career interception. The Spartan offense was able to drive into WMU territory following the interception, but was unable to score. Several possessions later, Brian Lewerke finally opened the scoring in the first quarter on a read option play, scoring on a 61-yard run, giving Michigan State a 7–0 lead. Michigan State would add another score late in the second quarter on a 15-yard pass from Lewerke to LJ Scott. As a result, MSU led 14–0 at halftime. For the second week in a row, an opponent scored on a fumble recovery when true-freshman receiver Hunter Rison had the ball stripped by WMU cornerback Darius Phillips and returned it 67 yards for a touchdown, to pull the Broncos within 14–7. The Spartan offense immediately answered the score, taking less than three minutes on their following drive to score, which included a Darrell Stewart run of 41 yards to the WMU one-yard line. Lewerke would punch it in from one-yard out, restoring MSU's two touchdown lead, 21–7. The Spartans increased the lead in the fourth quarter when LJ Scott broke a 44-yard run on fourth and one from the Spartan 45-yard line. Scott would eventually score on a two-yard touchdown run, giving MSU a 28–7 lead. However, Darius Phillips answered the Spartan touchdown on the ensuing kickoff with a 100-yard return for touchdown, making it 28–14. The Bronco offense would finally put a drive together late in the fourth quarter, driving all the way to the MSU 15-yard line before failing to convert on fourth and one. The Spartan offense would then run out the clock to secure the 28–14 victory.[11] The win moved the Spartans to 2–0 on the season with a bye week to follow.
