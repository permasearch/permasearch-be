During the 2010â€“11 season, the Oilers introduced the Oilers Octane, the first cheerleading squad for a Canadian NHL team. The Oilers Octane consisted of 19 women aged 18 to 29, most of whom were from the greater Edmonton area (within neighbouring suburbs), or the province of Alberta.[151] In addition to performing cheers at Oilers home games, helping with promotions and interacting with fans, the Octane members participated in charity fund raising and special events.[152]
