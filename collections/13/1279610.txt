Many wind power companies work with local communities to reduce environmental and other concerns associated with particular wind farms.[220][221][222] In other cases there is direct community ownership of wind farm projects. Appropriate government consultation, planning and approval procedures also help to minimize environmental risks.[197][223][224] Some may still object to wind farms[225] but, according to The Australia Institute, their concerns should be weighed against the need to address the threats posed by climate change and the opinions of the broader community.[226]
