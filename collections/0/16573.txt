In 1266, the island became part of Scotland under the Treaty of Perth, after being ruled by Norway. After a period of alternating rule by the kings of Scotland and England, the island came under the feudal lordship of the English Crown in 1399. The lordship revested into the British Crown in 1765, but the island never became part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain or its successor the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: it retained its status as an internally self-governing Crown dependency.
