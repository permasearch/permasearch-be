Although Kevin gets his money back, by the time he makes his next appearance in "Mr. Monk and the Game Show," he has lost it all to a number of serious misfortunes, including: bad investments, gold diggers, two wives, and a dishonest accountant. A CPA, he has two sisters and could recall all eight times he ate egg salad sandwiches. Kevin works in a coffee shop in Aspen, Colorado and in "Mr. Monk and the Game Show", he accompanied Monk when Adrian's father-in-law, Dwight Ellison, asks Monk to investigate a cheating problem on his game show Treasure Chest, which Dwight produces. Dwight is shown to suspect that TV host Roddy Lankman is feeding champion Val Birch the answers. According to Kevin, a pencil with Roddy's chew marks on it is a "collectible." The pencil proves handy, for when Monk and Kevin visit Val Birch's house, they find a pencil with identical chew marks.
