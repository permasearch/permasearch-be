In the 1980s, more subtle but no less important roles of gap junction communication have been investigated. It was discovered that gap junction communication could be disrupted by adding anti-connexin antibodies into embryonic cells.[50][51] Embryos with areas of blocked gap junctions failed to develop normally. The mechanism by which antibodies blocked the gap junctions was unclear but systematic studies were undertaken to elucidate the mechanism.[52][53] Refinement of these studies showed that gap junctions appeared to be key to development of cell polarity[54] and the left/right symmetry/asymmetry in animals.[55][56] While signaling that determines the position of body organs appears to rely on gap junctions so does the more fundamental differentiation of cells at later stages of embryonic development.[57][58][59][60][61]  Gap junctions were also found to be responsible for the transmission of signals required for drugs to have an effect[62] and conversely some drugs were shown to block gap junction channels.[63]
