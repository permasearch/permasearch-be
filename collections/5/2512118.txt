Lee's father wins £400 on horse racing and he spends it on a boat (with no workable engine), which he convinces Lee to invite Lucy and Daisy to stay with him on, tempting Lee with the offer of sharing a double bed with Lucy. Lucy is hesitant as she has a fear of water, but Lee eventually persuades her. The boat proves to be a wreck, but Lucy has an enjoyable night and appears to be overcoming her fear, whilst Frank bonds with Daisy and teaches her how to tie some knots. In the morning, the boat has floated away from shore in Eastbourne to the middle of the sea. With no way of knowing where they are and getting back to land and a diminishing food supply, they fear for their lives. Lee catches Frank deliberately destroying the boat, and the whole adventure is revealed to have been an elaborate insurance scam - Frank has insured the boat for £12,000 and deliberately let the boat float away, destroying it in the hope of escaping on a dinghy. Daisy accidentally lets the dinghy float away, leaving the four deserted on a sinking ship. Eventually, Lucy floats on the one remaining fragment whilst Lee, Frank and Daisy float alongside her, until by chance they find the dinghy and manage to get to safety.
