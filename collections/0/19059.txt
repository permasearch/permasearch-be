Killer whales were first captured live and displayed in exhibitions in the 1960s, soon becoming popular attractions at public aquariums and aquatic theme parks due to their intelligence, trainability, striking appearance, playfulness in captivity and sheer size. As of September, 2016, there are 56 orcas in captivity worldwide, 33 of which are captive-born.[1] The practice of keeping killer whales in captivity has become controversial.[2]
