There are over 109 different definitions of terrorism.[22] U.S. American political philosopher Michael Walzer in 2002 wrote: "Terrorism is the deliberate killing of innocent people, at random, to spread fear through a whole population and force the hand of its political leaders".[8] This meaning can be traced back to Sergey Nechayev, who described himself as a "terrorist".[23] Nechayev founded the Russian terrorist group "People's Retribution" (Народная расправа) in 1869.[24]
