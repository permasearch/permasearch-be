Former manager for the Yankees, Joe McCarthy came out of retirement after a feud with Yankee ownership to sign with the Red Sox as their manager in 1948.[74] Both the Yankees and the Red Sox were involved in a tight pennant race with the Cleveland Indians until the final weekend. The Red Sox eliminated the Yankees in the final series at Fenway Park, overcoming four DiMaggio hits in the final game to tie Cleveland for the pennant.[75][76] The situation forced the first-ever one-game playoff in AL history, which the Indians won 8â€“3 at Fenway Park.[77] The city of Boston missed out on a chance for its first all-Boston World Series,[77] as the Indians went on to defeat the Boston Braves in the Series, the last one the Indians have won to date.[78]
