United then played city rivals and closest contenders Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium. Wayne Rooney scored two goals in the first half hour to give United a two-goal cushion. But the match looked to have turned completely with half an hour left as Ashley Young had a goal wrongly ruled out for offside before Yaya Tour√© netted within seconds. It allowed the Blues to stage a comeback that led to Pablo Zabaleta levelling from a corner on 86 minutes. Incredibly, Van Persie, with a deflected free kick, had the final say in stoppage time to end City's unbeaten run at home that lasted almost two years and inflict their first league defeat since April 2012. In winning the match, United stretched the advantage at the summit to six points.
