TK Records staff producer Steve Alaimo listened to the demo of the song and was going to re-cut it with a full band, but then decided the song was already finished the way it was.[2] Released as a single in late 1972, the song became a major hit in the U.S. during the early part of 1973, reaching the number one spot on the R&B chart, number three on the Billboard Pop Singles[3] and eventually selling over two million copies. The song became his only hit single. It was also a hit in the UK as well, peaking at #12.[4] There was a re-release on 7" and 12" in 1979, with a live version as B-side on the 7" European release.
