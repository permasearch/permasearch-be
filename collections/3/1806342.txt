A men's freestyle javelin event was contested at the 1906 Games – the first time the javelin featured on the Olympic programme. The competition was dominated by Swedish athletes, who took the first four places.[4] Eric Lemming was a comfortable winner by a margin of over eight metres and he would go on to win the first two Olympic titles proper in 1908 and 1912.[5] A 100 metres finalist, Knut Lindberg, was the silver medallist,[6] while the third placer, Bruno Söderström, also won a pole vault medal that year.[7]
