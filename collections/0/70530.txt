Both Gold and Belle set off to search for Gideon's heart. Henry helps Emma escape from Gideon (knocking him out with a fire extinguisher) with Emma placing a protection spell to contain him temporarily. The others realize that Fiona has crafted the perfect trap: If Gideon kills Emma, Light will be destroyed. And if Emma kills Gideon, she will turn dark and Light will still be destroyed. Regina consoles Emma and encourages her to find another way like she always does. Emma attempts to hold off Gideon as Gold finds Gideon's heart. When Gold finds Gideon's heart he is tempted by a manifestation of the Darkness, which takes the form of his Enchanted Forest counterpart, Rumplestiltskin. The Dark One manifestation tells him to let Gideon kill Emma so he can finally have it all: power and love. The manifestation reminds Gold of what Fiona told him, that if Emma dies his Dark Magic will increase exponentially. After it's all over he can spend all the time he wants exploring the world with Belle and/or destroying it. Gold resists temptation and chooses to do the right thing and tries to use Gideon's heart to stop him from killing Emma. However Fiona's spell keeps him from being able to free Gideon and instead Gideon's heart stops beating and dims. The manifestation taunts Gold before disappearing and Gold heads out to Belle who consoles him for trying to do the right thing. Back at the intersection, Emma and Gideon fight with Emma acknowledging her role as the Savior to protect those she loves, protect the innocent and to spread light and hope no matter what the cost. Realizing what she must do, Emma throws down her sword and Gideon apologizes and kills her releasing an enormous blast of light magic, ending the Final Battle and causing Gideon to disappear.
