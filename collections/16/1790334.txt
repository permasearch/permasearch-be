Argentina's currency board established a fixed pegging of one-to-one parity between the peso and the U.S. dollar. It also guaranteed full convertibility of pesos into U.S. dollars.  The government hoped to establish local and international credibility in the peg and to limit the amount of local control over monetary and fiscal policy.  The currency board regime intended to stabilize the peso, encourage both foreign and local investment, and foster sustained economic growth.
