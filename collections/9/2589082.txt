The episode opens with an introductory glimpse of the aquatic town of Bikini Bottom. The audience is then introduced to SpongeBob SquarePants, an ecstatic, hyperactive, anxious and friendly young sea sponge preparing to fulfill a lifelong dream and passion by applying for a fry cook job at the underwater fast food restaurant, the Krusty Krab, to the annoyance of the restaurant's cashier and SpongeBob's irritable neighbor, Squidward Tentacles. SpongeBob then gets nervous and almost reconsiders applying for a job at the restaurant until his best friend, a starfish named Patrick Star, convinces him otherwise. Humored with SpongeBob's vulnerability, gullibility, and impenetrable enthusiasm and innocence, both Squidward and the restaurant's proprietor, Mr. Eugene Krabs, decide to manipulate SpongeBob, whom they secretly consider unqualified for the position, by sending him on an impossible errand to purchase a seemingly non-existent high-caliber spatula.[3]
