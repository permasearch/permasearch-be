Studies have shown elevated concentrations of heavy metals in surface and ground waters of the PoopÃ³ basin. These metals are naturally present in the bedrock, from which they are released through weathering processes. The mining activities in the area further contributes to the heavy metal pollution. Acid leaching from mines and mechanical processing of ore speed up the process.
