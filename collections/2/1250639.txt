The film series originally started out as straight horror with the first installment Child’s Play, which appears to have more psychological horror elements, while its successors are straightforward slasher films with elements of dark humor. As the films progressed, they became satirical and campy, until the series briefly became a horror comedy, with 1998's Bride of Chucky and 2004's Seed of Chucky. In 2012, it was confirmed that a new film would be made under the title Curse of Chucky and be released direct-to-video. Unlike Bride and Seed, Curse of Chucky is a full-fledged horror film much like the original three installments. However, it does maintain the campy humor to a small degree. Since Bride of Chucky, titles have no longer been released under the Child's Play brand name and now use Chucky and will continue to do so with future films.[2] The latest installment to the series, titled Cult of Chucky, was released on October 3, 2017.[3]
