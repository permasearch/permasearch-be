This is all compounded by a work system in which temps must file complaints about clients through the temp agencies, which, often enough, not only disqualifies them from another assignment at that firm, it disqualifies them from receiving an assignment from that temporary agency upon review.[11] Since a client firm is harder to replace than a client employee and there is no disincentive to not giving a complaining employee, an assignment; there is an incentive for agencies to find employees who are willing to go along with the conditions for client firms, as opposed to severing ties with firms that routinely violate the law.[11]
