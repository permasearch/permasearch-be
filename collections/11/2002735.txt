Suppose that there are     K   {\displaystyle K}   different possible allocations and     N   {\displaystyle N}   different agents, where     K , N < ∞   {\displaystyle K,N<\infty }   and     N ≥ 2   {\displaystyle N\geq 2}  . Suppose that each agent has a type      θ  i   ∼  F  i   [ 0 , 1 ]   {\displaystyle \theta _{i}\sim F_{i}[0,1]}   and that each agent gets payoff      v  i   (  θ  i   , k ) +  t  i     {\displaystyle v_{i}(\theta _{i},k)+t_{i}}  , where      t  i     {\displaystyle t_{i}}   is the transfer paid by the     i   {\displaystyle i}  -th agent. A map     f = ( κ ,  t  1   , . . . ,  t  N   )   {\displaystyle f=(\kappa ,t_{1},...,t_{N})}   is a social choice function if
