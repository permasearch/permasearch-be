Rice is central to Thai society.[13] Rice uses over half of the arable land and labor force in Thailand. It is one of the main foods and sources of nutrition for most Thai citizens: yearly per capita consumption in 2013 was 114.57Â kg.[14] Rice is also a major Thai export. Despite its importance to the nation, the industry is under threat. According to Setboonsarng, the top three threats are, "(i) increase in competition in the international market; (ii) growing competition with other economic activities that increases the cost of production, especially the labour cost; and (iii) degradation of ecological conditions. Rice research has to address these challenges."[13]
