It is most closely related to the Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis) and the southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii), and more distantly to the other large tunas of the genus Thunnus â€“ the bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) and the yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares).[7] For many years, the Pacific and Atlantic bluefin tuna species were considered to be the same, or subspecies, and referred to as the "northern bluefin tuna".[7] This name occasionally gives rise to some confusion, as the longtail tuna (Thunnus tonggol) can in Australia sometimes be known under the name "northern bluefin tuna".[8][9] This is also true in New Zealand and Fiji.
