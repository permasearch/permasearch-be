Eva Cassidy recorded a version of the song for the 1992 Chuck Brown/Eva Cassidy album The Other Side. After her death in 1996, it was included in her posthumously-released compilation album Songbird, released in 1998 and was released as a CD single in 2001. It was popularised by the BBC on BBC Radio 2 and on the television show Top of the Pops 2; the latter featured a video recording of Cassidy performing it. This publicity helped push sales of the compilation album Songbird to number 1 in the UK charts. Her recording was selected by the BBC in the UK for their Songs of the Century album in the year 1999. Her performance of it at Blues Alley was published for the first time in January 2011 on her Simply Eva album.
