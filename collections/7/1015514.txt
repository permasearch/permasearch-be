The line was unused and in disrepair during the 1990s, but the riveted-steel elevated structure was structurally sound. Around this time, it became known to urban explorers and local residents for the tough, drought-tolerant wild grasses, shrubs (such as sumac) and rugged trees which had sprung up in the gravel along the abandoned railway. The line was slated for demolition under the administration of mayor Rudy Giuliani.[50][61]
