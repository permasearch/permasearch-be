In game two, eleven and six shots were taken for the Penguins and Sharks respectively in the first period, but no goals were scored. In the second period, a series of mistakes led to a Penguins goal starting first with defenceman Roman Polak of the Sharks almost giving it away to Phil Kessel, then Brenden Dillon got stripped of the puck by Carl Hagelin who gave it to Nick Bonino for a tip-in by Kessel. The Sharks were able to tie the game late in the third on a goal by Justin Braun to send the game into overtime. Early in overtime, a quick shot by Conor Sheary got past the Sharks goaltender Martin Jones to give the Penguins a 2â€“0 series lead.[6][7]
