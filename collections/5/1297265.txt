Prior to the film's release, it was announced that it includes 30 minutes of film footage shot for the band's 1965 concert at Shea Stadium. That concert was filmed by Ed Sullivan Productions and broadcast on TV as The Beatles at Shea Stadium in 1966.[6] Consisting of 11 songs, the set was originally shot on 35-mm film, but was digitally restored for the documentary to 4K resolution, in addition to remastered sound by Giles Martin, son of Beatles producer George Martin.[7]
