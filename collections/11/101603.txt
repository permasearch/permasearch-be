where      {  x  1   ,   x  2   ,  … ,   x  N   }    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle \{x_{1},\,x_{2},\,\ldots ,\,x_{N}\}}   are the observed values of the sample items and        x ¯      {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\overline {x}}}   is the mean value of these observations, while the denominator N stands for the size of the sample: this is the square root of the sample variance, which is the average of the squared deviations about the sample mean.
