In 1968 seven new models appeared: the 820, 920, 1520, 2520, 4000, 4520, WA-14, and WA-17. The WA-14 and WA-17 were articulated four-wheel-drive tractors. The 4520 was John Deere's first turbocharged tractor. The 3020 and 4020 were updated with new features, and the 5020 model had a power increase to an industry leading 141 hp. The 4000 was a high horsepower-to-weight tractor, designed to be a "runner" rather than a "lugger". The 4000 used the same engine as the popular 4020, but weighed almost 1000 lbs less. According to Deere the 4000 could, in the same amount of time, pull a 4-bottom plow fast enough to cover the same acreage as a 4020 pulling a 5-bottom plow. The John Deere 4000 was also an economy tractor, providing the same horsepower as the 4020 with fewer features and smaller rear axles.
