"The Purdue School of Electrical and Computer Engineering enriches society and advances engineering in three crucial ways: by educating electrical and computer engineering students from Indiana, the country, and the world so that they have the knowledge, ability, and skills to innovate, excel and lead in their professions; by contributing to the benefit of humanity through the discovery of fundamental knowledge, the solution of current technological problems, and the development of new applications; and finally, by sharing knowledge and expertise through meaningful engagement within and outside the Purdue community."
