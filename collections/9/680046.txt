News is the leading source of knowledge about global affairs for people around the world.[314] According to agenda-setting theory, the general public will identify as its priorities those issues which are highlighted on the news.[315] The agenda-setting model has been well-supported by research, which indicate that the public's self-reported concerns respond to changes in news coverage rather than changes in the underlying issue itself.[316] The less an issue obviously affects people's lives, the bigger an influence media agenda-setting can have on their opinion of it.[317] The agenda-setting power becomes even stronger in practice because of the correspondence in news topics promulgated by different media channels.[318]
