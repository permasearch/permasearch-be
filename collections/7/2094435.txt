In a bit of role reversal from 1978, #4 Georgia traveled to Clemson for an early season game, but Clemson's defense stood tall and caused a miserable day for Herschel Walker, including forcing him to fumble near Clemson's goal line. Fueled by a touchdown pass from Homer Jordan to Perry Tuttle, the Tigers pulled off the 13–3 upset. The loss turned out to cost Georgia a shot at back to back national championships, as Clemson finished the season unbeaten and won the national title following their 22–15 1982 Orange Bowl victory over #4 Nebraska, while Georgia finished at #6 after losing 24–20 to #8 Pittsburgh in the Sugar Bowl.
