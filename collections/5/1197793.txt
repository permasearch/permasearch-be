Except for the aye-aye and the Lac Alaotra gentle lemur, lemurs are seasonal breeders[2][46] with very short mating and birth seasons influenced by the highly seasonal availability of resources in their environment. Mating seasons usually last less than three weeks each year,[42] with the female vagina opening up only during a few hours or days of her most receptive time of estrus.[87] These narrow windows for reproduction and resource availability appear to relate to their short gestation periods, rapid maturation, and low basal metabolic rates, as well as the high energy costs of reproduction for females. This may also relate to the relatively high mortality rate among adult females and the higher proportion of adult males in some lemur populationsâ€”both unusual traits among primates. In both the aye-aye and Lac Alaotra gentle lemur, birth (parturition) occurs over a six-month period.[2]
