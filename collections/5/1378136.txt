Team challenge: The men competed against the women being judged by Ramsay. Emily's duck breast, Russell's grilled calamari steak, Vinny's poached halibut, Jillian's vegetable stuffed chicken, Boris's dish, and Sabrina's fish and salad all impressed Ramsay. Raj's seafood and vegetable pancake received positive feedback for taste, but Ramsay refused to score it a point as it barely resembled an actual pancake and also because it was dripping oil when he tilted the plate. The remaining dishes were poorly received; Nona's fried chicken was too sweet and she undercooked her asparagus, Antonia's mardi gras gumbo made Ramsay physically ill and puke twice, Curtis's lemon pepper chicken was called "shit", Rob's pistachio-crusted rack of lamb was undercooked, Gail burnt the potatoes she used for her dish, Trev's dish was deemed an "embarrassment", Lisa's meat was dry, Ramsay asked Melissa if she was "off her tiny mind" when she presented her dish, and finally Louis's lobster lost out as Ramsay couldn't get the meat out of the shell. The score was tied 3â€“3, but as a tie-breaker Ramsay deemed Antonia's dish the worst, giving the men the win.
