This idea was presented in Anthony Trollope's 1882 novel The Fixed Period, which envisaged a College where men retired at 67 and after a contemplative period of a year were 'peacefully extinguished' by chloroform. It was also endorsed in a 1905 speech by the famous physician William Osler. It was then used, slightly modified, in Isaac Asimov's novel "Pebble in the Sky", in the 1967 novel Logan's Run and adaptations of the novel as well as a 1991 episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, "Half a Life".
