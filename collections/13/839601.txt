The roughly 200 species of living ruminants include both domestic and wild species.[3] Ruminating mammals include cattle, goats, sheep, giraffes, yaks, deer, antelope, and some macropods (kangaroos).[4] It has also been suggested that notoungulates also relied on rumination, as opposed to other atlantogenates that rely on the more typical hindgut fermentation, though this is not entirely certain.[5]
