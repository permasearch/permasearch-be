The second generation (chassis model L30) was an American market-only version, again styled by Nissan's California design center under Doug Wilson through 1994 (design freeze in 1995). A new interior (by Diane Allen) brought a revised glove box and cup holders, a folding back seat (except on XE), and depowered airbags. The Japanese Domestic Markets Nissan Bluebird U14 has different front and rear ends, and slightly narrower width dimensions to comply with Japanese Government dimension regulations.
