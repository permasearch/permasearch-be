In 1933 Broken Hill, with a population of 26,925, was the third largest urban incorporated area in New South Wales.[26] Broken Hill's population peaked at around 30,000 in the early 1960s and has shrunk by one third since the heyday of the 1970s zinc boom, with the decrease attributed to migration from the closure and consolidation of mining operations.[27] The estimated urban population of Broken Hill at the 2016 census was 17,814.[1] The impact on Broken Hill's economy of the shrinking mining industry and the more efficient mining rates resulted in a higher proportion of part-time employment, higher employment participation rate by females, a general reduction in overall household incomes, and an increase in the average age of the populace as the young leave seeking work.[citation needed]
