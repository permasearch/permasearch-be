So also was Jonah among those sent (by Us).When he ran away (like a slave from captivity) to the ship (fully) laden,He (agreed to) cast lots, and he was condemned:Then the big Fish did swallow him, and he had done acts worthy of blame.Had it not been that he (repented and) glorified Allah,He would certainly have remained inside the Fish till the Day of Resurrection.But We cast him forth on the naked shore in a state of sickness,And We caused to grow, over him, a spreading plant of the gourd kind.And We sent him (on a mission) to a hundred thousand (men) or more.And they believed; so We permitted them to enjoy (their life) for a while.
