The Shield has from the beginning of their existence voiced their intentions to fight what they perceived as "injustice".[4] They were also known for their black ring attire (including protective vests) with each member having their own style,[27][28] their tendency to approach the ring through the live audience[29] and their trademark promos, which were recorded from a first-person perspective using a handheld camcorder.[30] They were a group which possessed excellent teamwork and a willingness to sacrifice themselves as an individual for the good of the team,[31][32] which achieved victories by overwhelming opponents with superior numbers after incapacitating their teammates.[33] The Shield referred to WWE as their "yard" during their speeches[34][35] and were nicknamed as "The Hounds of Justice".[27]
