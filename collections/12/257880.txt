The original single runway was 4,800 feet (1,500 m) long, oriented on a magnetic heading of 210 degrees (Runway 21) and 30 degrees (Runway 3). In 1964 the airport was rebuilt, with its present two parallel runway configuration, oriented 190 degrees and 10 degrees magnetic. The longer runway, 19R (now 20R), at 5,701 feet (1,738 m), is only 901 feet (275 m) longer than the old Runway 21 but long enough to legally accommodate jet airliners. A full instrument landing system (ILS) was also installed to serve commercial operations.
