The stress is on the second syllable; with careful enunciation "Toronto" is pronounced /toʊˈrɒntoʊ/ toh-RON-toh or /təˈrɒntoʊ/ tə-RON-toh. In conversation, locals generally pronounce it /təˈrɒnoʊ/[citation needed] tə-RON-oh, /ˈtrɒnoʊ/ TRON-oh, /ˈtrɒntoʊ/ TRON-toh, /toʊˈrɒnə/ toh-RON-ə, or /təˈrɒnə/ ( listen) tə-RON-ə, or, in its most abbreviated form, /ˈtrɒnə/ TRON-ə.[citation needed] As with other words beginning with tr, the stressed /tr/ often sounds almost like [tʃʰʷɹʷ] chr, for pronunciations such as CHRON-oh and CHRON-ə. The same speaker may pronounce "Toronto" differently depending on the subject of the conversation in which it is used.
