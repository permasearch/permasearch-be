At the beginning of season 8, after three months on the run, her mother's name is cleared and the two are reunited with Booth. In "The Shot in the Dark", it is revealed that Christine is 14 months old. Her birthday is implied to be in between late March and early April. In Season 9, although Christine made fewer appearances (with the exception of many mentions in her parents' conversations), she celebrates her 4th birthday (her current age is further confirmed in "The Money Maker on the Merry-Go-Round", in season 10).[22] In the season 9 finale Brennan is seen driving away from their house with Christine in the car seat while Booth braces himself to be attacked by Delta Force operatives as he booby-traps the entire downstairs of the house. Now a 4-year-old toddler, Christine makes a non-speaking appearance in the premiere of season 10 where Brennan finds her asleep on Booth, himself having fallen asleep reading a bedtime story to her, and tells him that Christine missed him greatly while he was in prison.
