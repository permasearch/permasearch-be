During the 2006–07 season, despite making early-season errors (most notably against Liverpool city rivals Everton in a 3–0 defeat), Reina's status as Liverpool's number-one goalkeeper was further cemented after Jerzy Dudek conceded nine goals within a week in two cup ties against Arsenal. After the 2007 Champions League semi-final first-leg against Chelsea, Reina was awarded man of the match by Liverpool supporters thanks to a string of superb saves, including two saves from midfielder Frank Lampard. He repeated his good form in the second leg, keeping a clean sheet. The match went to a penalty shootout, where Reina reinforced his penalty-saving reputation, stopping two of the three Chelsea kicks as Liverpool won 4–1. On his return home from the match, he discovered his house in Woolton had been burgled. Three weeks later in Athens, Reina became only the third player to follow in his father's footsteps by appearing in a European Cup final. However, Liverpool failed to win their sixth trophy, losing 2–1 to Milan. Reina signed a new five-year contract Liverpool on 7 June 2007.[17]
