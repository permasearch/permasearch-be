Sadly for Monaco, it was to be nothing more than a cameo from their captain as, after just 22 minutes, he limped out of the match clutching his midriff, handing the armband to Julien Rodriguez and being replaced by Dado Pršo. Undeterred, Monaco kept their momentum and Nuno Valente became the first player to be booked after a clumsy foul on Cissé. Morientes was then adjudged offside from another astute pass from Bernardi.
