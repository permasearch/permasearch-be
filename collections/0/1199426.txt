The return creases are primarily used to determine whether the bowler has bowled a No ball. To avoid a No ball, the bowler's back foot in the delivery stride must land within and not touch the return crease. This is to stop the bowler from bowling at the batsmen from an unfair angle (i.e. diagonally).[3]
