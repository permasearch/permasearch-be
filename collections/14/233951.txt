Meanwhile, in the castle, Godfrey sings how Jean cannot break his heart, since he was without one (Man Without a Heart). He and Dagger briefly talk about love before he mentions how Allen had been healed. Dagger doesn't understand how that is possible, and Godfrey postulates someone in the village is capable of magic. He sends Dagger to find out the source of the magic and to eliminate it. He also says Lady Jean will be his, and Linet is becoming a nuisance.
