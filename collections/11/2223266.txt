The ionic strength of the buffer used can affect the ligation. The kinds of cations presence can also influence the ligation reaction, for example, excess amount of Na+ can cause the DNA to become more rigid and increase the likelihood of intermolecular ligation. At high concentration of monovalent cation (>200 mM) ligation can also be almost completely inhibited.[17] The standard buffer used for ligation is designed to minimize ionic effects.[18]
