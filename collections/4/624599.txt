Over the years, Gilliam and Grisoni kept on re-writing The Man Who Killed Don Quixote as they kept on trying to make the film. The most notable change was the removal of the time travelling element present central to the original 2000 production; instead of the character of Grisoni being thrown back through time, the film would instead take place in modern times, with the "period elements" being characters having a party dressed like in the ancient times. Grisoni would be revisiting a Spanish village he had once filmed a student film in, and discover that the shoemaker he had cast in the title role all those years ago has been living as Quixote ever since.[19]
