When the building opened in 1974, it was nicknamed the 'Moroccan tower' because many renters came from the local Moroccan immigrant community.[13] In recent years some residents had become leaseholders, mostly under the Right to Buy scheme; 14 flats in the tower, and three in Grenfell Walk, were leaseholder owned at the time of the fire.[14]
