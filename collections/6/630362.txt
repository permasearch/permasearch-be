While saying her farewell to her colleagues of the last seven years, there is a possible act of terrorism in Seattle, which later turns out to be just a gas main explosion. Cristina has a quick but emotional goodbye hug with Derek, Bailey, and Webber, leaves her shares of the hospital to Alex, and dances it out with Meredith one last time to an old favorite song. Owen, however, is busy saving a patient in the O.R., so they share a silent goodbye through the gallery's glass without exchanging a word with their eyes and imperceptible nods saying everything that was left unsaid. Meredith starts fighting with Derek when she adamantly states that she's not going to Washington, D.C. because Cristina makes her realize her life is in Seattle and she is just as important in the relationship as Derek is. The new head of cardio, Dr. Maggie Pierce (Kelly McCreary) tells Dr. Webber that her birth mother is Dr. Ellis Grey, and asks if he knows her.
