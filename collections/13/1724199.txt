Akbar remained heirless until 1569 when his son, who will become known as Jahangir, was born in the village of Sikri in 1569 and Akbar began the construction of a religious compound in honor of the Chisti saint Sheikh Salim who had predicted the birth of Jahangir. After Jahangir's second birthday, he began the construction of a walled city and imperial palace probably to test his son's stamina. By constructing his capital at the khanqah of Sheikh Salim, Akbar associated himself with this popular Sufi order and brought legitimacy to his reign through this affiliation.[7]
