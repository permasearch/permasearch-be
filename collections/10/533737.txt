Along with feminist theory, the work of Michel Foucault, influenced by structuralism and post-structuralism, has had a significant impact on the study of gender in classical antiquity.[25] Foucault has been praised for looking at gender through the lens of social systems.[26] According to Lin Foxhall, his approach has "had more impact on the scholarship of gender than anything since second-wave feminism"[25] and is "virtually canonical in some quarters".[27] However, Foucault's work has been criticised for its "shallow discussion of women as historical subjects".[28]
