The stadium cost Â£750,000, and was constructed on the site of an earlier folly called Watkin's Tower. The architects were Sir John Simpson and Maxwell Ayrton[12] and the Head Engineer Sir Owen Williams. It was originally intended to demolish the stadium at the end of the Exhibition, but it was saved at the suggestion of Sir James Stevenson[citation needed], a Scot who was chairman of the organising committee for the Empire Exhibition. The ground had been used for football as early as the 1880s[13]
