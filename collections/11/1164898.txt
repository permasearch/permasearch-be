Sheldon has a deep love and interest for science fiction and comic books, to the point of an obsession, and shows particular affinity for Spock, a fictional character from the Star Trek franchise. He usually wears clothing emblazoned with logos for these interests as well as science-related designs. Sheldon refrains from any form of physical contact if possible and exhibits a strict adherence to routines to the point of exhibiting signs of obsessiveâ€“compulsive personality disorder. His disorder is confirmed by Amy in the ninth season. Any disruption to routines distresses him enormously. A running gag has him always knocking on doors in a pattern of three knocks and one call repeated three times, which he has the urge to complete no matter what.
