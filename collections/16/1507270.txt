First opened in June 1976, Ocean Bowl Skatepark in South Ocean City was the very first skate park to open on the East Coast in the United States, and is the longest running municipal skatepark in the United States today. Due to time, wear and the current needs of skaters, the original bowl and legendary steel halfpipe ramp were torn down in the Fall of 1997 and the newly constructed skatepark opened in July 1998 on the same site. The park has attracted the National Dew Tour for several years running,[55] and many pro skateboarders from around the world have skated the legendary Ocean Bowl park.
