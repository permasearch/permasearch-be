Spirit of the Jaguar[37] was opened in 2001 and is sponsored by Jaguar Cars and was designed by McCormick Architecture.[38] The exhibit is split into four sections. The two inside are modelled on a rainforest and a dry savannah, and the two outside contain rivers and pools so that the jaguars can exercise their swimming skills. A new breeding pair of Jaguar, Napo (Spotted male) and Goshi (Black female) arrived from separate French zoos in Spring 2013. Spirit of the Jaguar is also home to a colony of leaf-cutter ants, sloths, and an aquarium featuring numerous rainforest fish such as Discus fish and shoals of tetra. The exhibit went through another makeover in late 2011, and now has a theme focusing on human/wildlife conflict.[39][40] An outdoor enclosure for two-toed sloths is located just outside which is set to also house Azara's agouti in the future.
