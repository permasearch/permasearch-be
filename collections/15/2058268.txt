In 1977, both nations launched the Samjhauta Express connecting the Indian city of Attari with the Pakistani city of Lahore. Since the successful launch of the Delhi-Lahore Bus in 1999, both nations have worked to established multiple bus and train services connecting cities across the borders in the Punjab region and Sindh as well as between Indian-administered Kashmir and Pakistan-administered Kashmir across the Line of Control (LoC) – the boundary line denoting rival areas of control in the disputed region of Kashmir, which is not an official international border.[2][3] [4] India and Pakistan have no official trade relations due to ongoing tensions.
