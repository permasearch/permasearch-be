Haryana would benefit enormously by gaining water from Ravi-Beas from Punjab.[25] On 30 November 2016, the Supreme Court appointed the Union Home Secretary, Punjab's Chief Secretary and the Director General of Police as receivers for submitting a report on the present status of land and other properties on the canal site by 15 December.[22] The receivers submitted their reports as per schedule, stating in the reports that there was no fresh or deliberate damage to the canal.[26]
