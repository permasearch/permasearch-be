On 3 September 1939, Neville Chamberlain declared war, and League football was abandoned with only 3 games played.  Matches however continued to be arranged and played during the Second World War. The London clubs first played in the Wartime League and Football League War Cup, and Spurs won the Regional League South 'C' in 1940. After a reorganisation in 1941, they also competed in the Football League South. However, due to the difficult wartime conditions, Spurs along with other London clubs refused to travel long distance for the matches drawn up by the Football League, and decided to run their own competitions: London War League and London War Cup. They (11 London clubs and 5 other clubs from the south) were temporarily expelled from the Football League; after paying a fine they were readmitted but they would play in the Football League South in the way the London clubs had suggested.[69] Spurs won the regional league twice, with Arthur Turner managing the team as McWilliam had gone back to the North during the war.[70] Spurs shared White Hart Lane with rival Arsenal when Highbury was requisitioned by the government and used as an Air Raid Precautions centre.[71]
