In early 2017, TNA would go through a restructuring period that would see an ownership change, with Anthem taking 85%, Aroluxe 10% and Dixie Carter 5%.[9][9][118] On January 4, 2017, Anthem Sports & Entertainment purchased an 85% majority stake of the company, re-organizing TNA's parent company to Anthem Wrestling Exhibitions, LLC, and Carter resigned as Chairwoman after 14 years in charge, while joining the advisory board of Fight Media Group. Ed Nordholm, Anthem's Executive Vice President, then took over Anthem Wrestling Exhibitions as President.[6] Shortly after Anthem's acquisition of TNA, it was re-branded to Impact Wrestling. On January 5, Jeff Jarrett was brought back to the company by Anthem as an executive consultant.[103] Eventually, Jarrett was made the company's Executive Producer and Chief Creative Officer by Anthem. In June 2017, Anthem completed the acquisition of Jarrett's newer promotion, Global Force Wrestling, merging it with Impact Wrestling; the combined company took the GFW name. As a result of the merger, Jarrett gained a minority share in the new GFW, alongside Aroluxe and Dixie Carter.[105] In September 2017, Jarrett was suspended for behavior issues, and departed a month later. The promotion has since reverted to the Impact Wrestling name, as the acquisition of the "GFW" name from Jarrett had not actually been finalized.
