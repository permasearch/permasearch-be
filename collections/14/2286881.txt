The 1997 World Series, the 93rd edition of Major League Baseball's championship series, began on October 18 and ended on October 26 (after midnight October 27). It featured the Cleveland Indians of the American League (playing in their second World Series in three years) and the Florida Marlins of the National League (who had set a record by reaching the World Series in only their fifth season). The Marlins, who were underdogs, capped a stunning season. They defeated the Indians four games to three to win their first World Series championship, making them the first wild card team to ever win the World Series. The final of Game 7 was decided in extra innings on an Édgar Rentería single. This was also the fourth time where Game 7 of the World Series went into extra innings, and the most recent until the 2016 World Series, in which the Indians also lost in extra innings, this time to the Chicago Cubs.
