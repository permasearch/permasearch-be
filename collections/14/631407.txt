In the season four episode "The Three Faces of Phoebe", Bob offers Paige a promotion to become a full-fledged social worker for having helped a client named Carolyn Seldon (Camilla Rantsen) with getting her son back from her abusive ex-husband. In the process, Bob passed over Scott (Christian Keiber), a more experienced assistant, with the offer. Paige turns down the offer because she used magic to help Carolyn.[69] During the first episode of season five, "A Witch's Tail (Part 1)", Bob tells Paige that she has been promoted to social worker and that it means she has to arrive at work on time.[36] In "A Witch's Tail (Part 2)", Paige quits her job at South Bay Social Services and Bob tells her that she has got a real gift at helping people.[70]
