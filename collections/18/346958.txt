While originally developing iPhone prior to its unveiling in 2007, Apple's then-CEO Steve Jobs did not intend to let third-party developers build native apps for iOS, instead directing them to make web applications for the Safari web browser.[121] However, backlash from developers prompted the company to reconsider,[121] with Jobs announcing in October 2007 that Apple would have a software development kit available for developers by February 2008.[122][123] The SDK was released on March 6, 2008.[124][125]
