Brigham Young: American Moses was critically acclaimed within the Mormon community. Many considered it to be "the definitive Mormon History".[2]:400 However, it was not highly esteemed outside of Church organizations. There was a general understanding among critics that Arrington was too admiring of Brigham Young in his writing. Arrington seemingly chose to avoid including any controversial material in his work, writing in his personal diary, "I am of course finding many things about Brigham Young that would be better left unsaid."[2]:402 The biggest criticism of the biography was over Arrington's intentional exclusion of information regarding the Mountain Meadows Massacre. According to Arrington's colleague Robert Kent Fielding, "He said no, he was not going to deal with [the Massacre]. He was going to leave that for other scholars."[2]:404
