On 9 February 2015, Brendan Rodgers said that Sterling had been offered "an incredible deal" to stay at Liverpool, rumoured to be a new contract worth Â£100,000 a week, but he also stated Liverpool were "certainly not a club that is going to give way, way above what a player is worth at a certain time in their career."[50] However, on 20 March, Rodgers said Sterling's contract situation would not be resolved until the summer at least.[51]
