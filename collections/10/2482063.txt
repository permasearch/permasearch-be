Sydney DiMera is the daughter of EJ DiMera and Sami Brady. Sydney is born in secret on January 28, 2009,[23] while her mother is in witness protection, and she is switched shortly after birth with the daughter of a teenage mother, Mia, who has agreed to give her baby up for adoption to Nicole Walker. Nicole, who has miscarried her fiancÃ© E.J.'s daughter, has arranged in secret to adopt Mia's baby and pass the child off as E.J.'s, fearful that she would lose EJ without a baby.
