In September 1855, when Rockefeller was sixteen, he got his first job as an assistant bookkeeper working for a small produce commission firm called Hewitt & Tuttle.[28] He worked long hours and delighted, as he later recalled, in "all the methods and systems of the office."[29] He was particularly adept at calculating transportation costs, which served him well later in his career. Making 50 cents a day, the full salary for his first three months' work was $50 (equivalent to $1.31Â thousand[30] in 2017 dollars).[31]
