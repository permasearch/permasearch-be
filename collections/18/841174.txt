Due to a change in election law approved by Jersey City voters at the end of 2016, mayoral elections will now take place in November, with the next election scheduled for November 2017.[1] Although the mayorship has historically been a four-year term in Jersey City, and although current law prescribes the mayorship as being a four-year term in the future, due to the calendar change in elections, the current mayorship is a four-and-a-half-year term, beginning July 2013 and ending at the end of 2017. The winner of the November 2017 mayoral election will take office January 1, 2018.
