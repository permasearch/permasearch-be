The Raiders lead the series 62–51–2 as of the end of the 2016 season, including a 1–1 playoff split between the two teams.[citation needed] including the playoffs. During the AFL days in the 1960s and up to 1976, the rivalry was very lopsided, with the Raiders going 26–6–2, including 14 straight wins from 1965–71. The Broncos defeated the Raiders in the 1977 AFC championship, en route to the first Super Bowl appearance. The Raiders won 13 out of 15 meetings from 1988–94, and held a 49–20–2 series lead by 1994. However, the Broncos reversed their fortunes against the Raiders when Mike Shanahan became the Broncos' head coach in 1995. Shanahan coached the Raiders in 1988 before being fired four games into the 1989 season, and later became involved in a lengthy contract dispute with Raiders' owner Al Davis. The Broncos went 21–7 against Oakland during the 14 seasons that Shanahan coached the Broncos (1995–2008). As of 2013, the two teams have met 17 times on Monday Night Football, tied (with the Cowboys & Redskins) for the most frequent pairing in Monday Night Football history.
