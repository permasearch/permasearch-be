In February 2011, it was confirmed that the new head of the FCA would be Martin Wheatley, formerly chairman of Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission.[7][16][17][18] Wheatley's appointment, however, was not approved by the Treasury Select Committee. "The Government did not accept the case for a pre-appointment hearing with the Chief Executive, on the grounds of supposed market sensitivity." [19] In July 2015, Wheatley resigned his post at the FCA following a vote of no confidence by George Osborne.[20] In September 2015, Tracy McDermott took over from Wheatley as acting FCA chief.[21]
