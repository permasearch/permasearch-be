In 1833, Associate Justice Joseph Story of the U.S. Supreme Court published the text of the Constitution in his Commentaries on the Constitution. That publication included twelve amendments and a clear statement (in ยง 959) that there were only twelve amendments adopted. The text also included a statement (in ยง 1346) that the Titles of Nobility Amendment had not been adopted "probably from a growing sense that it is wholly unnecessary." In 1847, Associate Justice Levi Woodbury mentioned in a dissenting opinion that there "were only twelve amendments ever made to" the Constitution.[14] In Dillon v. Gloss (1921), the Supreme Court explicitly described the Titles of Nobility Amendment as not having been adopted.[15] In Coleman v. Miller (1939), the two dissenting Justices similarly described the Titles of Nobility Amendment as unadopted.[16] In Afroyim v. Rusk (1967), the majority and dissenting opinions described it as unadopted.[17]
