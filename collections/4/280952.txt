Although the XJ models had just been introduced, AMC quickly began development of its successor. To compete against its much larger rivals, the smallest U.S. automaker created a business process that is now known as "product lifecycle management" (PLM) to speed up its product development process.[13][14] By 1985, development and engineering was based on computer-aided design (CAD) software systems while new systems stored all drawings and documents in a central database.[13] The pioneering PLM was so effective that after Chrysler purchased AMC in 1987, it expanded the system throughout its own enterprise.[13]
