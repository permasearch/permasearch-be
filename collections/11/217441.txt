Principal photography began on April 25, 2011, in Albuquerque, New Mexico,[93] with the working title Group Hug.[94] In June 2011, stuntman Jeremy Fitzgerald injured his head while attempting a stunt involving a 30-foot fall from a building after getting hit by an arrow. A Marvel spokesperson later told TMZ.com that despite the injury, Fitzgerald recovered and continued working on set.[95] The following month, secondary filming took place about an hour outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the Butler area.[96] A chase sequence was also shot in Worthington, Pennsylvania at Creekside Mushroom Farms, the world's largest single-site mushroom farm, which provided 150 miles of abandoned limestone tunnels 300 feet below the ground for filming.[97]
