Graf had a win-loss record of 75-2 for a 97.4 winning percentage in 1987, both losses coming to Navratilova as they split the four matches they played during the year. On August 17, after defeating Evert in a straight set final in the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles, Graf overtook Navratilova for the world No. 1 ranking for the first time in her career, a ranking she would hold for the next 186 consecutive-weeks, a record that has not been broken (although it was tied by Serena Williams in 2016, who also held the ranking for 186 consecutive weeks). Graf was the first player other than Navratilova or Evert to hold the top spot since Tracy Austin in 1980.[24]
