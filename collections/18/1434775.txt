A barbershop; pun on the name of the actor Harry Shearer. It's frequented by Marge Simpson who's massive hairdo requires signifigant effort to maintain. In "Hungry, Hungry Homer", they refused to honor her coupon for discount hair streaks, as their thin profit margins would ruin them, but Homer (in an unusual exhibition of helpfullness) assisted the owner with finding ways of decreasing their spending, and they honored the copupon in return. The shop reappears in ""The Blue and The Gray", where it's revealed that Marge's hair has been grey for decades, but the industrial-strength coloring they use keeps wiping out her memory.
