In 1812, Mount Tambora became highly active, with its maximum eruptive intensity occurring in April 1815.[17] The magnitude was 7 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) scale, with a total tephra ejecta volume of 1.6 × 1011 cubic metres.[17] Its eruptive characteristics included central vent and explosive eruptions, pyroclastic flows, tsunamis and caldera collapse. This eruption had a long-term effect on global climate. Volcanic activity ceased on 15 July 1815.[17] Activity resumed in August 1819—a small eruption with "flames" and rumbling aftershocks, and was considered to be part of the 1815 eruption.[5] This eruption was recorded at 2 on the VEI scale.
