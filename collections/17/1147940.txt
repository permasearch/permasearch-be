After high school, with his father's help, Aldean and his band performed at Truman State University (previously Northeast Missouri State University) in Kirksville, Missouri. With Justin Weaver (one of the band's members), Aldean began writing and recording songs with Savannah-based writer, Robert Willis; he also recorded a song written by hit songwriter, Keith Follose. In 1998, he performed songs from his first album at a showcase staged by Atlanta nightclub The Buckboard. He was approached by Michael Knox, then of the Warner-Chappell song-publishing company.[4] After signing with Warner-Chappell, Aldean moved to Nashville on November 1, 1998, at age 21.
