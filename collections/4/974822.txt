Mario Bros. also introduced Mario's brother, Luigi, who was created for the multiplayer mode by doing a palette swap of Mario.[7] The two-player mode and several aspects of gameplay were inspired by Joust.[8] To date, Mario Bros. has been released for more than a dozen platforms.[9] The first movement from Mozart's Eine kleine Nachtmusik is used at the start of the game.[10] This song has been used in later video games, including Dance Dance Revolution Mario Mix[10] and Super Smash Bros. Brawl.[11]
