The forests and meadows of Bryce Canyon provide the habitat to support diverse animal life including foxes, badgers, porcupines, elk, black bears, bobcats, and woodpeckers.[14] Mule deer are the most common large mammals in the park.[14] Elk and pronghorn, which have been reintroduced nearby, sometimes venture into the park.[14]
