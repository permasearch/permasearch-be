There are other World of Coca-Cola locations beyond Atlanta as well. Club Cool, formerly Ice Station Cool, is located in Walt Disney World Epcot park. The facade was themed to resemble a polar expedition with props such as a snowmobile. Like other Coca-Cola exhibits, it included an area where guests could taste Coca-Cola beverages from around the world. In 2016, the World of Coca-Cola opened in Disney Springs, which was modeled like the Atlanta attraction.[7] It features a sampling of Coca-Cola products from around the world.[8]
