Lilly Truscott (Emily Osment) buys two tickets to see a Hannah Montana concert for her and her best friend Miley (Miley Cyrus). Because Miley secretly is Hannah Montana, she says she can't go, so Lilly goes to the concert with Oliver Oken (Miley and Lilly's friend). After sneaking into her dressing room, she finds out that Miley is Hannah Montana, so Miley shows Lilly her secret Hannah closet. However, when Lilly tries to convince Miley she should tell her secret to her school, Miley tells Lilly why it's a terrible idea, and they get into a fight, but make up soon after. Meanwhile, Jackson (Miley's older brother) tries to impress a girl by telling her he knows Hannah Montana and could get free tickets for her next show.
