Tapeworm (played by Dennis Bendersky) â€“ One of Zack and Cody's friends, Tapeworm received his nickname when he ate 20 hotdogs in 2 minutes (beating Cody's record by 18 hot dogs). His real name is unknown. He is strange and a math genius. In the episode "Band in Boston", he was the drummer for "Rock Squared". In "Hotel Hangout", Mr. Moseby and Drew repeatedly call him by the wrong name, such as ringworm and earthworm. He gets unhappy when people don't call him the right name. In total, Tapeworm made four appearances, but was not seen after Season 1.
