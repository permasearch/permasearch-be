The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs acknowledges that the Korean Wave in Japan has led to discussion and mutual cultural exchange between the two countries,[113] with high-profile fans of Korean television including former First Lady Miyuki Hatoyama and current First Lady Akie Abe.[114] However, remaining tension between Japan and Korea has led to instances of street protests involving hundreds of people, demonstrating against the popularity of Korean entertainment exports.[115] These protests were mostly organized by critics of Korean pop culture with the support of right-wing nationalists.[116]
