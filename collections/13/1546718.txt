The animals were first checked to ensure they were free from disease and unblemished (temimim or tamimim, ἀνώμους in the Septuagint, without spot in the King James Version) as required by the law.[21] Leviticus 22 identified animals "that are blind or broken or maimed, or have an ulcer or eczema or scabs" as 'blemished' - [these] you shall not offer to the Lord".[22] The animals were brought to the north side of the altar, and ritually slaughtered. The animal's blood was carefully collected by a priest and sprinkled on the outside corners of the altar. Unless the animal was a bird, its corpse was flayed, with the skin kept by the priests.
