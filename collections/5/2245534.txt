During the war and for a time afterwards, Roundhead was a term of derision[3]—in the New Model Army it was a punishable offence to call a fellow soldier a Roundhead.[4] This contrasted with the term "Cavalier" to describe supporters of the Royalist cause. Cavalier also started out as a pejorative term—the first proponents used it to compare members of the Royalist party with Spanish Caballeros who had abused Dutch Protestants during the reign of Elizabeth I—but unlike Roundhead, Cavalier was embraced by those who were the target of the epithet and used by them to describe themselves.[4]
