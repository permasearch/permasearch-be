TypeÂ 1 diabetes is a disease that involves many genes. The risk of a child developing type 1 diabetes is about 5% if the father has it, about 8% if a sibling has it, and about 3% if the mother has it.[19] If one identical twin is affected there is about a 40% chance the other will be too.[20][21] Some studies of heritability has estimated it at 80 to 86%.[22][23]
