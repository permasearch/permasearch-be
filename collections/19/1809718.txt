Service: Ramsay announced the VIP guests at the chef's tables with actor Rex Lee in the blue kitchen and director Adam Shankman in the red kitchen. Ja'Nel and Ray served additional appetizers tableside, but Ray was slow and caused his team to have to recook their appetizers. Nedra and Mary earned their jackets back through serving approving appetizers, but both teams had trouble on entrÃ©es; Despite Dan's strong performance on meat, Barret accidentally left parchment paper on fish, while Jessica repeatedly overcooked and undercooked fish and Susan constantly got her times wrong and accidentally dropped a lamb after re-firing it. Both teams successfully completed service, but Ramsay named both teams losers.
