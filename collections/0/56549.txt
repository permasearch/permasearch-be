Forensic scientists can use DNA in blood, semen, skin, saliva or hair found at a crime scene to identify a matching DNA of an individual, such as a perpetrator.[169] This process is formally termed DNA profiling, but may also be called "genetic fingerprinting". In DNA profiling, the lengths of variable sections of repetitive DNA, such as short tandem repeats and minisatellites, are compared between people. This method is usually an extremely reliable technique for identifying a matching DNA.[170] However, identification can be complicated if the scene is contaminated with DNA from several people.[171] DNA profiling was developed in 1984 by British geneticist Sir Alec Jeffreys,[172] and first used in forensic science to convict Colin Pitchfork in the 1988 Enderby murders case.[173]
