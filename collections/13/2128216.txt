Lordgenome (ロージェノム, Rōjenomu) The main antagonist of the first story arc, he is known as the "Spiral King", a cruel and ruthless tyrant who has employed the Beastmen to systemically eradicate all humankind on the planet's surface for over a thousand years. He commands his armies from Teppelin, a gigantic funnel-shaped fortress which is actually a massive gunman in hibernation. He is typically a very somber character, but can throw himself into a frenzy during a battle, displaying superhuman feats of strength, agility, and endurance, to the point where he can easily hold his own against Lagann. In the past, Lordgenome was a child with an affinity toward animals, until he found a gunman similar to Lagann and battled the Anti-Spirals when they invaded his world. He became one of the four distinguished Spiral Generals, who commanded legions of Spiral Warriors charged with ensuring peace and order throughout the Milky Way Galaxy. The battle eventually became hopeless as their numbers dwindled, and the Anti-Spirals finally appeared directly to Lordgenome, spiritually and mentally breaking him by killing everyone on board the Cathedral Terra before using Lazengann to transform Cathedral Terra into Cathedral Lazengann and wipe out his entire fleet. Soon after, the Cathedral Terra was converted by the Anti-Spirals into a defense mechanism, and Lordgenome used his Beastmen in an effort to drive the population underground and keep them to a bare minimum. He also created "Beauty Village," a village made up of girls abducted from other villages, in order to stop the birth of an Anti-Spiral scout. He had a number of children with the women of the village over the centuries, and he killed all of them after they became self-aware.
