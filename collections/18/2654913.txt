From 1997 to 2002, Nissan did not offer the Z-car line except in Japan where they sold the 300ZX (Z32) until 2000 as the Fairlady Z. In 1998, Nissan launched a program to bring back the Z-car line by first purchasing original 240Zs, then restoring them to factory specifications, and finally selling them to dealerships for $24,000. This was an effort to keep Z-car interest alive. Nissan over-estimated the market for the cars and low demand (and the high price) meant that less than fifty cars were re-manufactured and sold.  Furthermore, in 1999, a concept car was shown to the public in a plan to return to the fundamentals that made the 240Z a market success.
