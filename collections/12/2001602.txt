Shingles, also known as herpes zoster, is a viral disease characterized by a painful skin rash with blisters in a localized area.[2][6] Typically the rash occurs in a single, wide stripe either on the left or right of the body or face.[1] Two to four days before the rash occurs there may be tingling or local pain in the area.[1][7] Otherwise there are typically few symptoms.[1] The rash usually heals within two to four weeks;[2] however, some people develop ongoing nerve pain which can last for months or years, a condition called postherpetic neuralgia.[1] In those with poor immune function the rash may occur widely.[1] If the rash involves the eye, vision loss may occur.[2][8]
