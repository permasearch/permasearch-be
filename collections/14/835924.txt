Ambrose (Oliver Muirhead) is a member of Mighty Med's comic book department. He has the power to see visions of other heroes' lives, allowing him to write and illustrate incredibly fast. Ambrose agrees with Kaz and Oliver's idea to fudge some details to boost sales. He also does not seem to be paid well since he has to use a saw to sharpen his pencils.
