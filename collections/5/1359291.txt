And thus, unlike standard 14500 Li-ion batteries with their dangerously high native 3.7 V output (which can potentially destroy devices designed for the 1.5 V AA-standard), these are able to provide near perfect drop-in compatibility in almost anywhere standard AA's are used; while still retaining all of the 14500's other inherent advantages such as capacity, cycle endurance, and its more than 3.7 V input voltage/charging speed. With the only major exceptions to this being those devices that absolutely require the lower 1.2 volt output found on certain AA's, and most specifically those that are NiMH based (with most devices designed for 1.2 V working with 1.5 V just fine, albeit running slightly brighter in a flashlight or faster in an electric razor for example, and so on. This is of course due to the consistently slightly higher voltage output). [8]
