Button-Bright (real name Saladin Paracelsus de Lambertine Evagne von Smith), is a little boy who appears in The Road to Oz. He is the first American child besides Dorothy Gale to accidentally emigrate to the Land of Oz. Because his real given name is rather long, he's called "Button-Bright", because his mother says he is as bright as a button. In the sequel Oz books, he is often the main character in subplots that deal with him getting lost and being found again. Button-Bright is also a main character in the book Sky Island.
