In Australia, Commonwealth (federal) state funerals are generally offered to former governors-general, prime ministers and long-serving members of the Parliament of Australia. In rare occasions a Commonwealth state funeral is offered to people outside politics but who made a significant contribution to the nation, for example Sir Douglas Mawson was granted a Commonwealth state funeral in 1958.[34] A Commonwealth state funeral was offered for Margaret Whitlam but the Whitlam family declined.[35]
