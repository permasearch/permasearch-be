Although Wolman was in default on the mortgage and there were many liens against the property – the most recent being the $100,000+ demolition tab from Geppert Brothers – he continued to own it until 1981, when he sold it to Deliverance Evangelistic Church, a nondenominational evangelical Christian congregation.[146][147] In 1991, the church began constructing a 5,100-seat sanctuary on the site,[148] which was completed a year later, and formally dedicated on August 30, 1992.[149]
