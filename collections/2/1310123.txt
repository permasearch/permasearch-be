Governor Pedrarias sent Gil Gonz치lez D치vila to explore northward, and in 1524 Francisco Hern치ndez de C칩rdoba to settle that region (present day Nicaragua). Pedrarias was a party to the agreement authorizing the expedition by conquistadors Francisco Pizarro and Diego de Almagro that brought the European discovery and conquest of the Inca Empire (present day Peru).
