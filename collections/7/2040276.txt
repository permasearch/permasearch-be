With her dragons growing fast, Daenerys Targaryen has arrived at Astapor in Slaver's Bay and is considering buying an army of the renowned eunuch slave soldiers, the "Unsullied". She and Ser Jorah Mormont witness a brutal demonstration of their fortitude, but Daenerys is horrified to hear of the gruesome training they endure. Upon walking throughout a nearby market, a warlock masked as a young girl attempts to assassinate Daenerys with a scorpion-like creature. He is thwarted by a cloaked Ser Barristan Selmy, previous Kingsguard to Daenerys' father, who swears his allegiance to her.
