Staff Sergeant Charley Hacker runs the company mess hall and served at battle of Iwo Jima; unlike his feud with Whipple, Sergeant Carter's rivalry with Hacker is less contemptuous, and on occasion the two are able to put aside their differences. One example was in the episode "Third Finger, Left Loaf", Hacker and Carter have to search 600 loaves of bread for a wedding ring Pyle accidentally dropped into the dough (which was in Pyle's back pocket), nearly driving themselves crazy in the process. You rarely hear Hacker call Carter 'Carter'. He usually calls him by his first name Vince.
