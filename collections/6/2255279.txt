When they arrive home, Ted and Kat examine the newly developed photographs and find only one clue: that the stranger who gave them the ticket is in the background of one of the photographs, in a T-shirt with the letters "ONTLI ECUR" on it. They soon decipher that some of the letters are missing, and the writing actually says 'FRONTLINE SECURITY', a security company which is currently working at a local motorbike exhibition. Kat goes to the exhibition, and Ted soon works out where she has gone and follows her. They soon find the stranger who sold them the ticket, but he simply avoids their questions, denying any connection with Salim's disappearance.
