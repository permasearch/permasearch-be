To outdo the Los Angeles games of 1932, Adolf Hitler had built a new 100,000-seat track and field stadium, six gymnasiums, and many other smaller arenas. The games were the first to be televised, and radio broadcasts reached 41 countries.[3] Filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl was commissioned by the German Olympic Committee to film the Games for $7 million.[3] Her film, titled Olympia, pioneered many of the techniques now common in the filming of sports.
