Main cast members Victor Garber, Brandon Routh, Arthur Darvill, Caity Lotz, Franz Drameh, Amy Pemberton, and Dominic Purcell returned from the previous season as Martin Stein, Ray Palmer, Rip Hunter, Sara Lance, Jefferson Jackson, Gideon, and Mick Rory, respectively.[18][56] They were joined by Matt Letscher, Maisie Richardson-Sellers and Nick Zano, playing Eobard Thawne,[57] Amaya Jiwe,[58] and Nate Heywood, respectively.[59] Letscher reprised his role from The Flash.[57] It was originally intended for Megalyn Echikunwoke, who voices Mari McCabe / Vixen in the animated web series Vixen, to reprise her role in this series, but due to scheduling conflicts for Echikunwoke, the producers instead cast Sellers as Jiwe, McCabe's grandmother and an earlier incarnation of Vixen.[58] This incarnation was an original creation for the series.[60] Darvill was absent for most of the season due to his commitment to the ITV series Broadchurch.[61] Pemberton physically portrayed Gideon in the episode "Land of the Lost", unlike earlier episodes where she only voiced the character.[56]
