A free floating turbocharger is the simplest type of turbocharger.[36] This configuration has no wastegate and canâ€™t control its own boost levels.[36][37] They are typically designed to attain maximum boost at full throttle. Free floating turbochargers produce more horsepower because they have less backpressure, but are not driveable in performance applications without an external wastegate.[36][37]
