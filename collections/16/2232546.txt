In 1963, two Americans, Gabriel Almond[2] and Sidney Verba, outlined three types of political culture that can be combined to create civic culture.[3] These three key features expressed by both men were composed to establish a link between the public and the government. The first of these features is "deference", which considers the concepts of respect, acknowledgment of "inferiority" or "superiority", and authority in society.
