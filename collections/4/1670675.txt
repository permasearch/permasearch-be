Claims such as those initiated by early freemasons today find their way into academic discourse. Semetsky,[8] for example, explains that tarot makes it possible to mediate between humanity and the godhead, or between god/spirit/consciousness and profane human existence.

Santarcangeli[10] informs us of the wisdom of the fool and Nichols[5] speaks about the archetypal power of individuation boiling beneath the powerful surface of the tarot archetypes.
