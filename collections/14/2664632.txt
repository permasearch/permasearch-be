The Philadelphia Badlands contain a diverse mix of ethnicities. Puerto Ricans are the largest group,[4][5][6][7] but the area also contains large populations of Black Americans, Irish Americans, and Dominicans. The area encompasses El Centro de Oro, the heart of Philadelphia's Puerto Rican community.  Many drug users from surrounding upscale suburbs make the badlands their home and get stuck in the cycle of addiction which leads to homelessness.  The term "Badlands" sometimes refers to the area's high concentration of street gangs of various ethnicities, and its abundance of open-air drug dealing and heavy users of drugs, especially heroin and cocaine.[8] Although much of the area's crime stems from local neighborhood-based street gangs and the drug trade, larger, more organized gangs also operate in the area, including the Black Mafia, Latin Kings, and various motorcycle gangs.[8]
