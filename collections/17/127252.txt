Before 1776, the American Colonies were subject to taxation by the United Kingdom, and also imposed local taxes. Property taxes were imposed in the Colonies as early as 1634.[108] In 1673, the English Parliament imposed a tax on exports from the American Colonies, and with it created the first tax administration in what would become the United States.[109] Other tariffs and taxes were imposed by Parliament. Most of the colonies and many localities adopted property taxes.
