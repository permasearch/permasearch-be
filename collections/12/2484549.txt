At this time, Lahey claimed that Ricky was his biological son, explaining that this caused Ricky's mother to leave Sunnyvale and Jim and Ray to hate each other. However, in Season Eleven, after Ricky discovers the "truth" of his heritage, it is revealed that Lahey is not his father, although Lahey himself firmly believed that he was. After doing research at the hospital, Bubbles and Julian discovered that neither Lahey nor Ray are Ricky's biological father, but they continue to let him believe that Ray is his real father, as he is the man who raised him.
