Sapper (abbreviated Spr) is the Royal Engineers' equivalent of private.  This is also the case within the Indian Army Corps of Engineers, Pakistan Army Corps of Engineers Royal Canadian Engineers, Royal Australian Engineers,[4] South African Army Engineer Formation and Royal New Zealand Engineers.  The term "sapper" was introduced in 1856 when the Corps of Royal Sappers and Miners was amalgamated with the officer corps of the Royal Engineers to form the Corps of Royal Engineers.
