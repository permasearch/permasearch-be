The clay ornaments were limited to the roof of buildings, decorating the cornice, the corners and surmounting the pediment. At the corners of pediments they were called acroteria and along the sides of the building, antefixes. Early decorative elements were generally semi-circular, but later of roughly triangular shape with moulded ornament, often palmate.[44][45] Ionic cornices were often set with a row of lion's masks, with open mouths that ejected rainwater.[26][45] From the Late Classical period, acroteria were sometimes sculptured figures.See "Architectural sculpture"[46]
