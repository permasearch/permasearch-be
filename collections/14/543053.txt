Aidan Croker[17] (born December 8, 1995) arrives to the Chatsworth estate in the eighth series, and fills the void left by Liam Gallagher (Johnny Bennett). He is introduced to the series when he has been sent to live with his aunt, Patty Croker (Valerie Lilley) and godmother Libby Croker (Pauline McLynn). During his first episode, he was already shown to be a trouble-maker; beating up neighbour Jackson Powell (Emmanuel Ighodaro), and buying internet porn with Libby's credit card.[18]
