In Ethiopian Orthodoxy, fasting (tsome) lasts for 55 continuous days before Easter (Fasika), although the fast is divided into three separate periods: Tsome Hirkal, eight days commemorating an early Christian figure; Tsome Arba, 40 days of Lent; and Tsome Himamat, seven days commemorating Holy Week.[32][33][34] Fasting involves abstention from animal products (meat, dairy, and eggs), and refraining from eating or drinking before 3:00Â pm.[32] Ethiopian devotees may also abstain from sexual activity and the consumption of alcohol.[32]
