On December 19, 2011, BI-LO, another Southeastern supermarket chain, announced plans to purchase Winn-Dixie. On March 9, 2012, Winn-Dixie became a wholly owned subsidiary of Southeastern Grocers and Winn-Dixie's ticker symbol was removed from the NASDAQ.[5] Southeastern Grocers announced at the time of acquisition that the merged company would be based at Winn-Dixie's headquarters in Jacksonville.  BI-LO had previously been based in Greenville, South Carolina.  In 2015, Bi-Lo Holdings changed their name to Southeastern Grocers and remained in Jacksonville.
