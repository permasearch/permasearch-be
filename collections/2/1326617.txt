Bloodletting and cauterization were techniques widely used in ancient Islamic society by physicians, as a therapy to treat patients.  These two techniques were commonly practiced because of the wide variety of illnesses they treated. Cauterization, a procedure used to burn the skin or flesh of a wound, was performed to prevent infection and stop profuse bleeding.  To perform this procedure, physicians heated a metal rod and used it to burn the flesh or skin of a wound.  This would cause the blood from the wound to clot and eventually heal the wound.[70]
