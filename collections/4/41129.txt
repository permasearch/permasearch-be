In 2012, Gillen played CIA agent Bill Wilson[10] (referred to solely as "CIA" in the film's dialogue; the character's name is revealed in the film's novelization) in The Dark Knight Rises, his first role in a major Hollywood film.[11] Gillen said he enjoyed playing the role, but preferred low-budget lead roles to blockbuster bit-parts.[11] Gillen's character subsequently became the subject of an Internet meme popular among 4chan users known as "Baneposting", which references the dialogue between Wilson and Tom Hardy's character Bane in the film's opening plane scene.[12][13] The same year, Gillen also starred in the British spy-drama Shadow Dancer, and was announced as the new host of the music show Other Voices.[14][15]
