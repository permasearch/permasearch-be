When the north tracks of the Manhattan Bridge closed on April 13, 1986 due to construction, the D service was divided and ran in two sections, one between Norwood–205th Street in the Bronx and 34th Street–Herald Square (the Orange D) while the other ran from 57th Street–Seventh Avenue on the BMT Broadway Line, then express along the Broadway Line to Canal Street, then over the south tracks of the Manhattan Bridge into Brooklyn, and then along the Brighton Line to Stillwell Avenue (the Yellow D). At this time, D/Q skip-stop service ran in Brooklyn on weekdays.
