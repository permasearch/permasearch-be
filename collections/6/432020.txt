At the time of the Flash Crash, in May 2010, high-frequency traders were taking advantage of unintended consequences of the consolidation of the U.S. financial regulations into Regulation NMS,[3][14] designed to modernize and strengthen the United States National Market System for equity securities.[15]:641 The Reg NMS, promulgated and described by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, was intended to assure that investors received the best price executions for their orders by encouraging competition in the marketplace, created attractive new opportunities for high-frequency-traders. Activities such as spoofing, layering and front-running were banned by 2015.[citation needed] This rule was designed to give investors the best possible price when dealing in stocks, even if that price was not on the exchange that received the order.[16]:171 An HFT trader can benefit from the rule by placing a tiny order at an apparently beneficial price to other traders, but which alerts them to the existence of a large order and so they can snap up existing offers or bids to drive the price away from the large order, then filling the large order at a profit.[disputed â€“ discuss]
