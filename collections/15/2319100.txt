Greenhouses commonly supplement CO2 levels to 3â€“4 times the atmospheric rate. This increase in CO2 increases photosynthesis rates by 50%, contributing to higher yields.[45] Some greenhouses burn fossil fuels purely for this purpose, as other CO2 sources, such as those from furnaces, contain pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and ethylene which significantly damage plants.[45] This means a vertical farm requires a CO2 source, most likely from combustion. Also, necessary ventilation may allow CO2 to leak into the atmosphere.
