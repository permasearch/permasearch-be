Gregg Allman recorded "Melissa" primarily as a tribute to his brother, who adored the song; the song was written in 1967 while staying in a hotel in Pensacola, Florida and was one of the first he saved after dozens of writing attempts.[15] Allman had previously not shown it to other members of the band ("I thought it was too soft for the Allman Brothers," he said), and was saving it for a possible solo album he assumed he would one day record.[15] "One Way Out" was recorded on June 27, 1971 at the band's final concert at the Fillmore East, which was shut down after that date, and "Trouble No More" and "Mountain Jam" were culled from the band's March performances.[15] "Mountain Jam" was always intended for inclusion on the band's next album; the band teased its appearance by including the opening seconds on the fade-out of the final song on At Fillmore East.[17] The band considered it a signature song of the group, but they deemed the performance that was recorded relatively mediocre.[17]
