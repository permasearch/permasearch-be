Spanish Town has the oldest cathedral of the British colonies in the Caribbean.[17] The Spanish were forcibly evicted by the English at Ocho Rios in St. Ann. In the 1655 Invasion of Jamaica, the English, led by Sir William Penn and General Robert Venables, took over the last Spanish fort on the island.[18] The name of Montego Bay, the capital of the parish of St. James, was derived from the Spanish name manteca bahÃ­a (or Bay of Lard), alluding to the lard-making industry based on processing the numerous boars in the area.[19]
