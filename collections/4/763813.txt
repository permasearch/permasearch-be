State portal www.e-gov.az was established to facilitate citizens in benefiting from e-services provided by government agencies on a ‘single window’ principle with the combination of services. Through e-government portal citizens can use more than 140 e-services of 27 state agencies. In addition, a gateway between government agencies was established in order to ensure mutual exchange of information, and most of state agencies are connected to this infrastructure. The gateway allows to efficiently use the existing government information systems and a safe contact between them, issuing requests and rendering e-services, liberates citizens from providing same information or documents which are already available in information databases.[96]
