Young people in the church are encouraged to save money throughout their childhood and teenage years to pay for as much of their mission as they can, although many receive assistance from parents, family, or friends. Missionaries who cannot save the required funds may obtain assistance from their home congregation or from a general missionary fund operated by the church and contributed to by Latter-day Saints around the world. Married couple missionaries are expected to pay their own costs,[45] but in 2011 the church began paying for missionary couples' housing expenses that exceed US$1400 per month.[14] In many areas, church members often invite locally assigned missionaries over for meals to help reduce the overall expenditures of the missionary program.
