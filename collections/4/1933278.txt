San Antonio, like many Sun Belt cities, experienced explosive growth in its suburbs beginning in the early 1990's. This growth was particularly evident in affluent areas formed by people moving to the city. In Stone Oak and Sonterra north of Route 1604 and between the Blanco Road and US-281 corridors, this rapid growth caused severe overcrowding at nearby Winston Churchill High School. At the time Churchill was the farthest-north school in the North East Independent School District, and its student population grew to 3,400 at a school designed for not more than 2,500. The district recognized this problem, and included an allocation to build a new high school in the area as a part of its 1997 bond issue. The property for the school was purchased from descendants of rancher William Classen prior to passage of the bond issue.
