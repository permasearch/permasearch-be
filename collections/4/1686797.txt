Maya Elizabeth Bennett[2] (Zoey Deutch) is one of the ship's waitresses and helps Zack serve drinks. Zack has an obvious crush on her and she reciprocates but plays hard-to-get due to his 'hit-on-every-girl' attitude. She becomes the target of Zack's modified 6-month plan, originally designed by Cody. Zack eventually becomes friends with her due to receiving advice from Cody to be just friends first, then move on later. Maya catches on easily, as shown in My, Oh Maya, where after being on the SS Tipton for a single day, she already knows that Zack hits on every girl on the ship. In Das Boots when Woody, London, Zack and Maya become trapped in London's shoe submarine and when they are all about to die because of the lack of oxygen, Maya admits she really likes Zack too. When Cody rescues the group, Maya explains that she is not yet ready to become Zack's long-term girlfriend. In "My, Oh Maya", it is revealed that she is from New York City. In Party On! Zack throws Maya a surprise birthday party, which results in the pair sharing a kiss. It is also revealed in that episode that Maya is born sometime between March and June, and that she is a huge fan of Sean Kingston. In "Love and War", Maya has become Zack's girlfriend. She breaks up with him in Graduation On Deck because she got accepted into 'The Peace Corps' in Chad and didn't want a long distance relationship with Zack. He is very hurt by her leaving. After Maya tries to comfort him, he responds saying, "No, I am not your 'baby' anymore" and goes off. He is heart broken and almost doesn't go to graduation because of it. When his dad helps him though, Zack goes to graduation and at the end is seen hugging Maya, showing that they are friends despite the break-up.
