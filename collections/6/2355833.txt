Rendezvous Tower The 459-room Rendezvous Tower was built on the site of a smaller hotel tower for the casino. The Rendezvous Tower, whose rooms were designed by Bergman Walls Associates, opened in 2004. The tower contains 357 luxury rooms and 42 suites. Combined with the property's existing 480 rooms, Resorts total room inventory was boosted to 879 rooms after it was completed. The exterior of the tower features an Art Deco design that was part of a "return to the classics" theme which Colony Capital implemented for the property. The new tower also brought upon an expansion of the casino and several new restaurants.[25]
