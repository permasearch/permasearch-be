According to the John-Jay-Report, 80.9% of the abuse victims in the United States were male;[139] and a study by Dr. Thomas Plante found the number may be as high as 90%.[306] A number of books, such as "The Rite of Sodomy: Homosexuality and the Roman Catholic Church", have argued that homosexual priests view sex with minors as a "rite of passage" for altar boys and other pre-adult males.[307] William Donohue of the Catholic League argued that the Church's pedophile problem was really a "homosexual crisis",[308] which some have dismissed as unwarranted by arguing that there's a lack of correlation between a man identifying as homosexual and any particular likelihood he will abuse children.[221] In the United States Father Cozzens quoted figures from 23 percent to 58 percent of homosexual priests, with a higher percentage among younger priests.[309] On the other hand, research on pedophilia in general shows a majority of abusers identify themselves as heterosexual,[310][311][self-published source] and the Causes and Context Study of the John Jay Institute found no statistical support for linking homosexual identity and sexual abuse of minors.[302] Additionally The New York Times reported "the abuse decreased as more gay priests began serving the church."[312]
