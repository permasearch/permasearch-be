Tod Browning, the film's creator-director and co-producer, left his affluent family at the age of 16 to join a traveling circus; he drew on his personal experiences when devising Freaks. Because of his success as the director of Dracula, he was given considerable leeway for a major studio's first horror film; this and the fact he was working in pre-Code Hollywood enabled a unique production. In the film, the physically deformed "freaks" are inherently trusting and honorable people, while the real monsters are two of the "normal" members of the circus who conspire to murder one of the performers to obtain his large inheritance.
