For the New York Post, Johnny Oleksinski gave the film one star out of a possible four, writing that while Glover was "amusing" in his role, Ehrenreich was "given an impossible task: to make us forget about Harrison Ford, easily the most iconic action hero in modern cinema."[128] Kevin Scott from Exclaim! echoed the sentiment that Ehrenreich did not have the same "ineffable everyman" quality that Ford had, giving the film 4/10 and saying, "The villain is a generically icy figure with vague plans and hollow threats, the twists and turns are fairly predictable and the entire story is one that—unlike superior fellow Star Wars stand-alone Rogue One—has few meaningful connections to other Star Wars stories beyond the hollow reverence for what has come before."[129]
