From 1963 to 1966, the Gibb family lived at 171 Bunnerong Road, Maroubra in Sydney.[14] Just prior to his death, Robin Gibb recorded the song "Sydney", about the brothers' experience of living in that city. It was released on his posthumous album 50 St. Catherine's Drive.[15] The house was demolished in 2016.[16]
