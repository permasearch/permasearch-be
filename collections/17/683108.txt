Superintendent Harold Gorman[14] (Weston Blakesley) is a Superintendent at Ridgeway Middle School and Principal Franklin's boss, and appeared in "iHave My Principals". He has an abnormally low voice, which at first, stunned and impressed Sam. He also appears to have a strong hatred of fun, and fires Franklin simply for appearing on iCarly and playing one of their games, something he feels is below a principal. He rehires Franklin later in the episode.
