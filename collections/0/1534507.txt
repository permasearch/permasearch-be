Maxwell Roth (18??â€“1868) was the mastermind behind London's criminal underworld and one of Starrick's lieutenants. Although he wasn't a Templar himself, he trained several of Starrick's small-time gang leaders in return for a massive amount of money. After some of Starrick's lieutenants were killed, Roth proposed a partnership with Jacob's gang, betraying Starrick and helping Jacob's gangsters in freeing the city. The partnership ended shortly after due to Roth's psychopathic behavior, and after he intentionally burned the Alhambra Music Hall during his final act, Jacob stabbed him with his blade. In his final moments, Roth told Jacob that he had carried out the atrocities simply because he wanted and chose to do so.
