The company started in 1882 by watchmaker and inventor Clarence Hamilton in Plymouth, Michigan, as the Plymouth Iron Windmill Company, to manufacturer a type of vaneless windmills that Hamilton invented in 1880. By the mid-1880s the business was struggling, as transporting the heavy steel windmills by wagons throughout the southern part of Michigan, northern Indiana and Ohio was impractical. In January 1888 the company board met to consider closing the factory, but the motion to liquidate failed by one vote â€” that of general manager Lewis Cass Hough.
