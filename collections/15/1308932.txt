On 21 November 2006, the seven participants formally agreed to fund the creation of a nuclear fusion reactor.[21] The program is anticipated to last for 30 years – 10 for construction, and 20 of operation. ITER was originally expected to cost approximately €5 billion, but the rising price of raw materials and changes to the initial design have seen that amount almost triple to €13 billion.[14] The reactor is expected to take 10 years to build with completion scheduled for 2019.[22] Site preparation has begun in Cadarache, France, and procurement of large components has started.[23]
