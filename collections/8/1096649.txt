For an example of why the degree function may fail over a ring that is not a field, take the following example. Let R =      Z   /  4  Z    {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} /4\mathbb {Z} }  , the ring of integers modulo 4. This ring is not a field (and is not even an integral domain) because 2 × 2 = 4 ≡ 0 (mod 4). Therefore, let f(x) = g(x) = 2x + 1. Then, f(x)g(x) = 4x2 + 4x + 1 = 1. Thus deg(f⋅g) = 0 which is not greater than the degrees of f and g (which each had degree 1).
