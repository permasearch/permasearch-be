In France, the title of Docteur is only used generally for physicians (médecin) and dentists (chirurgiens-dentistes) but can also be used by pharmacists, along with holders of research doctorates. Medical professionals do not normally hold a doctorate, which in France is used only to refer to a research doctorate, but a "State Diploma of Doctor of Medicine" (Diplôme d'État de docteur en médecine).[121]
