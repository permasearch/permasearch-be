There are no reliable contemporary accounts of Every's flag. According to the ballad "A Copy of Verses," Henry Every's pirate flag was red with four gold chevrons.[133] Although red was a popular color for pirate flags of the time, the meaning of the four chevrons is not certain; it may be an attempt (justified or not) to link Every with the West-Country gentry clan of Every whose coats-of-arms showed varying numbers of chevrons, red on gold or vice versa.[134] However, there is no reliable evidence that Every actually flew such a flag.
