"Theme from Mission: Impossible" is the theme tune of the TV series Mission: Impossible (1966â€“1973). The theme was written and composed by Argentine composer Lalo Schifrin and has since gone on to appear in several other works of the Mission: Impossible franchise, including the 1988 TV series, the film series and the video game series. The 1960s version has since been acknowledged as one of TV's greatest theme tunes.[1]
