Coimbatore and its people have a reputation for entrepreneurship.[106][107] Though it is generally considered a traditional city, Coimbatore is diverse and cosmopolitan.[106][108][109] The World Classical Tamil Conference 2010 was held in Coimbatore.[110] The heavy industrialisation of the city has also resulted in the growth of trade unions.[111]
