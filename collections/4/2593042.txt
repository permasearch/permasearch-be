The permanent John F. Kennedy grave site opened with little announcement or fanfare on March 15, 1967. A few days before, the eternal flame had been moved from its temporary location to the new site.[57] The reburial of the bodies occurred on the evening of March 14, after Arlington National Cemetery had closed.[3] Earth over the existing grave was removed, and a small crane was used to lift the burial vault (which remained unopened) from the old grave and place it in the new one.[58][c] The event was unannounced.[57] The transfer was witnessed by Senator Robert F. Kennedy, Senator Edward M. Kennedy and Cardinal Richard Cushing of Boston.[52] Exhumation began at 6:19 PM and was complete at 9:00 PM.[52] Consecration of the new burial site occurred at 7:00 AM on March 15, 1967, in a driving rain.[3] The ceremony, which took 20 minutes, was attended by President Lyndon B. Johnson, Mrs. Kennedy, and members of the Kennedy family.[3][52] Cardinal Cushing presided over the consecration.[52] The final cost of the entire project was $2.2 million.[3]
