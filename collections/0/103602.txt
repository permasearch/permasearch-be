Canadian law requires that all persons entering Canada must carry proof of both citizenship and identity.[1] A valid U.S. passport[1] or passport card[1] is preferred, although a birth certificate, naturalization certificate, citizenship certificate, or another document proving U.S. nationality, together with a government-issued photo ID (such as a driver's license) are acceptable to establish identity and nationality.[3] However, the documents required to return to the United States can be more restrictive (for example, a birth certificate and photo ID are insufficient) â€“ see the section below on Return entry into the U.S.
