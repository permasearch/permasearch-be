As Reconstruction came to a close in the 1870s, most white reformers grew uninterested in racial equality and invested more energy into temperance.[6] This period produced various temperance organizations including the prohibitionist Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU, f. 1874) and the voluntarist Catholic Total Abstinence Union of America (CTAU, f. 1872). Prohibitionist temperance grew popular in the South as it embraced the "Southern" values of racial hierarchy, gender roles, and honor.[7] The national movement enlisted more religious support throughout the country, especially from evangelicals.
