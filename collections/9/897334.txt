Salt taxation originated in ancient China. Guanzi, a book written in around 300 BC recommends taxation of salt and propounds different methods for this purpose.[3] The recommendations of Guanzi became the official salt policy of early Chinese Emperors. At one point of time, salt taxes constituted over one half of China's revenues and contributed to the construction of the Great Wall of China.
