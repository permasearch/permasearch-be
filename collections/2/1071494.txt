Reiko placed 42nd on UGO's 2012 list of the top 50 Mortal Kombat characters, and 45th in Dorkly's 2013 online fan-voted MK character poll.[5][6] Hardcore Gaming 101 said of the character, "Reiko just likes to wear Shao Kahn's helmet a lot, and ... he has a new outfit more like Shao Kahn's and uses a hammer just like his former master does. Reiko has issues."[36] Gavin Jasper of Den of Geek rated Reiko last (73rd) in his 2015 ranking of the series' playable characters, for what he considered the wasted potential of his storyline in regards to his connection to Shao Kahn: "Reiko is like opening the biggest gift at Christmas only to see you got a pair of used socks."[7] WhatCulture ranked him fourteenth in their 2015 selection of the series' twenty worst characters. "Reiko is guilty for the crime of having zero individuality."[51]
