Subsection (a) addresses the basic principles of the YCJA and the YCJA's intentions on dealing with young offenders and youth crime. More specifically, subsection (a) sets the basic principle that the YCJA attempts to address underlying behaviour, such as pre-existing conditions or circumstances that would lead to an offending behaviour.[2] It also seeks to, above all, reintegrate young persons who commit offences into society through means of rehabilitation.[1]
