The Five Nations historically referred to themselves by a different autonym, Haudenosaunee, meaning "People of the Longhouse".[13] It is also occasionally preferred by scholars of Native American history, who consider the name "Iroquois" to be derogatory in origin as arising from colonists.[14] This name derives from two phonetically similar but etymologically distinct words in the Seneca language: Hodínöhšö:ni:h, meaning "those of the extended house," and Hodínöhsö:ni:h, meaning "house builders".[15][16][9] The name "Haudenosaunee" first appears in English in Lewis Henry Morgan (1851), where it is written as Ho-dé-no-sau-nee. The spelling "Hotinnonsionni" is also attested from later in the nineteenth century.[17][18] An alternate designation, Ganonsyoni, is occasionally encountered as well.[19] This term derives from the Mohawk kanǫhsyǫ́·ni ("the extended house"), or from a cognate expression in a related Iroquoian language, and is frequently encountered in earlier sources variously spelled "Kanosoni", "akwanoschioni", "Aquanuschioni", "Cannassoone", "Canossoone", "Ke-nunctioni", or "Konossioni".[20] More transparently, the Iroquois confederacy is also often referred to simply as the Six Nations (or, for the period before the entry of the Tuscarora in 1722, the Five Nations).[21] The word is Rotinonsionni in the Mohawk language.[22]
