The Nation of Israel is likened to the olive. Just as this fruit yields its precious oil only after being much pressed and squeezed, so Israel's destiny is one of great oppression and hardship, in order that it may thereby give forth its illuminating wisdom.[10] Poverty is the quality most befitting Israel as the chosen people (á¸¤ag. 9b). Only on account of its good works is Israel among the nations "as the lily among thorns",[11] or "as wheat among the chaff."[12][13]
