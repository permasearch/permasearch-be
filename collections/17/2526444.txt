Adrian then narrates how he came back to Spain after a business trip to Paris. However, instead of going home straight to his wife and young daughter, he went to the outskirts of town for a rendezvous with Laura. On their way home to the city, they get involved in a collision with another car. Although they are unhurt, the driver of the other car, a young bank worker named Daniel Garrido, dies at the scene. Laura rationalizes that it is not entirely their fault since Daniel was texting while driving and did not have his seat belt on. While another car passes by, Adrian and Laura pretend like nothing happens and the driver leaves. While trying to flee the scene, Adrian's car engine dies off. Laura waits for help while Adrian leaves with Daniel's car to get rid of it and the body. He drives it into a lake and disposes of it there. He then texts Laura his location and she comes to fetch him with his car, now repaired.
