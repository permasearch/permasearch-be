Ferrari's first automated gearbox in a road car (used them previously in their Formula One cars since 1989) went on sale in 1993 in the Ferrari Mondial; the Mondial Valeo retained the traditional gated shifter, but removed the clutch pedal. Four years later, a paddle-shifted transmission arrived in the 1997 Ferrari F355. The most recent version of its semi-automatic was introduced in the Ferrari 599 GTO which was capable of changing gear in 60Â ms. In the new Ferrari California & Ferrari 458 Italia, Ferrari has opted to use a double-clutch transmission.
