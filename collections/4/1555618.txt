The recognised metalloids have either pyrotechnic applications or associated properties. Boron and silicon are commonly encountered;[183] they act somewhat like metal fuels.[184] Boron is used in pyrotechnic initiator compositions (for igniting other hard-to-start compositions), and in delay compositions that burn at a constant rate.[185] Boron carbide has been identified as a possible replacement for more toxic barium or hexachloroethane mixtures in smoke munitions, signal flares and fireworks.[186] Silicon, like boron, is a component of initiator and delay mixtures.[185] Doped germanium can act as a variable speed thermite fuel.[n 20] Arsenic trisulfide As2S3 was used in old naval signal lights; in fireworks to make white stars;[188] in yellow smoke screen mixtures; and in initiator compositions.[189] Antimony trisulfide Sb2S3 is found in white-light fireworks and in flash and sound mixtures.[190] Tellurium has been used in delay mixtures and in blasting cap initiator compositions.[191]
