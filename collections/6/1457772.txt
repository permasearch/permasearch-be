In 2010, Reeves indicated that Matheson and Solomon were working on a script for a third film,[13] confirming in April 2011 that a draft was complete.[14] Winter said in March 2012 that he and Reeves both like the finished script, which revisits the two characters after the changes of the past twenty years. Despite the script being finished and satisfied by both parties, no specific filming dates have been named.[15] In April 2016, Winter said that he hoped the film would begin production in 2017.[16] Reeves gave an update on the film in February 2017 and said a story has been written for the third film. “Basically, they’re supposed to write a song to save the world and they haven’t done that. The pressure of having to save the world, their marriages are falling apart, their kids are kind of mad at them, and then someone comes from the future and tells them if they don’t write the song it’s not just the world, it’s the universe. So they have to save the universe because time is breaking apart.”[17]
