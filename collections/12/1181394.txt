Lazar's army numbered between 12,000 and 30,000.[B] According to a Yugoslav encyclopaedia (1972), there were approximately 30,000 fighters present; 12,000-15,000 were under Lazar's command, with 5,000-10,000 under Vuk Branković, a Serbian nobleman from Kosovo, and just as many under the nobleman Vlatko Vuković,[8] who had been sent by the Bosnian king Tvrtko I Kotromanić. Also present were Knights Hospitaller led by the Croatian knight John of Palisna.[12] Several thousand were knights.[13] Furthermore, there have been several anachronistic accounts that have mentioned the "Christian army" of Lazar was far greater, and that it also included contingents of other nations, although these cannot be verified.[C]
