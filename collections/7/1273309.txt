In his preface to the second volume of Tales and Stories (1863) Andersen claims to have heard the story in his childhood,[3][4] but the tale has never been a traditional one in Denmark.[5] He may as a child have heard a Swedish version, "Princess Who Lay on Seven Peas" ("Princessa' som lå' på sju ärter"), which tells of an orphan girl who establishes her identity after a sympathetic helper (a cat or a dog) informs her that an object (a bean, a pea, or a straw) had been placed under her mattress.[1]
