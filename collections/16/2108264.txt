Having visited the Canal du Midi in France and watched the construction of the Sankey Canal in England,[5] the duke's solution to these problems was to build an underground canal at Worsley, connected to a surface canal between Worsley and Salford.[6] In addition to easing overland transport difficulties and providing drainage for his mines, an underground canal would provide a reliable source of water for the surface canal, and also eliminate the need to lift the coal to the surface (an expensive and difficult proposition). The canal boats would carry 30 long tons (30 t) at a time, pulled by only one horse – more than ten times the amount of cargo per horse that was possible with a cart.[7] The duke and his estate manager John Gilbert[8] produced a plan of the canal, and in 1759 obtained an Act of Parliament, enabling its construction.[6][9][a]
