For 22 of their 28 years the St. Louis Cardinals called Busch Memorial Stadium home after it opened in 1966, after spending their first six seasons in St. Louis at Sportsman's Park; they shared both stadiums with the baseball team of the same name. However, the overall mediocrity of the Cardinals, combined with stadium issues,[1] caused game attendance to dwindle. Consequently, the Bidwills, the family that owned the Cardinals, decided to move the team for a second time after having relocated the franchise from Chicago to St. Louis in 1960. The cities the Bidwells considered included Baltimore, Phoenix, New York City, and Jacksonville, whilst Columbus and Oakland also made overtures without Bidwell considering them.[2] Nonetheless, Cardinals fans were unhappy at losing their team,[3] and Bill Bidwill, fearing for his safety, stayed away from several of the 1987 home games. The Cardinals’ final home game in St. Louis was on December 13, 1987, which they won 27–24 over the New York Giants in front of 29,623 fans on a late Sunday afternoon.
