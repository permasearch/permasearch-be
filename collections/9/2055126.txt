Taoist institutional orders evolved in various strains that in more recent times are conventionally grouped in two main branches: Quanzhen Taoism and Zhengyi Taoism.[284] Taoist schools traditionally feature reverence for Laozi, immortals or ancestors, along with a variety of rituals for divination and exorcism, and techniques for achieving ecstasy, longevity or immortality. Ethics and appropriate behaviour that Taoists have to follow may vary depending on the particular school, but in general all of them emphasise wu wei (effortless action), "naturalness", simplicity, spontaneity, and the Three Treasures: compassion, moderation, and humility.
