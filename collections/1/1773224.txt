Four managers have taken charge of both sides in a Bristol Derby: Joe Palmer, Fred Ford, Terry Cooper and John Ward. Palmer and Ford both managed City first, then later went to Rovers, while Cooper moved in the opposite direction. Ward had two spells as Rovers manager, which were either side of his time at City.
