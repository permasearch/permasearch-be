He is considered by many to be the most naturally talented player in the history of the sport,[463] with some labelling him a "genius".[7][464] Several of his peers regard him as the greatest player ever.[145][465][466][467][468] However, a temperamental streak sometimes leads to O'Sullivan having a lack of confidence or interest,[469] and he has performed inconsistently throughout his controversial career thus far,[470] with observers noting the "two Ronnies" aspect of his character.[471][472] According to Stephen Hendry after his defeat at the 2008 World Championship, "O'Sullivan is the best player in the world by a country mile".[473] O'Sullivan has compiled the highest number of competitive century breaks in the sport's history,[474] surpassing Hendry's previous record of 775.[475] O'Sullivan has targeted reaching 1,000 century breaks before he retires.[476]
