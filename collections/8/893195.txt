Jamaica is a large island with approximately 2.8 million residents that lies in the northern Caribbean Sea. Lying to the south of Cuba and to the southwest of the countries on Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic), the island was originally colonized by the Spanish Empire until the British seized control of the island in 1655.[1] Jamaica first competed as a British colony at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, England, and competed at the next two Summer Olympics under the same auspices of the British Empire.[2] The colony joined Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados in 1958 to form the West Indies Federation,[1] competing jointly with those nations at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Italy.[3] Jamaica later withdrew from the West Indies Federation, declaring complete independence from Great Britain in 1962,[1] And participated as an independent nation for the first time at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. Between 1964 and 2008, the Caribbean nation sent delegations to all twelve Summer Olympic games, in addition to five Winter Olympic games.[2]
