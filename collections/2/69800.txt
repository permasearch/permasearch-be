Lowe's won eight consecutive Energy Star awards from 2003 to 2010, including four Energy Star Partner of the Year awards for educating consumers about the benefits of energy efficiency. On March 1, 2010, Lowe's also became the first winner of the Energy Star Sustained Excellence Award in Retail, to recognize its contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by promoting energy-efficient products and educating consumers and employees on the value of the Energy Star program.[19] In 2000, Lowe's released a policy promising that all wood products sold would not be sourced from rainforests.[20] However, according to a 2006 report released by the Environmental Investigation Agency, wood used in flooring that Lowe’s was selling had been coming from the forests of Indonesia’s remote Papua Province, where some logging was estimated to be illegal.[21]
