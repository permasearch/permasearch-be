Aspirin, in the form of leaves from the willow tree, has been used for its health effects for at least 2,400 years.[5] In 1853, chemist Charles Frédéric Gerhardt treated sodium salicylate with acetyl chloride to produce acetylsalicylic acid for the first time.[6] In the second half of the nineteenth century, other chemists established the chemical structure and came up with more efficient methods to make it.[6]:69–75 In 1897, scientists at Bayer began studying acetylsalicylic acid as a less-irritating replacement for common salicylate medicines.[6]:69–75 By 1899, Bayer had named the drug Aspirin and was selling it around the world.[7] The word Aspirin was Bayer's brand name; however, their rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries.[8] Aspirin's popularity grew over the first half of the twentieth century leading to competition between many brands and formulations.[8]
