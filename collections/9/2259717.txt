After Elizabeth leaves, Beckett imprisons Swann when Mercer reveals that he found a letter to the king on Governor Swann, giving a negative review on Beckett's authority and letting the king know what Beckett is illegally doing. Blackmailing him, he lets Swann know that he is sending EITC ships after the Black Pearl and if it is caught he will keep Elizabeth alive if Swann agrees to not tell the king about Beckett's crimes but good reports on Beckett's presence; also ignoring the fact that Swann warns him with that the Pearl is impossible to catch because of its speed.
