In April 2014, most of the licensed Star Wars novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film Star Wars were rebranded as Star Wars Legends and declared non-canon to the franchise by Lucasfilm.[18][19][15] Star Wars Legends literature elaborates on Palpatine's role in Star Wars fiction outside of the films.
