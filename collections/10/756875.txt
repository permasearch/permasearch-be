Thyroglobulin (Tg) is a 660 kDa, dimeric protein produced by the follicular cells of the thyroid and used entirely within the thyroid gland.[citation needed] Thyroxine is produced by attaching iodine atoms to the ring structures of this protein's tyrosine residues; thyroxine (T4) contains four iodine atoms, while triiodothyronine (T3), otherwise identical to T4, has one less iodine atom per molecule. The thyroglobulin protein accounts for approximately half of the protein content of the thyroid gland.[citation needed] Each thyroglobulin molecule contains approximately 100-120 tyrosine residues, a small number of which (<20) are subject to iodination catalysed by thyroperoxidase.[27] The same enzyme then catalyses "coupling" of one modified tyrosine with another, via a free radical-mediated reaction, and when these iodinated bicyclic molecules are released by hydrolysis of the protein, T3 and T4 are the result.[citation needed] Therefore, each thyroglobulin protein molecule ultimately yields very small amounts of thyroid hormone (experimentally observed to be on the order of 5-6 molecules of either T4 or T3 per original molecule of thyroglobulin).[27]
