Widespread study of physical and mental pathology found its place in psychiatry. I. Jensen (1975),[17] J.H. Boyd (1984),[18] W.C. Sanderson (1990),[19] Y. L. Nuller (1993),[20] D.L. Robins (1994),[21] A. B. Smulevich (1997),[22] C.R. Cloninger (2002)[23] and other renowned psychiatrists devoted many years for the discovery of a number of comorbid conditions in patients suffering from most diverse psychiatric disorders. These very researchers developed the first models of comorbidity. Some of the models studied comorbidity as the presence in a person (patient) of more than one disorders (diseases) at a certain period of life, whereas the others elaborated the relative risk, for a person having one disease, of picking up other disorders.[citation needed]
