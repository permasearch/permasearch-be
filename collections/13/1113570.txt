Monarchs in diapause of the fall migrating population are physiologically distinct from those in active reproduction behavior in the spring and summer. In diapause, the measurement of fats and lipids levels a can be as high as 34%. The fat storage organ is substantially larger in migrating and overwintering monarchs compared to the summer generations. Samples of tissue excluding the fat body also show higher levels of free lipids in the hemeolymph. Females in diapause show little evidence of mature eggs. Mating is repressed and only occasionally observed among overwintering monarchs. This is thought to increase the survivability of winter populations and maintain fat reserves that will promote spring northward migration. At one site, the population stayed in diapause until the middle to the end of January. By the beginning of February the day length increases to just over 11 hours, the point at which monarchs come out of diapause.[33] In addition to the required day length, monarchs in diapause must also have temperatures that promote the formation of eggs. When these two conditions are met, mating occurs and females migrate northward. While migrating, the monarch in diapause uses nectar along its migration to create a significant increase in its fat reserves. There are reports of monarchs laying eggs while traveling southward to overwintering sites. Eggs and larvae are killed by freezing temperatures. Migration ends at the first frost.
