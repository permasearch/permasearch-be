The agriculture industry is one of the largest consumers of water. The wine industry in and surrounding Cape Town is a major tourist draw and is a significant aspect of the economy, employing 300,000 workers. The wineries drew 1.5 million tourists in 2017 and at the same time used a third of the water.[51] Depending on the region, a vineyard needs between 10 and 24 inches of rain to survive. South Africa’s wineries have received on average half as much precipitation in the past year. The stress is being felt by industry where less water is causing smaller berries and therefore smaller yield. The industry also has a disproportionate profit with only about 1% return on investment despite producing some of the most popular wines in the world.  The grape yield for 2018 could fall an estimated 20% from the 1.4 million tons produced in 2017, resulting in a 9% decrease in the volume of wine sold.[52]
