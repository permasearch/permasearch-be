Customer participation should not be confused with customer contact. Customer participation is the degree of effort and involvement, both mental and physical, required to produce and deliver the service.[21] Examples of services high in customer participation include do-it-yourself car washes, salad bars and buffets, and distance (off-campus) education services.
