Following the pilot episode of Star Trek: Enterprise, "Broken Bow", and the debut of the song as the series' theme tune, the reception among Star Trek fans was mostly negative. Such was the response, that online petitions were formed and a protest held outside Paramount Studios against the use of the song.[16] One petition stated that "We wish to express our unmitigated disgust with the theme song that has been selected for the new 'Enterprise' series, it is not fit to be scraped off the bottom of a Klingon's boot."[17] Actor Simon Pegg, who played engineer Montgomery Scott in Star Trek and Star Trek Into Darkness later said that he had never watched Enterprise due to the song, which he described as "dreadful soft-rock" and "probably the most hideous Star Trek moment in history".[18] The song was mentioned in the review of the Enterprise first season DVD set by DVD Talk. It was called "sappy",[19] and the reviewer said that it "never felt appropriate and serves only to undercut the emotional strength of the images on screen".[19]
