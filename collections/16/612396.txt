The hibernating American black bear does not display the same rate of muscle and bone atrophy relative to other nonhibernatory animals that are subject to long periods of inactivity, due to ailment or old age.[72][73] A hibernating black bear loses approximately half the muscular strength to that of a well-nourished, inactive human. The bear's bone mass does not change in geometry or mineral composition during hibernation, which implies that the bear's conservation of bone mass during hibernation is due to a biological mechanism.[74] During hibernation bears retain all excretory waste, leading to the development of a hardened mass of fecal material in the colon known as a fecal plug.[75]  A special hormone, leptin, is released into the black bear's systems, to suppress appetite. The retention of waste during hibernation (specifically in minerals such as calcium) may play a role in the bear's resistance to atrophy.[72]
