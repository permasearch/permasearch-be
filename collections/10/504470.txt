The story resumes one year after the tsunami in Asheville â€“ a small North Carolina village where Mark, Trina, Alec, and Lana now live. Huge helicopter-like vehicles called Bergs arrive and attack the people in the village; the Berg crew showers Asheville with darts that kill many villagers. Alec and Marc manage to subdue and take over a Berg but its pilot crashes the vehicle to avoid answering questions. They work out that the darts contained a deadly virus, and start their long journey back to Asheville.
