The Chinese personal pronouns are 我 wǒ "I, me", 你 [你/妳[17]] nǐ "you", and 他/她/它 tā "he (him)/she (her)/it". Plurals are formed by adding 们 [們] men: 我们 [我們] wǒmen "we, us", 你们 [你們] nǐmen "you", 他们/她们/它们 [他們/她們/它們] tāmen "they, them". There is also a formal, polite word for singular "you": 您 nín. The alternative "inclusive" word for "we/us", 咱 zán or 咱们 [咱們] zá(n)men, referring specifically to the two people "you and I", is not widely used. The third-person pronouns are not often used for inanimates (instead, demonstratives are preferred).
