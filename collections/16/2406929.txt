In contrast to expulsions from other nations or states, the expulsion of the Germans from Hungary was dictated from outside Hungary.[112] It began on 22 December 1944 when the Soviet Commander-in-Chief ordered the expulsions. Three percent of the German pre-war population (about 20,000 people) had been evacuated by the Volksbund before that. They went to Austria, but many had returned. Overall, 60,000 ethnic Germans had fled.[96]
