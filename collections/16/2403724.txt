Phobos has dimensions of 27 km × 22 km × 18 km,[1] and retains too little mass to be rounded under its own gravity. Phobos does not have an atmosphere due to its low mass and low gravity.[13] It is one of the least reflective bodies in the Solar System, with an albedo of about 0.071.[2] Spectroscopically it appears to be similar to the D-type asteroids,[14] and is apparently of composition similar to carbonaceous chondrite material.[15] Phobos's density is too low to be solid rock, and it is known to have significant porosity.[16][17][18] These results led to the suggestion that Phobos might contain a substantial reservoir of ice. Spectral observations indicate that the surface regolith layer lacks hydration,[19][20] but ice below the regolith is not ruled out.[21][22]
