In 1808, Napoleon forces invaded the Iberian peninsula, resulting in the evacuation of the Portuguese royal family to Brazil and the abdication of the Spanish King. Napoleon placed his brother, Joseph Bonaparte, on the Spanish throne, provoking an uprising from the Spanish people, the Peninsular War, a grinding guerrilla war that Napoleon dubbed his "ulcer"[citation needed]. The war was famously depicted by the painter Goya). The French invasion also sparked in many places in Spanish America a crisis of legitimacy of crown rule and movements that resulted in political independence. In Spain, political uncertainty lasted over a decade and turmoil for several decades, civil wars on succession disputes, a republic, and finally a liberal democracy. Resistance coalesced around juntas, emergency ad-hoc governments. A Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom, ruling in the name of Ferdinand VII, was created on 25 September to coordinate efforts among the various juntas.
