Should the Governor be unable to fulfill his duties, the Lieutenant Governor must become Governor. If he refuses, he must resign as Lieutenant Governor. Likewise, this applies to the President Pro Tempore and the Speaker of the House. In January 2017, Hugh K. Leatherman Sr., the President Pro Tempore, refused to ascend to the Lieutenant Governorship. Leatherman resigned as President Pro Tempore to avoid becoming Lieutenant Governor but won his seat back the following day. [16] [17]
