Glenn Casale reinvented the show after the Broadway production closed, with an altered songlist (different order, omitted, shortened, replaced or combined songs), and this later version is the basis for the regional US productions and international productions in the Netherlands, Russia, and Japan. "I Want the Good Times Back" and its reprise are replaced by a song called "Daddy's Little Angel", and "Under the Sea", which was previously performed after Triton destroys Ariel's grotto, is moved to before that sequence. Ariel sings a reprise of "If Only" after the grotto destruction and the "Human Stuff" sequence is dialogue-only. Carlotta is entirely omitted, leaving Grimsby with her lines. In the international productions "Daughters of Triton" is the opening number of the musical, and it leads into Ariel's introduction "The World Above", followed by Eric's introduction "Fathoms Below". In the regional US productions Ariel sings "The World Above" as the show's opening number and there is another reprise of "If Only" in which King Triton laments over the loss of his wife.[5][46]
