Karnavedha (IAST: Karṇavedha, Sanskrit: कर्णवेध) literally means "ear-piercing".[68] This is a minor rite of passage, that is not mentioned in most Gryha-sutras.[60][69] Those that mention it state different schedules, with some suggesting that the ritual within the first four weeks after birth, others suggesting within the first year.[60][70] The purpose of this optional ritual is primarily an ornamentation of the body, and is part of the baby's socialization process and culture emersion. The piercing is usually done with a clean gold thread, or silver needle.[60][70]
