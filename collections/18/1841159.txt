Born Sara Janet Duncan on 22 December 1861 at 96 West Street, Brantford, Canada West (now Ontario),[a] she was the oldest daughter of Charles Duncan, a well-off Scottish immigrant who worked as a dry goods and furniture merchant, and his wife, Jane (n√©e Bell), who was Canada-born of Irish descent. She trained as a teacher at Brantford Model School and Toronto Normal School, but always had an eye on a literary career. She had poetry printed as early as 1880, two years before she fully qualified as a teacher. A period of supply teaching in the Brantford area ended in December 1884, when she travelled to New Orleans after persuading The Globe newspaper in Toronto and the Advertiser in London, Ontario to pay her for articles about the World Cotton Centennial. Her articles were published under the pseudonym "Garth" and reprinted in other newspapers. They led The Globe to offer her a regular weekly column when she returned to Canada some months later.[3][4]
