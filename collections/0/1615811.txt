Now lost, and with no food, matters are made worse when they spot a bear den. Realizing danger is literally at their tent door, they try to hike as far as possible before dark, and then camp for the night. Shockingly, the danger catches up with them the following morning when a bear viciously attacks. No amount of yelling, fighting, or bear spray is working on this bear. Alex is brutally dragged from the tent and eaten alive.  Jenn finds herself running for her life to avoid the stalking bear. She breaks her leg after a fall, and stumbles through the woods for days.
