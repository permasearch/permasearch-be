At Cory's house, Jimmy and Joe find a taped phone conversation between Senator Calvin Baynard (Chelcie Ross), who is leading a congressional investigation into gambling in sports, and Stallions owner Sheldon Marcone (Noble Willingham). When the tape is ruined in Joe's faulty car stereo, Jimmy realizes that Cory tried using the tape against Marcone to put Jimmy back on the team, prompting Marcone to send the hitmen. Joe saves Jimmy from a second car bomb, and manages to trick two hitmen into blowing themselves up. But the explosion destroys the remaining evidence.
