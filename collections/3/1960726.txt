An interactive Flash game has been posted on Nickelodeon's official Invader Zim site since the series' original broadcast, based on the episode "NanoZim", in addition to other Shockwave games. There were three video games created with Zim included as the only playable character from the series: Nickelodeon Party Blast, Nicktoons: Freeze Frame Frenzy, and the arcade exclusive game, Nicktoons Nitro. Zim's Voot Cruiser and house were seen briefly in Nicktoons: Battle for Volcano Island. GIR was a playable character in Nicktoons: Attack of the Toybots, while Zim was only playable in the Nintendo DS version. Both Zim and Dib are playable in SpongeBob SquarePants featuring Nicktoons: Globs of Doom, with GIR as a boss battle and rescue after the battle. The game Nicktoons: Android Invasion, on the educational Didj platform, is set entirely inside Zim's base. Zim is the main boss in the game, with several other characters making appearances. Zim and Gaz are playable characters in Nicktoons MLB; GIR appears in the game as well as one of the announcers, and there is a ballpark for the show called "Irken Field". Other characters appear in the game as cameos when the game is loading and on the character cards, making it the game with the most Invader Zim characters to date. The series has yet to have a stand-alone video game set.
