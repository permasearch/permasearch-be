Sometimes, the name the third defenestration of Prague is used, although it has no standard meaning. For example, it has been used[9] to describe the death of Jan Masaryk, who was found below the bathroom window of the building of the Czechoslovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 10 March 1948. The official report listed the death as a suicide.[10] However, it was widely believed he was murdered, either by the nascent Communist government in which he served as a non-partisan Foreign Minister, or by the Soviet secret services.[11] A Prague police report in 2004 concluded after forensic research that Masaryk had indeed been defenestrated to his death.[12] This report was seemingly corroborated in 2006 when a Russian journalist said that his mother knew the Russian intelligence officer who defenestrated Masaryk.[13]
