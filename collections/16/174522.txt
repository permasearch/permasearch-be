In 2012, Weiland formed Scott Weiland and the Wildabouts. The band received mixed reviews, and some critics and fans noted Weiland's failing health. In December 2015, Weiland died of an accidental drug overdose on his tour bus in Minnesota at the age of 48. Upon his death, many critics and peers offered re-evaluations of Weiland's life and career; those critics included David Fricke of Rolling Stone[4] and Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins, who identified Weiland as one of three "voices of the generation" alongside Kurt Cobain and Layne Staley.
