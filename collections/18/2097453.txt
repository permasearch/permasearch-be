After worldwide distribution, the film grossed just under $13,000,000 according to Guy Hamilton in an interview on the 2-disc DVD edition, but as this was near to the huge cost of production, the film failed to make a profit (although VHS, DVD and Blu Ray sales finally moved it into profit). The film lost ten million dollars worldwide.
