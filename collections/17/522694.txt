Introduced in Star Wars: Episode I â€“ The Phantom Menace, Windu appears as the Master of the Jedi High Council.[1] The maverick Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn comes before the Council and offers to train Anakin Skywalker, believing that the boy is the Chosen One of Jedi prophecy. Windu and the other Council members refuse, deeming Anakin too old and dangerously full of fear and anger. After the corrupt Trade Federation is defeated and Obi-Wan Kenobi apparently slays Darth Maul, who also kills Qui-Gon Jinn, Windu realizes that the Sith have returned, and he and the Council reluctantly allow Obi-Wan to train Anakin in Qui-Gon's stead.[5]
