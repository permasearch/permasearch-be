Back in New Zealand, Gallaher was selected for the North Island in his first ever Inter-Island match; the South won 12â€“5.[65] He then continued playing for Auckland, who were conducting a tour of both islands. Gallaher appeared in six of their seven matches,[56] against Taranaki, Wellington, Southland, Otago, Canterbury, and South Canterbury. Auckland lost the first two matches, but won the others.[65]
