In non-pacemaker cells (i.e. ventricular cells) this is produced predominantly by the activation of Na+ channels, which increases the membrane conductance (flow) of Na+ (gNa). These channels are activated when an action potential arrives from a neighbouring cell, through gap junctions. When this happens, the voltage within the cell increases slightly. If this increased voltage reaches a certain value (threshold potential; ~-70mV) it causes the Na + channels to open. This produces a larger influx of sodium into the cell, rapidly increasing the voltage further (to ~ +50mV;[6] i.e. towards the Na+ equilibrium potential). However, if the initial stimulus is not strong enough, and the threshold potential is not reached, the rapid sodium channels will not activate and an action potential will not be produced, this is known as the All-or-none law .[14][15] The slope of phase 0 on the action potential waveform (see figure 2) represents the maximum rate of voltage change, of the cardiac action potential and is known as dV/dtmax.
