Ninhydrin was discovered in 1910 by the German-English chemist Siegfried Ruhemann (1859â€“1943).[3][4] In the same year, Ruhemann observed ninhydrin's reaction with amino acids.[5] In 1954, Swedish investigators Oden and von Hofsten proposed that ninhydrin could be used to develop latent fingerprints.[6][7]
