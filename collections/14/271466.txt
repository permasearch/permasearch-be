The Beatles began recording the song, with a working title of "In the Life ofÂ ...", at EMI's Studio Two on 19 January 1967.[32] The line-up as they rehearsed the track was Lennon on piano, McCartney on Hammond organ, George Harrison on acoustic guitar, and Ringo Starr on congas.[33] The band then taped four takes of the rhythm track, by which point Lennon had switched to acoustic guitar and McCartney to piano, with Harrison now playing maracas.[33][34]
