While the first act of WALL-E "fell out of the sky" for Stanton,[15] he had originally wanted aliens to plant EVE to explore Earth and the rest of the film was different. When WALL-E comes to the Axiom, he incites a Spartacus-style rebellion by the robots against the remnants of the human race, which were cruel alien Gels (completely devolved, gelatinous, boneless, legless, see-through, green creatures that resemble Jell-O). James Hicks, a physiologist, mentioned to Stanton the concept of atrophy and the effects prolonged weightlessness would have on humans living in space for an inordinately extended time period.[8][22][23] Therefore, this was the inspiration of the humans degenerating into the alien Gels,[24] and their ancestry would have been revealed in a Planet of the Apes-style ending.[25] The Gels also spoke a made-up gibberish language, but Stanton scrapped this idea because he thought it would be too complicated for the audience to understand and they could easily be driven off from the storyline.[26] The Gels had a royal family, who host a dance in a castle on a lake in the back of the ship, and the Axiom curled up into a ball when returning to Earth in this incarnation of the story.[26] Stanton decided this was too bizarre and unengaging, and conceived humanity as "big babies".[25] Stanton developed the metaphorical theme of the humans learning to stand again and "grow[ing] up",[25][27] wanting WALL-E and EVE's relationship to inspire humanity because he felt few films explore how utopian societies come to exist.[28] The process of depicting the descendants of humanity as the way they appear in the movie was slow. Stanton first decided to put a nose and ears on the Gels so the audience could recognize them. Eventually, fingers, legs, clothes, and other characteristics were added until they arrived at the concept of being fetus-like to allow the audience to see themselves in the characters.[26]
