Prior to the Roman conquest of Dacia, the territories between the Danube and Dniester rivers were inhabited by various Thracian peoples, including the Dacians and the Getae.[28] Herodotus, in his work "Histories", notes the religious difference between the Getae and other Thracians,[29] however, according to Strabo, the Dacians and the Getae spoke the same language.[28] Dio Cassius draws attention to the cultural similarities between the two people.[28] There is a scholarly dispute whether the Dacians and the Getae were the same people.[30][31]
