The piece, which has no lyrics, is still autobiographical, like many of Bowie's other pieces on this album. The title, "A New Career in a New Town," reflects Bowie's move from the United States to Europe. Despite a distant tone, the upbeat nature of the piece presents a sort of optimism in having a chance to start over.
