Matt Bjorke of Roughstock also rated it 4.5 out of 5 stars.[7] He states, "with "Give It All We Got Tonight," George showcases that he's still got it with this romantic tempo-filled ballad" and that it "finds George back in the pocket of Nashville's writers, a place where he's always been able to mine hits as a man with some of the best ears in Nashville".[7]
