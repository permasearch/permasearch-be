In the early 1990s, due to the protracted lack of a permanent central authority, Somalia began to be characterized as a "failed state".[112][113][114] Political scientist Ken Menkhaus argues that evidence suggested that the nation had already attained failed state status by the mid-1980s,[115] while Robert I. Rotberg similarly posits that the state failure had preceded the ouster of the Barre administration.[116] Hoehne (2009), Branwen (2009) and Verhoeven (2009) also used Somalia during this period as a case study to critique various aspects of the "state failure" discourse.[117]
