Budstikka also did a count of the number of vehicles traveling in the bus lane during the rush hour on December 3, 2013. The newspaper found that a total of 829 vehicles used the bus lane between 7:30 and 8:30 a.m., of which, 618 vehicles were electric cars (74.5%). Buses accounted for only 7.5% of the traffic in the bus lane, and taxis, two-wheelers and mini-buses made up the rest. The Deputy Director of the Institute of Transport Economics (TØI) explained that the normal capacity of a highway lane is between 1,800 and 2,000 vehicles per hour, but because of the ramp entrances and exits, and the buses maneuvering in and out the bus lane to do their stops, the traffic flow starts to become troublesome when the number of vehicles in the bus lane is about 1,000 vehicles per hour. Although by December 2013 the traffic is approaching this limit, TØI's Deputy Director did not want to predict when this critical situation will occur. The Manager of the green car advocate group Grønn Bil warned that "if the only reason people bought an electric car is to drive in the bus lane, they will probably be disappointed sooner or later."[80][81]
