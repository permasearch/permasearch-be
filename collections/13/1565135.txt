Steve is portrayed as a stereotypical nerd: he is somewhat of a social outcast, wears thick glasses due to hyperopia, and is very unathletic.[7][8] More typically nerdy traits of Steve's include his interests in Dungeons & Dragons, Harry Potter and Star Wars.[9] Like most unpopular students, Steve is often physically and verbally picked on by the bullies of the more popular social circle. Stan is often annoyed with Steve, as he would prefer that Steve engage in activities that would improve his social standing, like sports, a conflict that was first explored in the first season episode "All About Steve".[10] Stan sometimes attempts to change Steve, usually unsuccessfully, as when he once gave Steve an experimental performance enhancer. The steroid caused Steve to grow female breasts but also ironically made him more popular at school.[11] Steve looks up to his dad as a role model but his naÃ¯vete often leads him to follow his dad's advice or convictions, seemingly blindly. This led him to once openly display homophobia.[12] Another time Steve received a failing grade on a presentation about fossils using information he got from Stan because he thought his dad was intelligent, despite Roger's attempts to convince him otherwise.[13]
