Few new progressive rock bands formed during this era, and those who did found that record labels were not interested in signing them.[114] The short-lived supergroup U.K. was a notable exception since members had already established reputations, although they tended to carry on in the style of previous bands and did little to advance the genre.[115] Some of the genre's more important development at this time occurred in its influence on other styles, as several guitarists with European ties brought a progressive rock approach to heavy metal and laid the groundwork for the future progressive metal style. Michael Schenker, of UFO, and Uli Jon Roth, who replaced Schenker in Scorpions, expanded the modal vocabulary available to guitarists.[116][further explanation needed] Roth studied classical music with the intent of using the guitar in the way that classical composers used the violin.[117] Finally, the Dutch-born and classically trained Alex and Eddie Van Halen formed Van Halen, featuring ground-breaking whammy-bar, tapping & cross-picking guitar work[118]and influencing "shred" music of the 1980s.[119]
