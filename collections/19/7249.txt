The four winning contestants of each preliminary game stand on a platform 30 feet in the air. One by one they are given a category, and each contestant is asked a question in turn from left to right. When a contestant misses a question or answers it incorrectly, the contestant is eliminated, and falls through a chute beneath his or her feet. The last contestant remaining wins and advances to Hot Hands.
