Several reviewers noted the record's ambition. Slant Magazine described the song's lyrics as a "multipart anti-yuppie anthem whose ambition is anything but ugly",[42] and Andy Gill wrote in The Independent that "Paranoid Android" could be the most ambitious single since Jimmy Webb's "MacArthur Park".[43] Craig McLean of The Sydney Morning Herald described "Paranoid Android" as "a titanic guitar opera in three movements and 6 [and a half] minutes".[44] PopMatters' Evan Sawdey called the song OK Computer's "sweeping, multi-tiered centerpiece",[45] Peter and Jonathan Buckley wrote in The Rough Guide to Rock that it was the album's "breathtaking high point".[46] Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine called "Paranoid Android" "complex, multi-segmentedÂ ... tight, melodic, and muscular", and said it displayed Radiohead at their most adventurous.[47] Browne admitted that, partially because of "Paranoid Android", OK Computer was significantly more expansive than The Bends.[39] Rolling Stone placed the song at number 256 on its 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list,[48] and Pitchfork Media included the song at number 4 on their Top 200 Tracks of the 90s.[49]
