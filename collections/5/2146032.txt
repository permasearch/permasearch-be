Although pottery figurines are found from earlier periods in Europe, the oldest pottery vessels come from East Asia, with finds in China and Japan, then still linked by a land bridge, and some in what is now the Russian Far East, providing several from 20,000–10,000 BCE, although the vessels were simple utilitarian objects.[25][26] Xianrendong Cave in Jiangxi province contained pottery fragments that date back to 20,000 years ago.[27][28]
