Mariah and Tessa's kiss in August 2017 generated polarized reactions from viewers. While the soap opera had been criticized by journalists and fans of the genre for its reluctance to write LGBT stories, the storyline proved controversial with fans.[28] Having been away from the daytime genre for a decade (a period in which other soap operas had featured LGBT characters), Sally Sussman Morina was "taken aback" by the negativity surrounding the kiss.[30] However, it also received positive feedback on social media; Grimes responded to these reactions by writing: "Your strength is power, progress, and potential."[28] Michael Logan of TV Insider reported that network executives were "super skittish" about the storyline, and that there was a gag order banning Grimes and her co-stars from discussing it with the press.[29] Logan posed the question, "Will a new day finally dawn in Genoa City?", observing that "there’s no getting around the fact that Y&R—the only current daytime soap without any out and proud LGBTQ characters—has been historically phobic when it comes to same-sex amour".[29] Jeremy Helligar of HuffPost praised the show's depiction of Mariah and Tessa's feelings for one another as "just two women falling for each other and attempting to make sense of it without putting a label on it."[31] Helligar remarked that "gender almost seems to be an afterthought" in the storyline, "It’s backing up an assertion some of us have been making forever: Two men or two women fall in love the same way a man and a woman do. Love is neither “gay” nor “straight.” Love is love, regardless of the gender(s) or sexual orientation of the people falling into it."[31] Likewise, Helligar praised The Young and the Restless for not making race an issue in Mariah's relationship with Devon.[31] The storyline earned Grimes her second Daytime Emmy Award, winning for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in April 2018.[37] Grimes had submitted the scenes where Mariah confides in Sharon about her feelings for Tessa.[38] The actress dedicated her acceptance speech to "everyone who dares to love truthfully".[39]
