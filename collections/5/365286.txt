Carrie (Claire Danes), now medicated, pleads with her psychiatrist (Stephen Schnetzer) to pass along a message to Saul that she is doing better and that she's sorry. Later on, she momentarily loses control while in a bathroom, bashing her head into the mirror and drawing blood. A sympathetic nurse (Marcia DeBonis) finds her and agrees not to report the incident.
