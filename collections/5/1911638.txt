While Fender was not the first to manufacture electric guitars — luthiers and larger musical instrument manufacturers had produced electric guitars since the late 1920s — the popularity of Fender's instruments superseded what had come before. Furthermore, while nearly all other electric guitars featured hollow bodies — making them most similar to an acoustic guitar — or more specialized designs, such as Rickenbacker's solid-body Hawaiian guitars, Fender's instruments possessed an unprecedented level of versatility.  The solid wood bodies of Fender's instruments allowed for minimal feedback with high-gain amplification, an issue that plagued earlier guitars.  The Fender guitars were popular with musicians in a variety of genres and are now revered for their build quality and tonal excellence.
