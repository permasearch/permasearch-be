Though not widely known, a new variation of the pragmatic theory was defined and wielded successfully from the 20th century forward. Defined and named by William Ernest Hocking, this variation is known as "negative pragmatism". Essentially, what works may or may not be true, but what fails cannot be true because the truth and its meaning always works.[27] James and Dewey's ideas also ascribe meaning and truth to repeated testing which is "self-corrective" over time.
