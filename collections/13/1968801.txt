An Icelandic DJ living in London who is trying to escape a troubled past. Riley begins the series by accidentally diving deep into the world of London's drug trade, and has many psychic encounters with Will, a sensate who is a part of her cluster. The two fall in love with each other. She finds that she cannot escape her tragic past and goes home to Iceland to confront it and reunite with her father, who is a famous Icelandic pianist. It is there that Riley's backstory is revealed. She was married once to a man named Magnus and was pregnant with his child. On the way to the hospital to give birth, a snowstorm hits and Magnus accidentally drives off the road. Her husband dies in the car crash and she is stuck in the overturned car. Her water breaks and she has to give birth in the wilderness. She takes her baby and tries to get to safety, but ultimately, her daughter freezes to death. In the present, Riley is haunted by survivor's guilt. While at her father’s classical music concert, she falls unconscious and is taken to the hospital. Her unique brain scans garner the attention of the series’ villain Whispers, who leads an organization that hunts down sensates, and he abducts her. Aware of what is happening, Will goes to Iceland and uses his skills and those of other sensates to break her out. Before they escape however, Will looks into Whispers' eyes, which gives Whispers the ability to see and hear through Will’s perspective. Riley helps Will use drugs to knock him unconscious to avoid Whispers learning their location. With this strategy, the two successfully escape, using a boat belonging to Riley's friend Sven to get out to sea.
