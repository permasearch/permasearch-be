Blair liked to carry out practical jokes. Buddicom recalls him swinging from the luggage rack in a railway carriage like an orangutan to frighten a woman passenger out of the compartment.[15] At Eton he played tricks on John Crace, his Master in College, among which was to enter a spoof advertisement in a College magazine implying pederasty.[140] Gow, his tutor, said he "made himself as big a nuisance as he could" and "was a very unattractive boy".[141] Later Blair was expelled from the crammer at Southwold for sending a dead rat as a birthday present to the town surveyor.[142] In one of his As I Please essays he refers to a protracted joke when he answered an advertisement for a woman who claimed a cure for obesity.[143]
