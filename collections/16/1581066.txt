Olivia Colman was the first cast member to learn the killer's identityâ€”having been informed during her first meeting with the producers. Colman told Radio Times that she asked who the killer was, and was told. An hour later, she was told that the killer's identity would remain a secret and that she should not tell anyone. Somehow, David Tennant's agent learned that Colman knew the murderer's identity, and told David Tennant midway through the production that Colman knew. Tennant did not believe it. Colman later said that Tennant was angry at learning the truth.[33]
