The "notice time" refers to the period that immigrants had to wait after declaring their intent to become a citizen. The "residence period" refers to the period they had to live in the United States before they could become a citizen. The Naturalization Act of 1798 is considered one of the Alien and Sedition Acts, passed contemporaneously in 1798. Like the Naturalization Acts of 1790 and 1795, the 1798 act also restricted citizenship to "free white persons".
