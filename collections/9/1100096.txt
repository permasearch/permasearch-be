Herbert was not originally a pedophile; Henry pitched the idea to the writers of the show, leading to the decision to make him one.[1] As with most of the other characters he created, Henry voices Herbert.[1] Henry based Herbert's voice and appearance on an elderly man he met when he worked in a grocery store when he was in high school. In an interview Henry described that man as a sweet person.[1]
