Dopamine itself is used as precursor in the synthesis of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and epinephrine.[16] Dopamine is converted into norepinephrine by the enzyme dopamine Î²-hydroxylase, with O2 and L-ascorbic acid as cofactors.[16] Norepinephrine is converted into epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase with S-adenosyl-L-methionine as the cofactor.[16]
