A member of the Firefly family, namely Tiny's older brother. Rufus was abnormally tall, and often shot down nearby cars so their drivers would have to stop by the Firefly house for help. His Father was a man named Rufus, hence Rufus Jr or R.J. He was a fairly minor character in House Of 1000 Corpses. In The Devil's Rejects, Rufus defended the house from police covered in homemade steel body armor. In the end of the assault, Rufus fought alone while the others retreated and was shot to death by Wydell and his men. He is named after the Groucho Marx character in the film Duck Soup.
