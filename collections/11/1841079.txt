On October 7, 2014, the Detroit Lions signed him to a one-year deal.[14] Prater was Detroit's 3rd kicker in only a little over a month after Nate Freese and Alex Henery had struggles in the kicking game. In Prater's debut as a Lion, he only made 1 of 3 kicks on a rather windy day at TCF Bank Stadium, but the Lions still got the win over the Minnesota Vikings.[15] Two weeks later, Prater missed a game-winning 43 yard field goal against the Atlanta Falcons in London, but due to a delay of game penalty on Detroit, was allowed to re-kick from 48 yards out from which he converted, winning the game for the Lions.[16] He finished the year converting 21 field goals on 26 attempts.
