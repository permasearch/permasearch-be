The introduction of the metric system was a topic at the Fifth Commonwealth Standards Conference that was held in Sydney in 1962.[32] The following year a poll by the British Standards Institute (BSI) revealed that the majority of its members favoured a transition to the metric system and two years later (1965), after taking a poll of its members, the Confederation of British Industry informed the government that they favoured the adoption of the metric system, though some sectors emphasised the need for a voluntary system of adoption.[33][34]
