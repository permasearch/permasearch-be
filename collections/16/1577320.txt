LpO cross-validation requires training and validating the model      C  p   n     {\displaystyle C_{p}^{n}}   times, where n is the number of observations in the original sample, and where      C  p   n     {\displaystyle C_{p}^{n}}   is the binomial coefficient. For p > 1 and for even moderately large n, LpO CV can become computationally infeasible. For example, with n = 100 and p = 30 = 30 percent of 100 (as suggested above),      C  30   100   ≈ 3 ×  10  25   .   {\displaystyle C_{30}^{100}\approx 3\times 10^{25}.}
