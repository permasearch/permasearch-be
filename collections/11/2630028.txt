Vietnam is known for its rigorous curriculum that is deemed as competitive for students. Secondary education is one of the most significant social issues in the country: designated schools known as "High schools for the gifted" (Trường trung học phổ thông chuyên) are regarded as prestigious and often demand high entrance examination results. Higher education is also a fundamental cornerstone in Vietnamese society. Entrance to university is determined through the National High School Graduation Examination, whose results will be considered for evaluation. The higher the score is, the more prestigious the institution will be. Failure to attend university often leads to social stigma, as those who could not pass the Graduation Examination would be looked down upon by members of society.
