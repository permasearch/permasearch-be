In Oakville, Tavares attended St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Secondary School.[5] He lived five minutes from Sam Gagner, who later signed a contract with the Edmonton Oilers, and the two quickly established a friendship.[4] Gagner's father, former National Hockey League (NHL) player Dave Gagner, built a backyard ice rink on which Tavares spent much of his time honing ice hockey skills.[4] In the OHL, Tavares placed an emphasis on his education, earning honours as well as the Oshawa Generals' Scholastic Player of the Year in 2007â€“08.[6] Tavares also spends some of his time working with the Special Olympics.[7]
