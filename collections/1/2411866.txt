Kosrae is a high island that is largely unspoiled. It is becoming a destination for scuba divers and hikers[citation needed]. The coral reefs that surround the island are kept in pristine condition through an extensive mooring buoy system, installed and maintained by concerned expat[who?] dive operators with the help of the government's Marine Resources office. The reefs are largely untouched, and contain miles of hard corals, some said to be thousands of years old.[citation needed]
