Charlie and John research Fredbear’s history, discovering a newspaper article on Sammy’s kidnapping. A photograph depicts Dave, who is identified as William Afton, co-owner of both restaurants. Dave has placed Carlton in a costume, which can be worn by both humans and animatronics, through a series of spring-loaded mechanisms called “spring locks”. These locks could be lethal if triggered whilst a human is wearing the suit.
