During and after the US-led invasion of Iraq, members of the Zaidi-Shia community protested after Friday prayers every week outside mosques, particularly the Grand Mosque in Sana'a, during which they shouted anti-US and anti-Israeli slogans, and criticised the government's close ties to America.[189] These protests were led by ex-parliament member and Imam, Bader Eddine al-Houthi.[190] In response the Yemeni government has implemented a campaign to crush to the Zaidi-Shia rebellion"[191] and harass journalists.[192]
