The Death Note concept derived from a rather general concept involving Shinigami and "specific rules".[6] Ohba wanted to create a suspense series because he did not feel that he could have created a fight-style series and that the genre had few suspense series' available to the public. After publication of the pilot chapter, the series was not expected to be approved as a serialized comic by the author, who did not consider it to "fit with Jump". Ohba said that, when he learned that Death Note had received approval and that Takeshi Obata would create the artwork, he "couldn't even believe it".[7] Due to positive reactions, Death Note became a serialized manga series.[8]
