The 2005 season started with a repeat of the previous year's final: a Brumbies victory over the Crusaders in Canberra.[39] There was a win the following week at home over the Chiefs, followed by a win over the Reds at Trafalgar Park.[40] Although there was a 35–20 loss to the Bulls after Crusaders captain Richie McCaw was knocked unconscious, they eventually finished the regular season top of the table.[41][42] McCaw returned from his five weeks on the sideline to lead the Crusaders in their semi-final victory over the Hurricanes.[41][42] They faced the Waratahs in the final at Jade Stadium. Leading 14–6 at halftime, the Crusaders then moved out to a 29-point lead.[43] Despite three late tries by the Waratahs, the Crusaders won their fifth title with a 35–20 win.[43][44]
