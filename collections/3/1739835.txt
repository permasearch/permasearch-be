Estrogens, in females, are produced primarily by the ovaries, and during pregnancy, the placenta.[64] Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates the ovarian production of estrogens by the granulosa cells of the ovarian follicles and corpora lutea. Some estrogens are also produced in smaller amounts by other tissues such as the liver, pancreas, bone, adrenal glands, skin, brain, adipose tissue,[65] and the breasts.[66] These secondary sources of estrogens are especially important in postmenopausal women.[67] The pathway of estrogen biosynthesis in extragonadal tissues is different. These tissues are not able to synthesize C19 steroids, and therefore depend on C19 supplies from other tissues[68] and the level of aromatase.[69]
