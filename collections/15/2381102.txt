When fitting new piston rings or breaking them in within an engine, the end gap is a crucial measurement. In order that a ring may be fitted into the "grooves" of the piston, it is not continuous but is broken at one point on its circumference. The ring gap may be checked by placing the ring into the bore/liner (squared to bore) and measuring it with a feeler gauge. The end gap should be within recommended limits for size of bore and intended "load" of engine. Because metals expand with a rise in temperature, too small a gap may result in overlapping or bending when used under hot running conditions (racing, heavy loads, towing) and, even at normal temperatures, an undersized ring gap may lead to ring-gap closure, ring breakage, bore damage and possible seizure of the piston. Too large a gap may give unacceptable compression and levels of blow-by gases or oil consumption. When piston gap is measured in a used bore, it may serve to indicate either excessive bore wear or ring wear, or a combination of both types of wear. (Radial wear on the ring face reduces the effective thickness of the used/worn ring, thereby essentially decreasing the face circumference of the ring. This increases the size of the ring's end gap.)
