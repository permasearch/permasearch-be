Before the FMR1 gene was discovered, analysis of pedigrees showed the presence of male carriers who were asymptomatic, with their grandchildren affected by the condition at a higher rate than their siblings suggesting that genetic anticipation was occurring.[10] This tendency for future generations to be affected at a higher frequency became known as the Sherman paradox after its description in 1985.[10][34] Due to this, male children often have a greater degree of symptoms than their mothers.[35]
