At the base of the cochlea, there is an oval window, and this is what the footplate at the end of the stapes presses on. When the footplate presses on this oval window, it pressurizes the fluid in the vestibular canal which is the part of the cochlea that is filled with fluid and receives incoming acoustic vibrations. At the base of the cochlea, there is a round window that is a flexible membrane. It absorbs the pressure that is left after the stapes' footplate sends the pressurized waves into the cochlea and drains it from the system so that theres not limitless pressure going into the cochlea at all times without any release.
