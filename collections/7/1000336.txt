Before this match England and the West Indies had played each other in two ICC finals – the final of the 1979 World Cup at Lord's and the final of the 2004 Champions Trophy final at the Oval – both of which the West Indies won. This was also the first final between two previous champions – England won the 2010 World T20 for their first ICC world championship while the West Indies won the 2012 World T20.
