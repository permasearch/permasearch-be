In mammals copper is absorbed in the stomach and small intestine, although there appear to be differences among species with respect to the site of maximal absorption.[15] Copper is absorbed from the stomach and duodenum in rats[16] and from the lower small intestine in hamsters.[17] The site of maximal copper absorption is not known for humans, but is assumed to be the stomach and upper intestine because of the rapid appearance of Cu64 in the plasma after oral administration.[18]
