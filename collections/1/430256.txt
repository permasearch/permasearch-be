The "ez" signifies "son of". The name Rodrigo is the Spanish form of Roderick, meaning "famous power", from the Germanic elements "hrod" (fame) and "ric" (power). It was the name of Roderic, the last Visigothic King before the Muslim conquest, and the subject of many legends. The surname RodrÃ­guez could have originated in the 9th century when patronymic names originated.
