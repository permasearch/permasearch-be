Another explanation for the lack of widespread use of lever action designs stems from the initial inability to fire high-pressure cartridges. Safe operation could only be carried out by using low-pressure cartridges in the toggle-lock lever action rifles such as the Henry rifle and the following Winchester Model 1866, Model 73 and Model 76 (which was used by the mounted police of Canada). The new lever action designs, notably the Winchester Model 1886, Model 92 Model 94 and the Model 1895 (in 7.62x54R, a Russian military cartridge), with a strong locking-block action designed by John Moses Browning, were capable of firing higher pressure cartridges. These rifles became available in the late 19th century, too  expensive  to manufacture, militaries worldwide had put  cheap bolt action rifles into service and were unwilling to invest into producing a lever action rifle after having done with an inexpensive bolt action design.
