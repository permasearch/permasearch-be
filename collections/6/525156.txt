Saint Piran's Flag is the national flag and ancient banner of Cornwall,[19][20][21] and an emblem of the Cornish people. It is regarded as the county flag by Cornwall Council. The banner of Saint Piran is a white cross on a black background (in terms of heraldry 'sable, a cross argent'). According to legend Saint Piran adopted these colours from seeing the white tin in the black coals and ashes during his discovery of tin. [22] [23] The Cornish flag is an exact reverse of the former Breton national flag (black cross) and is known by the same name "Kroaz Du".[24][25]
