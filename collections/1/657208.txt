Birthplace Citizenship is controversial as applied to children born in the United States to non-immigrant parents. In the late 1990s opposition arose over the longstanding practice of granting automatic citizenship on a jus soli basis[63] as fears grew in some circles that the existing law encouraged parents-to-be to come to the United States to have children in order to improve the parents' chances of attaining legal residency themselves.[64][65] Some media correspondents[66][67] and public leaders, including former congressman Virgil Goode, have controversially dubbed this the "anchor baby" situation,[68][69] and politicians have proposed legislation on this basis that might alter how birthright citizenship is awarded.[70]
