The 2017 race will be the third and final year contested with the Chevrolet and Honda aero kits outfitted to the Dallara DW12 chassis. Beginning in 2018, all DW12 chassis will be outfitted with a universal bodywork kit.[6] Furthermore, a development freeze was implemented for 2017, and all aero kits must adhere to the established specifications carried over from 2016.
