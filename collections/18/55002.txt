According to Q, the song is "a mammoth power ballad with a chorus like Mott the Hoople's All the Young Dudes."[2] William Goodman from Spin agreed, also comparing the song to All The Young Dudes.[3] Entertainment Weekly's Simon Vozick-Levinson described it as a "sensitive arena rock cut that made us think of Toto's 'Africa'. While the chorus sounded more like ELO's 'Telephone Line.'[4] A Rolling Stone article commented that it "has a dash of 'Boulevard of Broken Dreams' to it."[5] Spin's Goodman agreed, writing: "This track covers a lot of territory in its five minutes, from a solo acoustic guitar (reminiscent of "Boulevard of Broken Dreams") to Brian May-worthy electric riffage. But the chorus holds the killer hook, as Armstrong hits highs with his voice in a thrilling moment."[3]
