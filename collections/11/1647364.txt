With the return of the "allroad" nameplate to North America, in the form of the 2013 A4 allroad quattro, the C5-Platform allroad quattro has begun to take the name "Ur-allroad." The 'Ur-' is used in the German language, as a prefix to signify 'ancient' or 'early ancestor' (e.g., great-grandmother is Urgroßmutter), and is used informally by car enthusiasts worldwide to refer to the original[13] Audi Quattro that was produced from 1980 – 1991 (the "Ur-Quattro").  The use of the term was then extended to the original S4 and S6 models to differentiate them from later models with the same name; and more recently to the C5 allroad models ("Ur-allroad"). The need for differentiating the models is apparent because the new B8 A4 allroad lacks the C5's adjustable height/load leveling suspension with shock rate adjustment to load and reinforced uni-body, sports only a nominal towing capacity, and lacks a non-allroad A4 wagon counterpart. Some feel that for these reasons it does not live up to the allroad nameplate and is nothing more than an A4 wagon with a trim package.
