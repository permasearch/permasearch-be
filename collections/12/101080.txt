Funding bias refers to the tendency of a scientific study to support the interests of the study's financial sponsor. This phenomenon is recognized sufficiently that researchers undertake studies to examine bias in past published studies.[74] It can be caused by any or all of: a conscious or subconscious sense of obligation of researchers towards their employers,[75] misconduct or malpractice,[76] publication bias,[76][77][78][79] or reporting bias.[80]
