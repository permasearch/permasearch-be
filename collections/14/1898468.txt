The series is set in modern Mexico City, mostly at a café named "El Dicho Cafe" owned by Don Tomás, where he is helped by his granddaughter Isabel and his employees.[4] Episodes usually center around the customers who, most of the time, are dealing with a problem.[4] Throughout the episode a proverb is written in one of the white walls of the café, either by Don Tomás, one of his employees, or by a customer.[5] The saying that is written usually describes the situation of what is happening in the particular moment it is written.[5]
