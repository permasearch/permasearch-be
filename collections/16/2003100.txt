The 19th century saw the writings of many renowned French authors. Victor Hugo is sometimes seen as "the greatest French writer of all times"[318] for excelling in all literary genres. The preface of his play Cromwell is considered to be the manifesto of the Romantic movement. Les Contemplations and La Légende des siècles are considered as "poetic masterpieces",[319] Hugo's verse having been compared to that of Shakespeare, Dante and Homer.[319] His novel Les Misérables is widely seen as one of the greatest novel ever written[320] and The Hunchback of Notre Dame has remained immensely popular.
