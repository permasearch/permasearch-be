Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation apparently takes place in its own continuity, although the original film is mentioned in the opening prologue, in the same prologue it also references the other sequel films, as "two minor, yet apparently related inncidents". This is the lowest rated film of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre series. The film features Leatherface as a yelping, pizza-eating transvestite involved in an Illuminati conspiracy to provide society a source of horror and, again, with a different family.[6][7] Leatherface (who is referred to as "Leather" in the whole film) is presented as a much more effeminate character than the previous two installments feature, which portrayed Leatherface as being attracted to women. In part 4, Leatherface is reverted to his original self, a screaming mentally ill killer with an identity problem. He seems even more feminine than his character in the original film, wearing a female face mask and a Gein-like female skin suit, a woman's dress, make-up, even painting his fingernails.
