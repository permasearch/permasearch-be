The character and casting was announced on 26 July 2016 alongside that of his mother Goldie and twin brother Hunter (Theo Graham).[44] Prince was described as a "cocky and swaggering" 15-year old who has "confidence in spades and more front than Blackpool".[44] He was billed as having "a rebellious and adventurous spirit" causing him to "live in the moment", but also has trouble "listening to authority", something that Sophie Dainty of Digital Spy described as "a trait that seems to run in the McQueen family."[44] Healey said that she, Thompson-Dwyer and Graham were overjoyed by their family unit.[44] Lily Drinkwell (Lauren McQueen) was introduced as a new love interest for Prince in January 2017. McQueen commented that Lily and Prince were total opposites and that no one would think to put them together.[58] In August 2017, Thompson-Dwyer and McQueen were longlisted for Best Partnership at the Inside Soap Awards.[5] They did not progress to the viewer-voted shortlist.[12]
