Mathematically, this is known as the (generalised) problem of moments: for a given class of random variables     X   {\displaystyle X}  , find a collection     {  f  i   }   {\displaystyle \{f_{i}\}}   of functions such that the expectation values     E ‚Å° [  f  i   ( X ) ]   {\displaystyle \operatorname {E} [f_{i}(X)]}   fully characterise the distribution of the random variable     X   {\displaystyle X}  .
