The Walking Dead was a financial success, aided by the ease of digital distribution.[130] The first episode topped the charts on Xbox Live Arcade for the week of April 30,[131] and remained at the top for two weeks. It also topped the sales charts for both PlayStation Network and Steam for a week.[132] The first episode sold one million copies in 20 days (not including iOS sales), making it Telltale's fastest selling title to date.[132] With the third episode's release, over 3.8 million episodes were delivered to 1.2 million players.[130] As of January 2013, over 8.5 million episodes have been sold across all platforms, representing about $40 million in revenue.[58] Telltale's CEO Dan Connors has stated that the iOS version represented about 25% of their overall sales, the "largest upswing" for any platform, with sale particularly high in November and December 2012, due in part due to various sales on the App Store.[58] Upon announcement of the 400 Days content, Telltale reported that over 17 million episodes have been purchased across all platforms worldwide,[133] while by October 2013, at the time of the formal announcement of Season Two, over 21 million episodes have been sold.[61] As of July 28, 2014, 28 million episodes have been sold.[134]
