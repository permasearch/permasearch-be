Ghosters have appeared in fiction. One example is Seymour Skinner, the grade-school principal in The Simpsons. Several years after his first appearance on this series, Skinner revealed that he was an impostor who had stolen the real Seymour Skinner's life and identity after the real Skinner was captured in Vietnam and sold to a shoe-producing company in China. Don Draper, the main character in AMC's Mad Men, is another example of a ghoster, obtaining his identity from a deceased superior officer during the Korean War. In the film The Day of the Jackal the would-be assassin assumes the identity of a deceased person to hide his movements from the authorities.
