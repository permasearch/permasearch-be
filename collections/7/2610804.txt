Episodes two and three did not fare as well, critically. Discussing the second episode, Michael Hogan in The Daily Telegraph found the quickened pace invigorating, and found the story gripping.[149] But Neela Debnath at The Independent criticised the writing, concluding, "Sadly, all the electric tension of episode one has evaporated, instead events are becoming improbable and additional drama seems to be shoehorned in for the sake of it. ... There's so much going on that it's starting to feel unbelievable."[148] Ross McG at Metro largely agreed with these points, and noted that the courtroom drama seemed bland because it essentially reiterated facts viewers already knew.[150] Ben Skipper at the International Business Times was harsh in his appraisal, calling episode two "Broadchurch's first truly bad hour of television." He blasted the plot, particularly the apparent kidnapping of Claire Ripley, the clichÃ©d timing of Beth Latimer going into labour, and legal inconsistencies. He also called Marianne Jean-Baptiste's performance "lacking".[151] The "Bafta-winning detective drama is a heap of old codswallop that makes no sense at all," said Christopher Stevens in the Daily Mail, referencing episode three. "The first episode was shaky. The second was riddled with errors. But the third was beyond all forgiving."[152] There was limited praise for episode three, however. Ben Dowell at Radio Times had high praise for cinematographer John Conroy's work: "The cinematography was beautiful. Broadchurch always looks fabulously bucolic but tonight the lovely summer dawns and countryside was shown off to an even greater degree..." He also lauded Olivia Colman's performance, calling her "once again on top form".[153]
