Other opponents, such as African-American leader Harriet Tubman, simply treated the law as just another complication in their activities. One important consequence was that Canada became a major destination for escaped slaves; the black population of Canada increased from 40,000 to 60,000 between 1850 and 1860 and many reached freedom by the Underground Railroad.[19] In Pittsburgh, for example, during the September following the passage of the law, organized "squads" of escaped slaves set out for Canada—armed and sworn to "die rather than be taken back into slavery"—with more than 200 men leaving by the end of the month.[6]
