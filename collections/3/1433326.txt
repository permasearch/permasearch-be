In November 2012, Adidas unveiled a new lightweight version of the Predator LZ, aptly named the Predator LZ SL.[17] The boot still features Lethal Zones, miCoach technology and the same soleplate. It is in the upper material where they are differentiated. Rather than using the Hybrid S-L seen in the regular LZ, Adidas employ a thinner SprintSkin on the back end of the LZ SL. This boot weighed in at 7.3oz.
