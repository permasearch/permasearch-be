The Houghton Mifflin edition was released in January or February 1957, and the Random House edition was released on March 1.[19] The two editions featured different covers but were otherwise identical.[19] The first edition can be identified by the "200/200" mark in the top right corner of the front dust jacket flap, signifying the $2.00 selling price. The price was reduced to $1.95 on later editions.[20]
