Visual effects for Infinity War were created by Industrial Light & Magic,[176] Framestore,[177] Method Studios,[178] Weta Digital, Double Negative, Cinesite, Digital Domain, Rise, Lola VFX, and Perception.[179] Digital Domain worked on creating Thanos for the film, producing over 400 visual effects shots. The company created a new facial capture application called Masquerade, based on the concept of machine learning through computer algorithms, specifically for the film, beginning work on the system 3â€“4 months before filming began to develop and test it. They presented their results to Brolin, the Russos, and executives from Marvel ahead of filming to demonstrate the subtleties Brolin would be able to bring to the character, which helped inform Brolin how to portray the character.[175] Kelly Port, Digital Domain's VFX Supervisor, noted the design of Thanos took into account the versions that appeared in previous films, but were adjusted more toward's Brolin's features, which also helped with matching his performance to the digital character.[180] Weta Digital worked on the fight on Titan, where they also created a separate version of Thanos for their needs. Weta worked on 200 shots of him, along with their 250 other effects shots, that included the Titan environment and the other characters in the fight.[175]
