Governments have traditionally had a strong interest in preserving their economic, and therefore political, strength, and have therefore sought to use the tools at their disposal. This was especially true when warfare was endemic in the early-modern period: a strong economy often meant the difference between political independence, and conquest by a foreign power.[citation needed]  This resulted in the economic system generally known as mercantilism.[dubious  â€“ discuss]
