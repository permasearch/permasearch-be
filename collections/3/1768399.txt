The game was suspended after the top of the sixth inning due to rain, making it the first game in World Series history not to be played through to completion or declared a tie. Phillies starter Cole Hamels, making his fifth start, had pitched six innings when the umpires suspended play.  (The Phillies pinch-hit for Hamels in the bottom of the 6th inning. By retaking the lead in that half-inning, the Phillies put Hamels in line for the victory, which would have been his 5th win in the postseason, tying a MLB record.  However, when Tampa Bay again tied the game in the 7th, Hamels was left with a no-decision.)[33]
