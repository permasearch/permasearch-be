Shortly after the park opened in 2004, the bullpens were reassigned so the Phillies' pitchers used the lower pen and visitors use the upper pen. This was done to give Phillies' pitchers a better view of the game and to protect them from heckling by rowdy fans.[10] However, the team forgot to rewire the bullpen phones after the bullpens were reassigned; so during the first game, the dugout coaches had to communicate with the bullpens by hand signals.
