Homesick James, who recorded and toured with his cousin Elmore,[57] also recorded a rendition titled "Crossroads".[40] Homesick derived his guitar style from Elmore, which music critic Bill Dahl describes as "aggressive, sometimes chaotic slide work".[57] Unlike Elmore, however, he uses most of the lyrics from Johnson's second take, which had been first issued in 1961.[57] The July 23, 1963, recording session produced Homesick's only single for Chicago-based USA Records, "Crossroads" backed with "My Baby's Sweet".[57]
