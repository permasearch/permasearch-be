Crawley Hospital in West Green is operated by West Sussex Primary Care Trust. Some services are provided by the Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust, including a 24-hour Urgent Treatment Centre for semi-life-threatening injuries.[154] The Surrey and Sussex was judged as "weak" by the Healthcare Commission in 2008,[155] however in 2015 both the hospital[156] and the Surrey and Sussex Trust[157] were rated good by the Care Quality Commission.
