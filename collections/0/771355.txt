Two Nationals stars — Scherzer and first baseman Ryan Zimmerman — made franchise history in June. On June 13, Zimmerman hit two home runs off Braves starter R.A. Dickey to tie Vladimir Guerrero for the Montreal–Washington franchise record of 234 home runs,[163] although he did not hit another home run for the remainder of the month and finished June still tied with Guerrero for the record. One start after recording his 2,000th strikeout against the Rangers, Scherzer struck out ten Mets on June 16 to tie Pedro Martínez's franchise mark of five consecutive starts with double-digit strikeouts,[164] and in his next start on June 21, he struck out 11 Marlins to set the franchise record at six.[165] Scherzer was named the National League Pitcher of the Month, posting a 0.99 ERA on the month.[166]
