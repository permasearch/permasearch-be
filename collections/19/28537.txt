The white stork is a large bird. It has a length of 100–115 cm (39–45 in),[b][17] and a standing height of 100–125 cm (39–49 in). The wingspan is 155–215 cm (61–85 in) and its weight is 2.3–4.5 kg (5.1–9.9 lb).[18][19] Like all storks, it has long legs, a long neck and a long straight pointed beak.[13] The sexes are identical in appearance, except that males are larger than females on average.[10] The plumage is mainly white with black flight feathers and wing coverts; the black is caused by the pigment melanin.[20] The breast feathers are long and shaggy forming a ruff which is used in some courtship displays.[21] The irises are dull brown or grey, and the peri-orbital skin is black. The adult has a bright red beak and red legs,[10] the colouration of which is derived from carotenoids in the diet. In parts of Spain, studies have shown that the pigment is based on astaxanthin obtained from an introduced species of crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) and the bright red beak colours show up even in nestlings, in contrast to the duller beaks of young white storks elsewhere.[22]
