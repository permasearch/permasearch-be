A close terrestrial analogy is provided by a tennis ball bouncing off the front of a moving train.  Imagine standing on a train platform, and throwing a ball at 30 km/h toward a train approaching at 50 km/h.  The driver of the train sees the ball approaching at 80 km/h and then departing at 80 km/h after the ball bounces elastically off the front of the train.  Because of the train's motion, however, that departure is at 130 km/h relative to the train platform; the ball has added twice the train's velocity to its own.
