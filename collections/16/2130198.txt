Now consider the full case, when variables exist and are affected by the program commands being executed. Then between different program counter locations, not only does the program counter change, but variables might also change values, due to the commands executed. Consequently, even if we revisit some program command (e.g. in a loop), this doesn't imply the program is in the same state.
