Melbourne summers are notable for occasional days of extreme heat, which have increased in frequency over the past decade.[3] This occurs when the synoptic pattern is conducive to the transportation of very hot air from central Australia over to the south-east corner of the continent. The inland deserts of Australia are amongst the hottest areas on earth, particularly the inland parts of north-west Australia.
