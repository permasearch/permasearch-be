Hans Zimmer composed the film score,[159] emphasizing a challenge not to reuse the themes he established with the Batman character from Christopher Nolan's trilogy.[160] Junkie XL, who provided additional music in Man of Steel, also returned for this film, helping to compose the theme for Batman.[161] Originally, Zimmer enlisted Junkie XL to compose the Batman material, with Zimmer planning to focus solely on the Superman side of the score, but the final Batman theme was written by both composers as a collaboration.[162] Zimmer noted that he had significant trouble in finding a new angle from which to tell the story and after the release of the film, Zimmer announced that he was retired from superhero films.[163] The soundtrack album of the film was released on March 18, 2016 by WaterTower Music.[164]
