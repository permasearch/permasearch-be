In addition to Copper’s 100% conductivity, falling behind only silver and gold in performance, the material is malleable, ductile and responsive to precision tooling. These features coupled with the metal’s natural corrosion resistance to industrial atmospheres make it a commonly used material in custom metal stamping projects. Some copper automotive components include reel to reel terminals, conductive lead frames, grids and wire forms.[96]
