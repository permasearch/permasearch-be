Polyembryony is the phenomenon of two or more embryos developing from a single fertilized egg.[1][2][3] Due to the embryos resulting from the same egg, the embryos are identical to one another, but are genetically diverse from the parents.[1][2] The genetic difference between the offspring and the parents, but the similarity among siblings, are significant distinctions between polyembryony and the process of budding and typical sexual reproduction.[2] Polyembryony can occur in humans, resulting in identical twins, though the process is random and at a low frequency.[1] Polyembryony occurs regularly in many species of vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants.
