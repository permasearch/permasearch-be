In the 1680s, King Charles II determined to bring the New England colonies under a more centralized administration in order to regulate trade more effectively.[10] His efforts were fiercely opposed by the colonists, resulting in the abrogation of their colonial charter by the Crown.[11] Charles' successor James II finalized these efforts in 1686, establishing the Dominion of New England. Dominion rule triggered bitter resentment throughout New England; the enforcement of the unpopular Navigation Acts and the curtailing of local democracy angered the colonists.[12] New Englanders were encouraged, however, by a change of government in England that saw James II effectively abdicate, and a populist uprising overthrew Dominion rule on April 18, 1689.[13][14] Colonial governments reasserted their control in the wake of the revolt, and successive governments made no more attempts to restore the Dominion.[15][16]
