The Pacific Ocean contributes to the frequency of fog by providing atmospheric moisture and by its temperature.  It is also the major source of nuclei for the condensation of moisture from vapor into cloud droplets.  Moisture evaporated from the ocean surface over hundreds, even thousands of miles of the open Pacific is carried to California from various directions.  This water vapor contributes to the development of what is called a marine layer near the surface of the ocean.
