Excavations at Kayatha (around 26Â km from Ujjain) have revealed chalcolithic agricultural settlements dating to around 2000 BCE.[4] Chalcolithic sites have also been discovered at other areas around Ujjain, including Nagda, but excavations at Ujjain itself have not revealed any chalcolithic settlements. H. D. Sankalia theorized that the chalcolithic settlements at Ujjain were probably destroyed by the Iron Age settlers.[5]
