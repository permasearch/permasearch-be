Loudoun was born in England and educated at Ampleforth College in Yorkshire, but emigrated to Jerilderie, New South Wales as a teen, where he was a rice farmer and family man.[3] He was the heir-general of George Plantagenet, the younger brother of Edward IV of England. If Edward IV had been illegitimate  and the crown of England had descended by male-preference primogeniture before 1500, then George (and his heirs) would have been monarchs of England.
