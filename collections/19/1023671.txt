Corner House Research, a Non-Governmental Organisation that ran a Campaign Against Arms Trade, applied for judicial review of the Serious Fraud Office decision to stop investigating BAE Systems plc. The SFO director decided to halt a criminal investigation into alleged bribery in relation to an arms supply contract between BAE Systems plc and the Saudi Arabia authorities, known as the Al-Yamamah arms deal. The UK govt gave arms in return for 600,000 barrels (95,000 cubic metres) of crude oil per day. The first sales were in September 1985, and more recently 72 Eurofighter Typhoons in August 2006. In August 2005 CEO Mike Turner said BAE earned £43bn and could earn £40bn more. In 2010, BAE pleaded guilty to charges in the US of false accounting and making misleading statements. The UK Serious Fraud Office began to investigate. Saudi Arabia had threatened to take action that would damage UK security if the investigation continued. The SFO dropped the investigation.
