Some journalists also criticized the quality of the CGI that was to represent a younger Carrie Fisher in order to portray Princess Leia at an earlier time, as well as its suitability in movie-making.[27][28] Eliana Dockterman of Time wrote that "there was something particularly plastic about this version of the young Carrie Fisher–so smooth and so perfect it couldn't be real – that pulled me out of the moment."[158] Kelly Lawler of USA Today said: "... while Tarkin is merely unnerving, the Leia cameo is so jarring as to take the audience completely out of the film at its most emotional moment. Leia's appearance was meant to help the film end on a hopeful note (quite literally, as 'hope' is her line), but instead it ends on a weird and unsettling one."[159] Michael Cavna of The Washington Post described the facial effect as feeling "distractingly artificial and nearly alien, like a plastered death mask robbed of authentic actorly effect, well beyond the usual artifice of Botox."[160]
