A variety of parasites can affect the lungs, including Toxoplasma gondii, Strongyloides stercoralis, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Plasmodium malariae.[40] These organisms typically enter the body through direct contact with the skin, ingestion, or via an insect vector.[40] Except for Paragonimus westermani, most parasites do not affect specifically the lungs but involve the lungs secondarily to other sites.[40] Some parasites, in particular those belonging to the Ascaris and Strongyloides genera, stimulate a strong eosinophilic reaction, which may result in eosinophilic pneumonia.[40] In other infections, such as malaria, lung involvement is due primarily to cytokine-induced systemic inflammation.[40] In the developed world these infections are most common in people returning from travel or in immigrants.[40] Around the world, these infections are most common in the immunodeficient.[41]
