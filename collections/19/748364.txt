At the launch of his album Cradlesong on June 30, 2009, Rob Thomas told the New York Daily News, "My buddy Adam Shankman, who just directed Miley's movie, called me on the phone the other day and was like, 'You have to write a song for this movie.'... I would definitely write a song for her [Cyrus]."[81] In the end, however, Thomas was unable to contribute music to The Last Song, citing "scheduling problems" as the reason.[82]
