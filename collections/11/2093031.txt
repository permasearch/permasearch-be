Pure anhydrous caffeine is a bitter-tasting, white, odorless powder with a melting point of 235–238 °C.[8][9] Caffeine is moderately soluble in water at room temperature (2 g/100 mL), but very soluble in boiling water (66 g/100 mL).[150] It is also moderately soluble in ethanol (1.5 g/100 mL).[150] It is weakly basic (pKa of conjugate base = ~0.6) requiring strong acid to protonate it.[151] Caffeine does not contain any stereogenic centers[152] and hence is classified as an achiral molecule.[153]
