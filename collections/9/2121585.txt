Five years later, Takatoshi meets with 15-year-old Emi and gives her her sketch. A further ten years later, Takatoshi rescues 5-year-old Emi from a festival fire. The film then cuts to a montage of the film presented from Emi's perspective, i.e. backwards, ending with her and Takatoshi's introduction on February 15, her last day she met him as equals.
