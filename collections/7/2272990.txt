The Mini-14 GB ("government bayonet")[18] models feature either a pistol grip, side folding stock or a standard semi-pistol grip stock, a 20 or 30-round magazine, bayonet lug, threaded barrel, and flash suppressor. The GB models also come with standard rifle stocks. Sales are intended for only the law enforcement, military and private security markets, and can only be found in their Law Enforcement Catalog.[19] However, some have entered the civilian market.[20]
