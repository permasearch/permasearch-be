After several months on the run, including a trip to the Soviet-occupied area to recover his Auschwitz records, Mengele found work near Rosenheim as a farmhand.[62] Worried that his capture would mean a trial and death sentence, he fled Germany on 17 April 1949.[63][64] Assisted by a network of former SS members, Mengele traveled to Genoa, where he obtained a passport under the alias "Helmut Gregor" from the International Committee of the Red Cross. He sailed to Argentina in July.[65] His wife refused to accompany him, and they divorced in 1954.[66]
