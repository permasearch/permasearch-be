Between 2009 to 2015, Google Webmaster Central proposed and then recommended an "AJAX crawling scheme"[22][23] using an initial exclamation mark in fragment identifiers for stateful AJAX pages (#!). Special behavior must be implemented by the SPA site to allow extraction of relevant metadata by the search engine's crawler. For search engines that do not support this URL hash scheme, the hashed URLs of the SPA remain invisible. These "hash-bang" URIs have been considered problematic by a number of writers including Jeni Tennison at the W3C because they make pages inaccessible to those who do not have JavaScript activated in their browser. They also break HTTP referer headers as browsers are not allowed to send the fragment identifier in the Referer header.[24] In 2015, Google deprecated their hash-bang AJAX crawling proposal.[25]
