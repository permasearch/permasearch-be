Medicaid funding has become a major budgetary issue for many states over the last few years, with states, on average, spending 16.8% of state general funds on the program. If the federal match expenditure is also counted, the program, on average, takes up 22% of each state's budget.[72][73] Some 43 million Americans were enrolled in 2004 (19.7 million of them children) at a total cost of $295 billion.[74] In 2008, Medicaid provided health coverage and services to approximately 49 million low-income children, pregnant women, elderly people, and disabled people.[citation needed] Federal Medicaid outlays were estimated to be $204 billion in 2008.[75] In 2011, there were 7.6 million hospital stays billed to Medicaid, representing 15.6 percent (approximately $60.2 billion) of total aggregate inpatient hospital costs in the United States.[76] At $8,000, the mean cost per stay billed to Medicaid was $2,000 less than the average cost for all stays.[77]
