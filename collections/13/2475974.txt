Following the success of the recent Christmas singles, Richard released his first Christmas album Together with Cliff Richard in 1991, however his bid for the UK Christmas No. 1 spot again with "We Should Be Together" was unsuccessful (making No. 10). 1992 saw "I Still Believe in You" (No. 7) released as his Christmas single, while 1993 saw Richard's first new music studio album for over three years released. Simply titled The Album, it debuted at No.1 on the UK album chart. "Peace in Our Time" (No. 8) was the second lead single, followed by "Human Work of Art" (No. 24) and "Healing Love" (No. 19) for Christmas. In 1994, the compilation The Hit List was released, meanwhile in the background, Richard was concentrating on bringing the musical Heathcliff to the stage.
