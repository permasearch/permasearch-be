A mountainous, volcanic island country, Japan has inadequate natural resources to support its growing economy and large population, and therefore exports goods in which it has a comparative advantage such as engineering-oriented, research and development-led industrial products in exchange for the import of raw materials and petroleum. Japan is among the top-three importers for agricultural products in the world next to the European Union and United States in total volume for covering of its own domestic agricultural consumption.[73] Japan is the world's largest single national importer of fish and fishery products.[74][75][76][77][78] Tokyo Metropolitan Central Wholesale Market[79][80] is the largest wholesale market for primary products in Japan, including the renowned Tsukiji fish market.[81][82] Japanese whaling, ostensibly for research purposes, has been sued as illegal under international law.
