The British and French Navies, assisted by the Royal Air Force, began the Dunkirk evacuation of the surrounded Allied forces (27 May – 4 June). Although the Germans, using the new "Blitzkrieg" tactics, clearly had achieved a spectacular tactical victory, it was not yet clear that France would collapse altogether. In the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 and 1871, France had fought on for another four months after the Battle of Sedan, which caused the defeat of its armies on the frontier, and in 1914, it had snatched survival from the jaws of defeat at the First Battle of the Marne.
