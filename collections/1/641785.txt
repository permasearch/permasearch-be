The criticism of this series primarily revolves around whether the events depicted in the story are appropriate for the teenage audience the books attract.[27][28] American author and feminist Naomi Wolf calls the books "corruption with a cute overlay," and she claims that "sex saturates the Gossip Girl books.... This is not the frank sexual exploration found in a Judy Blume novel, but teenage sexuality via Juicy Couture, blasÃ© and entirely commodified."[29]
