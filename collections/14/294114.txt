Though Gore came in second in the electoral vote, he received 547,398 more popular votes than Bush,[46] making him the first person since Grover Cleveland in 1888 to win the popular vote but lose in the Electoral College.[47] Gore failed to win the popular vote in his home state, Tennessee, which both he and his father had represented in the Senate, making him the first major-party presidential candidate to have lost his home state since George McGovern lost South Dakota in 1972. Furthermore, Gore lost West Virginia, a state that had voted Republican only once in the previous six presidential elections,[48] and Bill Clinton's home state of Arkansas, which had voted twice before to elect Gore vice president. A victory in any of these three states would have given Gore enough electoral votes to win the presidency.
