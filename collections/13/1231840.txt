At the first singles workout, the trainers push the players hard - they have a lot of catching up to do after their dismal performance on the scale last week. Toma is really upset about his +1 and knows if he falls below the Yellow Line, the others won't hesitate to vote him out. Rob is worried that with Scott gone, the former Team White members have a voting block of five, which gives them all the power. He knows it's paramount that he stay above the yellow line because old alliances don't die. Jessie realizes Rob's biggest issue is trust and encourages Rob to not let the games that go on at the ranch get in the way of the bigger picture. "For you, showing up here is do or die," he says, adding that the other contestants have reached weights where they could go home and be okay. "One hundred percent. I was 500 pounds." Rob responds. "I was dead before I was 30."
