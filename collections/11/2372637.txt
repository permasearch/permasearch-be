The daily insulin dose was gradually increased to 100â€“150 units until comas were produced, at which point the dose would be levelled out.[1] Occasionally doses of up to 450 units were used.[6] After about 50 or 60 comas, or earlier if the psychiatrist thought that maximum benefit had been achieved, the dose of insulin was rapidly reduced before treatment was stopped.[5][7] Courses of up to 2 years have been documented.[7]
