The tomb appears to be a hermetically sealed space roughly the size of a football pitch (c. 100 Ã— 75 m).[20][21] The tomb remains unopened, possibly due to concerns over preservation of its artifacts.[20] For example, after the excavation of the Terracotta Army, the painted surface present on some terracotta figures began to flake and fade.[22] The lacquer covering the paint can curl in fifteen seconds once exposed to Xi'an's dry air and can flake off in just four minutes.[23]
