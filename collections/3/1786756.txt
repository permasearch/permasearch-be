The group won a recording deal with the "It's A Natural" record label, a subsidiary of Jubilee Records, and changed their name to The Orioles in honor of the state bird of Maryland and in emulation of another popular group, The Ravens.  In July 1948, they recorded Chessler's song "It's Too Soon To Know", with Sonny Til taking lead vocals.  The record reportedly sold 30,000 copies in its first week, rising to #1 on the national R&B charts in November 1948, and leading to cover versions by artists such as the Ravens, Ella Fitzgerald and Dinah Washington.  It was also one of the first "race" songs to cross over into mainstream markets, reaching # 13 on the pop charts.
