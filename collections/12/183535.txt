One anecdote that has been told to illustrate the intimacy of Churchill and Roosevelt's bond alleges that once, while he hosting Churchill at the White House, Roosevelt stopped by the bedroom in which the Prime Minister was staying to converse with the him. Churchill answered his door in a state of nudity, remarking, "You see, Mr. President, I have nothing to hide from you." The president is said to have taken this in good-humor, later joking with an aide that Churchill was, "pink and white all over."[47]
