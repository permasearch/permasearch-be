In those with poor tissue perfusion, boluses of isotonic crystalloid solution should be given.[8] In children with more than 10–20% TBSA burns, and adults with more than 15% TBSA burns, formal fluid resuscitation and monitoring should follow.[8][47][48] This should be begun pre-hospital if possible in those with burns greater than 25% TBSA.[47] The Parkland formula can help determine the volume of intravenous fluids required over the first 24 hours. The formula is based on the affected individual's TBSA and weight. Half of the fluid is administered over the first 8 hours, and the remainder over the following 16 hours. The time is calculated from when the burn occurred, and not from the time that fluid resuscitation began. Children require additional maintenance fluid that includes glucose.[14] Additionally, those with inhalation injuries require more fluid.[49] While inadequate fluid resuscitation may cause problems, over-resuscitation can also be detrimental.[50] The formulas are only a guide, with infusions ideally tailored to a urinary output of >30 mL/h in adults or >1mL/kg in children and mean arterial pressure greater than 60 mmHg.[14]
