Regardless of the model/region, the microconsole included 30 built-in games in all regions. Games that originally had different titles in the PAL regions now use their respective American monikers, such as Ninja Gaiden (originally Shadow Warriors) and Super C (originally Probotector II: Return of the Evil Forces). From the 30 included titles, 22 are common between all regions, while the eight remaining ones are exclusive to either Japan or North America/PAL region respectively.[37][9]
