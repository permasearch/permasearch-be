Apollo 17 is the most recent manned Moon landing and was the last time humans travelled beyond low Earth orbit.[3][4] It was also the first mission to be commanded by a person with no background as a test pilot, and the first to have no one on board who had been a test pilot; X-15 test pilot Joe Engle lost the lunar module pilot assignment to Schmitt, a scientist.[5] The mission broke several records: the longest moon landing, longest total extravehicular activities (moonwalks),[6] largest lunar sample, and longest time in lunar orbit.[7]
