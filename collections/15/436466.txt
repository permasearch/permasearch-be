Chomsky wrote Syntactic Structures when he was still an unknown scholar.[note 4] Mouton, a small Dutch publisher, released the book.[note 5] Still, this dense technical work was well received in the beginning. It was even considered a welcome addition[11] to the existing tradition of language study.[note 6] Yet, established older linguists soon began criticizing it for its bold new views.[note 7] Unlike them, younger linguists were eager to adopt Chomsky's way of doing research.[note 8] And so linguistics changed course in the second half of the 20th century. It became normal to build more formal theories with syntax at their center. This way of study valued language's place in the mind over language behavior.[note 9]
