This poem chronicles the misadventure of Strephon as he explores his mistress’s vacant dressing room. Beginning with an ideal image of his lover he looks through the contents of her room, but encounters only objects that repulse him. He finds sweaty smocks, dirt-filled combs, oily cloths, grimy towels, snot encrusted handkerchiefs, jars of spit, cosmetics derived from dog intestines, and a mucky, rancid clothes chest. Beholding this filth, culminating in the discovery of her chamber pot, he is slapped with the reality that Celia (the name "Celia" means "heavenly") is not a “goddess,” but as disgustingly human as he is, as shown in line 118: “Oh! Celia, Celia, Celia shits!”
