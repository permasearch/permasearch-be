The first visible institution to run into trouble in the United States was the Southern Californiaâ€“based IndyMac, a spin-off of Countrywide Financial. Before its failure, IndyMac Bank was the largest savings and loan association in the Los Angeles market and the seventh largest mortgage originator in the United States.[211] The failure of IndyMac Bank on July 11, 2008, was the fourth largest bank failure in United States history up until the crisis precipitated even larger failures,[212] and the second largest failure of a regulated thrift.[213] IndyMac Bank's parent corporation was IndyMac Bancorp until the FDIC seized IndyMac Bank.[214] IndyMac Bancorp filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in July 2008.[214]
