New Jersey was the first state to adopt an "enabling" corporate law, with the goal of attracting more business to the state,[27] in 1896. In 1899, Delaware followed New Jersey's lead with the enactment of an enabling corporate statute, but Delaware only became the leading corporate state after the enabling provisions of the 1896 New Jersey corporate law were repealed in 1913.[26]
