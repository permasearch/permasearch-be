Dieselisation took place largely because of the tremendous reduction in operating costs it allowed. Steam locomotives require large pools of labour to clean, load, maintain and run. They also require extensive service, coaling and watering facilities. This was their biggest inferior measure as compared to the diesel locomotive in the number of ton-miles or passenger traffic miles either could run.  Diesels could and did have a significantly higher initial price per unit-horsepower delivered.  However, their far greater range between fueling stops, the absence of water stops, and the much higher unit availability between inspection repair and maintenance stops, were orders of magnitude better than steam.  Diesels simply required significantly less time and labour to operate and maintain.[citation needed]  Initially, diesel locomotives were less powerful than the largest steam locomotives, limiting train sizes or speeds, although the gap was closed somewhat by the introduction of larger diesel-electric locomotives such as the Deltic class.  Electric locomotives can be vastly more powerful than either steam or diesel ones.
