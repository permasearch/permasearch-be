On 11 September 2010, Modrić scored his first goal of the 2010–11 season in a 1–1 away draw at West Bromwich Albion.[62] On 28 November, in a home match against Liverpool, Modrić scored one goal that was later credited as an own goal by Liverpool's defender. After a draw against Manchester United at White Hart Lane in January 2011, Redknapp praised Modrić, saying, "He was unbelievable. Magnificent. He's an amazing footballer, the little man takes the ball in the tightest areas with people around him, wriggling out of situations. He could play in any team in the world."[63] Modrić also scored in Tottenham's 3–2 victory over Stoke City on 9 April,[64] and converted a penalty at Anfield on 15 May in a 2–0 victory over Liverpool.[65]
