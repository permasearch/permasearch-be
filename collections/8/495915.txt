Interpretations of Duel often focus on the symbolism of Mann and the truck. Some critics follow Spielberg's own interpretation of the story as an indictment against the mechanization of life, both by literal machines and by social regimentation.[19] The theme of gender performativity in Mann's quest to prove his manhood is another interpretation several observers have noted.[19][20] The film has been placed at #66 on The 100 Scariest Movie Moments on Bravo.
