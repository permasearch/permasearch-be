The event at Rajpath established two Guinness world records awarded to the Ministry of AYUSH and received by AYUSH minister Shripad Yesso Naik. The two records were for the largest yoga class, featuring 35,985 people,[16] and for the largest number of participating nationalities (84 nations).[17] In San Francisco, 5,000 participants gathered in the Marina Green park to practice yoga.[18]
