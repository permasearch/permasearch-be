In the biblical narrative, Hophni and Phinehas are criticised for engaging in illicit behaviour, such as appropriating the best portion of sacrifices for themselves, and having sexual relations with the sanctuary's serving women. They are described as "sons of Belial" in (1 Samuel 2:12) KJV, "corrupt" in the New King James Version, or "scoundrels" in the NIV. Their misdeeds provoked the wrath of Yahweh and led to a divine curse being put on the house of Eli, and they subsequently both died on the same day, when Israel was defeated by the Philistines at the Battle of Aphek near Eben-ezer; the news of this defeat then led to Eli's death (1 Samuel 4:17-18). On hearing of the deaths of Eli and Phinehas, and of the capture of the ark, Phinehas' wife gave birth to a son that she named Ichabod, and then she herself died (1 Samuel 4:19-22).
