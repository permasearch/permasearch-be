In 1990, Dayton-Hudson acquired Marshall Field's and opened its first Target Greatland store in Apple Valley, Minnesota. It started the Everyday Hero clothing specialty store with two locations in Minneapolis in 1992,[10] although they were closed in 1997.[14] In 1993, the company created a chain of four closeout stores called Smarts for liquidating clearance merchandise, which was shuttered in 1996.[15] In 1995, the first SuperTarget hypermarket opened in Omaha, Nebraska and the Target Guest Card, the discount retail industry's first store credit card, was launched.[5] J. C. Penney offered to buy out Dayton-Hudson for $6.82 billion in 1996, an offer that most analysts had considered as insufficiently valuing the company.[5][16] Target remained the company's main area of growth while the department store subsidiaries underperformed.[17] The middle scale Mervyn's department store chain consisted of 300 units in 16 states, while the upscale department stores division operated 26 Marshall Field's, 22 Hudson's, and 19 Dayton's stores.[5] In an effort to turn the departments around, Mervyn's and Marshall Field's closed several locations.[5]
