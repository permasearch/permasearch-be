Although Ringo Starr received sole writing credit for "It Don't Come Easy", author Bruce Spizer writes that he had "substantial, but uncredited, assistance from Harrison".[1] Starr subsequently acknowledged that Harrison had helped write it.[2] In an episode of VH1 Storytellers (Season 3, Episode 4) in 1998, right before performing the song, Starr said: "I wrote this song with the one and only George Harrison." He went on to say that Harrison suggested the last verse be about God. When Starr protested, Harrison suggested Hare Krishna. Starr protested again, and Harrison suggested "peace" as a topic, and they settled on that.
