Shel Silverstein's influence on poetry has been said to have the ability to “Convince children that poetry is neither difficult nor threatening,” he was also able to “understand common childhood thoughts and anxieties.” and his poem, Where the Sidewalk Ends, is no different. Its easy to read, silly vocabulary in combination with the underlying idea that children in fact have the secret to "where the sidewalk ends" makes it fun for children to read. Also, Silverstein had a special insight into the mind of a child, and understood the children's way of thinking relaying that into "Where the Sidewalk Ends." Where the Sidewalk Ends has become a children's poetry launch point, and its lighthearted, engaging style has propelled children to dive into more of Silverstein's poetry and in some cases more poetry in general. Where the Sidewalk Ends, is now a children's poetry classic, and has shaped much of the modern children's poetry that is published today.
