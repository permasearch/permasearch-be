During the September 11, 2001 attacks, two of the four airliners hijacked and crashed by al-Qaeda members were United aircraft. United Airlines Flight 175 was flown into the south World Trade Center tower. United Airlines Flight 93 crashed in a field in Pennsylvania after the passengers fought back against the hijackers. An airline industry downturn resulted. Economic problems, skyrocketing oil prices, and higher labor costs caused United to lose US$2.14 billion in 2001. That same year, United applied for a US$1.5 billion loan guarantee from the federal Air Transportation Stabilization Board established in the wake of the September 11 attacks.[citation needed] United filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on December 9, 2002.[44] United then furloughed thousands of workers, closed its U.S. city ticket offices, cancelled several existing and planned routes, downsized its Miami operations, and closed some maintenance bases.[citation needed] The carrier also negotiated labor cuts with employees,[44] suppliers, and contractors. United terminated feeder contracts with United Express carriers Atlantic Coast Airlines and Air Wisconsin.[citation needed] In 2005, United cancelled its pension plan in the largest such default in U.S. corporate history.[44] On September 7, 2005, United announced that it had raised US$3 billion in financing to exit bankruptcy and filed its Plan of Reorganization. United emerged from bankruptcy on February 1, 2006.[44]
