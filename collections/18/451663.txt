A potentially adverse effect of progressive tax schedules is that they may reduce the incentives for educational attainment.[16][37][42] By reducing the after-tax income of highly educated workers, progressive taxes can reduce the incentives for citizens to attain education, thereby lowering the overall level of human capital in an economy.[16][37][42] However, this effect can be mitigated by an education subsidy funded by the progressive tax.[43] Theoretically, public support for government spending on higher education increases when taxation is progressive, especially when income distribution is unequal.[44]
