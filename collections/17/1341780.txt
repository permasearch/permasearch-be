U2 hired Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno to produce the album, based on the duo's prior work with the band on The Unforgettable Fire and The Joshua Tree.[18] Lanois was principal producer, with Mark "Flood" Ellis as engineer.[11] Eno took on an assisting role, working with the group in the studio for a week at a time to review their songs before leaving for a month or two.[11][19] Eno said his role was "to come in and erase anything that sounded too much like U2".[20] By distancing himself from the work, he believed he provided the band with a fresh perspective on their material each time he rejoined them.[21] As he explained, "I would deliberately not listen to the stuff in between visits, so I could go in cold".[22] Since U2 wanted the record to be harder-hitting and live-sounding, Lanois "push[ed] the performance aspect very hard, often to the point of recklessness".[23] The Lanois–Eno team used lateral thinking and a philosophical approach—popularised by Eno's Oblique Strategies—that contrasted with the direct and retro style of Rattle and Hum producer Jimmy Iovine.[24]
