When Haruna takes her dog, Maron, out for a walk she feels that someone is stalking her. She finds Oshizu on her break from Mikado-sensei's clinic, and asks for help. Lala helps Haruna by making a machine that switches their bodies. Using the bait trick, Lala and Oshizu defeat the stalker. The stalker turns out to be a female dog-like alien who is actually in love with Maron, though Oshizu beats her up anyway as she is terrified of dogs.
