Weber's ten majors place him first all-time along with the legendary Earl Anthony, who also has ten. Weber has rolled 80 perfect 300 games in PBA competition through 2016. His five U.S. Open titles are the most of any bowler in PBA history.[16] Weber is one of six PBA players to have earned the career PBA Triple Crown. Upon winning the 2013 Tournament of Champions title, he became the first bowler to win all three jewels of the Triple Crown at least twice in a career (five U.S. Open titles, two PBA World Championship titles, and two wins in the Tournament of Champions).[17] He is also the oldest winner of the U.S. Open (49) and Tournament of Champions (50). His other major win was in the Touring Players Championship, which has only recently become a PBA major again. The only major that has eluded him to this point is the USBC Masters.
