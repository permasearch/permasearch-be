Speaking to film music fan site Maintitles, Arnold said he wanted "You Know My Name" to act as a substitute for the James Bond theme, to represent Bond's immaturity. The song's main notes are played throughout the film, and the classic theme only plays during the end credits to signal the end of his character arc.[9] Arnold felt the song should tie closer to the score, and have the "DNA of the James Bond music".[7] The musical arrangement tried to create "the right blend of rock aggression and sophisticated instrumentation",[10] with Cornell describing it as "more uptempo and a little more aggressive than any other Bond theme has been, maybe since Paul McCartney ['s 'Live and Let Die']".[11]
