The dates of appointment and departure may fall outside the club's period in the Premier League, for example, Ron Atkinson was appointed as Aston Villa manager in 1991 (before the Premier League was formed in 1992) and remained in his position through the Premier League's establishment. Similarly, Wolverhampton Wanderers' first spell in the Premier League lasted for only one season (2003â€“04) but manager Dave Jones remained in his position until November 2004. Chris Coleman is the youngest manager in Premier League history, while Bob Bradley is the first American to manage a Premier League club.
