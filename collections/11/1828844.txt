In the films, the uncertainty of Jamie’s age stems from a discrepancy between Halloween 4 and 5. In the former film, set in late October 1988, Jamie's foster sister, Rachel Carruthers (Ellie Cornell) wonders why Jamie continues staying up so late. She asks, "You are going for a record here? The Seven-Year-Old Insomniacs' Hall of Fame?", suggesting that she is born in 1981. The latter film is set one year later in late October 1989. Rachel and Jamie’s adolescent friend Tina Williams (Wendy Kaplan) exclaims to Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) that "Jamie’s a nine-year-old girl!"
