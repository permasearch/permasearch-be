For the roles of Richard K. Straker and the vampire Kurt Barlow, James Mason and Reggie Nalder had been on producer Richard Kobritz's "wish list".[2] Kobritz sent Mason a copy of the script, who loved the part and his wife, Clarissa Kaye-Mason, was also cast as Marjorie Glick.[1] However, Nalder was less impressed. "The makeup and contact lenses were painful but I got used to them. I liked the money best of all."[3]
