The Great Blizzard of 1888 helped demonstrate the benefits of an underground transportation system.[31] A plan for the construction of the subway was approved in 1894, and construction began in 1900.[32] The first underground line of the subway opened on October 27, 1904, almost 36 years after the opening of the first elevated line in New York City, which became the IRT Ninth Avenue Line.[33][34][35] The fare was $0.05[36] and on the first day the trains carried over 150,000 passengers.[37] The oldest structure still in use opened in 1885 as part of the BMT Lexington Avenue Line in Brooklyn[38][39][40][41][42] and is now part of the BMT Jamaica Line.[43] The oldest right-of-way, which is part of the BMT West End Line near Coney Island Creek, was in use in 1864 as a steam railroad called the Brooklyn, Bath and Coney Island Rail Road.[44][45][46]
