Post Office branches, along with the Royal Mail delivery service, were formerly part of the General Post Office and later the Post Office corporation. Post Office Counters Ltd was created as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Post Office corporation in 1986. After the Post Office corporation was renamed Royal Mail Group in 2001, Post Office Counters Ltd became Post Office Ltd.[3]
