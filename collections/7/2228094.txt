Section 13 of the Data Protection Act provides that the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner "shall encourage trade associations and other bodies representing categories of data controllers to prepare codes of practice to be complied with by those categories in dealing with personal data." The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner then formally approves such codes of practice, if such a code provides adequate data protection for individuals. The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner will then encourage its use in the sector concerned. The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner may also draw up such a code of practice on its own initiative.
