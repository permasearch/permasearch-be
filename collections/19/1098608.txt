According to Overmans there are no reliable figures to breakout the national origin for the figure of 900,000 men of German ancestry conscripted into the Waffen-SS[39] Overmans maintains that records of the Deutsche Dienststelle (WASt) surveyed only persons of German ancestry  "deutsche nach Abstammung"[39]  However Polish sources maintain that during the war the Germans forcibly conscripted ethnic Poles into the German military.  Professor Ryszard Kaczmarek of the University of Silesia in Katowice, author of a monograph titled Polacy w Wehrmachcie ("Poles in the Wehrmacht") noted that many Polish citizens in the Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany were forcibly conscripted in Upper Silesia and in Pomerania. They were declared citizens of the Third Reich by law and therefore subject to drumhead court-martial in case of draft evasion.[40]  A 1958 West German estimate put the military war dead of ethnic German(deutschen Bev√∂lkerung) foreign nationals from east-central Europe in the German Armed Forces at 432,000 (Blatic States 15,000, Poland 108,000, Czechoslovakia 180,000, Hungary 32,000, Yugoslavia 40,000 and Romania 35,000)[41]
