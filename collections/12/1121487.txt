Of the follower characteristics, competence, agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, locus of control, and positive affectivity are all positively correlated with LMX.[10] Negative affectivity and neuroticism are negatively correlated with LMX.[10] All of the listed leader characteristics are positively correlated with LMX.[10] With the exception of assertiveness, all of the interpersonal relationship variable correlated positively with LMX.[10] In an experiment run by Dulebohn et al. that measured the effects of various characteristics on LMX and its outcomes, leader behaviors and perceptions explained most of the variance.[10] This study suggests that it is up to the leader to form the relationships necessary for successful implementation of LMX.
