The show periodically conducts audience giveaways.[10] The twelfth season of The View was heavily focused on the events related to the 2008 United States presidential election.[11] Season 13 introduced the addition of male guest co-hosts, the first season in the show's history to do so; among them were Joe Scarborough, Bryant Gumbel, Tom Bergeron, and D. L. Hughley.[12] Male personalities have since begun serving as guest co-hosts more frequently, specifically on Fridays, dubbed "Guy Day Friday."[13] In 2016, the show began focusing more on politics leading to the 2016 United States presidential election.[14]
