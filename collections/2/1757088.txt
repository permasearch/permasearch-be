On May 7, 2010, the band posted a batch of photos during recording sessions for Vices & Virtues.[19] All guitars and bass for the album were completed by early July,[20] and, by the end of the month, Urie confirmed that recording of the album was complete and mixing would follow soon.[21] Near the end of the writing process, the band looked back upon the lyrics and noticed that "some of the motion was pining for something, or some of it was vanity, or some of it touched on subversion or overthrowing of somebody or manipulation." Urie likened it to the seven deadly sins, and, after research, settled on the title Vices & Virtues. "In the Biblical sense, there's all that stuff and then there’s just morals that we live by every day and human behavior", Urie said. "I guess this record was really a study in human behavior—mostly for us personally what we had been going through, and noticing all of that."[13]
