Having no response from Eaton,[106] Smith joined his partners and left St. Louis to trade in Santa Fe on April 10, 1831.[110] Smith was leading the caravan on the Santa Fe Trail on May 27, 1831, when he left the group to scout for water near the Lower Spring on the Cimmaron River in present-day southwest Kansas.[111] He never returned to the group. The remainder of the party proceeded on to Santa Fe hoping Smith would meet up with them, but he never did. They arrived in Santa Fe on July 4, 1831, and shortly thereafter members of the party discovered a comanchero with some of Smith's personal belongings.[112] It was relayed that Smith had encountered and communicated with a group of comancheros just prior to his approaching a group of Comanche.[113] Smith tried to negotiate with the Comanche, but they surrounded him in preparation for attack.[112]
