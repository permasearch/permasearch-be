Jimmy tries to make amends with Chuck in the season 3 finale, "Lantern", but Chuck coldly cuts ties with Jimmy. After forcing Jimmy away, Chuck's EHS symptoms begin to re-emerge, and he becomes obsessed with disabling all electronic devices in his home to the point of tearing walls open to remove the wiring. He eventually reaches a breaking point and knocks the gas lantern over, setting fire to his house, while he is still inside. After this scene there was much speculation as to what happened to Chuck after the fire started. Showrunner Peter Gould said, "I don't want to define anything more than what's on screen".[41] Michael McKean, who played Chuck, told Vulture: "I got a call on my cell from Peter [and] Vince [Gilligan]. I said, 'If this is the death call, I'm going to pull over.' And that's what I did. I pulled into the parking lot of the bookstore and I called them back and they told me what they had planned. They told me they had laughed about what I had said, but they had to deliver it." When asked if his character was dead, McKean said, "I am. I know they want to bring me in for some flashbacks this coming season, but that's kind of beside the point."[42]
