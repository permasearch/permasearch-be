Bed sizes vary considerably around the world, with most countries having their own standards and terminology. While the "double" size appears to be standard among English speaking countries, based on the imperial measurement of 4 ft 6 in by 6 ft 3 in (137 cm x 190 cm), the sizes for other bed types tend to vary. The mainland European sizes differ, not merely because of the use of the metric system.[9]
