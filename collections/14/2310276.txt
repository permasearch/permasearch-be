Clear Sky is a light gray tom with ice blue eyes, the founder of SkyClan, comes from the Tribe of Rushing Water. Kit of Quiet Rain, brother of Gray Wing, Jagged Peak and Fluttering Bird. Mate of Bright Stream, Storm and Star Flower, father of Thunder(star), Dew Petal, Flower Foot and. He chose to follow the Sun Trail when cats were casting stones. He brought several cats to follow his group, choosing the forest as their place to set camp. He's also the creator of borders, the first cat to establish it. After the deaths of Fluttering Bird, Bright Stream and Storm, he went so depressed, and thought about never let his cats went dying like they do, so he set borders, and drove the cats who crossed the borders away. However, he decided to move his borders for a bigger territory for hunting and more prey to fill their bellies. Near the end of "The Sun Trail", he asked Gray Wing to take Thunder away, because he thought that he couldn't hold the responsibilities that a father should do. After he told this, he and Gray Wing declared the end of their brotherhood. He also kicked Jagged Peak out of his group because he broke his leg. Soon a fire broke out in his group, so he moved to the moor. Thunder joined his group, but later left because he thought his father's methods were too extreme. Soon, the hostility between Gray Wing and him went too far, and a fierce battle broke out. During the battle, Clear Sky killed his old friend Rainswept Flower because she shouted at him for being greedy. He responded with, "I'm not greedy, I'm just strong." He also fought Gray Wing, shouting at him to give in. Gray wing rejected, and challenged him to kill him. Clear Sky finally realised that he had gone too far, and announced that the battle was over. He met the spirit cats, and Storm asked him to stop bossing other cats around. He agreed, and rebuilt the brotherhood with Gray Wing. He then returned to his territory.
