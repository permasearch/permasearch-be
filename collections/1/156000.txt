Modern mandolinists such as Avi Avital and Joseph Brent use instruments customized, either by the luthier's choice or at the request of player.[97][95] Joseph Brent's mandolin, made by Brian Dean also uses what Brent calls a false back.[98] Brent's mandolin was the luthier's solution to Brent's request for a loud mandolin in which the wood was clearly audible, with less metallic sound from the strings.[95] The type used by Avital is variation of the flatback, with a double top that encloses a resonating chamber, sound holes on the side, and a convex back.[99] It is made by one manufacturer in Israel, luthier Arik Kerman.[100] Other players of Kerman mandolins include Alon Sariel,[101][102] Jacob Reuven,[100] and Tom Cohen.[103]
