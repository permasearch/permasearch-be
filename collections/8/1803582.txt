Womack describes McCartney's "Eleanor Rigby" as a "narrative about the perils of loneliness".[153] The story involves the title character, who is an ageing spinster, and a lonely priest named Father McKenzie who writes "sermon[s] that no one will hear".[153] He presides over Rigby's funeral and acknowledges that despite his efforts, "no one was saved".[154] The first McCartney composition to depart from the themes of a standard love song,[155] its lyrics were the product of a group effort, with Harrison, Starr and Lennon all contributing.[156][nb 11] While Lennon and Harrison supplied harmonies beside McCartney's lead vocal, no Beatle played on the recording;[158] instead, Martin arranged the track for a string octet,[159] drawing inspiration from Bernard Herrmann's 1960 film score for Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho.[160] In Riley's opinion, "the corruption of 'Taxman' and the utter finality of Eleanor's fate makes the world of Revolver more ominous than any other pair of opening songs could."[161]
