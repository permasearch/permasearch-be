Trails of Cold Steel III debuted as the best selling game in its week of release. According to Media Create, the game sold 87,261 units.[14] This was a significant drop from the 151,781 units Cold Steel II had sold in its first week.[15] Media Create attributed this decline to the lack of a PlayStation Vita version.[16] Despite this, Dengeki's sales reports still estimated that approximately 80% of the game's physical stock was sold at launch,[17] and Falcom announced that the title had the highest digital game sales in the series as well.[18]
