Terra (テラ, Tera) is an original character created by Tetsuya Nomura who appears as one of the three protagonists of Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep. He is a Keyblade wielder raised and trained by Master Eraqus alongside Aqua and Ventus, developing a strong sibling-like bond and sharing his dream of becoming a Keyblade Master with them. During the exam to obtain the Mark of Mastery, Master Xehanort manipulates the trials to stimulate the darkness that resides inside of Terra. Terra becomes troubled upon learning that the darkness in his heart is too strong, for which he is denied the Mark of Mastery.[38] He is thus easily manipulated by Master Xehanort's encouragements to embrace and channel his darkness into power,[39] This, in turn, causes him to succumb to the darkness and become possessed by Xehanort. His fate remains unknown as Xemnas and Ansem's destruction brought back Master Xehanort instead of his possessed self.
