Determined to do whatever it takes to win, Hicks will often ram other cars or use the PIT maneuver in an attempt to cause racing incidents for his own benefit. He despises and mocks McQueen, adopting the nickname Thunder which McQueen previously used as a put-down (McQueen: "Because thunder always comes after 'lightning'"). Hicks is also equally antagonistic towards The King, having come 2nd place to The King his entire career. While McQueen is presumed missing, Hicks tries to take away McQueen's fans and increase his fame.
