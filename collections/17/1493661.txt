Tom opens his pizzeria and with Lynette's help, gets it ready for the grand opening, overcoming a few hitches along the way. He then tries organising a surprise for their 9th wedding anniversary but it goes wrong, leaving Lynette out in the woods at night and rushes to meet her. A little while later, Tom's back is injured and he is confined to bed rest so Lynette hires a new chef, Rick, and Mrs McCluskey to look after Tom and the children when she's at work. One night, Tom and the kids come to the pizzeria to surprise her, where Kayla sees chemistry between Lynette and Rick and tells Tom. So Tom suggests that he returns to work and they fire Rick but Lynette is not keen. After Lynette and Rick are locked in the freezer when the restaurant is robbed, they cuddle to keep warm but Tom sees the CCTV tape and confronts Rick, telling him that although his marriage to Lynette is shaky, it is rock solid and Rick would never break it up. Tom asks Rick to quit but he refuses, claiming Lynette "doesn't want him gone". Rick later tells Lynette about his lunch with Tom and his feelings for her and tries to get her to admit her feelings for him but Lynette refuses and fires him.
