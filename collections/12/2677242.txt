Mild detergent and ethanol rinsing with tap water is used to wipe off the outer layer of the cuvette. Acid and alkaline are not used due to their corrosive effects on glass, and acetone is avoided when dealing with plastic cuvettes. Wiping the container dry with a soft, low-lint cloth avoids scratching the surface of the cuvette. In case the cuvette needs incubation for various experiments, care must be taken to avoid raising the temperature above permissible levels for the material.
