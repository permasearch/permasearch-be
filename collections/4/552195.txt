The rest of the chapter focuses on "standard-based reform" and the small school initiative (see Deborah Meier, The power of their ideas: Lessons for America from a small school in Harlem) in relation to school segregation.   Kozol argues that the "standards-based reform" is an effort to address the scoring gap between high and low socio-economic schools through the use of positive thinking and sheer willpower.   This strategy is shown to be occasionally successful in the extreme short term, but ultimately unsuccessful in the long run.  In other words, scores would often improve for the particular test being studied for, but the competency of the students did not improve.   As for the small school initiative, Kozol is generally supportive of the idea but is critical when it amounts to many smaller just as segregated learning institutions around the nation.
