The Articles of Confederation created a Union of states, albeit a loose one. The confederation's central government was a unicameral Congress with legislative and executive function, and was composed of delegates from each state in the Union. Congress received only those powers which the states had previously (during the Revolutionary Era) recognized as belonging to king and parliament.[21] Each state had one vote in Congress, regardless of its size or population, and any act of Congress required the votes of nine of the 13 states to pass;[22] any decision to amend the Articles required the unanimous consent of the states. Each state's legislature appointed multiple members to its delegation, allowing delegates to return their homes without leaving their state unrepresented.[23] Under the Articles, states were forbidden from negotiating with other nations or maintaining a military without Congress's consent, but the Articles, designed to preserve the independence and sovereignty of the states, reserved almost all other powers to the states.[24] Congress lacked the power to raise revenue, and incapable of enforcing its own legislation and instructions. As such, Congress was heavily reliant on the compliance and support of the states.[25]
