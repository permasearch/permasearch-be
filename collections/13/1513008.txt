Halep served first in the second set and held to 30, then Wozniacki held to love. In the next game, Halep saved four break points to claim a 2–1 lead. The next 3 games would see no break points, and at 3–3, Halep held serve, broke and won the second set after saving three break points when serving for the set, winning it 6–3. The match score was now tied at one set apiece, meaning a third set would be required to decide the title.[4]
