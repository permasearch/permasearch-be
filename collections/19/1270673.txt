Another method for increasing absorption through the ileum is to ingest a Cbl complex to which IF is already bound. The lack of intrinsic factor produced by the patient's body can be supplemented by using synthetic human IF produced from pea plant recombinants.[58] However, in cases where IF-antibodies are the reason for malabsorption across the ileum, this treatment would be ineffective.
