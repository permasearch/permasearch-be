Inside the stoma, the hyphae tips flatten out to form structures known as appressoria that lock to the cell walls.[11] It is thought that the whole process is mediated by a mechano-sensitive calcium ion channel, located within the germ tube tip, which produces electric currents that stretch the cell membranes, changing gene expression and forming the appresorium.[12]
