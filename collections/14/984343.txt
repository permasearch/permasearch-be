Insufficient transfusion efficacy can result from red blood cell (RBC) blood product units damaged by so-called storage lesionâ€”a set of biochemical and biomechanical changes which occur during storage. With red cells, this can decrease viability and ability for tissue oxygenation.[21] Although some of the biochemical changes are reversible after the blood is transfused,[22] the biomechanical changes are less so,[23] and rejuvenation products are not yet able to adequately reverse this phenomenon.[24]
