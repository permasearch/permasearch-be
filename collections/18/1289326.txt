Mito (ミト) is Gon's aunt who raised him and does not want him to become a Hunter. Although she never told Gon that Ging was a Hunter, he grew up believing both his parents died in an accident, the boy learned about it from Kite three years prior to the series.[ch. 1] She later reveals to Gon that Ging returned with an infant Gon asking their grandmother to take care of him for a while, but Mito felt him unfit to parent and gained custody of Gon.[ch. 65] However, in the 1999 version of the anime and novelization, Mito is made into the sister of Gon's mother, making Ging her brother-in-law. Mito does not want Gon to become a Hunter who does not care about his family like his father. As such, she fights and wins for custody over Gon. However, now that Gon has left, she tries her best to support him in his journey.
