For non-mailing purposes (other than payment of property taxes, when parcel numbers are used), an individual property is identified on a geographical-location pattern (a fictitious example follows):  Sealion 5 NW Sea Otter.  In this example, the property is the 5th house on Sealion Street, northwest of Sea Otter Street.  Given Carmel's geographic orientation, this is the 5th house on the side of Sealion St. closer to the Pacific Ocean.
