The sperm whale has the longest intestinal system in the world,[65] exceeding 300 m in larger specimens.[66][67] Similar to ruminants the sperm whale has a four-chambered stomach.  The first secretes no gastric juices and has very thick muscular walls to crush the food (since whales cannot chew) and resist the claw and sucker attacks of swallowed squid. The second chamber is larger and is where digestion takes place. Undigested squid beaks accumulate in the second chamber â€“ as many as 18,000 have been found in some dissected specimens.[66][68][69] Most squid beaks are vomited by the whale, but some occasionally make it to the hindgut.  Such beaks precipitate the formation of ambergris.[69]
