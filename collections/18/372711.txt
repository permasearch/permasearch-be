Neville Longbottom is a pure-blood Gryffindor student in Harry's year, described as round-faced and "short and plump and blond".[4] His parents, Frank and Alice Longbottom, were prominent Aurors and Order of the Phoenix members until they were tortured into insanity, through the use of the cruciatus curse, by a group of Death Eaters led by Bellatrix Lestrange. Neville was subsequently raised by his paternal grandmother, Augusta. Throughout the series, he is often portrayed as a bumbling, disorganised character and a rather mediocre student, though he is highly gifted at Herbology. Neville plays a minor role in the first four books, but Rowling wanted him to perform an act of bravery in Philosopher's Stone, in which Neville "finds true moral courage in standing up to his closest friends — the people who are on his side" towards the climax.[5]
