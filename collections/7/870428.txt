In somatic cell nucleus however we cannot observe any actin filaments using this technique.[94] The DNase I inhibition assay, so far the only test which allows the quantification of the polymerized actin directly in biological samples, have revealed that endogenous nuclear actin occurs indeed mainly in a monomeric form.[93]
