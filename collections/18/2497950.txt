Quickly overpowered and outnumbered as he is hit with the All Star Crash, Geth summons Kerberos to attack the city with Ryu Commander holding him off as Shishi Red, Ookami Blue Blue, Oushi Black, Chameleon Green, and Kaijiki Yellow board their Voyager Machines to stop Kerberos. Tsurugi offers his help by sending Shishi Red the Hercules Kyutama, using it force his cockpit into Keroberos and turn it the Kerberos Voyager. Shishi Red then uses the Kerberos Kyutama to have the Keroberos Voyager combine with the Oushi, Hebitsukai, Chameleon and Kajiki Voyagers to become Kerberios. As Raptor counts down while Gigant Houou restrains an enlarged Oumo, Lucky uses the Hikari Kyutama's Moon Mode to enlarge Kerberios with all nine main Kyurangers and Koguma SkyBlue piloting it. Kerberos manages to destroy the Geth Star while Ryu Commander and Gigant Houou destroy their opponents, the stone once more scattered across the universe as the Kyurangers celebrate.
