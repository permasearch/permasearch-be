Microsoft's first attempt to sell a relational database product was during the mid 1980s, when Microsoft obtained the license to sell R:Base.[2] In the late 1980s Microsoft developed its own solution codenamed Omega.[3] It was confirmed in 1988 that a database product for Windows and OS/2 was in development.[4][5] It was going to include the "EB" Embedded Basic language,[3] which was going to be the language for writing macros in all Microsoft applications,[6] but the unification of macro languages did not happen until the introduction of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). Omega was also expected to provide a front end to the Microsoft SQL Server.[7] The application was very resource-hungry, and there were reports that it was working slowly on the 386 processors that were available at the time.[8] It was scheduled to be released in the 1st quarter of 1990,[9] but in 1989 the development of the product was reset[2][10] and it was rescheduled to be delivered no sooner than in January 1991.[11] Parts of the project were later used for other Microsoft projects: Cirrus (codename for Access) and Thunder (codename for Visual Basic, where the Embedded Basic engine was used).[2][3] After Access's premiere, the Omega project was demonstrated in 1992 to several journalists and included features that were not available in Access.[12]
