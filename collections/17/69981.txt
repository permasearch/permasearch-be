As well as being the arms of Ireland, since 1945 the harp is the arms of each President of Ireland whilst in office. Typically the arms are borne as a banner in the form of a Presidential Standard. The standard is flown over Áras an Uachtaráin, the President's residence in Dublin, at Dublin Castle when the President is in residence and on vehicles used by the President. As with other Presidential and Royal Standards, it is never flown at half mast. However, the Presidential Standard never takes precedence over the flag of Ireland, whereas, for example, the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom takes precedence over the flag of the United Kingdom.
