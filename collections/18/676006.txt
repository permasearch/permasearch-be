The City Museum has been named one of the "great public spaces" by the Project for Public Spaces,[2] and has won other local and international awards as a must-see destination.[citation needed] It has been described as "a wild, singular vision of an oddball artistic mind" and compared to the similarly individualistic Museum of Jurassic Technology in Los Angeles.[3]
