Nile recorded all the tracks and vocals and called me and my horn section for a 3-hour date. We had a great time, as the songs were fabulous—especially "Upside Down" and "I'm Coming Out". We sounded great—Nile was pleased and as I was packing up, he asked me to stay and play a jazz trombone solo on one of the tracks. I said, "Nile, there are a lot of hit records with jazz saxophone solos—even some with jazz trumpet solos, but not one with a trombone"!! He said. "That's exactly why I want you to do it"!! I was a little bit rusty at first as I hadn't had a call to play jazz in years, so we ended up with four separate tracks of solos, with the intention of picking the best parts to make one great solo when later he went to mix it. I reminded Nile of our agreement and he said he was looking forward to 'The Empire Strikes Back' as he was a Star Wars fan himself.
