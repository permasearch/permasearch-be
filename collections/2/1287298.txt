In 1993 the song was covered – as "Can't Get Enough of Your Love" – by Taylor Dayne. When Dayne submitted her planned third album to Arista Records, label president Clive Davis strongly suggested that she remake the Barry White classic to serve as the album's lead single (replacing Dayne's choice, the self-penned "I'll Wait" which was the planned title cut; the album's title was amended to Soul Dancing).
