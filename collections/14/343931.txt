Al Gore served as Vice President during the Clinton Administration. Clinton and Gore were inaugurated on January 20, 1993. At the beginning of the first term, Clinton and Gore developed a "two-page agreement outlining their relationship". Clinton committed himself to regular lunch meetings, recognized Gore as a principal adviser on nominations, and appointed some of Gore's chief advisers to key White House staff positions. Clinton involved Gore in decision-making to an unprecedented degree for a Vice President. Through their weekly lunches and daily conversations, Gore became the president's "indisputable chief adviser".[31]
