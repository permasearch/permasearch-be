Even though the village grew a great deal from the turnpike, the village was not as fortunate with the railroad. Although one survey for the Erie Railroad went to Monticello, when the final route was determined it did not go near the village. Later when the Midland Railroad (later the O & W) was built through Sullivan County, it too missed Monticello by going through Fallsburg five miles (8Â km) away. A railroad line between Monticello and Port Jervis was launched in 1869 with the formal opening taking place on January 23, 1871. The name of the little railroad was changed several times before it was taken over by the New York O & W in 1903. The O & W ran the line until it was suspended in 1935.
