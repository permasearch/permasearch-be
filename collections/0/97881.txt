"Still Crazy After All These Years" begins with the singer singing that "I met my old lover on the street last night."[2] The "old lover" has been variously interpreted to be either Simon's ex-wife Peggy Harper, from whom he was recently divorced, his former girlfriend from the 1960s Kathy Chitty, or even Simon's former musical partner Art Garfunkel, who appears on the song that follows 'Still Crazy After All These Years" on the album.[2][3] After sharing a few beers, the singer and the old lover part ways again.[4] The singer notes that he is "not the kind of man who tends to socialize" but rather leans "on old familiar ways" and is "still crazy after all these years."[4] The lyrics acknowledge a nostalgia for the past, but also subtly suggest that once the sweet nostalgia is gone, it is replaced by loneliness and even bitterness.[2]
