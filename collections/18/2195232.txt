Three engines were offered with the 2009 redesign: a revised 5.4 L 3-valve Triton V8 that is E85 capable with an output rating of 320 hp (240 kW) and 395 lb⋅ft (536 N⋅m) of torque, a 292 hp (218 kW) 4.6 L 3-valve V8, and a 248 hp (185 kW) 4.6 L 2-valve V8. The 3-valve 5.4 and 4.6 liter V8s were mated to Ford's new 6R80E 6-speed automatic transmission while the 4R75E 4-speed automatic transmission was carried over for the 2-valve 4.6 L V8. The 4.2 L OHV V6 engine, which had been available, was dropped due to the closure of the Essex engine plant where it was produced.
