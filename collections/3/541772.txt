On February 26, 2016, Bryce Dion's brother, Trevor Dion, filed a lawsuit against the City of Omaha, alleging that inadequate communication and coordination between dispatchers and the officers arriving at the scene contributed to Dion's death. The suit also blames the authorities' decision to invite the Cops video crew to go with officers.[34][35]
