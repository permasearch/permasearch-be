He was given command of a division in 1897 as a major-general (equivalent to a British and US brigadier general) in 1897; in 1900 he was promoted to lieutenant general (major-general). Five years later he was made commander of the Fourth Army Corps based in Magdeburg as a General of the Infantry (lieutenant-general). (The German equivalent to four-star rank was Colonel-General). The annual maneuvers taught him how to maneuver a large force; in 1908 he defeated a corps commanded by the kaiser.[8] In 1909 Schlieffen recommended him as Chief of the General Staff, but he lost out to Helmuth von Moltke.[9] He retired in 1911 “to make way for younger men.”[10] He had been in the army for 46 years, including 14 years in General Staff positions.
