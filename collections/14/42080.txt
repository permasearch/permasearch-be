Multiple studies have found individualized interventions tailored on the 14 TTM variables for smoking cessation to effectively recruit and retain pre-Action participants and produce long-term abstinence rates within the range of 22% â€“ 26%. These interventions have also consistently outperformed alternative interventions including best-in-class action-oriented self-help programs,[49] non-interactive manual-based programs, and other common interventions.[50][51] Furthermore, these interventions continued to move pre-Action participants to abstinence even after the program ended.[50][51][52] For a summary of smoking cessation clinical outcomes, see Velicer, Redding, Sun, & Prochaska, 2007 and Jordan, Evers, Spira, King & Lid, 2013.[44][53]
