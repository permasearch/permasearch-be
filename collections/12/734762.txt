The etymology of "chorizo" is uncertain. It was formerly thought to derive from the Latin salsicium, meaning "salted".[5] In English, chorizo is usually pronounced /tʃəˈriːzoʊ, -soʊ/.[6] Non-English pronunciations are sometimes heard, including /tʃəˈriːθoʊ/, mimicking Castilian Spanish pronunciation.
