The fifth annual Gathering of the Juggalos returned to Garrettsville the following year, with over 5,000 in attendance.[13] Ol' Dirty Bastard, Kurupt, Tech N9ne, and Wolfpac were among those who performed.[14] Kurupt got booed off the stage by the attendees, and retaliated by throwing a microphone into the audience. Bone Thugs-n-Harmony also re-united for the first time in several months by making a surprise performance on opening night. Juggalo Championship Wrestling hosted matches every day, and featured several established wrestlers.[15]
