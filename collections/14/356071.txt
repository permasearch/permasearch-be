Although immortal, their physical bodies could be destroyed by violence – thus Gandalf truly died in the fight with Durin's Bane, beyond the power of the Valar to resurrect him; Eru Ilúvatar intervened to send Gandalf back.[4] Similarly, Saruman was killed when his throat was cut by his servant in The Return of the King. The Istari also carried staves, which seem to aid their magic. When Saruman is defeated at Isengard, Gandalf casts him from the White Council and breaks his staff.
