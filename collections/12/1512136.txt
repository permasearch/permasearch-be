In 2018 New Zealand military historian Ian McGibbon challenged the "myth" that Colonel Malone had refused a direct order to make a daytime attack; holding that Malone and Francis Johnston both disagreed with Major-General Alexander Godley's order for the Auckland Battalion to attack in daylight which Johnston had reluctantly accepted. McGibbon said that the sole claim that Malone refused a direct order was made by NCO Charlie Clark in 1981. Malone had argued with a British officer Major Arthur Temperley, but he was junior to Malone.[18]
