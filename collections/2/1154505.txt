Nancy begins working as a representative at a pharmaceutical company which legally produces medical marijuana for people diagnosed with cancer undergoing radiation therapy. Silas also gets a job growing marijuana at the same company as Nancy. After Silas starts working at the pharmaceutical company, he finds himself not too pleased with the process his plants have to go through after they are selected. This leads him to contemplate what marijuana really means to him. After much debate and deliberation, Nancy and Silas realize the industry in which they belong. This realization has them back in Regrestic (formerly Agrestic, where the story began). Teaming up with past friends (and enemies) Nancy develops a scheme.
