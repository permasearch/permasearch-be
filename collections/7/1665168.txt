Thieriot was born in Los Altos Hills, California, the son of Bridgit Ann (née Snyder) and George Cameron Thieriot. He has one older sister, Frances "Frankie" Cameron, and one younger brother, Aidan.[2] He was raised in the small town of Occidental in Sonoma County, California. Thieriot was educated at the Sonoma Country Day School in Santa Rosa, California for middle school, and went on to attend El Molino High School in Forestville, California, from which he graduated in 2006.[2] Thieriot's ancestors once owned the San Francisco Chronicle. His great-great-grandfather, M. H. de Young, who was of Dutch Jewish descent, but later converted to Catholicism, co-founded the paper with his brother Charles de Young,[3][4] and his relatives, Charles and Richard Thieriot, were the editors and publishers of the paper.[5][6] Thieriot's paternal grandparents, Frances Harrison (née Dade) and Ferdinand Melly Thieriot, died in the sinking of the SS Andrea Doria in 1956.[7]
