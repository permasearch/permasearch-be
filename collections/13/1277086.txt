In 2008, the NASCAR on Fox crew of Joy, Waltrip, Berggren, Yocum, and producer Pam Miller returned to the track to call the event for HBO Pay-Per-View along with NASCAR on TNT's booth analyst Kyle Petty.  23,000 fans attended the race this year as they watched Stewart win the 4th annual charity race.  At the end of the race, the Tony Stewart Foundation donated $1,000,000 to the Victory Junction Gang Camps.
