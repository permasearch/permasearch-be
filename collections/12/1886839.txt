Sasha has been described as a realist who demonstrates a pragmatic approach to survival.[2] Martin-Green called Sasha a "team player on the outside but a loner on the inside", who combats the world through her protective and defensive nature.[3] Over the course of the series, Sasha is "pushed further and further to repression and brutality", in contrast to her brother who desperately tries to retain his humanity.[11] Martin-Green commented that: "Sasha [...] is someone who has always been apt to step away from humanity and close herself off" in contrast to her brother, who embraces his humanity at all times.[12] Martin-Green commented on Sasha's relationship with her sibling having juxtaposition on how they view the world, which "makes them both better and challenges them in the best of ways.[13] After going through different experiences after the assault on the Prison and Terminus, she believed there to be a "disparity between them, and there always has been. They’ve always seen life in a different way. But that distance between them is definitely growing because they’ve both gone through some pretty traumatic things that have pushed them further to what they were already feeling."[12]
