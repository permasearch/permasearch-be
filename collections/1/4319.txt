Notwithstanding the sympathy and support from commanders (such as Brock,[297] Cochrane and Nicolls), the policymakers in London reneged in assisting the Indians, as making peace was a higher priority for the politicians. At the peace conference the British demanded an independent Indian state in the Midwest, but, although the British and their Indian allies maintained control over the territories in question (i.e. most of the Upper Midwest), British diplomats did not press the demand after an American refusal, effectively abandoning their Indian allies. The withdrawal of British protection gave the Americans a free hand, which resulted in the removal of most of the tribes to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma).[298] In that sense according to historian Alan Taylor, the final victory at New Orleans had "enduring and massive consequences".[299] It gave the Americans "continental predominance" while it left the Indians dispossessed, powerless, and vulnerable.[300]
