The 2004 Atlantic hurricane season is one of the most active and deadliest Atlantic hurricane seasons ever recorded and was the costliest Atlantic hurricane season on record until surpassed by the following year. The season was typically active due to a Modoki El Niño – a rare type of El Niño in which unfavorable conditions are produced over the eastern Pacific instead of the Atlantic basin due to warmer sea surface temperatures farther west along the equatorial Pacific – activity was above average. More than half of the 16 tropical cyclones brushed or struck the United States. The season officially began on June 1 and ended on November 30, though the last storm dissipated on December 3. The first storm, Alex, developed offshore of the Southeastern United States on July 31. It brushed the Carolinas and the Mid-Atlantic, causing one death and $7.5 million (2004 USD) in damage.[nb 1] Several storms caused only minor damage, including tropical storms Bonnie, Earl, Hermine, and Matthew. In addition, hurricanes Danielle, Karl, and Lisa, Tropical Depression Ten, Subtropical Storm Nicole and Tropical Storm Otto had no effect on land while tropical cyclones.
