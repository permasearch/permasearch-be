As a swan song to the C4 platform, an even more powerful, and very limited-production Audi S6 PLUS was briefly available to European customers.  The S6 PLUS, developed by Audi's wholly owned high performance subsidiary, quattro GmbH, was available for sale during the 1997 model year only (production from June 1996 to October 1997).  A total of 952 cars were producedâ€“855 Avant, and 97 saloons.
