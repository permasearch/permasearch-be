Additional work includes his role in the Silence of the Lambs prequel Hannibal Rising (2007). In late 2007, McKidd began his role as the lead character in the American Fantasy television series Journeyman on NBC.[8] Despite starting out with a strong audience, the show lost about half of its viewership throughout its run and suffered from the fractious situation in America due to the writer's strike at the time. Thirteen episodes were produced.
