President Barack Obama cautiously welcomed the news that the leak had been stopped, though stressing, "it is important we don't get ahead of ourselves".[31] If the cap holds for the planned 48 hours, its valves will be reopened temporarily in order to allow for seismic tests to ensure that oil is not escaping into the bedrock.[29] At the time of the stoppage, oil had been leaking continuously into the Gulf of Mexico for 85 days, 16 hours and 25 minutes since the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded on April 20, 2010.[29]
