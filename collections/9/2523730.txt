The labour market is characterized by high seasonality, due to climatic hazards. Traditionally, the inhabitants suspended all outdoor activities (construction, agriculture, etc.) between December and April.[41] In 1999 the unemployment rate was 12.8%, and a third of the employed worked in the public sector. The employment situation was worsened by the complete cessation of deep-sea fishing, the traditional occupation of the islanders, as the unemployment rate in 1990 was lower at 9.5%.[12] The unemployment for 2010 shows a decrease from 2009, from 7.7% to 7.1%.[41] Exports are very low (5.1% of GDP) while imports are significant (49.1% of GDP).[42] About 70% of the islands' supplies are imported from Canada or from other parts of France via Nova Scotia.[24]
