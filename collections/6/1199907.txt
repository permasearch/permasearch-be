The 36-story Time & Life Building,[104][c] named for anchor tenant Time Inc.,[107] was completed in November 1936,[4][108] replacing an empty plot on the southern block that had been used for vehicle parking.[109][110] Eleven buildings had been completed by 1937 at a total cost of over $100 million.[111] A building for Associated Press on the northern block's empty lot,[112] which had been reserved for the Metropolitan Opera house,[113] was topped out by June 1938[114] and occupied by December of that year.[115][4] The presence of Associated Press and Time Inc. expanded Rockefeller Center's scope from strictly a radio-communications complex to a hub of both radio and print media.[116] The Guild, a newsreel theater,[116] opened in 1938 along the curve of the truck ramp below the Associated Press Building.[117] After Nelson Rockefeller became president of Rockefeller Center in 1938,[3][118] he fired John Todd as the complex's manager and appointed Hugh Robertson in his place.[118][119] The Rockefeller family started occupying the 56th floor of the RCA Building,[120] though the offices would later expand to the 54th and 55th floors as well.[121]
