Gailard Sartain plays Ray Stuckey, the sheriff of Jessup County: a character based on former Neshoba County sheriff Lawrence A. Rainey.[20][28] Sartain described Stuckey as "an elected officialÂ ... who has to be gregarious - but with sinister overtones".[29] Stephen Tobolowsky plays Clayton Townley, a Grand Wizard of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.[20] The character is based on  White Knights leader Samuel Bowers.[30] Michael Rooker plays Frank Bailey, a Klansman involved in the murders of the three civil rights activists.[31] Pruitt Taylor Vince, who had a small role in Parker's previous film Angel Heart, plays Lester Cowens, a Klansman who unknowingly becomes a pawn in the FBI's investigation. Vince described the character as "goofy, stupid and geeky" and stated, "I never had a prejudiced bone in my body. It gave me a funny feeling to play this guy with a hood and everything. But when you're in the midst of it, you just concentrate on getting through it."[32]
