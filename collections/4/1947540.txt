By 1525, Reading was the largest town in Berkshire, and tax returns show that Reading was the 10th largest town in England when measured by taxable wealth. By 1611, it had a population of over 5000 and had grown rich on its trade in cloth, as instanced by the fortune made by local merchant John Kendrick.[13] [16] Reading played an important role during the English Civil War. Despite its fortifications, it had a Royalist garrison imposed on it in 1642. The subsequent Siege of Reading by Parliamentary forces succeeded in April 1643.[17] The town's cloth trade was especially badly damaged, and the town's economy did not fully recover until the 20th century.[11][18] Reading played a significant role during the Revolution of 1688: the second Battle of Reading was the only substantial military action of the campaign.[11][19]
