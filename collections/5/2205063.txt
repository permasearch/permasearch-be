DRESS syndrome is one of several terms that have been used to describe a severe idiosyncratic reaction to a drug that is characterized by a long latency of onset after exposure to the offending medication, a rash, involvement of internal organs, hematologic abnormalities, and systemic illness. Other synonymous names and acronyms include drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS), anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome, drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome, drug-induced delayed multiorgan hypersensitivity syndrome, and drug-induced pseudolymphoma.[1]
