The interior was also redesigned accordingly. Starting in 2005, the "SE-R" badged "goose-neck" shifter handle from the previous models was replaced by an all black, leather stitched ball-top shifter. The original two-tone interior cloth found in Spec V models, which was originally red and black for 2002, later changed to gray and black for 2003â€“2004, was changed to all-black mesh for the final two years of production.
