Mangione was born and raised in Rochester, New York, with his pianist brother Gap. Their uncle Jerre Mangione (March 20, 1909 â€“ August 16, 1998) was an American writer and scholar of the Italian-American experience. Together the brothers led the Mangione Brothers Sextet/Quintet, which recorded three albums for Riverside Records before Mangione branched out into other work. He attended the Eastman School of Music from 1958 to 1963, then joined Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, for which he filled the trumpet chair previously held by Clifford Brown, Freddie Hubbard, Kenny Dorham, Bill Hardman, and Lee Morgan.[2]
