Where parties make no express statement of how the subsequent agreement interacts with the original, it can be inferred from the circumstances whether the original contract has been terminated. The parties may have intended the subsequent agreement to replace the original contract,[149] or they may have intended it to vary the terms of the original contract.[36] Whether the agreement was intended to replace or vary the original is a 'matter of degree'.[36] Dependant upon the circumstances in each case different aspects may be considered by a court. Concut v Worrell [150] illustrates some factors that may be assessed in employment relationships.
