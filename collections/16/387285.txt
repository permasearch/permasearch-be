Stewart struggled for the early portion of the 2010 season, which prompted Old Spice to leave Stewart-Haas for the 2011 season. Stewart recovered later in the year to win two races at Atlanta and Auto Club Speedway and managed to make the Chase. He finished seventh in points. It was later announced that Mobil 1 would be the replacement sponsor for Old Spice.
