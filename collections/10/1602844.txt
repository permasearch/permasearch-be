Joey Ramone shared writing credit with Ramones bassist Dee Dee Ramone and Ramones producer and former Plasmatics bassist/keyboardist Jean Beauvoir.[11] Commentators on the song tended to suggest that Joey was its primary author.[9][12] Mickey Leigh, Joey's brother, who was particularly close with Dee Dee, claimed that while "everyone believed Joey had been the impetus to write the song ... it was actually Dee Dee."[11] Beauvoir's camp states that he was equally involved in the lyrics in addition to his music and melody contributions.
