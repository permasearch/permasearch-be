Iron Man runs a psychic scan on Wolverine and the Invisible Woman, stunned to see the alternate reality. Stark believes Morgan le Fay planted them as spies. Iron Man meets the original timeline Wolverine and explains that his injuries are from a war between Latveria and Asgard in which Thor vanished and Morgana conquered half the world. Wolverine is shown the footage of Henry Pym's death while Iron Man recounts that the Avengers broke up afterward and magic overcame technology and "you broke the world." At the Helicarrier, the Defenders' Wolverine decides to talk to his other self and the others help him push past Emma Frost with the Thing wanting to help the Invisible Woman. Iron Man chastises Wolverine for simply killing Hank Pym saying he could have convinced Pym to develop a virus to stop Ultron instead. The Invisible Woman breaks free, leading Stark to believe this is all another of Morgan le Fey's tricks. At that moment, Morgan le Fey attacks with a swarm of Doombots. The Defenders fight them and Iron Man accuses le Fey for the time travelers. She claims innocence and then points out to Iron Man that a pair of Helicarriers are crashing into the heart of New York City.[16]
