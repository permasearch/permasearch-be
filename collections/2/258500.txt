Another hurdle the song had to overcome was the fact that its title did not click with some record buyers. "Connors says her only regret about 'With You I'm Born Again' is that she didn't title it 'Come Bring Me Your Softness'. 'Berry Gordy called me to let me know we had a monster hit on our hands but that early on many people were going into record stores asking for "Come Bring Me Your Softness", and some record sales were lost as a result.'"[4] The fact that the phrase "born again" is often associated with Christianity may have also been confusing, and Connors admitted, "'Many thought the song had religious overtones, but Robert Culp and I were lovers at the time, and that's the way we felt about one another. Culp was the inspiration.'"[4] The singers also felt the song could be interpreted in a religious context as well as being a romantic love song. Preston explained, "When we saw [Fast Break], we understood it was a romantic song. But I think of it as religious because God is love, so it all inter-relates."[6]
