In the early days of 3D accelerated gaming, most vendors did not supply a full OpenGL driver. The reason for this was twofold.  Firstly, most of the consumer-oriented accelerators did not implement enough functionality to properly accelerate OpenGL.  Secondly, many vendors struggled to implement a full OpenGL driver with good performance and compatibility.  Instead, they wrote MiniGL drivers, which only implemented a subset of OpenGL, enough to run GLQuake (and later other OpenGL games, mostly based on the Quake engine). Proper OpenGL drivers became more prevalent as hardware evolved, and consumer-oriented accelerators caught up with the SGI systems for which OpenGL was originally designed. This would be around the time of DirectX 6 or DirectX 7.
