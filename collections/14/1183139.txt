The Xperia X1 was the first phone to be released in the Xperia range.[4] Released 2008, it featured a high resolution display (~311 ppi pixel density) and it was intended to fill the widening gap of smartphones as other competitors were producing high-end smartphone devices such as HTC and Apple. The X2 was released in the following year, which included an 8.1 MP camera and included Wifi and GPS. By this time there was a clear shift towards the smartphone end of the spectrum. An exception was the Xperia Pureness, a translucent phone without camera that was sold by selected retailers in selected cities.[5][6] The Xperia X5 Pureness is based on Sony Ericsson’s proprietary operating system (OSE).
