Residents of The Villages have a historically high 80% turnout rate in elections. Republicans outnumber Democrats two-to-one.[29] Some Democratic residents complain about the distinctly Republican coverage in local broadcasting and newspaper, an orientation attributed to The Villages' owner,[30] as well as voicing concerns about politically oriented vandalism.[31]
