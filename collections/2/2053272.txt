In October 2016 it was reported that the government had set a target of recovering £500 million a year from overseas visitors treated in NHS hospitals in England, which had been "refined" to £346m for 2017-18, according to the National Audit Office. £289m was collected in 2015-16 and £73m in 2012-13. The NAO reported that only 58% of hospital doctors knew some people were chargeable for NHS healthcare at all.[7] According to Joseph Meirion Thomas, a former cancer specialist at the Royal Marsden Hospital failure to enforce the charging regulations is costing the British taxpayer £3 billion a year.[8]
