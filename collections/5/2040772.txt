Vertical currency is a type of currency in which the orientation has been changed from the conventional horizontal orientation to a vertical orientation. Dowling Duncan, a self-touted multidisciplinary design studio, conducted a study in which they determined people tend to handle and deal with money vertically rather than horizontally, especially when currency is processed through ATM and other money machines. They also note how money transactions are conducted vertically not horizontally.[48] Bermuda, Brazil, Cape Verde, Israel, Switzerland, and Venezuela have adopted vertically oriented currency, although Israel is now reverting to horizontal orientation.[citation needed]
