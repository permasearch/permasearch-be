"When She Loved Me" is a pop song with light country music influences that lasts a duration of three minutes and five seconds (3:05).[29][30][31] Written in the key of F major, "When She Loved Me" is performed "tenderly" and "very freely" at a tempo of 75 beats per minute,[32] using simple background accompaniment.[29] The term "heartbreaking" is often associated with the song.[17][33] Sean Daly of the Tampa Bay Times described the ballad as a song that "captures the beauty of growing up and, for parents, the beauty of letting go."[2] Newman himself described the song as "slow ... emotional, and sort of grown-up emotional".[3] CD Universe compared the ballad to the works of composer Aaron Copland and singer Fats Domino.[34] Amazon.com's Jason Verlinde described McLachlan's vocal delivery as "breathy".[35] According to Brad Green of Urban Cinefile, the ballad is a lament about "platonic, unconditional and enchantingly innocent love" that he believes is seldom explored in mainstream pop music.[30]
