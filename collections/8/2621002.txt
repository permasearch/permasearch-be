The competition pits six top European players against six of their counterparts from the rest of the world. There are 12 matches played over three days (nine singles and three doubles), with the number of points awarded for victories increasing each day. Each player takes the court once or twice for singles, with at least four of the six taking part in doubles. All matches are played as best-of-three, with a 10-point tiebreaker if play goes to a third set.
