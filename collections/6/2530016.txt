At the other end of Asia, Austen was first introduced in Turkey at the so-called "foreign schools" for foreigners living in the Ottoman Empire, in which Turks were also allowed to enroll in the late 19th century.[98] Initially, Turks only read Austen in the English original, and the first Austen novel to be translated into Turkish was Sense and Sensibility as Sağduyu ve Duyarlık in two volumes in 1946 and 1948.[99] Austen first came to widespread notice Turkey in the late 1960s when Nihal Yeğinobalı started translating Austen with her first translation being Pride and Prejudice as Aşk ve Gurur (Love and Pride).[100] Yeğinobalı's translations of Austen removed much of the irony in the original, replaced the free indirect discourse with speeches by the characters and made changes to the plot and characters to make Austen fit into the style of popular Turkish romances.[101] Yeğinobalı's translations are the ones by which Austen is best known in Turkey.[102] The Turkish scholar Rana Tekcan wrote that Yeğinobalı was not particularly faithful to Austen, but it is very difficult to translate English novels into Turkish as in the Turkish language the predicate always comes at the end of a sentence, which is not the case in English.[103] It was not 2006 that Austen was first translated properly into Turkish when Pride and Prejudice was translated as Gurur ve Önyargı by Hamdi Koç, who at present is engaged in translating the rest of Austen's novels into Turkish.[104] Gurur ve Önyargı sold out in its first year, and a second edition was issued in 2007, which Tekcan used to argue that many Turks wanted a proper version of Austen in their own language.[105] Austen's status in modern Turkey can be seen in the Wikipedia-like website Ekşi Sözlük (The Sourtimes Dictionary), when anonymous contributors write articles on various subjects; typing Jane Austen on the Ekşisözlük produces comments such as “Jane Austen is for those who are ashamed to read romance novels”and “The characters that Jane Austen created still live in the likes of a neighbor who is dying to get her daughters married to rich men.”.[106]
