The government is working on the expressway from the Purvanchal border through Bihar to Jharkhand, and has also expanded the highway from Hajipur to Muzaffarpur from a two-lane to a four-lane highway.[30] The central government funded north-east corridor expressway will run through the northern part of the state making the north better connected with the rest of India. The state now spends (2007–2008) Rs 2,222.08 crore on roads, compared with Rs 51.2 crore between 2003 and 2004.[31] In September 2008, $420 million (USD) loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) was provided to the government to improve nine state highways. The loan would be used to convert nine state highways into double-lane roads covering a total stretch of 820 kilometres (510 mi). The governments aim is to convert these roads into double-lane traffic corridors as per international standards and bids have been invited for the conversion of these roads in accordance with international bidding procedures. The ADB had also given its consent for development of 1,500-kilometre (930 mi) stretch of state highways into two-lane roads as per international standards under Bihar State Highways Project (BSHP). BSHP will be executed in two phases. The nine roads have been included in its first phase.[32] World Bank India Director Onno Ruhl has said that the Bank would double up its assistance to Bihar from current $500 billion, in the next couple of years.[33]
