During the Late Jurassic, birds evolved from small, predatory theropod dinosaurs.[214] The first birds inherited teeth and long, bony tails from their dinosaur ancestors,[214] but some had developed horny, toothless beaks by the very Late Jurassic[215] and short pygostyle tails by the Early Cretaceous.[216]
