The Japanese commanders, faced with equipment that was substandard when engaging the industrial Western Powers of the UK and US, and even some of the Chinese armies that were equipped by the Germans in 1937, would initially resort to the "Banzai" or bayonet charge to attempt to close quickly with the enemy and negate the superior firepower in hand-to-hand combat. Although by 1940 an increasingly isolated Japan made the controversial decision to join the Axis, very little in the way of technological transfer occurred, and as a result Japanese equipment maintained independent development for the most part, however in some of the cases where limited exchanges of design did take place, Japan's lack of industrial capacity limited these to either prototypes for testing, or limited production runs for home defense only.
