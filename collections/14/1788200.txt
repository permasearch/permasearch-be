Rolling a person with an active tonic-clonic seizure onto their side and into the recovery position helps prevent fluids from getting into the lungs.[90] Putting fingers, a bite block or tongue depressor in the mouth is not recommended as it might make the person vomit or result in the rescuer being bitten.[26][90] Efforts should be taken to prevent further self-injury.[26] Spinal precautions are generally not needed.[90]
