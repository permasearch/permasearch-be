Jason is portrayed as a confident, affable, charismatic and popular all-American high school student from a middle-class home with loving and supportive, although sometimes over-protective, parents. He is presumably the only child of Mitchell and Joanne Street (there is no mention of siblings). He, Landry and Julie Taylor are the only original main characters in high school who come from stable, two-parent families, in contrast to the others, all of whom come from divorced or single-parent homes or families with absent parental figures. Of the adult characters in the show, Jason is closest to Coach Taylor, who coached him since elementary school and was his position coach in high school, and often seeks his advice.
