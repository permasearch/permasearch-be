After the bacterial DNA is inserted into the cell, the process of biosynthesis is initiated. Biosynthesis involves the utilization of the host cells' nucleotides and enzymes to make copies of the phage DNA. The mRNA in the cytoplasm are transcribed from the phage DNA being involved in the biosynthesis of phage enzymes and capsids proteins. Therefore, the ribosomes, enzymes, and amino acids of the host are involved in translation.
