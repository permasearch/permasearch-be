Other widely used zinc alloys include nickel silver, typewriter metal, soft and aluminium solder, and commercial bronze.[12] Zinc is also used in contemporary pipe organs as a substitute for the traditional lead/tin alloy in pipes.[114] Alloys of 85–88% zinc, 4–10% copper, and 2–8% aluminium find limited use in certain types of machine bearings. Zinc is the primary metal in American one cent coins (pennies) since 1982.[115] The zinc core is coated with a thin layer of copper to give the appearance of a copper coin. In 1994, 33,200 tonnes (36,600 short tons) of zinc were used to produce 13.6 billion pennies in the United States.[116]
