Business Interstate Highway 40-D (formerly Loop 552) is a long Business Loop through Amarillo. An older alignment - Loop 279 - carried Business U.S. Highway 66. East of Amarillo, Farm to Market Road 2575 is old US 66, rerouted to today's Business I-40 in 1958[6] by the construction of Amarillo International Airport. Present Business I-40 was bypassed in 1968 by I-40,[3] and carried US 66 until its 1985 decommissioning.[7]
