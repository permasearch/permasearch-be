Jallikattu has been known to be practiced during the Tamil classical period (400-100 BC).[1][9] It was common among the ancient people Aayars who lived in the ‘Mullai’ geographical division of the ancient Tamil country.[7][10] Later, it became a platform for display of bravery and prize money was introduced for participation encouragement. A seal from the Indus Valley Civilization depicting the practice is preserved in the National Museum, New Delhi.[11] A cave painting in white kaolin discovered near Madurai depicting a lone man trying to control a bull is estimated to be about 1,500 years old.[12]
