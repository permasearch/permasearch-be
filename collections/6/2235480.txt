The Ross Sea fishery (CCAMLR Statistical Division 88.1 and 88.2) was the second toothfish fishery to be independently evaluated and certified by the MSC as sustainable and well managed (in 2010, and re-certified in 2015). This fishery catches mainly Antarctic toothfish, a close relative to the Patagonian toothfish.[25][26]
