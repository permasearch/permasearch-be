An article published in American Psychologist in 2007 found that the story of Genovese's murder had been exaggerated by the media. There were much fewer than 38 eyewitnesses, the police were called at least once during the attack, and many of the bystanders who overheard the attack could not actually see the event. The story continues to be misrepresented in social psychology textbooks because it functions as a parable and serves as a dramatic example for students.[37] In 2016, The New York Times called its own reporting "flawed", stating that the original story "grossly exaggerated the number of witnesses and what they had perceived".[38]
