In Sweden, there is a system of administrative courts that considers only administrative law cases, and is completely separate from the system of general courts.[33] This system has three tiers, with 12 county administrative courts (förvaltningsrätt) as the first tier, four administrative courts of appeal (kammarrätt) as the second tier, and the Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden (Högsta Förvaltningsdomstolen) as the third tier.
