Afternoon is the time occurring between noon and evening.[1] The specific range of time this encompasses varies in one direction: noon is currently defined as a constant 12:00 pm,[2] but when afternoon ends is dependent on when evening begins, for which there is no standard definition.[3] However, before a period of transition from the twelfth to fourteenth centuries, noon instead referred to 3 pm—possible explanations include shifting times for prayers and midday meals, along which one concept of noon was defined—and so afternoon would have referred to a narrower timeframe.[4]
