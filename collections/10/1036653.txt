Stories for the show were often co-written by Burns, who also became a producer in the show's fourth season.[25] Other writers include three acclaimed crime fiction writers from outside of Baltimore: George Pelecanos from Washington, Richard Price from the Bronx and Dennis Lehane from Boston.[26] Reviewers drew comparisons between Price's works (particularly Clockers) and The Wire even before he joined.[27] In addition to writing, Pelecanos served as a producer for the third season.[28] Pelecanos has commented that he was attracted to the project because of the opportunity to work with Simon.[28] Staff writer Rafael Alvarez penned several episodes' scripts, as well as the series guidebook The Wire: Truth Be Told. Alvarez is a colleague of Simon's from The Baltimore Sun and a Baltimore native with working experience in the port area.[29] Another city native and independent filmmaker, Joy Lusco, also wrote for the show in each of its first three seasons.[30] Baltimore Sun writer and political journalist William F. Zorzi joined the writing staff in the third season and brought a wealth of experience to the show's examination of Baltimore politics.[29]
