In the 2014 Announcement of Opportunity for the Discovery program, an observatory to detect the objects in the Oort cloud (and Kuiper belt) called the "Whipple Mission" was proposed.[57] It would monitor distant stars with a photometer, looking for transits up to 10 thousand AU away.[57] The observatory was proposed for halo orbiting around L2 with a suggested 5-year mission.[57] It has been suggested that the Kepler observatory may also be able to detect objects in the Oort cloud.[58]
