Fall Out Boy's albums Take This to Your Grave and From Under the Cork Tree are both said to have pop punk as well as punk rock sounds and influences,[136][137] and Infinity on High features a wide range of styles and instrumentation, including orchestral arrangements ("Thnks fr th Mmrs"[138]) and a slower piano ballad ("Golden"[139]). R&B influences on Infinity on High are on songs such as "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race" and two of the album's tracks are produced by R&B singer/producer Babyface. On Folie Ã  Deux, the group continues to evolve its sound, with less of a pop punk sound and increasing the use of piano (such as "What a Catch, Donnie",[140] "Headfirst Slide into Cooperstown on a Bad Bet",[141] and "20 Dollar Nose Bleed"[141]), synthesizers, and guest artists. The band also shows a number of influences, with "Disloyal Order of Water Buffaloes" borrowing a chord sequence from The Who song "Baba O'Riley".[142] The group has worked with many producers and artists, including The Neptunes, Timbaland, Ryan Adams, Lil Wayne and Kanye West, the latter of which Patrick Stump described as "the Prince of his generation".[143]
