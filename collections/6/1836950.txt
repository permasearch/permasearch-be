The "Gladiolus Rag", a later composition by Joplin, is a developed variant of the "Maple Leaf Rag," showcasing Joplin's increasing musical sophistication, and is usually played at a somewhat slower tempo. In addition, the first strain of both Joplin's "The Cascades" and "Sugar Cane" are also similar to "Maple Leaf Rag"'s first strain.
