Kuwait was the center of boat building in the Persian Gulf region.[22][23] During the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, vessels made in Kuwait carried the bulk of trade between the ports of India, East Africa and the Red Sea.[24][25][26] Kuwaiti ships were renowned throughout the Indian Ocean.[27] Regional geopolitical turbulence helped foster economic prosperity in Kuwait in the second half of the 18th century.[28] Perhaps the biggest catalyst for much of Kuwait becoming prosperous was due to Basra's instability in the late 18th century.[29] In the late 18th century, Kuwait partly functioned as a haven for Basra's merchants, who were fleeing Ottoman government persecution.[30] Kuwaitis developed a reputation as the best sailors in the Persian Gulf.[27][31][32]
