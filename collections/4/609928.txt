"Mama, I'm Coming Home" is the third song on the 1991 album No More Tears by the English heavy metal singer Ozzy Osbourne. Sharon Osbourne has previously claimed that the song was written by Ozzy in tribute to her, however, the song was actually co-written by Lemmy Kilmister, Zakk Wylde (Osbourne's long-time guitarist) and multi-platinum producer/engineer Tom Fletcher. Lemmy was brought in as a songwriter for the No More Tears album, providing lyrics for the tracks "Mama I'm Coming Home" [2], "Hellraiser", "Desire", and "I Don't Want to Change the World."
