In Jewish and Christian tradition, the love of money is condemned as a sin primarily based on texts such as Ecclesiastes 5.10 and 1 Timothy 6:10. The Jewish and Christian condemnation relates to avarice and greed rather than money itself. The Jewish and Christian texts (scriptures) are full of parables and use easy to understand subjects, such as money, to convey the actual message, there are further parallels in Solon and Aristotle,[1] and Massinissa - who ascribed love of money to Hannibal and the Carthaginians.[2]. Avarice is one of the Seven deadly sins in the Jewish and Christian classifications of vices (sins).
