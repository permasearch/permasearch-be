About halfway through the game, the tribes are merged into a single tribe, and competitions are on an individual basis; winning immunity prevents that player from being voted out. Most players that are voted out during this stage become members of the Tribal Council Jury. Once only two people remain, the Final Tribal Council is held where the remaining players plead their case to the members of the Jury as to why they should win the game. The jurors must then cast their vote for which finalist should be awarded the title of Sole Australian Survivor and the grand prize of A$500,000 (or a A$100,000 charity prize in the celebrity season).
