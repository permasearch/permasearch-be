Sewanee is now a member of the Southern Athletic Association (SAA),[23] offering 11 varsity sports for men and 13 for women. As is the case for all of its previous conferences, Sewanee is a charter member of its current conferenceâ€”it was one of the seven SCAC members that announced their departure from that conference at the 2011 annual meeting of SCAC presidents.[22] The seven were joined by Berry College, another small private school in Georgia.[22]
