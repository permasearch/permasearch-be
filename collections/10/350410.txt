Initially, the primary method of breeding giant pandas in captivity was by artificial insemination, as they seemed to lose their interest in mating once they were captured.[77] This led some scientists to try extreme methods, such as showing them videos of giant pandas mating[78] and giving the males sildenafil (commonly known as "Viagra").[79] Only recently have researchers started having success with captive breeding programs, and they have now determined giant pandas have comparable breeding to some populations of the American black bear, a thriving bear species. The normal reproductive rate is considered to be one young every two years.[15][49]
