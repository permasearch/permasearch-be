Jane Kaczmarek guest starred in the episode "Beautiful Frame", as Suffolk County District Attorney Pamela James, who lands the same murder case as ADA Barba (Raúl Esparza). However, while James arrests an SVU rape victim for the crime, Barba and the SVU team like a different suspect for the murder. The trials start simultaneously and both prosecutors must fight for a conviction before the other can destroy their case.[32] In "Beautiful Frame", Yvonne Zima portrayed a rape victim in an SVU case who is arrested for the murder of her ex-boyfriend. Suffolk County DA Pam James (Kaczmarek) lands the case and swiftly brings charges against the young woman. Detective Benson questions the circumstances of the arrest and gathers enough evidence for ADA Barba to levy charges in Manhattan against another suspect. The two ambitious District Attorneys square off in separate trials for the same murder, hoping to get a conviction before the other derails their case.[40] Nia Vardalos appeared in an episode titled, "Criminal Hatred," (airing January 30, 2013), Vardalos portrayed Counselor Minonna Efron, whose client is on trial for assault and murder. Vardalos' character is described as "disorganized," which makes ADA Barba (Raúl Esparza) think he's got an easy win, but the character winds up thrwarting him at every turn. Victoria Rowell also guest stars and Fred Norris makes a cameo appearance.[41]
