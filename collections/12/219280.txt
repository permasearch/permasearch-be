The Viet Cong attacked Pleiku airbase (aka Camp Holloway Airfield).  Viet Cong demolition teams infiltrated the compound where American advisers were living and, supported by mortar fire, killed eight Americans, wounded 128, and damaged or destroyed 24 American aircraft. McGeorge Bundy (visiting in Vietnam) and General William Westmoreland (commander of the Military Assistance Command Vietnam, or MACV) visited Pleiku that day.  Bundy strongly recommended a reprisal attack against North Vietnam.[16]  Bundy reported to Johnson "The situation in Vietnam is deteriorating and without new U.S. action defeat appears inevitable--probably not in a matter of weeks or perhaps even months, but within the next year or so.... There is still time to turn it around, but not much."[17]
