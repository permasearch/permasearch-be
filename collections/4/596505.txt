Multipath TCP (MPTCP) [36][37] is an ongoing effort within the IETF that aims at allowing a TCP connection to use multiple paths to maximize resource usage and increase redundancy. The redundancy offered by Multipath TCP in the context of wireless networks enables the simultaneous utilization of different networks, which brings higher throughput and better handover capabilities. Multipath TCP also brings performance benefits in datacenter environments.[38] The reference implementation[39] of Multipath TCP is being developed in the Linux kernel.[40] Multipath TCP is used to support the Siri voice recognition application on iPhones, iPads and Macs [41]
