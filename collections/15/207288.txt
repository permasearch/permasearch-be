Guru Granth Sahib (Punjabi (Gurmukhi)eg.ਓ : (Gurū Gra°th Sāhib Jī), Punjabi pronunciation: [ɡʊɾu ɡɾəntʰ sɑhɪb], /ˈɡʊəruː ɡrʌnt səˈhɪb/) is the religious scripture of Sikhism, regarded by Sikhs as the final, sovereign, and eternal living guru following the lineage of the ten human Sikh gurus of the Sikh religion.[1] Adi Granth, the first rendition, was compiled by the fifth Sikh guru, Guru Arjan. The tenth guru, Guru Gobind Singh, added one salok, dohra mahala 9 ang, 1429 and all 115 hymns of his father, Guru Tegh Bahadur.[2] This second rendition came to be known as Sri Guru Granth Sahib.[3] After Guru Gobind Singh's death in 1708, Baba Deep Singh and Bhai Mani Singh prepared many copies of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji for distribution.[4]
