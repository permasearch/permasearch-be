The defeat in Mile High Stadium proved to be the last of Cleveland's streak of playoff appearances in the mid- to late-1980s. Kosar played through numerous injuries in 1989, including bruising on his right arm and a bad knee.[236] Strong defense had carried the Browns to the playoffs even when the offense faltered, but that all crumbled in 1990. Kosar threw more interceptions than touchdowns for the first time in his career, and the defense allowed more points than any other in the league.[237] The Browns' 2–7 start cost Carson his job.[238] Jim Shofner was named interim head coach, and the team finished 3–13.[239] After the season Bill Belichick, the defensive coordinator of the then-Super Bowl champion New York Giants, was named head coach.[240]
