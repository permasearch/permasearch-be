Another disadvantage of conical steel towers is that constructing towers that meet the requirements of wind turbines taller than 90 meters proves challenging. High performance concrete shows potential to increase tower height and increase the lifetime of the towers. A hybrid of prestressed concrete and steel has shown improved performance over standard tubular steel at tower heights of 120 meters.[69] Concrete also gives the benefit of allowing for small precast sections to be assembled on site, avoiding the challenges steel faces during transportation.[70] One downside of concrete towers is the higher CO2 emissions during concrete production as compared to steel. However, the overall environmental benefit should be higher if concrete towers can double the wind turbine lifetime.[71]
