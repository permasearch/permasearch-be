Bishops are normally ordained to the episcopate by at least three other bishops,[17] though for validity only one is needed[21] and a mandatum from the Holy See is required.[22] Ordination to the episcopate is considered the completion of the sacrament of Holy Orders; even when a bishop retires from his active service, he remains a bishop, since the ontological effect of Holy Orders is permanent. On the other hand, titles such as archbishop or patriarch imply no ontological alteration, and existing bishops who rise to those offices do not require further ordination.
