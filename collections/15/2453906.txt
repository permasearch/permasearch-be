Just as in the Doyle books, Mycroft is even more skilled at deduction, correcting Sherlock on occasion and beating him in deduction exercises, as well as lacking enthusiasm for “legwork”. His intellect is borderline superhuman, allowing him to learn Serbian in a couple of hours. As such, even Sherlock admits that Mycroft is smarter than he is; in reference to their childhood, Mycroft thought Sherlock was “an idiot”, only changing his mind when they compared themselves with other children.
