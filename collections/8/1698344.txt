Sleeping Beauty Castle (originally known as Snow White's Castle) is a fairy tale castle at the center of Disneyland and formerly (being redesigned as of 2018) at Hong Kong Disneyland. It is based on the late-19th century Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria, Germany. It appears in the Walt Disney Pictures title card, and, along with Cinderella Castle, is an iconic symbol of The Walt Disney Company. It is the only Disney castle whose construction was overseen by Walt Disney.
