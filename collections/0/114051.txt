After the Lakers once again won the title in Game 7 of the 2010 Finals, Bryant was asked what it meant to him personally. He responded, "Just one more than Shaq ... I can take that to the bank." Bryant had won five NBA titles, and O'Neal had won four. Bryant added, "You guys know how I am. I don't forget anything."[131] O'Neal again congratulated Bryant on his Twitter page: "Congratulations Kobe, u deserve it. U played great. Enjoy it man enjoy it. I know what ur sayin 'Shaq how my ass taste'  [sic]."[132]
