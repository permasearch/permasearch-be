Constantin announced that the second book in the series City of Ashes would be adapted into a film, with Harald Zwart returning as director. The film was due to start production in 2013, but was delayed to 2014 after the first film failed to recoup its budget. On October 12, a TV series adaptation was announced, and producers deemed it unlikely that the film series would continue.[21][22]
