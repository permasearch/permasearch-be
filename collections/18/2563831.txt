After Independence, Pakistan vigorously pursued bilateral relations with other Muslim countries[15] and made a wholehearted bid for leadership of the Muslim world, or at least for leadership in achieving its unity.[16] The Ali brothers had sought to project Pakistan as the natural leader of the Islamic world, in large part due to its large manpower and military strength.[17] A top-ranking Muslim League leader, Khaliquzzaman, declared that Pakistan would bring together all Muslim countries into Islamistan â€“ a pan-Islamic entity.[18] Such developments (alongside Pakistan's creation) did not get American approval and British Prime Minister Clement Attlee voiced international opinion at the time by stating that he wished that India and Pakistan would re-unite.[19] Since most of the Arab world was undergoing a nationalist awakening at the time, there was little attraction to Pakistan's Pan-Islamic aspirations.[20] Some of the Arab countries saw the 'Islamistan' project as a Pakistani attempt to dominate other Muslim states.[21]
