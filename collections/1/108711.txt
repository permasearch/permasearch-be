Some predatory species adjust their habits in response to competition from other predators. For example, the subspecies of short-eared owl that lives on the Gal√°pagos Islands is normally active during the day, but on islands like Santa Cruz that are home to the Galapagos hawk, the owl is crepuscular.[4][5]
