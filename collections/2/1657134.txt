In 1941 Kallman ended their sexual relationship because he could not accept Auden's insistence on mutual fidelity,[32] but he and Auden remained companions for the rest of Auden's life, sharing houses and apartments from 1953 until Auden's death.[33] Auden dedicated both editions of his collected poetry (1945/50 and 1966) to Isherwood and Kallman.[34]
