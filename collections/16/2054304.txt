Gameplay-wise, Genji is a flanker and an infiltrator, best suited to one-on-one fights. Since the cooldown for his Swift Strike resets upon scoring a kill, it is best used as a finishing move. Genji's Deflect ability can counter many enemy ultimate abilities, like Soldier 76's Tactical Visor or McCree's Deadeye. While some characters function best when paired with specific teammates, Genji works best in isolation.[50] Genji is strong against turrets like Bastion and those of TorbjÃ¶rn, and is effective at flanking snipers.[51] Genji is vulnerable against characters with energy weapons that bypass his deflection, such as Symmetra, Winston, and Zarya. Since Genji is reliant on Deflect, the common way to counter him is to bait him into activating it and then attack when it's on cooldown. Genji's agile, melee-oriented playstyle is difficult to learn, yet is popular among new players who like his ninja design.[50]
