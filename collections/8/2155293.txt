After the game, many Royals fans considered it "The Best Game Ever" in their franchise history because of the incredible 4-run comeback by Kansas City. Making it sweeter for Royals fans was their bitter feelings towards the Athletics, who played in Kansas City from 1955-67 before owner Charles O. Finley moved the franchise to California. It was the Royals' first playoff game in 29 years.
