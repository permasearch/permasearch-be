Parker held casting calls in New York, Atlanta, Houston, Dallas, Orlando, New Orleans, Raleigh and Nashville.[19] The filmmakers did not retain the names of actual people; many of the supporting characters were composites of people related to the murder case.[7] Gene Hackman plays Rupert Anderson, an FBI agent and former Mississippi sheriff.[20] Brian Dennehy was briefly considered for the role[25] before Orion suggested Hackman.[20] During the screenwriting process, Parker frequently discussed the project with Hackman.[19] Hackman said, "...Â it felt right to do something of historical import. It was an extremely intense experience, both the content of the film and the making of it in Mississippi."[24]
