The Greek ἥλιος is the inherited word for the Sun, from Proto-Indo-European *seh₂u-el,[2] which is cognate with Latin sol, Sanskrit surya, Old English swegl, Old Norse sól, Welsh haul, Avestan hvar, etc.[3] The name Helen is thought to share this etymology,[4][5][6][7] and may express an early alternate personification of the sun among Hellenic peoples.
