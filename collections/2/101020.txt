A round, moist lumpy clump of clay body is thrown at a wheelhead or a bat attached to it. (The term "bat" refers to a secondary disc or square, made of wood – or more recently plastic – to which the lump of clay is attached instead of the wheel head, thereby permitting the finished piece to be more easily lifted from the wheel.) The lump or clump is made even and forced to the centre of the wheel by applying pressure with the hands. The thrower finds the centre of the clay by moving a thumb across the lump until no more friction is felt. The thumb is pressed into the centre of the lump, stopping about 5 mm (1⁄4 inch) from the wheel head. The hole made is widened. The sides thus defined are pulled up and made thinner by pressure between the hands. The vessel is shaped, and the mouth is smoothed. The vessel is cut from the wheelhead or bat with a cheese wire and left to stiffen. Sometimes the stiffened vessel is inverted on the wheel and trimmed with a sharp tool.
