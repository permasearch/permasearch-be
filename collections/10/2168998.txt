Currently, 80% of Hispanic students in the U.S. are English Language Learners.[138] In 2008-9, 5.3 million students were classified as English Language Learners (ELLs) in pre-K to 12th grade.[139] This is a result of many students entering the education system at different ages, although the majority of ELLs are not foreign born.[139] In order to provide English instruction for Latino students there have been a multitude of English Language programs. However, the great majority of these programs are English Immersion, which arguably undermines the studentsâ€™ culture and knowledge of their primary language.[135] As such, there continues to be great debate within schools as to which program can address these language disparities.
