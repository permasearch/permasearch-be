The new formed girl group are in thoughts of maybe adding a fifth member. As of 24 July 2013, Dodient Records have taken Belle Amie off the label. The girls are now looking to find a new firm that can take the newly formed Belle Amie to success. "Girls Up" was re-recorded with Batist and White's voices, and their debut album as a new group will be entitled Fresh Girl.
