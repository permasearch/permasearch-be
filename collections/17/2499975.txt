The world's first documented baseball game took place in Beachville, Ontario on June 4, 1838.[citation needed]  Although more strongly associated with the United States, baseball has existed in Canada from the very beginning. The world's oldest baseball park still in operation is Labatt Park in London, Ontario.[citation needed] It is home to the London Majors of the semi-pro Intercounty Baseball League.
