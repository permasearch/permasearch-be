The Lucy Show is an American sitcom that aired on CBS from 1962â€“68. It was Lucille Ball's follow-up to I Love Lucy. A significant change in cast and premise for the fourth season (1965-1966) divides the program into two distinct eras; aside from Ball, only Gale Gordon, who joined the program for its second season, remained. For the first three seasons, Vivian Vance was the co-star.
