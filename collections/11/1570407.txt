The song received positive reviews from most music critics. Harley Brown of Billboard praised the track, calling it "[t]he first turning point of the record [...] where Smith goes home, dries off, and picks himself back up." Brown also added that "[t]he violins surging behind the breakdown are so high-pitched they practically sting."[17] Lily Moayeri of The A.V. Club calling it one of the album's driving forces, noting that it "illustrates this with sophisticated piano and escalating strings."[11] Ryan Lathan of PopMatters observed that "the charming 'I'm Not the Only One' confidently struts out from the rest of the set. An obvious candidate for future single, itâ€™s the type of track that elicits head bobbing and finger snapping the second it begins."[18] Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone called it "gorgeously bruising",[19] while Andy Kellman of AllMusic picked it as one of the album's best tracks.[20] Eric Davidson of CMJ thought that "[t]he Al Green vibe of 'I'm Not The Only One' has a verging-on-stern sentiment couched in a deeper groove that seems like a good direction Smith could head in."[21]
