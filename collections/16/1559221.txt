ICI is painless and is the easiest and most common insemination technique. This method closely replicates the ejaculation of semen by the penis during sexual intercourse, with fresh sperm being directly deposited into the vagina, and onto the neck of the cervix. It is the simplest type of artificial insemination, and unwashed or raw semen is normally used, but semen supplied by a sperm bank which has been prepared for IUI use may also be used. The procedure is commonly used in home, self-insemination and practitioner insemination procedures, and for insemination where semen is provided by private donors.
