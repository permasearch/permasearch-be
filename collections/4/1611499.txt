Ordinarily, when sound waves in air strike liquid, most of the energy is reflected off the surface of the liquid.  The middle ear allows the impedance matching of sound traveling in air to acoustic waves traveling in a system of fluids and membranes in the inner ear.  This system should not be confused, however, with the propagation of sound as compression waves in  liquid.
