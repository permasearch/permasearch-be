Ammonium phosphate is the salt of ammonium and phosphate. It is a highly unstable compound with the formula (NH4)3PO4. Because of its instability, it is elusive and of no commercial value (except for scientific research). In addition to (NH4)3PO4, a related double salt (NH4)2HPO4 is also recognized. It too is unstable. The instability of these salts results in their facile decomposition with evolution of ammonia:[2]
