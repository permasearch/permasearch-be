Both Homo erectus and Homo neanderthalensis became extinct by the end of the Paleolithic, having been replaced by a new wave of humans, the anatomically modern Homo sapiens sapiens, which emerged in eastern Africa c. 200,000 BP, left Africa around 50,000 BP, and expanded throughout the planet. It is likely that multiple groups coexisted for some time in certain locations. Neanderthals were still found in parts of Eurasia c. 30,000 BP years, and engaged in a limited degree of interbreeding with modern humans. Hominin fossils not belonging either to Homo neanderthalensis or to Homo sapiens species, found in the Altai Mountains and Indonesia, were radiocarbon dated to c. 30,000 – c. 40,000 BP and c. 17,000 BP respectively.
