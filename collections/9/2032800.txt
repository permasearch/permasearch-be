Since the early 1990s, Runner's World has expanded outside the United States, currently with 18 international editions. The first was a United Kingdom edition wholly owned by NatMag Rodale, a joint venture between Rodale Inc. and The Hearst Corporation in the UK. Editions in Argentina, Australia/New Zealand, Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, and Turkey are published either as joint ventures or through licensing arrangements with publishers in those countries. Editors in each country have access to editorial content from the U.S. edition, but also publish their own original content with local flavor.
