The population has increased every year since the establishment of the Dominion of Canada in 1867; however, the population of Newfoundland  was not included prior to its entry into confederation as Canada's tenth province in 1949.[31][32] The first national census of the country was taken in 1871, with a population count around 3,689,000.[33] The year with the least population growth (in real terms) was 1882â€“1883, when only 30,000 new individuals were enumerated.[32]
