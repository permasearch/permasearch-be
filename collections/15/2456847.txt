The Wessagusset Colony (sometimes called the Weston Colony or Weymouth Colony) was a short-lived trading colony located in present-day Weymouth, Massachusetts. It was settled in August 1622 by between 50 and 60 colonists who were ill-prepared for colonial life. After settling without adequate provisions[14] and harming relations with local Native Americans,[15] the colony was dissolved in late March 1623. The surviving colonists either joined the Plymouth Colony or returned to England.[16]
