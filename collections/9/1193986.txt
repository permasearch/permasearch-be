Carrie arrives back at her apartment after abruptly moving out of her father's house. She changes into a cocktail dress, seemingly to go out and hunt for a one-night stand, but then stops herself. Instead she devours over a dozen pills along with a lot of wine, and proceeds to lie down on her bed, waiting to die. After a short time, she reconsiders, bolting to the bathroom and forcing herself to vomit up the pills.
