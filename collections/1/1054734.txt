The legend of the "Old Widow's Stone" (姥が石, Ubagaishi) is another folklore story associated with the castle.[5] According to the legend, Toyotomi Hideyoshi ran out of stones when building the original three-story keep, and an old woman heard about his trouble.[5] She gave him her hand millstone even though she needed it for her trade.[5] It was said that people who heard the story were inspired and also offered stones to Hideyoshi, speeding up construction of the castle.[5] To this day, the supposed stone can be seen covered with a wire net in the middle of one of the stone walls in the castle complex.[5]
