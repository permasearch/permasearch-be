Hormones released from the pancreas regulate the overall metabolism of glucose.[10] Insulin and glucagon are the primary hormones involved in maintaining a steady level of glucose in the blood, and the release of each is controlled by the amount of nutrients currently available.[10] The amount of insulin released in the blood and sensitivity of the cells to the insulin both determine the amount of glucose that cells break down.[4] Increased levels of glucagon activates the enzymes that catalyze glycogenolysis, and inhibits the enzymes that catalyze glycogenesis.[8] Conversely, glycogenesis is enhanced and glycogenolysis inhibited when there are high levels of insulin in the blood.[8]
