Jawaharlal Nehru encouraged the Parliament of India to pass the amendment in response to State of Madras v. Champakam Dorairajan, which went before the Madras High Court and then the Supreme Court of India. In that case, a Brahmin woman in Madras challenged the state's Communal General Order, which established caste quotas in government-supported medical and engineering schools, on the grounds that it denied her equality under the law; both courts had upheld her petition.[4] Aside from Nehru, B. R. Ambedkar also spoke in support of the proposed amendment, while Syama Prasad Mookerjee spoke in opposition to it.[5]
