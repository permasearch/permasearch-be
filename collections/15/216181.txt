In the Year 2000 the German polar explorer Arved Fuchs built a detailed copy of Shackleton's boat named James Caird II. In his expedition titled 'Shackleton 2000' he succeeded in replicating the voyage of Shackleton and his crew from Elephant Island to South Georgia. The James Caird II was among the first exhibitions when the International Maritime Museum in Hamburg was opened. A further replica, James Caird III was built by boat builder Bob Wallace of Massachusetts; it was purchased by the South Georgia Heritage Trust and since 2008 has been on display at the Carr Maritime Gallery, part of the South Georgia Museum at Grytviken.[52] In 2011, a new 10.5-metre survey motor boat (SMB) was named James Caird IV; it operates from HMS Protector (A173), the Royal Navy's ice patrol ship.[53]
