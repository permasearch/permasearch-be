Companion legislation introduced in the House also imposed an all-purpose "general duty" clause on the enforcing agency as well.[7] With the stricter approach of the Democratic bill apparently favored by a majority of both chambers,[7] and unions now strongly supporting a bill,[12][13] Republicans introduced a new, competing bill.[7] The compromise bill established the independent research and standard-setting board favored by Nixon, while creating a new enforcement agency. The compromise bill also gave the Department of Labor the power to litigate on the enforcement agency's behalf (as in the Democratic bill).[7] In November 1970, both chambers acted: The House passed the Republican compromise bill, while the Senate passed the stricter Democratic bill (which now included the general duty clause).[7]
