When Mamta says that Prem and Preeti must stay here after marriage, Prem gets infuriated. They get into a heated argument in which Prem tries to make his mother realize her mistake by pointing out that if not for Vivek, he and Vinod won't be alive. Prem also accuses his mother that she is showing her true face of being a step-mother. This leads to Mamta slapping him, which indicates that she still loves Vivek. Prem ends his conversation by swearing on her most beloved sister-in-law, Sadhna, whom she brought home with love, that he won't marry Preeti unless the both of them come home. Mamta gets dumbfounded. Prem goes to Preeti's house and tells her father. Pritam tells Prem that he is aware that he would end up in this decision and already told Preeti and assures him that she respects his decision. Prem meets Preeti and she tells him that she also respects Vivek and Sadhna just like he does and that they won't get married until they return. She also tells him that she will take care of Sadhna's delivery.
