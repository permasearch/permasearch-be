In "Life of Brian", Stewie is the one who takes Brian's death the hardest, and when the family adopts a new dog named Vinny, he tries to get rid of him, feeling no one could ever replace his best friend. Two episodes later, in "Christmas Guy", Stewie finds a way to go back in time (despite destroying his time machine) and save Brian, parting ways with Vinny. After he had saved Brian, he joyously said, "you're alive my friend", as he hugged him. As he was explaining to Brian what had happened, Stewie said, "that car killed you, and when it did, a little part of me died as well."
