To be admitted to membership of the ICAEW, applicants must generally complete 450 days of relevant work experience (training) and pass a series of examinations. During the training, the candidate will also need to display professional ethics and skepticism along with showing a commitment towards continuous professional development, which must be maintained even once the qualification has been obtained. This pathway is defined as the ACA qualification. It is common for accountancy employers in the UK, such as the Big Four, to offer the ACA as part of their training contract for new joiners.
