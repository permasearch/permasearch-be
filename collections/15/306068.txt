Galileo was the first to demonstrate and then formulate these equations. He used a ramp to study rolling balls, the ramp slowing the acceleration enough to measure the time taken for the ball to roll a known distance.[1][2] He measured elapsed time with a water clock, using an "extremely accurate balance" to measure the amount of water.[note 1]
