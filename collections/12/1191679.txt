An old man named George watches TV. In fact, he is actually watching some Forever Knights live. The group of Forever Knights that he is watching tries to break an ancient seal. The Knights headed up by Sir Reginald knew that behind that seal was the secret of the First Forever Knight, and possibly a cache of alien tech. A squire named Winston tries to tell Sir Reginald that this is a bad idea, but they ignore him and continue to break the seal. A bright light suddenly shone from the cracks in the seal. Old Man George runs away from the TV and leaves his home. The team goes to the place that the Knights were and encounter another Forever Knights group led by Sir Cyrus (who claims that his group is much different from the Forever Knights led by Patrick, Urian and Driscoll). Gwen finds that a monster was sealed there.
