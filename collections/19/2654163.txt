Shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War Ashton was offered a position in New York with what was to become the American Ballet Theatre. He declined, and returned to de Valois' company, soon renamed "Sadler's Wells Ballet".[1] He created some works along more sombre lines, including Dante Sonata, which symbolised the unending struggle between the children of darkness and the children of light.[15][n 1] In Ballet magazine, Lynette Halewood commented in 2000, "No other work by Ashton is so disturbing and so bleak."[16]
