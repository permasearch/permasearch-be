Dixon's failure compounded American ambassador Loy Henderson's suspicions about India's motives and good faith. He concluded that Indian allegations of America's pro-Pakistan bias, which he noted were being quietly stimulated by Nehru himself, made it more suitable for the Commonwealth nations to intervene.

The majority if given the third option would opt for independence.[43]
