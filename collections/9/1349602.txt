The show was sold to a United States network, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), in 1965. The Avengers became one of the first British series to be aired on prime time U.S. television. The ABC network paid the then-unheard-of sum of $2 million for the first 26 episodes. The average budget for each episode was reportedly Â£56,000, which was high for the British industry. The fourth series aired in the U.S. from March to the beginning of September 1966.
