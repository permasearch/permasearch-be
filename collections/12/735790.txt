Kenneth "Monkey" Harris, Paddy the Greek and Sunglasses Ron are Del Boy's friends who are in the same "business" as him. Although they are mentioned regularly, they are never seen on screen. They are often involved in Del's trading deals (although separately), usually sourcing Del's hooky gear, and are often described and mentioned in discussions between other characters in The Nag's Head.
