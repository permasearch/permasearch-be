During this period the Japanese committed many atrocities against the local population of Cagayan de Oro, as they did throughout the Philippines. Colonel Fumio Suski and two hundred of his men escaped capture during the liberation of the city and withdrew into the mountainous jungle. They were caught two years later, only 38 had survived but when caught they had been cannibalizing the Higaonon tribal people. At least 70 people had been eaten.
