The Jain text of Kalpasutra confirms Mahavira's asceticism, whose life is a source of guidance on many of the ascetic practices in Jainism.[8] Such asceticism has been a hallmark of mendicant life in Jainism.[9] The Buddha tried it, but abandoned what he called the "extreme ascetic methods", teaching the Middle Way instead.[10]
