The railroad companies were paid $16,000/mile (approximately $436,000 today) for track laid on a level grade, $32,000/mile (about $872,000 today) for track laid in foothills, and $48,000/mile (or about $1,307,000 today) for track laid in mountains. The two railroad companies sold similar amounts of company-backed bonds and stock.[33]
