Landy was initially hired to treat Brian Wilson by Wilson's wife Marilyn in 1975.[10] Wilson publicly rebelled against the program, saying that the only reason that he went along with it was so that he would not be committed to a psychiatric facility.[3] Beach Boys road manager Rick Nelson later claimed that Landy had attempted to exert unwelcome artistic control over the group.[3] During the recording of 15 Big Ones (1976), group meetings were supervised by Landy, and discussions over each song for the record were reported to last for up to eight hours.[11] Another report suggested that Landy had asked for a percentage of the band's income.[12] At the command of Landy, Wilson appeared on Saturday Night Live, choosing to perform a solo piano rendition of "Good Vibrations" which received mixed feedback.[13] Landy stood off-camera holding signs for Wilson that read "smile". He said that critics misapprehended his motives, elaborating that Wilson's performance "was a terrible thing" as a one-shot, but if he continued making appearances, then he would have gradually overcome his stage fright.[13]
