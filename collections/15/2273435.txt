Averroes, who served as the royal physician at the Almohad court, wrote a number of medical treatises. The most famous was al-Kulliyat fi al-Tibb ("General Principles of Medicine", Latinized in the west as the Colliget), written around 1162, before his appointment at court.[26] The Latin translation became a medical texbook in Europe for centuries.[26] He also wrote summaries of the works of Greek physician Galen (died c.â€‰210) and a commentary on Avicenna's Urjuzah fi al-Tibb ("Poem on Medicine").[26]
