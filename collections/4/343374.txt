Perhaps the most important expression of Islamic architecture is that of the mosque.[346] Varying cultures have an effect on mosque architecture. For example, North African and Spanish Islamic architecture such as the Great Mosque of Kairouan contain marble and porphyry columns from Roman and Byzantine buildings,[347] while mosques in Indonesia often have multi-tiered roofs from local Javanese styles.
