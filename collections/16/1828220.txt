Before the 20th century, the Mexico City portion of the valley contained a series of lakes, with saline lakes to the north near the town of Texcoco and freshwater ones to the south.[4] The five lakes, Zumpango, Xaltoca, Xochimilco, Chalco, and the largest, Texcoco used to cover about 1,500 km2 (580 sq mi) of the basin floor.[2] Small mountains such as the Sierra de Guadalupe and Mount Chiconaultla partially separated the lakes from each other.[20] All the other lakes flowed toward the lower Lake Texcoco, which was saline due to evaporation.[2] The lakes were fed by a number of rivers such as the San Joaquin, San Antonio Abad, Tacubaya, Becerra, Mixcoac and Magdalena Contreras, carrying runoff and snowmelt from the mountains.[2]
