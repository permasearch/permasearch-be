Lance Corporal Sean Tansey, 26, of the Household Cavalry Regiment, died as he repaired a damaged Scimitar tank at a military base in Helmand province on 12 August.[23] This was subsequently found to be due to negligence on the part of the British Ministry of Defence, because the MoD failed to provide his regiment with proper equipment and training.[24]
