Brady missed virtually the entire following season due to a knee injury in the season opener.[77] But he would come back strong in the 2009 season to be named the league's Comeback Player of the Year.[78] In 2010, Brady set the NFL record for consecutive passes without an interception (358)[79] and broke his own record for the highest season touchdown to interception ratio (among players who have started a full season) at 9:1, currently the third best TD:INT ratio for a single season by a quarterback.[80] Brady would win his second league MVP award with all 50 votes in his favor.[81] He was the first unanimous NFL MVP since Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor won the award in 1986.[82] He and Joe Montana are the only players in NFL history to win multiple NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP awards.[83][84] Brady was also named the top player by his peers in the first NFL Top 100 list, released in 2011.[85]
