An unpublished Crisis on Infinite Earths story, written by Marv Wolfman with art by Paul Ryan and Bob McLeod, was published in the February 1999 Legends of the DC Universe: Crisis on Infinite Earths #1. Its events occur during and after Crisis on Infinite Earths #4, and it has the only appearance of Earth-D. The Flash of Earth-D is Tanaka Rei, a Japanese man who idolizes Barry Allen. Allen and Rei meet in Crisis on Infinite Earths when Barry returns from the 30th century to the wrong universe. Since that Earth is under attack by shadow demons, Barry calls on the Justice League and Rei calls on the Justice Alliance (his world's version of the Justice League).
