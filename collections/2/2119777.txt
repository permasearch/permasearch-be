As a way to honor key contributors including players, coaches, fans, broadcasters and announcers, National Basketball Association (NBA) teams often retire their jersey numbers, win totals or microphones. In the case of jersey numbers, they are usually no longer available for future players to wear, although they can ask for permission from players whose jerseys are retired. Teams usually display these numbers by hanging banners on the rafters inside their home arena. Currently, four teams (Los Angeles Clippers, Oklahoma City Thunder, Orlando Magic and Toronto Raptors) do not have any retired numbers.
