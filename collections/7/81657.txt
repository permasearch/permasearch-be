Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days is also the last film in the series to feature the original cast members, as many of the cast (such as Zachary Gordon, Robert Capron and Devon Bostick) outgrew their roles and a re-cast was made for the future films in the series, starting with Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul, which was released five years later.
