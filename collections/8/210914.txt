The National Union Party was created in 1864 prior to the end of the Civil War. A faction of anti-Lincoln Radical Republicans held the belief that Lincoln was incompetent and therefore could not be reelected. A number of Radical Republicans formed a party called the Radical Democracy Party and a few hundred delegates in Cleveland starting on May 31, 1864, eventually nominating John C. Fr√©mont, who had also been the Republicans' first presidential standard-bearer during the 1856 presidential election.
