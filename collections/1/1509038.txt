TR> Rupinder Goraya, her husband Kultar, and their two-year-old son Devyn came to Fort Myers, Florida, from India on a work permit. Rupinder had hoped to start a career and also help out her family back home. After developing a cancerous mass and taking a leave from work, she disappeared. Those who knew her said she might leave the abusive Kultar, but would not leave Devyn. Kultar had called his friend Saroop around the time of Rupinder's disappearance, but stated it was to research opening a restaurant. Not long after that, Kultar put Devyn up for adoption. He also stayed in the country on his wife's visa. He has since stated that his wife left the country, but all of her identifying papers were found in the Fort Myers house. Saroop was questioned in 2014 and stated Kultar called him at the time to ask for an alibi. The state's attorney issued an arrest for Kultar. He was found guilty of second-degree murder in 2016.[40]
