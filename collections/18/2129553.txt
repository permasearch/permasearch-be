From 1990 to 2011, the temple hosted a community garden on its grounds. The Temple Garden occupied about 0.25-acre (1,000Â m2), divided into about 70 small plots worked by nearby residents.[5] In fall 2011, the Temple closed the garden in order to use the space to stage construction equipment for a rehabilitation project.[6]
