Although local extinction of one or more competitors has been less documented than niche separation or competitive exclusion, it does occur. In an experiment involving zooplankton in artificial rock pools, local extinction rates were significantly higher in areas of interspecific competition.[9] In these cases, therefore, the negative effects are not only at the population level but also species richness of communities.
