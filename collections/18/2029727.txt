In 2015, the UN Development Program and the UN Development group postulated a set of 17 goals whose ultimate goal is to transform the world into a better one with emphasis to developing countries. Some of the goals included are aims to end extreme hunger, poverty and gender inequality.[101] While none of the sustainable development goals are specifically meant for Information and Communication Technologies, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development believes that it can help at some extent in achieving the SDGs adding that "The spread of information and communication technology and global interconnectedness has great potential to accelerate human progress, to bridge the digital divide and to develop knowledge societies".[102] The International Telecommunication Union also shares this sentiment and considers that the ICTs can "fast forward progress on the SDGs" which would fundamentally improve the lives of the people.[103]
