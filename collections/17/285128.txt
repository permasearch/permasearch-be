Stalin's second wife was Nadezhda Alliluyeva; theirs was not an easy relationship, and they often rowed.[823] They had two biological children—a son, Vasily, and a daughter, Svetlana—and adopted another son, Artyom Sergeev, in 1921.[824] During his marriage to Nadezhda, Stalin had affairs with many other women, most of whom were fellow revolutionaries or their wives.[825] Nadezdha suspected that this was the case,[826] and committed suicide in 1932.[827] Stalin regarded Vasily as spoiled and often chastised his behaviour; as Stalin's son, Vasily nevertheless was swiftly promoted through the ranks of the Red Army and allowed a lavish lifestyle.[828] Conversely, Stalin had an affectionate relationship with Svetlana during her childhood,[829] and was also very fond of Artyom.[824] In later life, he disapproved of Svetlana's various suitors and husbands, putting a strain on his relationship with her.[830] After the Second World War he made little time for his children and his family played a decreasingly important role in his life.[831] After Stalin's death, Svetlana changed her surname from Stalin to Allilueva,[655] and defected to the U.S.[832]
