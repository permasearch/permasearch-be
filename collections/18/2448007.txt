You Can't Ask That is an ABC original series[2] first released on ABC iview on 3 August 2016.[2] Each episode asks controversial questions sourced from the public[3] to a minority Australian population including people of short stature, Muslims, sex workers, transgender people and more. The show aims to offer insight into the lives of marginalised communities and break down stereotypes while answering the questions people are afraid to ask, reportedly inspired by Ask Me Anything (AMA) threads on Reddit.[4]
