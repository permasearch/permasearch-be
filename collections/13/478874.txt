Due to air pollution causing more than one effect it is hard to attribute a condition only to air pollution or to say how much a given source is responsible. However, it is believed that at least 200 000 human deaths are attributable to air pollution and at least a quarter are due to transportation [7]. This compares with the approximate 33 000 from gun deaths or recent average of 35 000 from motor vehicle collisions . Which are both also attributable to human technology application. There are also significant non-human deaths and effects.
