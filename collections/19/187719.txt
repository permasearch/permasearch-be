On June 2, 2014, Wentz stated that he and Stump were writing new music: "We're writing. I was just listening to something Patrick had written in the trailer. So we're writing, finishing out the album cycle in South Africa in September." In a later interview with Rock Sound regarding the status of the album, Wentz commented "We don't have an exact timetable yet. I have a two-week-old son and Patrick has a baby on the way in October, so there's a lot going on." as well as stating a rough release time as early 2015.[74] In December 2014 the band played radio-sponsored Christmas shows, including KROQ's Almost Acoustic Christmas.[75]
