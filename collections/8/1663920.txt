Canadian rightsholder Rogers Media reinstated Ron MacLean as host of Hockey Night in Canada for the 2016–17 season to replace George Stroumboulopoulos, whose introduction in the 2014–15 season was met with mixed reception by viewers. MacLean will host the early game of the weekly doubleheader, with David Amber handling the late games. Alongside HNIC, MacLean continues to host the travelling, Sunday-night Hometown Hockey games on Sportsnet.[3][4][5]
