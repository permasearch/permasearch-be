A megacity is a very large city, typically with a total population in excess of 10 million people.[1][2] Precise definitions vary: the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs in its 2014 "World Urbanization Prospects" report counted urban agglomerations having over 10 million inhabitants.[3] A University of Bonn report held that they are "usually defined as metropolitan areas with a total population of 10 million or more people".[4] Others list cities satisfying criteria of either 5 or 8 million and also have a population density of 2,000 per square kilometre.[5] A megacity can be a single metropolitan area or two or more metropolitan areas that converge.[citation needed] The terms conurbation, metropolis, and metroplex are also applied to the latter. The term metacity has been used to describe metropolitan conurbations containing over 20 million people.[5]
