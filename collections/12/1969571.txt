The war had a significant impact on the construction program of the Spanish Navy. The second and third Espa√±a-class battleships, built in Spain between 1910 and 1919, were delayed significantly because of material shortages from Britain.[10] Most importantly, the main battery guns for Jaime I did not arrive until 1919, after the war had ended.[11] The projected Reina Victoria Eugenia-class battleships, which also would have relied heavily on imported guns and armour plate, were cancelled outright after the war started.[12]
