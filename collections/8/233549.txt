The best information we have detailing Pennsylvania's prehistory comes from a mix of oral history & archaeology, which pushes the known record back another 500 years, or so. Before the Iroquois pushed out from the St. Lawrence River region, PA appears to have been populated primarily by Algonquians [5] & Siouans. We know from archaeology that the Monongahela had a far more vast territory at the time [6] & the Iroquois Book of Rites shows that there were Siouans along Lake Erie's southern shores as well. The Iroquois collectively called them the Alligewi (better written Adegowe [7] ), or Mound Builders. It is said that this is where the term Allegheny comes from (Adegoweni). Two groups of migrating Iroquoians moved through the region-- an Iroquois related group who spread west along the Great Lakes & a Tuscarora related group who followed the coast straight south. The Eries were the next to split off from the Iroquois & may have once held northwestern PA. An offshoot of them crossed the Ohio & fought back the ancient Monongahela, but later merged with the Susquahannocks to form a single, expanded territory. [8] (Europeans later said that they used the terms White Minqua & Black Minqua to differentiate their ancestries from one another.) A whole other Iroquoian tribe, the Petun, are believed to be Huron related and entered the region after, wedging in between the Eries & Iroquois.
