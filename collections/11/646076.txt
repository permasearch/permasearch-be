Richard and Karen Carpenter signed to A&M Records on April 22, 1969.[42] Since Karen was 19 and underage, her parents had to co-sign.[43] The duo had decided to sign as "Carpenters", without the definite article, which was influenced by names such as Buffalo Springfield or Jefferson Airplane, which they considered "hip".[40]
