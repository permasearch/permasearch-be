The Abbott Government came to office on a platform of "stopping the boats" via Operation Sovereign Borders, increasing army presence in the Indian Ocean and resettling refugees in Cambodia or turning them back to Indonesia or even to their home countries. The government also concluded the Australia Korea Free Trade Agreement and the Japanâ€“Australia Economic Partnership Agreement.[428][429] Abbott responded to multiple foreign policy issues, like the Downing of MH-17, the hosting of the G20 in Brisbane, the trial of an Australian journalist in Egypt and fighting the execution of Australian nationals convicted of drug smuggling, however leadership tensions emerged again and he was ousted by Malcolm Turnbull, who formed the Turnbull Government.
