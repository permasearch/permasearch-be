On August 21, 2014 Carowinds announced the addition of Fury 325 for the 2015 season. Designed by Bolliger & Mabillard, the ride is the fifth-tallest roller coaster in the world, after its debut in the spring of 2015 as another component of the park's previously announced "top-to-bottom" expansion program.[5] A new front entrance, replacing the original North Gate entrance of the park, also opened along with Fury 325 for the 2015 season.
