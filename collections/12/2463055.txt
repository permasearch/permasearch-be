The target of the Junta was anyone believed to be associated with activist groups, including trade union members, students (including underage students, like in Night of the Pencils, an operation directed by Ramón Camps, General and head of the Buenos Aires Provincial Police from April 1976 to December 1977),[19] people who had uncovered evidence of government corruption and people thought to hold left-wing views (including French nuns Léonie Duquet and Alice Domon, kidnapped by Alfredo Astiz). Ramón Camps told Clarín in 1984 that he had used torture as a method of interrogation and orchestrated 5,000 forced disappearances and justified the appropriation of newborns from their imprisoned mothers "because subversive parents will raise subversive children".[49] These individuals who suddenly vanished are called los desaparecidos, meaning "the missing ones" or "dissapeared".
