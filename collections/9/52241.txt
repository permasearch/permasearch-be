The standard term for "groundhog" was grun′daks (from German dachs), with the regional variant in York County being grundsau, a direct translation of the English name, according to a 19th-century book on the dialect.[45] The form was a regional variant according to one 19th century source.[45] However, the weather superstition that begins "Der zwet Hær′ning is Grund′sau dåk. Wânn di grundau îr schâtte sent... ("February second is Groundhog day. If the groundhog sees its shadow...)" is given as common to all 14 counties in Dutch Pennsylvania Country, in a 1915 monograph.[j][46] The form grundsow has been used by the lodge in Allentown and elsewhere.[47]
