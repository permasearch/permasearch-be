On January 10, 2018, West Virginia lawmakers made a bill which would increase speed limits on interstates and limited access highways in rural areas to 80 mph. If that is done, West Virginia could become the 8th state to increase its speed limit to 80 mph, and it would be the third eastern state with a speed limit of greater than 70 mph.[219]
