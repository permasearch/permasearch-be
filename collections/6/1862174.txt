A month before the February 5, 2008 Super Tuesday Georgia Democratic primary, Reed endorsed Barack Obama.[41] In March 2008, Reed announced an exploratory committee, named ONE Atlanta, to investigate his viability as a candidate in the 2009 Atlanta mayoral election.[42] Two-term incumbent Mayor Franklin was term limited and could not run again.[43] His exploratory committee announcement was coupled with an announcement that he would be pursuing a Hillary Clinton-style coalition-building tour.[42] During the summer of 2008, ONE Atlanta announced that the exploratory committee had become a formal campaign committee.[44]
