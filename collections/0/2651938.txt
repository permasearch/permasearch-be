Oakland is one of the most ethnically diverse major cities in the country.[84][85] Oakland was ranked the fourth most diverse city in the United States, with an overall diversity score of 91.4.[86] The city's formerly most populous ethnic group, whites, declined from 95.3% in 1940 to 32.5% by 1990, due to a combination of factors, such as suburbanization. Oakland became a destination for African Americans in the Great Migration during and after World War II as they gained high-paying jobs in the defense industry. Since the 1960s, Oakland has been known as a center of Northern California's African-American community.
