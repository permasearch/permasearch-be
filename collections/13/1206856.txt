The settlers officially disembarked on December 21, 1620. It is traditionally said that the Pilgrims first set foot in America at the site of Plymouth Rock, though no historical evidence can prove this claim.[16] They named their settlement "Plimouth" (sometimes spelled "Plimoth") after the major port city in Devon, England from which the Mayflower ultimately sailed.
