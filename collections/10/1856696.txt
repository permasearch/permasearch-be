Marine One is the call sign of any United States Marine Corps aircraft carrying the President of the United States.[1] It usually denotes a helicopter operated by Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1 "Nighthawks"), either the large Sikorsky VH-3D Sea King or the newer, smaller VH-60N "White Hawk". Both Helicopters are called "White Tops" because of the paint job they carry. Any Marine Corps aircraft carrying the Vice President has the call sign Marine Two.
