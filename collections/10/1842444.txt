The seemingly rapid appearance of fossils in the "Primordial Strata" was noted by William Buckland in the 1840s,[9] and in 1859 Charles Darwin discussed it as one of the main objections that could be made against the theory of evolution by natural selection.[10] The long-running puzzlement about the appearance of the Cambrian fauna, seemingly abruptly, without precursor, centers on three key points: whether there really was a mass diversification of complex organisms over a relatively short period of time during the early Cambrian; what might have caused such rapid change; and what it would imply about the origin of animal life. Interpretation is difficult due to a limited supply of evidence, based mainly on an incomplete fossil record and chemical signatures remaining in Cambrian rocks.
