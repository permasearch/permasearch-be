Between 1270 and 1280, Hasan al-Rammah wrote his al-furusiyyah wa al-manasib al-harbiyya (The Book of Military Horsemanship and Ingenious War Devices), which included 107 gunpowder recipes, 22 of which are for rockets.[9] According to Ahmad Y Hassan, al-Rammah's recipes were more explosive than rockets used in China at the time.[10][11][12] The terminology used by al-Rammah indicates a Chinese origin for the gunpowder weapons he wrote about, such as rockets and fire lances.[13] Ibn al-Baitar, an Arab from Spain who had immigrated to Egypt, described saltpeter as "snow of China" (Arabic: ثلج الصين‎ thalj al-ṣīn). Al-Baytar died in 1248.[14][15] The earlier Arab historians called saltpeter "Chinese snow" and " Chinese salt."[16][17] The Arabs used the name "Chinese arrows" to refer to rockets.[18][19][20][21][22][23][24] The Arabs called fireworks "Chinese flowers".[13] While saltpeter was called "Chinese Snow" by Arabs, it was called "Chinese salt" (Persian: نمک چینی‎ namak-i čīnī) by the Iranians,[25][26][27][28][29] or "salt from the Chinese marshes" (namak shūra chīnī Persian: نمک شوره چيني‎).[30][31]
