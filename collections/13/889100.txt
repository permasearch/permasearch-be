Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney[a] is a visual novel adventure puzzle video game for the Nintendo 3DS, and was developed by both Level-5 and Capcom, the former publishing it in Japan while Nintendo published it worldwide. The game is a crossover between two games series from both developers, combining the puzzle and exploration elements of Level-5's Professor Layton series, and the general trial mechanics of Capcom's Ace Attorney adventure series, the latter enhanced by the addition of a few new elements.[6][7] Shu Takumi, the series director for the Ace Attorney series, assisted with the scenario designs for the game. The plot focuses on Professor Layton and Phoenix Wright, along with their associated assistants, working together to solve the mystery behind a young girl that they both encounter separately, and a strange world they are brought to through her, with Layton focused on finding clues to solve the mystery, while Wright focuses on protecting people who are put on trial for being "witches".
