In the episode "Where No One Has Gone Before" the Enterprise-D was shown to exceed Warp 10, traveling 2.7 million light-years from their home galaxy in a matter of minutes (though the ship's extreme velocity was due to the influence of an alien being and could not be achieved by starship engines). The Intrepid-class starship Voyager has a maximum sustainable cruising speed of Warp 9.975; the Enterprise-E can go even faster, with a maximum velocity of Warp 9.999[citation needed]. In the alternative future depicted in "All Good Things...", the series finale of The Next Generation, the "future" Enterprise-D travels at Warp 13, although it is never established whether this is truly "above" Warp 10, or simply the result of another reconfiguration of the warp scale.
