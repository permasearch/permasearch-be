Each industry has its own specifications and methods for measuring thermal properties. The Shirley Togmeter is unsuitable for duvets because the large scale of their quilted construction makes it impractical to obtain a representative sample of suitable size. BS5335 describes apparatus for duvet tog testing. This consists of a metal plate at least 1000 mm x 600 mm at skin temperature (33°C) arranged to support the whole duvet, and a mechanism for measuring the air temperature above the quilt. This requires very precise control of the laboratory environment in order to get reliable results.
