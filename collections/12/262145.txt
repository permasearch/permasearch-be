Telomere shortening is associated with aging, mortality and aging-related diseases. In 2003, Richard Cawthon discovered that those with longer telomeres lead longer lives than those with short telomeres.[27] However, it is not known whether short telomeres are just a sign of cellular age or actually contribute to the aging process themselves.[citation needed]
