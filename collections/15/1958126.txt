Some people find chickens' behaviour entertaining and educational[52] and they are sometimes kept as pets.[53] Chickens can be tamed by hand feeding,[54] although roosters can sometimes become aggressive and noisy. Aggression may be curbed with proper handling. Some have advised against keeping them around very young children[citation needed]. Certain breeds, such as silkies and many bantam varieties, are generally docile and are often recommended as good pets around children with disabilities.[55]
