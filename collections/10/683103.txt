Mr. Howard (David St. James) is a mean math teacher and detention moderator with an extremely unpleasant personality. A vindictive, hateful, perpetually angry person that hates practically everything â€“ laughter, children, and even his wife. Everyone at Ridgeway, including Carly and her friends as well as Principal Franklin, dislike him, and the feeling is mutual. In later episodes, however, he has shown some respect towards Carly, Freddie, and Gibby. He appears in "iParty with Victorious", in which he seems very fond of Steven, Carly's boyfriend. He returns in the episode "iOpen a Restaurant" where he finds out about the secret restaurant Gibby had opened in the old school basement. He convinces Principal Franklin (who is there enjoying himself) to close it down, to which Franklin agrees to do. It is not until Mr. Howard leaves the basement that Principal Franklin blind-sides his request and tells Gibby to keep it open. He is in love with Miss Briggs.
