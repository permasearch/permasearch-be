In the first season of the sequel series The Legend of Korra, which picks up 70 years after Ozai's defeat, Katara (now an elderly woman) states that Sokka is deceased; in the third season, Tenzin (Katara and Aang's son) mentions that Sokka was present when a gang of criminals attempted to abduct Korra as a child. Flashbacks reveal that a middle-aged Sokka served as the representative of the Southern Water Tribe on the United Republic Council 40 years prior.
