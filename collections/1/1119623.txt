When first introducing Sasuke, Kishimoto wrote him as a rival who never noticed Naruto. However, as the series continued, Naruto became strong enough to finally be recognized by Sasuke as a rival. He also intended both as brothers due to the fact both characters suffered loneliness, something which made the readers relate to them as he noted through fan letters. By Part I's ending, the bond between Naruto and Sasuke was weakened as a result of their fight but still expected the time when the Sasuke accepted Naruto as an equal.[1] Kishimoto compared Sasuke and Naruto to the concept of yin and yang because of their notable differences. When one of the two progressed, Kishimoto made sure the other did too.[9] Before the serialization began, Kishimoto had decided the ending would feature a fight between these two characters.[10] He wanted the conflict to end with Naruto forgiving Sasuke as he had forgiven Nagato.[11] By 2013 when the series was reaching its climax, Kishimoto told the readers to look forward to the final fight between the two characters.[1] In regards to the fight, Kishimoto wanted to focus on hand-to-hand combat rather than ninja techniques.[12] Anime staff Chengxi Huang said the animated adaptation of this fight, the group worked carefully to depict the action in every scene by showing changes on Sasuke and Naruto's clothes and hair. Huang added he felt fatigue by working so much into this fight due to reaching 70 successive cuts at a time.[13]
