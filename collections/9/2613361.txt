Mating occurs in temperate, subtropical seas during the winter. Gestation is estimated to vary around 10​3⁄4 months,[48] 11​1⁄4 months,[49] or one year,[50] depending which model of foetal growth is used. The different estimates result from scientists' inability to observe an entire pregnancy; most reproductive data for baleen whales were obtained from animals caught by commercial whalers, which offer only single snapshots of fetal growth. Researchers attempt to extrapolate conception dates by comparing fetus size and characteristics with newborns.
