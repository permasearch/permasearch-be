A quiz app titled Deal or No Deal - Noel's Quiz was released on 12 March 2015.[46] Available on iOS and Android, the app allows users to play the Banker in a multiple-choice quiz based on the TV show's gameplay. When asked about the app, Edmonds said "I've lost count of the number of Deal or No Deal fans who have stopped me in the street to ask how they can get to play the game. With this app they can take the Walk of Wealth wherever and whenever they like and I can't wait for them to Spank the Banker on it."[47]
