On 23 March 1942, FÃ¼hrer Directive Number 40 called for the official creation of the Atlantic Wall - a line of concrete gun emplacements, machine-gun nests, minefields and beach obstacles stretching along the French coast. Fortifications were initially concentrated around ports, but were extended into other areas beginning in late 1943.[37] While the German army had seen its strength and morale heavily depleted by campaigns in Russia, North Africa and Italy, it remained a powerful fighting force.[38] Most of the German divisions along the French coast in late 1943, however, were either formations of new recruits or battered veteran units still resting and rebuilding after service on the Eastern Front; altogether some 856,000 soldiers were stationed in France, predominantly along the Channel coast.[38] They were supported by an additional 60,000 Hilfswillige (Russian and Polish conscripts to the German army).[39]
