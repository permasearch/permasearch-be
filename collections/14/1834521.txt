Pain medication such as NSAIDs and paracetamol (acetaminophen) helps in the management of pain associated with strep throat.[23] Viscous lidocaine may also be useful.[24] While steroids may help with the pain,[11][25] they are not routinely recommended.[6] Aspirin may be used in adults but is not recommended in children due to the risk of Reye syndrome.[11]
