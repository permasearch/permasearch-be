A second biotechnology district is being planned for the median strip on Frontage Road, on land cleared for the never-built Route 34 extension.[188] As of late 2009, a Pfizer drug-testing clinic, a medical laboratory building serving Yale â€“ New Haven Hospital, and a mixed-use structure containing parking, housing and office space, have been constructed on this corridor.[188] A former SNET telephone building at 300 George Street is being converted into lab space, and has been so far quite successful in attracting biotechnology and medical firms.[188]
