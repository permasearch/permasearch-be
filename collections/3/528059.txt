Shaktism focuses on goddess worship of Shakti or Devi as cosmic mother,[210] and it is particularly common in northeastern and eastern states of India such as Assam and Bengal. Devi is depicted as in gentler forms like Parvati, the consort of Shiva; or, as fierce warrior goddesses like Kali and Durga. Followers of Shaktism recognize Shakti as the power that underlies the male principle. Shaktism is also associated with Tantra practices.[222] Community celebrations include festivals, some of which include processions and idol immersion into sea or other water bodies.[223]
