From 644 to 655, Navasurendrādityanandi was King of Palola (Gilgit). In 706/707, Jayamaṅgalavikramādityanandi became king of Palola. It is said that in the year 717, a delegation of a ruler of great Palola, named Su-fu-she-li-ji-li-ni (Chinese: 蘇弗舍利支離泥; pinyin: sūfúshèlìzhīlíní), reached the Chinese imperial court. In 719, Su-fu-she-li-ji-li-ni, King of Palola, sent a second delegation to the Chinese Imperial court.[27][28] By at least 719/720, Ladakh (Mard) was part of the Tibetan Empire. By that time, Buddhism was practiced in Baltistan, and Sanskrit was the written language. It is unknown if Baltistan temporarily was ruled under Palola at that time. In 720, the delegation of Sou-lin-t'o i che (= Surendrāditya, Chinese: 蘇麟陀逸之; pinyin: sūlíntuóyìzhī), King of Palola, went to the Chinese imperial court.[29] The Emperor gave the ruler of Cashmere, "Tchen-fo-lo-pi-li (Chandrāpīḍa)", the title of "King of Cashmere". By 721/722, Baltistan had came under the influence of the Tibetan Empire.[30]
