Originally a low-budget film by a new studio, Vestron Pictures, Dirty Dancing became a massive box office hit. As of 2009[update], it has earned over $214 million worldwide.[2] It was the first film to sell more than a million copies on home video,[2] and the Dirty Dancing soundtrack created by Jimmy Ienner generated two multi-platinum albums and multiple singles, including "(I've Had) The Time of My Life", which won both the Golden Globe and Academy Award for Best Original Song, and a Grammy Award for best duet.[3] The film's popularity led to a 2004 prequel, Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, as well as a stage version which has had sellout performances in Australia, Europe, and North America.
