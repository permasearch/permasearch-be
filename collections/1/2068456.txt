In order to prepare for branding, a site for the brand is selected. This is important for several reasons: First, certain states and counties have different laws on legal brand placement. Another factor is the muscle underneath the skin. If part of the brand is pressed against muscle and the other part against bone, this will cause the pressure exerted on the head of the brand to be uneven. This can result in an uneven brand.[2]
