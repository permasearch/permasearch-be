The statewide sales tax in California was first imposed on August 1, 1933, at the rate of 2.50% under the "Retail Sales Act of 1933."[9] No local sales taxes were levied at that time. In an editorial dated September 5, 1933, the Los Angeles Times criticized the 2.50% sales tax rate in stating that the "sales-tax rate should not have exceeded 1 per cent" and that the tax rate was "so high as to discourage business, which will make the tax less productive."[10]
