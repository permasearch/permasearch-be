Isla Nublar is not shown in The Lost World: Jurassic Park, a 1997 film adaptation of Crichton's The Lost World novel. No details are provided as to the fate of Isla Nublar after the events in Jurassic Park, although it is implied that Isla Nublar is abandoned and the dinosaurs on the island have been exterminated. This is why InGen seeks to recoup some of its losses from Jurassic Park by capturing the surviving dinosaurs on Isla Sorna and bringing them to San Diego. John Hammond reveals that Isla Nublar was the "showroom" for the tourists, while Isla Sorna, 87 miles further west, was the breeding-ground where the dinosaurs were cloned and nurtured before being moved to Nublar. The facility in San Diego, an enormous amphitheater, was built before John Hammond decided on relocating the park to Isla Nublar.
