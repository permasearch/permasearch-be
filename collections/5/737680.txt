The film serves as a prequel to the original manga, depicting the one year interval between Kenshiro's defeat at the hands of Shin and their later battle. Unlike the prior movies, this film has a completely original storyline in which Kenshiro, near death after his battle with Shin and having used his remaining energy to kill a pack of wolves, was captured by slavers. Due to his strength, Kenshiro could escape whenever he wanted, but chose to stay and protect the other slaves. This experience further explores what reinforces Kenshiro's resolve to fight for the innocent and to bring justice upon the wicked in the post apocalyptic wasteland as the Savior of Century's End.
