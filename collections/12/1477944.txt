Players often express a fear of competing with 14 and 15 Year-Old players who have already experienced one or two years playing on a standard 90' diamond. Babe Ruth League introduced this prep league - comprising teams with only 13-year-old players-to foster more participation in the game for this age group. This league offers the 13-year-old player the assurance to play without age intimidation and the chance to participate in the 13-Year-Old World Series.
