Season 5 featured more significant changes from the novels. Some of the changes were more well-received than others (the sexual assault scene was heavily criticized and caused great controversy).[63] The various plotlines for the season also differed significantly in reception. The Dornish subplot received an overwhelmingly negative reception.[64] In particular, the hyped Sand Snakes were maligned by critics and fans alike, as many found them cheesy and unlikeable.[65] In contrast, Tyrion's storyline was highly praised. Many fans felt that his subplot progressed overly slowly in the novels, and his meeting with Daenerys was particularly lauded.[66]
