Another point of criticism raised by Bastiat was whether men can be better off in the state of nature, working in isolation. Bastiat provided an example of a day laborer of his time, who, thanks to the division of labor in a free society, can easily obtain several pieces of clothing, bread, a cot, and a shelter. The division of labor, which leaves some men producing cots, others bread, and yet others building shelters, benefits him more than having to go through the pain of obtaining all these things alone, without cooperation. As such, Bastiat concluded, returning to the illusionary "state of nature", by which, in economic sense, Rousseau means essentially the isolation of efforts, would doom mankind and force it to suffer unncesessary hardships.[137]
