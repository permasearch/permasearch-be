By 19 September 2013, Team New Zealand lead Oracle Team USA 8–1 needing just one more win to take the Cup. In Race 13 Team New Zealand were minutes away from winning the cup when the race time limits came into effect, causing the race to be cancelled. The race was then replayed and Oracle Team USA won – and went on to win all last eight races to come from behind – and take the Cup.[16] It had been the longest-ever event by both number of days and races, and the first since the 25th America's Cup to feature a winner-take-all final race.
