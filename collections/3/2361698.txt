The British Whipcracking Convention is a place for all who are interested in whip cracking. This ranges from complete novices who have never picked up a whip, through intermediate skills to expert skill sharing. There are workshops for the differing skill levels as well as competitions and targets. The third convention was  held in Aldersley Leisure Village, Aldersley Road, Wolverhampton on 14 July 2007.
