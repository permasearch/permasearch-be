When Hong Kong was under British administration, diplomatic missions of Commonwealth countries, such as Canada,[3] Australia,[4] New Zealand,[5] India,[6] Malaysia,[7] and Singapore[8] were known as commissions. After the transfer of sovereignty to China in 1997, they were renamed consulates-general.[9] with the last commissioner becoming consul-general.[10] However, the Australian commission had been renamed the consulate-general in 1986.[11]
