A huge energy field in the shape of a glowing green hand appears and grabs the Enterprise, halting its movement. Captain James T. Kirk tries to shake the ship free, but to no avail. A humanoid apparition appears on the bridge viewscreen and addresses the ship's crew. Kirk demands that the ship be set free, but the being responds by tightening its grip, threatening to crush the ship.
