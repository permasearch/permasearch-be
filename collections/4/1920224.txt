On 10 June, the SDF entered the Roman suburb and were locked "in fierce fighting", while they were reinforcing the western half of Al-Sabahiya.[70] The International Coalition itself stated that they had destroyed numerous targets in Raqqa between 7â€“9 June; a minefield, eleven fighting positions, four vehicles, three ISIL headquarters, two vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs) and an ISIL-held building.[71] At the end of the day, the SDF managed to take control over Harqaliya Suburb.[72] During the battle, US forces reportedly used white phosphorus munitions several times. A spokesman for the U.S. military did not confirm or deny the allegation.[73]
