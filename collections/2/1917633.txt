Washington's family moved to a home on Ferry Farm, Stafford County, Virginia near Fredericksburg when he was 6 years old, where he spent much of his boyhood.[8] The main farmhouse was "a fairly common English building with some regional variations,"[8] 1Â½ stories high with several cellars; it was considered architecturally elaborate for its time and place.[8] The family kept 10 slaves in the main farmhouse and outbuildings, and another 20 near the farm.[9] Washington is said to have damaged his father's cherry tree on Ferry Farm, according to American folk legend.[9]
