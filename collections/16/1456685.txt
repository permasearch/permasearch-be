Emoji are pictograms that can be used and displayed inline with text.[54][55] They are similar to previous symbol typefaces, but with a much larger range of characters, such as symbols for common objects, animals, food types, weather and emotions. Originally developed in Japan, they are now commonly installed on many computer and smartphone operating systems.[56][57] Following standardisation and inclusion in the Unicode standard, allowing them to be used internationally, the number of Emoji characters has rapidly increased to meet the demands of an expanded range of cultures using them; unlike many previous symbol typefaces, they are interchangeable with the ability to display the pictures of the same meaning in a range of fonts on different operating systems.[58][59] The popularity of emoji has meant that characters have sometimes gained culture-specific meanings not inherent to the design.[60][61][62] Both colour and monochrome emoji typefaces exist, as well as at least one animated design.[63]
