Sawfish fishing goes back several thousand years,[7] but until relatively recently it typically involved traditional low-intensity methods such as simple hook-and-line or spearing. In most regions the major population decline in sawfish started in the 1960sâ€“1980s.[7][80][88] This coincided with a major growth in demand of fins for shark fin soup, the expansion of the international shark finning fishing fleet,[80] and a proliferation of modern nylon fishing nets.[88] The exception is the dwarf sawfish which was relatively widespread in the Indo-Pacific, but by the early 1900s it had already disappeared from most of its range, only surviving for certain in Australia (there is a single recent possible record from the Arabian region).[3][89] The saw has been described as sawfish's Achilles' heel, as it easily becomes entangled in fishing nets.[90] Sawfish can also be difficult or dangerous to release from nets, meaning that some fishers will kill them even before bringing them aboard the boat,[54] or cut off the saw to keep it/release the fish. Because it is their main hunting device, the long-term survival of saw-less sawfish is highly questionable.[91] In Australia where sawfish have to be released if caught, the narrow sawfish has the highest mortality rate,[64] but it is still almost 50% for dwarf sawfish caught in gill nets.[89] In an attempt of lowering this, a guide to sawfish release has been published.[92]
