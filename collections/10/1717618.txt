Article 11 has been and is a point of contention in popular culture disputes on the doctrine of separation of church and state as it applies to the founding principles of the United States. Some religious spokesmen claim that—despite unanimous ratification by the U.S. Senate of the text in English which contained Article 11—the page containing Article 11 is missing from the Arabic version of the treaty.[10] The contemporaneous purpose of Article 11 was to make clear that the United States was a secular state[12] and to reassure the Muslims that the agreement was not with an extension of earlier Christian nations that took part in the Crusades.[13]
