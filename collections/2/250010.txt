After Paris, Rouen was the second largest city in France (70,000 inhabitants in 1550), in large part because of its port.  Marseille (French since 1481) was France's second major port: it benefited greatly from France's trading agreements signed in 1536 with Suleiman the Magnificent.  To increase maritime activity, Francis I founded the port city of Le Havre in 1517.  Other significant ports included Toulon, Saint Malo and La Rochelle.
