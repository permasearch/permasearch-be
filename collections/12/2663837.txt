Once rare in the United States, cases of pertussis (whooping cough) are appearing across the country with greater frequency.[64] To address this issue, the March of Dimes and Sanofi Pasteur launched a national education campaign in 2010 called "Sounds of Pertussis" to raise awareness about the seriousness of pertussis and the need for adult vaccination to prevent infecting babies.[64][65] NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon is a national spokesperson for the campaign.[66] The campaign recently sponsored a song-writing contest called Sound Off About Pertussis, which was won by Maria Bennett with her original song, "Give Pertussis a Whooping."[67]
