The song was credited to Myers (as "Jimmy DeKnight") and Max C. Freedman when copyrighted on March 31, 1953, although its exact authorship is disputed, with many speculating that Freedman wrote the song on his own.[8] There were several earlier songs of the title "Rock Around the Clock" (by Hal Singer and Wally Mercer), but they are unrelated to the Freedman/Myers song. In addition, it is sometimes erroneously stated that "Rock Around the Clock" is copied from a late-1940s Big Joe Turner recording, "Around the Clock Blues". Aside from title similarity, however, the two songs bear little resemblance. There are many blues songs with the theme of partying or making love "round the clock", with various actions specified at various hours.
