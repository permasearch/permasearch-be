At Robin's funeral in the season finale, Emma tries to delicately break it to Regina that Hook has returned, but as Gold tethers part of the Olympian Crystal to the magic in Storybrooke, Hook hastily runs in to make sure everyone is alright. Regina quickly puts aside her feelings and goes with the heroes to find out what Gold's plan is. After Henry and Violet run off to destroy magic, Emma and Regina join together to rescue him. However, due to Gold's machinations, magic in Storybrooke has become unstable. As Zelena uses Merlin's wand to return the people from Camelot, Merida, and the Merry Men home, another portal traps Hook, Snow, David and Zelena on the Mysterious Island Nemo and Liam had fled to years before: the Land of Untold Stories. There, they run into Dr. Henry Jekyll and his evil alter-ego Mr. Hyde. Initially, Hyde believes the heroes to be in the employ of Gold, whom he despises, and holds them captive. With the help of Jekyll, the heroes escape and assist Jekyll in creating a serum which separates Hyde from himself. With the help of Henry and the Dragon, the heroes manage to return to the Land Without Magic with Jekyll.
