The Gazette stated on November 3, 1830, that certain Mexican officials had commenced surveying Mexican claims in the disputed border area on October 11 and that they intended to continue until stopped by force of arms.[147] On November 1, 1830, Brigadier General George Hill, commandant of the 3rd Brigade of Arkansas Territorial Militia, reported to Pope that Curtiss Morriss, a citizen of Lost Prairie, had informed him that Mexican surveyor's were surveying the tracts granted to persons who had taken the oath of allegiance to Mexico, and that the Mexican claimants had threatened to dispossess loyal Arkansas citizens who refused to take the oath and whose land lay within the tracts of persons who had taken the oath. These loyal territorial citizens claimed the protection of the United States.[148]
