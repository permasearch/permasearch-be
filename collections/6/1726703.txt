As the United States went to war in the early 21st century, Carol Schneider, daughter of Lorrainne Schneider, and Josh Avedon, son of Barbara Avedon, revived the organization.[6] AMP operates as a not-for-profit, non-partisan, 501(c)(3) organization, offering "peace homework" and distributing educational materials, seeking to engage citizens in pursuing alternatives to armed conflict. Sales of posters and other materials with the sunflower logo support the group's efforts.[18]
