Federer's season turned around in the final masters event of the clay season when he defeated Nadal on clay for only the second time to capture the Madrid Masters.[82] Federer entered the French Open with few predicting him to win the elusive Parisian title having lost to Nadal in the final weekend for the past four seasons. After Nadal's unexpected defeat to Robin Söderling, Federer suddenly became the overwhelming favorite. It would not be easy as in his next match as he was forced to come from two sets and break point down in the third set to defeat Tommy Haas in five sets.[82] He was also forced to fight back from a two-sets-to-one deficit against a young Juan Martín del Potro to win a five setter in the semifinals.[82] In the final, he faced Söderling, and with a straight sets victory, he finally captured the Coupe des Mousquetaires and career Grand Slam.[83] This victory tied him with Pete Sampras for the most Grand Slam singles titles.
