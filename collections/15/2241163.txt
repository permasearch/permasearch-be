A simple criterion for checking if a given stationary point of a real-valued function F(x,y) of two real variables is a saddle point is to compute the function's Hessian matrix at that point: if the Hessian is indefinite, then that point is a saddle point. For example, the Hessian matrix of the function     z =  x  2   âˆ’  y  2     {\displaystyle z=x^{2}-y^{2}}   at the stationary point     ( x , y , z ) = ( 0 , 0 , 0 )   {\displaystyle (x,y,z)=(0,0,0)}   is the matrix
