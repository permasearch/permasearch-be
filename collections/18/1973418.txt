For a baby boy, the right earlobe is pierced first.[60] For a baby girl, the left earlobe is. In case of girls, the left nostril may also be pierced during this ritual.[60][70] The piercing of the earlobes symbolically reminds the child, as he or she grows up, of beauty and social presence, of the importance of hearing and speech in the wisdom of the Vedas.[60]
