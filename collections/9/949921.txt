Missionary Baptists are a group of Baptists that grew out of the missionary / anti-missionary controversy that divided Baptists in the United States in the early part of the 19th century, with Missionary Baptists following the pro-missions movement position.[1] Those who opposed the innovations became known as anti-missions or Primitive Baptists.[2] Since arising in the 19th century, the influence of Primitive Baptists waned as "Missionary Baptists became the mainstream".[1]
