Taking matters into his own hands, Bennett started his own record company, Improv.[12] He cut some songs that would later become favorites, such as "What is This Thing Called Love?", and made two well-regarded albums with jazz pianist Bill Evans, The Tony Bennett/Bill Evans Album (1975) and Together Again (1976),[47] but Improv lacked a distribution arrangement with a major label and by 1977, it was out of business.[12][64]
