The Cornhuskers' 1970 team needed a bit of good fortune to claim the school's first national title. Nebraska entered the day of the Orange Bowl ranked third, but losses by no. 1 Texas and no. 2 Ohio State gave NU the championship after a 17–12 victory over LSU. There would be no such suspense in 1971, as Nebraska began the season ranked second, and quickly moved up to no. 1 after a 34–7 victory against Oregon in week one. The Cornhuskers remained atop the AP Poll for the rest of the season, which included a 35–31 Thanksgiving Day defeat of no. 2 Oklahoma, a game still referred to as the "Game of the Century". Nebraska wrapped up the title by beating Bear Bryant and Alabama 38–6 in the 1972 Orange Bowl on New Year’s night. Nebraska's 1971 team remains the only champion ever to defeat the teams that finished second, third, and fourth (Oklahoma, Colorado, Alabama) in the final rankings.
