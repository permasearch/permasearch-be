A popular but false account of the origin of the term's present meaning is the story that less wealthy workers in France, who wore not leather but wooden shoes, used to throw these sabots into the machines to disrupt production.[3] This account is not supported by the etymology.[3] Rather, the French source word literally means to "walk noisily," as was done by sabot-wearing labourers, who interrupted production by means of labor disputes, not damage.[3]
