Some rice cookers are designed to accommodate a basket to steam vegetables, dumplings, buns, and so on in the steam coming off the rice. If the rice cooker is not suited for such uses, there is a chance that it will damage the appliance. In particular, it is quite possible that the polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) coating becomes scarred by the rough bottom of ceramic wares placed inside the inner cooking bowl. If such cooking is outside indicated usage of the appliance, it typically invalidates the warranty. In some countries, electric rice cookers, including Japanese models, are regarded as automated universal electric cooking pots, and their use in the preparation of a variety of foods is rather standard.[citation needed]
