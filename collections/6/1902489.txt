Van Gogh wrote many letters to his brother Theo and Willemina about gardening ideas, color harmonies and the benefits of working in a garden. Known for his works of sunflowers, he also made paintings with red poppies, grasses, irises and other garden plants. The colors used in the paintings may have been suggestive of his mood. When depressed, he painted "ghostly white-hooded arums." When he was in good mood he used bright colors, such as vibrant pink oleanders. During times of inner turmoil, â€œdark green spire like cypresses writhing with energy and contorted olive trees vibrant with silvery leaves.[6]
