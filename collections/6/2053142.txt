With CIA and Belgian army support Mobutu staged a coup against Lumumba. Lumumba was captured and transferred to Katanga where he was executed by the secessionist forces there. Tshombe then replaced Lumumba as prime minister In July 1964. Despite Tshombe's rule, the Congo would continue to be in crisis throughout the rest of the 20th and early 21st centuries.
