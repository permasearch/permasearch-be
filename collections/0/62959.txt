Currently the game is played primarily at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia, the home of the Philadelphia Eagles. Since the 1980s, the game has been held roughly once every three or four years at a site other than Philadelphia. In addition to the Rose Bowl, these sites have included Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey (replaced in 2010 by MetLife Stadium, which is scheduled to host the game for the first time in 2021), M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore and FedExField in Landover, Maryland. These are still considered neutral-site games, but provide locations that are closer to one academy or the other.
