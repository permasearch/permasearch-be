Raymond et al. (1992)[21]  suggest that the attentional blink is produced by perceptual uncertainty amongst the target (T1) and following target (T2). They suggest that this confusion happens at some point in the target identification processes. When confusion is eliminated, attentional blink isnâ€™t observed. The researchers also suggested that one way to eliminate confusion is to have items that cannot be named.
