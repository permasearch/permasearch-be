The Cuban security apparatus knew the invasion was coming, via their extensive secret intelligence network, as well as loose talk by members of the brigade, some of which was heard in Miami, and was repeated in US and foreign newspaper reports. Nevertheless, days before the invasion, multiple acts of sabotage were carried out, such as the El Encanto fire, an arson attack in a department store in Havana on 13 April, that killed one shop worker.[39][104] The Cuban government also had been warned by senior KGB agents Osvaldo SÃ¡nchez Cabrera and 'Aragon', who died violently before and after the invasion, respectively.[105] The general Cuban population was not well informed, except for CIA-funded Radio Swan.[106] As of May 1960, almost all means of public communication were in the government's hands.[107][108]
