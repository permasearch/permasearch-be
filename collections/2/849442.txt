Prior to the decolonization movements of the post-World War II era, Europeans were represented in every part of Africa.[43] Decolonisation during the 1960s and 1970s often resulted in the mass emigration of European-descended settlers out of Africa – especially from Algeria and Morocco (1.6 million pieds-noirs in North Africa),[44] Kenya, Congo,[45] Rhodesia, Mozambique and Angola.[46] By the end of 1977, more than one million Portuguese were thought to have returned from Africa.[47] Nevertheless, White Africans remain a minority in many African states, particularly South Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Réunion.[48] The African country with the largest native European African population is South Africa.[49] The Afrikaners, the British diaspora and the Coloureds are the largest native European-descended groups in Africa today.
