After the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, Kimberly-Clark and K-C Aviation decided to form a regular scheduled passenger airline, and out of that initiative, Midwest Express began operations on June 11, 1984. At the time the airline had two Douglas DC-9-10 twin engine jets and 83 employees.[5] Early plans for the airline called for it to serve Appleton, Chicago, and Atlanta. Kimberly-Clark opted against this plan after local resistance over the carrier's desire to serve Atlanta's Fulton County Airport, which is a general aviation airport on the city's west side. From 1983 to 1985, the airline also operated a single Convair 580 twin turboprop aircraft provided by Kimberly-Clark's corporate aviation department.[6]
