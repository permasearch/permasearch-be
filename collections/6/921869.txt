The loggerhead sea turtle is the world's largest hard-shelled turtle, slightly larger at average and maximum mature weights than the green sea turtle and the Galapagos tortoise. It is also the world's second largest extant turtle after the leatherback sea turtle.[6][7][8] Adults have an average weight range of 80 to 200 kg (180 to 440 lb) and a length range of 70 to 95 cm (28 to 37 in).[6] The maximum reported weight is 545 kg (1,202 lb) and the maximum carapace length is 213 cm (84 in).[6] The head and carapace (upper shell) range from a yellow-orange to a reddish brown, while the plastron (underside) is typically pale yellow.[9] The turtle's neck and sides are brown on the tops and yellow on the sides and bottom.[10]
