Many of the changes to the calendar that had accompanied the Reformation remained in place during the subsequent centuries.  In Saxony in the eighteenth century, in addition to chief festivals of Christmas, Easter, and Pentecost, a number of festivals were also celebrated with Vespers and Holy Communion, including Saint Stephen, Saint John, the Circumcision, Epiphany, Purification of Mary, the Annunciation, the Ascension, Holy Trinity, Nativity of Saint John the Baptist, the Visitation (on July 2), and Saint Michael (on September 29).[33]  When Holy Communion was celebrated, a chasuble was used in the color of the day, though especially at Lepzig, these colors were different from the ones normally used today.[34]  In the twentieth century, Lutherans in Europe came under the influence of the Liturgical Movement and many Lutheran churches adopted new calendars and rubrics similar to the Roman Calendar as revised by Vatican II.[35]  The Swedish Church also experienced a similar reform of its liturgy and calendar during this same period.
