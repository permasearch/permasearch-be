In March 2001, the then-WWF bought selected assets of WCW.[1] This resulted in the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship becoming a championship for the WWF, who referred to it as the WCW United States Championship. At Survivor Series in November 2001, the WCW United States and WWF Intercontinental Championships were unified, resulting in the United States Championship being deactivated. In July 2003, the title was reactivated as the WWE United States Championship. Since the 2018 WWE Superstar Shake-up, it is exclusively contested on the SmackDown brand.
