Associations of PPI use and cardiovascular events have also been widely studied but clear conclusions have not been made as these relative risks are confounded by other factors.[32][33] PPIs are commonly used in cardiovascular patients for gastric protection when aspirin is given for its antiplatelet actions.[32][34] An interaction between PPIs and the metabolism of the platelet inhibitor clopidogrel is known and this drug is also often used in patients with cardiac disease.[35][36]
