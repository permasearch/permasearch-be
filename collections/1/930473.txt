Second breakfast (or German: Zweites Frühstück, Polish: Drugie Śniadanie, Slovak: Desiata, Hungarian: Tízórai) is a meal eaten after breakfast, but before lunch. It is a traditional meal in Bavaria, Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary. In Bavaria and Poland, special dishes are made exclusively to be eaten during second breakfast. In Vienna and most other parts of Austria the second breakfast is referred to as Jause.[1] It is typical to eat four to five meals a day in these locations.
