Like the second season, the season consisted of 25 episodes, including a special holiday-themed episode, instead of a Halloween episode which was written by I. Marlene King and her assistant Kyle Bown and was directed by King.[3][4] It also contained the 100th episode and the episode was written by showrunner I. Marlene King. The promotional poster was released on May 28, 2014.[5] A second promotional poster was released after the hundredth episode was aired, on July 9, 2014.[6] A third promotional poster was released on January 5, 2015, as a promotion for the second half of the fifth season, which began the day after the release of the poster.[7]
