Bogart could be generous with actors, particularly those who were blacklisted, down on their luck, or having personal problems. During the filming of the Edward Dmytryk directed The Left Hand of God (1955), he noticed his co-star Gene Tierney having a hard time remembering her lines and behaving oddly. He coached Tierney, feeding her lines. He was familiar with mental illness from his sister's bouts of depression, and encouraged Tierney to seek treatment.[132][133] He also stood behind Joan Bennett and insisted on her as his co-star in Michael Curtiz's We're No Angels when an ugly public scandal made her persona non grata with Jack Warner.[134]
