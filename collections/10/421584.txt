Several weeks later, Moo-hyuk receives an invitation to his ex-girlfriend's wedding. At the wedding, Moo-hyuk is accidentally shot twice in the head when someone attempts an assassination on his ex-girlfriend's husband. The doctor saves him but can only remove one bullet. The remaining bullet is lodged too deeply within his head such that it cannot be surgically removed. It's killing him, and he has no longer than a year to live. Moo-hyuk is a dying gangster whose girlfriend is now married; in short, his life is an utter mess.
