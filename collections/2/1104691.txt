Due to the attack of the Scarlet Guard, the Reds are punished by the Silvers with the lowering of the age of conscription from 18 to 15. Mare herself is ordered to broadcast the new law. Julian confesses that his research concludes that Mare's blood is Red and Silver, and stronger than both; Shade's was too, which was why he was executed by Silver officers. Another meeting with Farley, in a free zone that the Silvers have been keeping out from, leads Mare, through Maven's suggestion, to infiltrate the king's residence in the capital, Archeon. There, the rebels, through the underground-roaming Undertrains, stake an invasion, following Mare and trick Cal. Cal takes notice and attempts to arrest her, but in the palace, it is revealed that Maven has been manipulating Mare all the time, as he is in league with his mother, Queen Elara, who forces Cal to kill his father, thus branding him and Mare traitors while allowing Maven to become king.
