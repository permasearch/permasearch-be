Hurricane Rita struck a direct hit on the Proctor Street Seawall, and damaged many downtown businesses and homes. As economic activity picked up in the region, calls for downtown revitalization have been advanced.[22][23] The true center of commercial activity has gravitated from downtown to other areas.[24] The main shopping center is Central Mall, opened outside the downtown in 1982.
