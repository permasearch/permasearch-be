The Live Lounge is a segment on the British radio stations BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 1Xtra. Originally hosted by Jo Whiley on her mid-morning radio show and then by Fearne Cotton from 2009 until 2015. It is now hosted by Clara Amfo, she has been the host since May 2015.  it exhibits well-known artists usually performing one song of their own and one by another artist, in an acoustic format. The 'Live Lounge' itself is also a physical room in the Radio 1 studios, from where some of the performances are broadcast; however, due to its size, many are done from the BBC Maida Vale Studios. From 2009, Trevor Nelson  began hosting Live Lounges on his BBC Radio 1Xtra show, and was replaced in that slot by DJ Ace in 2017.[1]
