In Season Two, Lin returned to Republic City, reinstated as Chief of Police. Impressed by Makoâ€™s outstanding work in busting local gangs, Lin hired Mako as an officer.[11] Six months later, Lin and the Republic City Police force would investigate the bombing of the Southern Water Tribe Cultural Center. When Korra and Mako initially broke up (over issues related to the bombing) at the city police station, Lin, finding an overturned table, demanded to know what happened. Mako stated that he had broken up with the Avatar. Amused, she commented that he got off easy compared to her break up with Tenzin.[12] A few days later, Lin traveled to Mako's apartment to investigate incriminating evidence in connection with the bombing of the cultural center. Mako adamantly denied any involvement in the bombing. However, when money and explosives were found in the apartment, she had Mako arrested.[13] Lin and her fellow officers later provided security at the pro-bending arena during the premiere screening of a film starring Bolin. When Varrick, who bankrolled the motion picture, was outed as the mastermind of not only the attempted kidnapping of President Raiko at the event, but also the bombing of the cultural center, Lin promptly arrested him and freed Mako. Lin promoted Mako to detective, noting that the officer was the first to suspect Varrick behind the bombings.[14]
