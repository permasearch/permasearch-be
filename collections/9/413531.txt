The long, wide chef's apron provides many advantages. It is primarily worn for safety purposes. Should hot liquid spill over the Chef as he is carrying it, the apron will take the main impact and can be quickly removed to get it away from the under garments and legs. The apron is worn long to just below the knee to protect the upper part of the legs. Traditionally, the purpose of the apron was also to protect the wearer's garments from food stains and smells.[5] It also used to provide a convenient cloth with which to wipe messy hands or to dry washed hands, although this would be considered unhygienic now.[5] Sometimes, an apron will contain pockets, enabling a chef to easily carry the tools of his trade.[6]
