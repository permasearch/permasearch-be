The signature tune has always been a hornpipe, originally using variations of Barnacle Bill by Herbert Ashworth-Hope, and should not be confused with the American sailor song of the same title .[94][95] The original opening titles showed a Blue Peter flag being lowered on a ship.[96] In 1979 it was updated by Mike Oldfield, and again in the 1990s.[51] From the 2008 series onwards it became a rendition of the similar Sailor's Hornpipe. However, from 14 October 2008, the tune has become a blend of both tunes.
