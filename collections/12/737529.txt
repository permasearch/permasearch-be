T.C. and Rick are both former Marines from VMO-2 with whom Magnum, a former Navy SEAL and Naval Intelligence agent, served in the Vietnam War.[note 1] The series was one of the first to deal with Vietnam veterans as "human beings" and not as shell-shocked killers, and was praised by many ex-servicemen groups for doing so.[citation needed] Magnum often dupes or bribes T.C. and Rick into aiding him on his cases, much to their frustration, though the deep friendship between the group, including Higgins, proved to be one of the key elements of the program over its eight-season run.[citation needed]
