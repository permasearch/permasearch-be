An intramolecular force is any force that binds together the atoms making up a molecule or compound, not to be confused with intermolecular forces, which are the forces present between molecules[1]. The subtle difference in the name comes from the Latin roots of English with inter meaning between or among and intra meaning inside.[2] Chemical bonds are considered to be intramolecular forces, for example. These forces are often stronger than intermolecular forces, which are present between atoms or molecules that are not bonded.
