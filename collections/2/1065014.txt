Oyster toadfish produce loud grunting sounds by contracting muscles located along the sides of their swim bladder, known as sonic muscles[50]  Female and male toadfishes emit short-duration grunts, often as a fright response.[51] In addition to short-duration grunts, male toadfishes produce “boat whistle calls”.[52] These calls are longer in duration, lower in frequency, and are primarily used to attract mates.[52] The sounds emitted by the O. tao have frequency range of 140 Hz to 260 Hz.[52] The frequencies of the calls depend on the rate at which the sonic muscles contract.[53][50]
