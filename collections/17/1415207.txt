The city of Miami Gardens was one of the two major contenders to host WrestleMania XXVII along with Atlanta; in February 2010, Atlanta was awarded the right to host the event.[7][13][14] According to the Miami-Dade Sports Commission, WWE management felt that Miami's planning for the event would have been too hectic with many other sporting events held in the area around the same time of the planning, such as Super Bowl XLIV.[14] However, the Miami area was reportedly considered for the next event due to its international ties, facilities, airports and experience of hosting previous major events.[7]
