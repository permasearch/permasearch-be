Upon the resolution of the labour dispute between NHL players and owners, new gameplay rules were set in place for the 2005â€“06 season that were intended to benefit skilled players and generate more goal-scoring. As the Canucks' basis of success in previous seasons was built on playing a fast-paced, high-scoring style of play, expectations for the team were high going into the season.[notes 1][78] However, the team failed to qualify for the playoffs, completing the regular season ninth place in the West.[79] The first line of Naslund, Bertuzzi and Morrison suffered offensively, as all three players recorded decreased points totals.[14] Head Coach Marc Crawford later recalled the campaign as a turning point for the team's offensive leadership as the Sedin twins began their rise to stardom, matching the top line's production.[80] Crawford was fired in the off-season and replaced with Alain Vigneault, who had been coach of the team's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Manitoba Moose.[81] Three days after Vigneault's hiring, Nonis dealt Bertuzzi to the Florida Panthers, ending the "West Coast Express" era. (Naslund and Morrison would leave the team two years later.) In return, the Canucks received All-Star goaltender Roberto Luongo as part of a six-player trade.[82] With the acquisition of Luongo, Cloutier was traded away to the Los Angeles Kings.[83]
