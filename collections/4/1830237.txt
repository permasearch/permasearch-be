An induction generator connected to a capacitor system can generate sufficient reactive power to operate on its own. When the load current exceeds the capability of the generator to supply both magnetization reactive power and load power the generator will immediately cease to produce power. The load must be removed and the induction generator restarted with either a DC source, or if present, residual magnetism in the core.[1]
