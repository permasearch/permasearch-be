Creatures killed by the Others soon reanimate as wights: undead with pallid skin, black hands and similarly glowing blue eyes.[4][7] Dragonglass has no effect on them.[8] Wights may be physically injured, but even dismembered parts remain animated, so they must be destroyed by fire.[7][8] The humans who live in the north beyond The Wall—called "wildlings" by the inhabitants of Westeros—burn their dead so that they do not become wights.[9]
