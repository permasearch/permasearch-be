In 1917, the Cuarteto Oriental recorded the first son documented on the catalog of Columbia Records which was entered as: Pare motorista-son santiaguero. Unexpectedly, a fifth member of the quartet is mentioned. His name was Carlos Godínez and he was a member of the army (Ejército Permanente). Subsequently, the RCA Victor contracted Godínez in 1918 to organize a group and record several songs. For that recording, the new group was called "Sexteto Habanero Godínez". Its members were: Carlos Godínez, conductor and tresero; María Teresa Vera, first voice and clave; Manuel Corona, second voice and guitar; "Sinsonte", third voice and maracas; Alfredo Boloña, bongo; and another unknown performer who was not included in the list."[26]
