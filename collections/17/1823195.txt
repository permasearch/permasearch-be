Wikipedia is the world's most successful online encyclopedia, now containing 5,578,096 English language articles. It is probably the largest collection of knowledge ever assembled, and is certainly the most widely accessible. Wikipedia can be edited by anyone with Internet access that chooses to, but does it provide reliable information? A 2005 study by Nature found that a selection of Wikipedia articles on scientific subjects were comparable to a professionally edited encyclopedia,[1] suggesting a community of volunteers can generate and sustain surprisingly accurate content.
