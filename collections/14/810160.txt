However, it is to be noted that after Indian independence in 1947, followed by the promulgation of the Indian Constitution on 26 January 1950, which marked the transformation of the Dominion of India into the Republic of India, the Article 18 of the Indian Constitution abolished all titles, except those given by the Government of India to those who have made their mark in military and academic fields.[10] However, under the policy of Privy Purse nobles were allowed to enjoy certain privileges and keep their titles. But this policy was abolished in 1971 by the  twenty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution of India. Thus the title of the "Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad" was officially, constitutionally and  legally abolished in 1971.[11] Thus, as titles have been abolished in India, the title of the Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad no longer exists. However, Abbas Ali Meerza can now succeed Waris Ali Meerza's office legally, but his title of the fourth Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad would be unofficial, as the title is not legally and officially recognised.[9][59][60]
