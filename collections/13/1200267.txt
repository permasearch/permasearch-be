To buy a Billiken was said to give the purchaser luck, but to have one given would be better luck.[3] The image was copyrighted and a trademark was put on the name. After a few years of popularity, the Billiken faded into obscurity. Although they are similar, the Billiken and the baby-like Kewpie figures that debuted in the December 1909 Ladies' Home Journal are not the same.
