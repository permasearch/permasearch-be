In 1934 Jack Warner met del Río at a party and offered her a starring role in two films for Warner.[42] The first was the musical comedy Wonder Bar, directed by Lloyd Bacon. Busby Berkeley was the choreographer and Al Jolson her co-star. Del Río and Jolson were gradually stealing the show. Del Río's character grew, while the character of Kay Francis, the other female star of the film, was reduced. Francis even threatened to stop filming. The film was released in March 1934 and was a huge blockbuster for Warner.[43]
