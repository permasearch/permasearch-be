Prestwick Golf Club hosted the first championship in 1860 and remained the sole venue until 1873, when the Old Course at St Andrews hosted the event. Prestwick hosted a further 12 championships, the last in 1925.[6] Musselburgh Links became the third course to host the championship in 1874. The three courses rotated the hosting of the championship until 1892 when Muirfield hosted the event. The Honourable Company of Edinburgh golfers built their own course at Muirfield and Musselburgh was removed from the rota as a result.[7] Royal St George's Golf Club became the first course outside Scotland to host the championship in 1894.[8]
