The defeat to the Czech national team in 2000 led to the resignation of David Lloyd as captain.[10] Before his departure he criticised the British player for not being fit enough.[10] On his departure, Lloyd went on to criticise the LTA and it's work.[10] In response John Crowther, the Executive Director of the LTA, stated they had "lost confidence" his Lloyd's abilities, and appointed former top 10 player Roger Taylor as his replacement.[10] During Taylor's captaincy, the post itself was under criticism, with Tim Henman claiming "It's mainly handing out the drinks and the bananas" since most of the players had their own coaches.[11] Taylor's first match as captain was against Ecuador, in which Britain lost 2â€“3 at home on grass.[11] The Guardian quipped that "In one hundred years of the Davis Cup there had never been a more embarrassing defeat."[11] Despite this, the team continued to decline in the ranking.[12] In their 2003 match against Australia the team's top player was ranked 163 in the world; both Henman and Greg Rusedski were hampered by injury, and could not take part.[12]
