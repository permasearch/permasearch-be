The plan for Season 3 was to cover topics such as identity, feminism, bullying and gender parity.[18] Walley-Beckett provided this additional hint: "Our beloved Anne will be 16 years old when we return to this season full of romantic complications, bold adventures and dramatic discoveries. I will explore important, contemporary themes that I hope will continue to resonate with, and inspire and uplift, our audience."[21]
