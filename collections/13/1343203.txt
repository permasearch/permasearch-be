In the People's Republic of China, Children's Day is celebrated on 1 June and is formally known as "the June 1 International Children's Day" (Chinese: 六一国际儿童节; pinyin: Liù Yī Guójì Értóng Jié). When the People's Republic of China was first established in 1949, the State Council (Cabinet) designated a half-day holiday for all primary schools on 1 June. This was later made into a full day's break in 1956 with The Announcement by the State Council to make 1 June Children's Day a One-Day Holiday. Schools usually hold activities such as children's performances, camping trips, or free movies on Children's Day or the day before to allow students to have fun. Children of civil servants might also receive small gifts from the government until they are fourteen, and Civil servants who have children sometimes have a half-day holiday on 1 June to spend more time with their children. Entrance and set out ceremonies of the Young Pioneers of China are usually held on 1 June as well. Entrance of children under 14 into the Forbidden City is free on 1 June, while each accompanying adult gets 100% off, i.e. CNY30.
