The role of the public relations specialist, in many ways, is to communicate with the general public in ways that serve the interests of the company. PR therefore consists of numerous specialty areas that convey information about the company to the public, including sponsorships, events, issues management and media relations. When executing these types of activities, the PR Specialist must incorporate broader corporate messages to convey the company's strategic positioning.  This ensures the PR activities ultimately convey messages that distinguish the company vis-Ã -vis its competitors and the overall marketplace, while also communicating the company's value to target audiences.
