The world's largest gold nugget on display, the Hand of Faith is still shown today in the Golden Nugget lobby.[9]  Weighing 875 troy ounces (960 oz; 27,200 g) and 18 inches (46 cm) in length, the Hand of Faith was found near Kingower, Victoria, Australia, and put on display at the casino in 1981 amid a number of other gold nuggets.[citation needed]
