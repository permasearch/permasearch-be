Motor Holdings developed from the New Zealand franchise of Jowett Motors. The New Zealand franchise imported and assembled Bradford's very light vans and trucks in Auckland. Following Jowett's 1954 departure from the industry the New Zealand company won the Volkswagen franchise and changed its name to VW Motors. By 1958 VW Motors had built a new assembly plant at Fort Richard Rd in Otahuhu. By 1964 the parent company of Motor Holdings was formed, which controlled 15 smaller companies, including VW Motors and the new assembly company of Motor Industries International Ltd. During the 1960s and 1970s Motor Holdings assembled many different makes in addition to Volkswagen including Studebaker, Nash, Hudson, Peugeot 404, Datsun, Simca, Skoda, the Fiat Bambina, and the New Zealand-made Trekka. The company became European Motor Distributors (EMD) in 1978, and continued to assemble Volkswagens until 1986.[112]
