Tales Told by Dead Friends is the debut EP by American rock band Mayday Parade, released on June 13, 2006. The group resulted from the merger of local acts Kid Named Chicago and Defining Moment. With their line-up solidified, the first two songs they wrote together was "When I Get Home, You're So Dead" and "Three Cheers for Five Years". Soon afterwards, they recorded an EP, Tales Told by Dead Friends, with Lee Dyess. The group followed Warped Tour and sold copies to people in line. By the end of summer, the band had sold 10,000 copies of the EP. This attracted the attention of Fearless Records, who would sign the band in late August. The group went on tour from September to November, before the EP was reissued by Fearless.
