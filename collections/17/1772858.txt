On November 2, 2011, a lawsuit filed by buyers of ten condos in Trump Soho, including French soccer player Olivier Dacourt, was settled with plaintiffs recovering 90% of their deposits. The plaintiffs had claimed that they were tricked into buying the condos by "deceptive" sales figures of the developers and that the number of apartments sold at Trump Soho had been "fraudulently misrepresented." The New York Post described plaintiffs' 90% recovery as "staggering."[24]
