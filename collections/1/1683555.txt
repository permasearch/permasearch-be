After training, Presley joined the 3rd Armored Division in Friedberg, Germany, on October 1.[153] While on maneuvers, Presley was introduced to amphetamines by a sergeant. He became "practically evangelical about their benefits", not only for energy but for "strength" and weight loss as well, and many of his friends in the outfit joined him in indulging.[154] The Army also introduced Presley to karate, which he studied seriously, training with JÃ¼rgen Seydel. It became a lifelong interest, which he later included in his live performances.[155][156]</ref>[157] Fellow soldiers have attested to Presley's wish to be seen as an able, ordinary soldier, despite his fame, and to his generosity. He donated his Army pay to charity, purchased TV sets for the base, and bought an extra set of fatigues for everyone in his outfit.[158]
