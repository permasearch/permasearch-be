Dr. Blake Hanson (portrayed by Jason Pendergraft) is a doctor at Mercer Army Medical Center, the hospital serving Fort Marshall. He holds the rank of Major and is an ER specialist. He was attracted to SPC Tanya Gabriel and Tanya reciprocated interest but they resisted pursuing a relationship due to strict rules forbidding fraternization between officers and enlisted personnel. They secretly dated for a while before Denise Sherwood, through Roxy, discovers the relationship. He decided to transfer to Fort Lee to avoid endangering their careers. Tanya stayed at Fort Marshall to see out the last few months of her enlistment contract. She joins him in Virginia after being discharged.
