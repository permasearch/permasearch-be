A disinfectant, Rivamol, was put over most of his body and then a white ointment was applied and he was bandaged over most of his body.  Dr. Yoshimi gave Bose four injections of Vita Camphor and two of Digitamine for his weakened heart.  These were given about every 30 minutes.  Since his body had lost fluids quickly upon being burnt, he was also given Ringer solution intravenously.  A third doctor, Dr. Ishii gave him a blood transfusion.  An orderly, Kazuo Mitsui, an army private, was in the room and several nurses were also assisting.  Bose still had a clear head which Dr. Yoshimi found remarkable for someone with such severe injuries.[76]
