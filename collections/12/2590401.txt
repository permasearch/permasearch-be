Although estriol is an efficacious agonist of the ERs, it is reported to have mixed agonistâ€“antagonist (partial agonist) activity at the ER; on its own, it is weakly estrogenic, but in the presence estradiol, it is antiestrogenic.[8][9] Relative to estradiol, the estrogenic potency of estriol and estrone have been reported to be 80- and 12-fold lower than that of estradiol, respectively.[11] It is notable that unlike estriol, estrone can be metabolized into estradiol, and most of its potency in vivo is in fact actually due to conversion into estradiol.[1]
