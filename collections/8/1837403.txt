Although experimental studies continued during the 18th century,[14] a successful quantitative treatment of capillary action[15] was not attained until 1805 by two investigators: Thomas Young of the United Kingdom[16] and Pierre-Simon Laplace of France.[17] They derived the Young–Laplace equation of capillary action. By 1830, the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss had determined the boundary conditions governing capillary action (i.e., the conditions at the liquid-solid interface).[18] In 1871, the British physicist William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) determined the effect of the meniscus on a liquid's vapor pressure—a relation known as the Kelvin equation.[19] German physicist Franz Ernst Neumann (1798–1895) subsequently determined the interaction between two immiscible liquids.[20]
