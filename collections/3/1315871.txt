DmC: Devil May Cry features a different Dante from a parallel universe separate from the original series. This version of Dante (a "nephilim", described in the game's mythology as a half-angelic, half-demonic hybrid)[8] is voiced by Tim Phillipps. In this version, Dante initially has black hair, which turns white near the end of the game. While he is still just as sarcastic and cocky as the original Dante, his attitude is significantly more punk-like than the laid back demeanor of the original counterpart. Changes to his signature weapons include a slimmer version of the Rebellion sword, as well as his guns Ebony and Ivory resembling Desert Eagle handguns with the grips twisting to a sharp point, which makes it lack any detachable magazines or a magazine release.
