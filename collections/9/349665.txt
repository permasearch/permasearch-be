The following day, Grande Island was taken and Navy minesweepers began clearing the bay.  Engineers of the 38th Division remained in Olongapo to begin reactivation of Subic Bay Naval Station.  Bridges, buildings and the water distilling plant were repaired and the beaches and streets were cleared.  Soon enough, LSTs were making dry-ramp landings near the town of Subic.
