The vegetation type is defined by characteristic dominant species, or a common aspect of the assemblage, such as an elevation range or environmental commonality.[3] The contemporary use of vegetation approximates that of ecologist Frederic Clements' term earth cover, an expression still used by the Bureau of Land Management. Natural vegetation refers to plant life undisturbed by humans in its growth and which is controlled by the climatic conditions of that region.[clarification needed]
