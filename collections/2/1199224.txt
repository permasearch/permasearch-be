During Greg's birthday party, Susan confiscates some of his birthday money to pay off Rowley's dad's smoothie bill from the country club. Greg also gets a Ladybug, a cell phone that can only make emergency calls and home calls. Greg, Rodrick, Manny, and his mom go to the local pet store. Greg gets an angelfish but Rodrick, on the other hand, gets a pet piranha which he neglects while Manny buys fish food which he later eats as a snack. After a trip to the water park, Greg finds that the piranha ate his angelfish while they were gone, upsetting Greg.
