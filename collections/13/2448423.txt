Destroying the Supremo is Malia’s entire life’s work. Expected by everyone to fulfill the prophecy when she matures, she encounters defeat and disappointments time and again when her powers do not manifest. Undaunted, she persists, is killed and resurrects, and moves forward to fulfill the prophecy as the savior of the three species. Four characters precipitate Malia’s evolution from mortal to supernatural.
