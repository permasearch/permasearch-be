Informally, some enlisted ranks have commonly used nicknames, though they are not official and may be improper for use in formal situations. The acceptability of nickname use by juniors is at the discretion of the individual rank holder. A gunnery sergeant is typically called "Gunny" and occasionally "Guns", or very rarely, “Gunther”. A master sergeant is commonly called "Top", and a master gunnery sergeant is "Master Gunny" or "Master Guns", or, very rarely, “Master Gunther”. Differing from the Army and Air Force, all ranks containing "sergeant" are always addressed by their full rank and never shortened to simply "Sergeant" or "Sarge". A private first class is usually referred to as a PFC, instead of simply "private"; similarly, Lance Corporal is not shortened to "Corporal". Senior officers may informally address junior officers by their first name. Marines of the same rank may also address each other by their first names when among peers only and never in the presence of junior or senior Marines.
