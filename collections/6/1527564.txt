Different cultures of the Philippine archipelago referred to the most senior datu or leader of the "Barangay state" or "Bayan"[1] using different titles.  In Muslim polities such as Sulu and Cotabato, the Paramount Ruler was called a Sultan.[1]  In Tagalog communities, the equivalent title was that of Lakan.[1]  In communities which historically had strong political or trade connections with Indianized polities in Indonesia and Malaysia,[9] the Paramount Ruler was called a Rajah.[9][1]  Among the Subanon people of the Zamboanga Peninsula, the most senior Thimuay is referred to as the "Thimuay Labi,"[11] or as Sulotan in more Islamized Subanon communities.[12]  In some other portions of the Visayas and Mindanao, there was no separate name for the most senior ruler, so the Paramount Ruler was simply called a Datu,[9][1] although one Datu was identifiable as the most senior.[3][13]
