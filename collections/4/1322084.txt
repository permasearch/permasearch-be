In 1975, authors Roy Carr and Tony Tyler wrote in The Beatles: An Illustrated Record that "If a future archivist were to select one single tune to characterise the Beatles' appeal and the stylistic devices for which they became world famous, he would be forced to choose 'She Loves You'."[12] In 1979, author Greil Marcus included "She Loves You" in his Stranded: Rock and Roll for a Desert Island list of essential rock records.[49] Even more fundamentally, Marcus posed the question of what one would tell a Martian who landed and asked the meaning of rock and roll? The first answer would be "She Loves You".[50]
