In November 2006 NIM President Alhaji Mohammed Abubakar, after describing how political leaders had stolen $480 billion since 1960, said that all sectors of the economy were suffering from endemic management failure.[3] In December 2007 the new NIM President Sir Peter Edeoghon said he would focus on ways to improve the institute's performance in regulating the industry and promoting best practices.[4] In November 2008, Edeoghon called on the federal government to increase investment in the non-oil sector.[5] The November 2008 International Management Conference of the NIM wound up with a call for a change in the government's emphasis to a focus on wealth creation rather than poverty reduction. The two-day conference was held jointly with the Association of Management Organisations in Africa (AMOA).[6]
