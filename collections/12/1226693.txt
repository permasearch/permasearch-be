Penalties for players, club officials and agents include fines of one and a half times the amount involved (until 2010, lesser of 10% of the amount involved or $100,000) and/or suspension. Penalties for clubs include fines of up to triple the amount involved (until 2010, the lesser of half the amount involved or $500,000), fines of $10,000 (until 2010, $2,500) for each document that is late or incorrectly lodged or lost, and/or deduction of premiership points. These penalties were increased after the Melbourne Storm salary cap scandal in 2010.
