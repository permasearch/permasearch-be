In Ancient Greece there was a sport called pankration, which featured a combination of grappling and striking skills similar to those found in modern MMA. Pankration was formed by a combination of the already established wrestling and boxing traditions and, in Olympic terms, first featured in the 33rd Olympiad, 648 BC. All strikes and holds were allowed with the exception of biting and gouging, which were banned. Fighters, also known as pankratiasts, fought until a fighter submitted; there were no rounds.[13] According to E. Norman Gardiner, 'No branch of athletics was more popular than the pankration.'[14] From its origins in Ancient Greece, pankration was later passed on to the Romans.[15]
