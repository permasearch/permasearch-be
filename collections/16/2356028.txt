Mayawati then obtained support from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to become Chief Minister on 3 June 1995. In October 1995, the BJP withdrew their support and fresh elections were called after a period of President's Rule. In 2003, Mayawati resigned from her own government to prove that she was not "hungry for power"[22] and asked the BJP-run Government of India to remove Union Tourism and Culture Minister, Jagmohan.[23] In 2007, she began leading a BSP-formed government with an absolute majority for a full five-year term.[24]
