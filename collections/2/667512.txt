Trap is a style of popular music that developed in the late 1990s to early 2000s from Southern hip hop in the United States.[1][2] It is typified by double or triple-time sub-divided hi-hats,[3] heavy kick drums from the Roland TR-808 drum machine, layered synthesizers and an overall dark, ominous or bleak atmosphere.[4][5] The term "trap" referred to places where drug deals take place. In the 2010s, artists crossbred trap with dubstep to create trap EDM.
