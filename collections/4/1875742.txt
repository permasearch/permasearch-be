This legend was originally published in  the March 27, 1959, edition of  the Auburn Plainsman and was conceived by then editorial page editor  Jim Phillips. Though apocryphal, this tale is most often told as the beginning of the association of "War Eagle" with Auburn.  Phillips has pressed several recent presidents of Auburn to research the true origin of the battle cry "before my fictitious story gets carved in stone."
