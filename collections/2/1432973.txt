EERE has been established from several previous agencies within the United States Executive branch following the 1973 energy crisis. It has foundations in the former agencies Federal Energy Administration, the Energy Research and Development Administration, the Energy Resource Council, and the Atomic Energy Commission, all established prior to the establishment of Department of Energy (DOE) in 1977 (Pub.L. 95–91, 91 Stat. 565, enacted August 4, 1977).[2] The 1978 National Energy Act consolidated several of the former agencies into the DOE, and created an office that focused on energy efficiency and renewable fuels. The agency had undergone several different names since 1978 to reflect its changing scope, including the Office of Conservation and Solar Applications (CSA), the Office of Conservation and Solar Energy (CSE), and the Office of Conservation and Renewable Energy (CRE). The agency gained its current name, the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, in 1993.
