A haplotype (haploid genotype) is a group of genes in an organism that are inherited together from a single parent.[16][17] In 2011, a study looked at the maternal lineage through the use of Mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) as a genetic marker of the Australian dingo and the New Guinea Singing Dog. The mDNA haplotype A29, or a haplotype one step away, was found in all of the Australian dingoes and New Guinea Singing Dogs studied, indicating a common female ancestry.[18] In 2012, a study looked at the dingo male lineage using Y chromosome DNA (yDNA) as a genetic marker and found two yDNA haplotypes. Haplotype H3 could be found in domestic dogs in East Asia and Northern Europe. Haplotype H60 had not been previously reported, but was one step away from haplotype H5 that could be found in East Asian domestic dogs. Only the New Guinea Singing Dog and dingoes from north-eastern Australia showed haplotype H60, which implies a genetic relationship and that the dingo reached Australia from New Guinea.[19]
