The following year, 1982, The Circuit was prominent, situated on a piece of empty ground popularly known as "The Hole in The Ground".[22] This was once the site of a church building (Poole's Synod Hall), which was converted to a cinema, and where the Saltire complex was subsequently built in the early 1990s. The new Traverse Theatre opened here in 1993.[citation needed] It had a 700 seat marquee auditorium, which hosted, among other things, opera, even though the organisers had been told it was no such place for the artform.[22] The next year it became a "tented village", with several smaller tents. Malcolm Hardee made his debut here as part of The Greatest Show On Legs.[22]
