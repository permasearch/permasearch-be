where      E    {\displaystyle \mathrm {E} }   is the source strength per unit area at the aperture, A is the area of the aperture (    A = π  a  2     {\displaystyle A=\pi a^{2}}  ) and R is the distance from the aperture. At the focal plane of a lens,      I  0   = (  P  0   A )  /  (  λ  2    f  2   )   {\displaystyle I_{0}=(P_{0}A)/(\lambda ^{2}f^{2})}  . The intensity at the maximum of the first ring is about 1.75% of the intensity at the center of the Airy disk.
