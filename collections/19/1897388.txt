Some speculated that the battles between U.S. troops and the Navajo and factors such as disease and famine reduced the Navajo population of approximately 25,000 to somewhere in the neighborhood of 2,000 Navajo of reproductive age, creating a genetic bottleneck.[citation needed] This produced the consequence of certain otherwise rare genetic diseases, for example Xeroderma pigmentosum, stemming from recessive genes to present with greater dominance.[22] An alternative put forth by some Navajo is that the sudden rise in the Xeroderma pigmentosum is directly related to wide spread uranium contamination.[23]
