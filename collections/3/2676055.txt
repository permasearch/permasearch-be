The Colombian island of Providencia, about 140 miles (230Â km) off the coast of Nicaragua, was subjected to hurricane-force winds for several hours as the center of the storm moved very slowly by the island. Reports indicate extensive damage to homes and a loss of communications with the islanders.[45]
