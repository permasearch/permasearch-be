Shaggy visits Florida with the gang, so he can see his grandma in her nursing home. In a bold attempt to try to impress her, Shaggy pretends that Daphne is his girlfriend and that he is the leader of the gang. Meanwhile, an Ape Man begins rampaging around the nursing home, a tropical storm hits the area, and Fred wears a pair of very "upsetting" shorts.
