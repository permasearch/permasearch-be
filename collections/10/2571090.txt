The recipient's SMTP server sees only the forwarding system's IP address. In general it has no reason to trust the Received: headerfield generated by the forwarding system and does not know the originating system's IP address. Therefore, recipients cannot reliably distinguish spam to the alias address from spam generated on the forwarding system. When a recipient reports a message to his ISP as spam, the ISP credits that spam to the forwarding system. ISPs with low abuse thresholds may begin blocking email from the forwarding system.
