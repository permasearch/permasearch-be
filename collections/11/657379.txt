While Toronto has been home to American football teams, including the Continental Football League's Toronto Rifles from 1965â€“67, no NFL team has ever been based in the city. However, there have been numerous efforts to bring an NFL club to Toronto over the last than 40 years.[89] In 1952 it was reported that the Dallas Texans of the NFL might be moved to Toronto.[90] In 1955, Eric Cradock, who would later become part owner of the Argos, stated that he had held discussions with the NFL about establishing a Toronto NFL team.[3] Later that year it was reported that the Argos would join the NFL by 1957, contingent upon a larger stadium being constructed, and that there were several other bidders for a Toronto NFL team.[91] A Toronto group announced in 1960 that they were in negotiations with the league for a Toronto franchise to begin play by 1962.[92] The same year, a separate group brought the New York Giants and Chicago Bears to Toronto to play an exhibition game at Varsity Stadium with the goal of eventually acquiring an expansion franchise for the city.[4] However, prior to the game George Halas, owner of the Bears and chairman of the NFL's expansion committee, said on NFL expansion into Canada "we should not do anything detrimental to [Canada's] game".[93] In 1964 a Toronto group submitted a bid for an expansion franchise to begin play in 1967, with plans to construct a new stadium.[94][95] The following year, NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle listed the city as one of 12 potential expansion markets, but stated that "we would not want to do anything detrimental to the CFL."[96][97] In 1969, a Toronto group approached the NFL about bringing a team to the city.[98][99] Later that year, Rozelle said that that the league could expand "outside the continental United States", including possibly to Canadian cities.[100]
