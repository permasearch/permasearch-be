The company maintains strong ties, both directly and indirectly (through partnership with Phil Knight), with the University of Oregon. Nike designs the University of Oregon football program's team attire. New unique combinations are issued before every game day.[125] Tinker Hatfield, who also redesigned the university's logo, leads this effort.[126]
