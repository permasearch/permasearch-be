The microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) is a structure found in eukaryotic cells from which microtubules emerge. MTOCs have two main functions: the organization of eukaryotic flagella and cilia and the organization of the mitotic and meiotic spindle apparatus, which separate the chromosomes during cell division. The MTOC is a major site of microtubule nucleation and can be visualized in cells by immunohistochemical detection of Î³-tubulin. The morphological characteristics of MTOCs vary between the different phyla and kingdoms.[1] In animals, the two most important types of MTOCs are the basal bodies associated with cilia and the centrosome associated with spindle formation.
