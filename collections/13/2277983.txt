First Great Western received a cascade of 15 Class 150/1 DMUs from London Midland and London Overground between 2010 and 2011, following the delivery of Class 172 Turbostar units to those franchises. These allowed the Class 142 units to be returned to the Northern Rail franchise, and for the Class 143 units to move south to work the Devon and Cornwall branch lines rather than Bristol area commuter services.[81]
