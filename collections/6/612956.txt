All 17th-century American writings were essentially in the manner of British writings, and both the content and form of the literature of this first century in America were markedly English.[4] John Smith is credited with initiating American literature, and wrote in the tradition of geographic literature and written to explain colonizing opportunities to Englishmen.[4] His numerous publications also offered practical advice on seamanship and colonization, and his literary achievements were probably more important to Englandâ€™s imperial aspirations than his travel ones.[5]
