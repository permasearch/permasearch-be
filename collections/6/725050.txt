Germline modification has been around since the 1980s, as there have been successful animal trials dating back to that time.[12] In order for germline modification to be successful, medical professionals must know how to introduce a gene into the patient'sâ€™ cell and the germline so that it will be transferred subsequent generations and still maintain the proper functionality.[13] The way in which genes are integrated into the DNA is what determines that difference between germline modification and somatic cell modification.[14] In order to be transferred to subsequent generations, these changes need to be carried out through the development of germ cells.[15] Changes in the germline result in permanent and heritable changes to the DNA.[14] While amplification of positive effects would occur, there is also the risk that amplification of possible negative effects would also occur.[15] Since the results are generational, it is more complicated to study the long-term effects and therefore it is not a simple task to figure out if the benefits of germline modification outweigh the harm.[15] Allowing families to have the ability to design their children and select for desirable traits is another major concern that germline modification presents.[15]
