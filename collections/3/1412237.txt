Death by exposure has been reported in the deserts, particularly during the hot summer season.[234] "Exposure to the elements" encompasses hypothermia, dehydration, heat strokes, drowning, and suffocation.

Martinez points out that engaging in high speed pursuits while attempting to escape arrest can lead to death.[235] Many migrants are also killed or maimed riding the roofs of cargo trains in Mexico.[236]
