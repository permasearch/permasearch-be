On November 24, 2004, Viacom paid out US$3.5 million to settle outstanding indecency complaints and stated that it would challenge the US$550,000 penalty related to the incident, on the grounds that the broadcast was unintentional and thus exempt from indecency regulation.[112] In March 2006, the FCC affirmed that the Super Bowl halftime show was indecent,[113] so CBS paid the FCC's issued fine in July 2006 in order to take their appeal against their fine to federal court.[114] CBS appealed the fine on September 17 at the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia.[115]
