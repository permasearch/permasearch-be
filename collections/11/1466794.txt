Canada's biggest market for seal pelts is Norway.[71] Carino Limited is one of Newfoundland's largest seal pelt producers. Carino (CAnada–RIeber–NOrway) is marketing its seal pelts mainly through its parent company, GC Rieber Skinn, Bergen, Norway.[72] Canada sold pelts to eleven countries in 2004. The next largest were Germany, Greenland, and China/Hong Kong. Other importers were Finland, Denmark, France, Greece, South Korea, and Russia.[54] Asia remains the principal market for seal meat exports.[57] One of Canada's market access priorities for 2002 was to "continue to press Korean authorities to obtain the necessary approvals for the sale of seal meat for human consumption in Korea."[73] Canadian and Korean officials agreed in 2003 on specific Korean import requirements for seal meat.[73] For 2004, only Taiwan and South Korea purchased seal meat from Canada.[54]
