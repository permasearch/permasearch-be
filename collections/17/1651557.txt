Eddard Stark awakens in his chambers with Robert Baratheon and Cersei Lannister watching him. Cersei accuses Eddard of kidnapping her brother, Tyrion, and claims Eddard was drunk and attacked Jaime first, but she is silenced by a slap from Robert. After she leaves, Robert tells Eddard that he cannot rule the kingdoms if the Lannisters and Starks are at war and insists that Eddard remain the Hand of the King, or else Robert will give the position to Jaime. Robert also informs Eddard that he will be regent while Robert is away on a hunting trip.
