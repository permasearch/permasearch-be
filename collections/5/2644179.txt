Approximately 8.0 million tickets were proposed to be available for the Olympics, and 1.5 million tickets for the Paralympics.[30][31] and the London Organising Committee planned on selling a total of 6.5 million (an 81% sellout) Olympic tickets, and a 63% sellout for Paralympic tickets.[32] Olympic tickets go on sale on 15 March 2011[33] and should remain on sale until the start of the event, depending on availability. With the purchase of a ticket, each person is entitled to free transportation on London's public transport system for that day.[30] Paralympic tickets go on sale on 9 September 2011.[34]
