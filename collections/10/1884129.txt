Some patients with this condition are disturbed by the perceived volume of their voice, causing them to speak very quietly.  Their own voice may also sound lower to other people, because the trachea has more volume when the Eustachian tube is open.  The patient may also sound as if they have congestion when speaking.  Some sufferers may have difficulty in normal activities. They may also experience increased breathing rate, such as that brought on by physical activity. The increased activity not only increases the rate and force of pressure changes in the airway, which is therefore transmitted more forcefully into the middle ear, but also drives increased blood flow to peripheral muscles, compounding the problem by further depleting the Eustachian tube of extracellular fluid and increasing patency.  The combination can lead to severe exacerbation of the symptoms.  The urge to clear the ear is often mentioned.
