Wright's performance is described as "nuanced and compelling".[7] Claire has "chilly poise" but the "coolly regal doyenne" softens over the course of the first season according to New Republic's Laura Bennet.[19] Wright plays the role with "an almost terrifying froideur".[9][1] As a couple Frank and Claire are said to "reverberate with tension and wit".[1] Michael Dobbs, who wrote the trilogy of novels upon which the British miniseries is based, compares the compelling nature of the relationship between Frank and Claire favorably to the original characters in House of Cards and likens them to Macbeth and Lady Macbeth.[9] He is not alone.[7] In season 2, she remains "equally steely".[35] Despite suggestions to the contrary, Wright insists that the character is not based on Hillary Clinton.[36]
