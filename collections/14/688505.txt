Sookie was created by Charlaine Harris. Harris stated that she decided to "shake up [her] writing style by trying something new".[citation needed] The author said that to do this she would include "all the elements I loved: mystery, the supernatural, bloody adventure, and a dash of romance. And since people had told me for years that I had a great sense of humor, I thought it would be interesting to try to include that in the book, too".[1] Harris went on to establish the protagonist of the series. When naming the character Harris decided to use her grandmother's best friend's name because "it was a fine old Southern nickname, I thought it would do well for my heroine. And "Stackhouse" just flowed right after it".[1] Sookie, Sooky, Sukie, Sukey, Sook etc. are historical Southern U.S. regional nicknames for Susannah or Susan (Hebrew, "Lily"). [2] In subsequent stories involving his characters, Truman Capote identifies the initially unnamed female "best friend" and cousin of Buddy, the narrator of his well-known 1956 short work A Christmas Memory as "Sook". Harris wanted to "write from the point of view of a human". To make Sookie more interesting as Harris would have "to live with Sookie" while writing, she decided to have the character start a relationship with a vampire as an introduction to a foreign world. Harris then decided she would have to establish a reason "sensible Sookie" would "do such a crazy thing" which led to her giving Sookie the power of telepathy.[1] In an interview Harris stated that making Sookie telepathic is "the worst thing I could think of to do to anybody". She explained this further saying "it would just be absolutely horrible to know what people really thought about you".[3] Harris felt that there are "definitely elements of Sookie in meâ€”or, more correctly, there are elements of me in her. [...] I wish I were as brave as she is!"[4] Harris said that when writing for Sookie it is "second nature to me to step into Sookie's skin".[5]
