Contralto range: The contralto voice is the lowest female voice. A true operatic contralto is rare,[9] so much so that often roles intended for contralto are performed by mezzo-sopranos. The typical contralto range lies between F3 (the F below middle C) to F5 (the second F above middle C). In the lower and upper extremes some contralto voices can sing from D3 (the D below middle C) to Bâ™­5 (the second B-flat above), one whole step short of the soprano high C.[5]
