The Falkland Islands comprises a homogeneous society, with the majority of inhabitants having been descended from Scottish and Welsh immigrants who settled the territory in 1833.[131][M] The 2006 census listed some Falklands residents as descendants of French, Gibraltarians and Scandinavians.[132] That census indicated that one-third of residents were born on the archipelago, with foreign-born residents assimilated into local culture.[133] The legal term for the right of residence is "belonging to the islands".[74] The British Nationality Act of 1983 gave British citizenship to Falkland Islanders.[131]
