With Parsons gone from the band and their tour of South Africa due to begin in two days time, the Byrds were forced to draft in their roadie Carlos Bernal as a substitute rhythm guitar player.[168]  The ensuing South African tour was a disaster, with the band finding themselves having to play to segregated audiencesâ€”something that they had been assured by promoters they would not have to do.[168][172]  The under-rehearsed band gave ramshackle performances to audiences that were largely unimpressed with their lack of professionalism and their antagonistic, anti-apartheid stance.[172]  The Byrds left South Africa amid a storm of bad publicity and death threats,[172] while the liberal press in the U.S. and the UK attacked the band for undertaking the tour and questioned their political integrity.[172][173]  McGuinn attempted to counter this criticism by asserting that the tour of South Africa had, in some small way, been an attempt to challenge the country's political status quo and protest against apartheid.[173]
