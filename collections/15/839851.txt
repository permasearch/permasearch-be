Loans taken out for courses beginning after 1 September 2012 (which are much larger due to the increase in tuition fees) will be repaid under a new 'Plan 2' variant of the ICR scheme.[28] Such loans did not enter repayment until at least April 2016. Under this scheme, repayments are also calculated as 9% of annual gross income, but relative to a higher initial threshold than Plan 1. The interest for these loans will initially accrue at the rate of RPI plus 3% until they become eligible for repayment (the April after graduating), after which there will be a progressive rate of interest dependent on income. The rate will range from RPI for those earning up to £21,000 per annum, up to a maximum of RPI+3% at a salary of £41,000 and above.[29] On average students with loans taken after September 2012 will have accrued £44,000 of debt.[27][needs update]. This average loan balance increased further from academic year 2016/17 with the large shift from maintenance grant to maintenance loan funding. The repayment threshold for Plan 2 loans was increased from £21,000 to £25,000 for tax year 2018/19, and annually with average earnings thereafter, despite a previous intention to freeze it at £21,000 until at least April 2021. This is a very expensive change and it is unclear whether it can be sustained into the future. At the same time, the upper interest threshold was raised to £45,000 from £41,000.
