This story takes place at the Golden Palm resort on the Caribbean island of St HonorÃ©. Miss Marple's nephew has paid for her to holiday there after a bout of ill health - but she is bored. She is approached by Major Palgrave, a garrulous man avoided by the other guests due to his long-winded stories. She sits, half listening, until Major Palgrave tells a story about a man who got away with murder more than once. When Palgrave asks her if she wants to see a picture of a murderer, she listens intently - but after he fishes into his wallet for the photo, he suddenly changes the subject. Miss Marple looks up to see why and spots several people nearby.
