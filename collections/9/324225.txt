The video was directed by Jim May & Coke Sams. The video opens with Kathy Mattea dining at the Pie Wagon, a small diner off Music Row in Nashville, where a truck driver approaches Kathy and asks for her autograph as a present for his wife. Throughout the video, there are scenes of Kathy on her tour bus, performing with her band, and scenes of the trucker. In the end, the driver makes it home, his wife greeting him, and he hands her the dozen roses mentioned in the song's lyric, as they walk arm in arm into their house;  Kathy turns off the lights to the bus, and the last shot is one also seen in the beginning of the video; various trucks driving on the highway.
