No treatment is necessary for a diagnosis of complete miscarriage (so long as ectopic pregnancy is ruled out). In cases of an incomplete miscarriage, empty sac, or missed abortion there are three treatment options: watchful waiting, medical management, and surgical treatment. With no treatment (watchful waiting), most miscarriages (65â€“80%) will pass naturally within two to six weeks.[102] This treatment avoids the possible side effects and complications of medications and surgery,[103] but increases the risk of mild bleeding, need for unplanned surgical treatment, and incomplete miscarriage. Medical treatment usually consists of using misoprostol (a prostaglandin) to contract the uterus, expelling remaining tissue out of the cervix. This works within a few days in 95% of cases.[102]  Vacuum aspiration or sharp curettage can be used, though vacuum aspiration is lower-risk and more common.[102]
