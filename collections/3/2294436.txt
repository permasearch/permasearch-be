Girma was born deafblind in Oakland, California in 1988, after her mother fled Eritrea in 1983 and met her father, an Ethiopian, in California.[3][1] Growing up in the US school system, Girma benefited from civil rights laws including the Americans with Disabilities Act.[3] She also had accessible technology, such as a digital Braille device - something her elder brother, who is also deafblind, did not have access to in Eritrea.[3]
