On May 3, colonial governor Winship argued for a light artillery unit.[52] On March 16, 1936, the PRNG underwent a reorganization.[53] In February 1934, Gen. George Leach, who oversaw Company A of the 295th, visited Puerto Rico and was surprised to see that the bayonets had been repaired motu proprio with local resources and their discipline, promoting him to pronounce during a speech that he had "inspected the national guards of the 48 states" and not seen one better prepared than the PRNG, going to the extent that if the president asked which was the best regiment for defense, it would be the 295th.[54] The 296th remained under the supervision of the 295th until June 1, 1936, when it was designated as a regiment under Col. Luis Irizarry.[53] In 1937, the 296th first Battalion was reassigned to the 295th as Company A.[51] In 1938, the PRNG joined the 65th Infantry Regiment and participated in exercises supervised by Gen. Frank Ross McKoy.[55] On July 25, 1938, Irizarry was killed during an assassination attempt against colonial governor Winship in one of several confrontations between the government and the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party following the events of the Ponce massacre.[53] Col. JosÃ© Enrique Colom took over the 296th Regiment.[56]
