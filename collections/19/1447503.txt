Egyptian President Nasser was in a difficult position. He had received humiliating rebukes for Egypt's lack of action after the recent Israeli attacks on Jordan and Syria in April 1967. This, combined with Israeli threats to topple the Syrian regime and the Soviet urging that the Syrian-Egyptian defence agreement had thereby been triggered, left Nasser feeling as though he had no option other than to display solidarity with Syria.[112] On 14 May, Nasser began the re-militarization of the Sinai, and concentrated tanks and troops there.[113] This move was reminiscent of what he had done in the Rotem Crisis, although this time it was done openly.[114] Fawzi reported to Nasser that the Soviet alarm about an Israeli plot to attack Syria was baseless, but Nasser continued to pour his divisions into Sinai.[111]
