The production crew of Adventure Time are also pleased with the character. Near the start of the series, Ward stated that Marceline was his favorite character because he does not "know everything about her character yet", which he finds "mysterious [and] cool".[88] Rynda claimed that Marceline was probably his favorite character in the series because "she's just really fun to draw."[5] Marceline is also particularly popular with the Adventure Time fan base, and after the release of "Evicted!" her popularity grew enormously. Ward later noted that he felt "good about that. It's nice".[89] Marceline is also popular with cosplayers, or performance artists who wear costumes and fashion accessories to represent characters from the Adventure Time universe.[83] The character's popularity has been recognized by the company that owns Adventure Time. In fact, the official press release for the Adventure Time: Marceline and the Scream Queens companion comic book referred to the character as a "fan-favorite".[58]
