Fish schools are faced with decisions they must make if they are to remain together. For example, a decision might be which direction to swim when confronted by a predator, which areas to stop and forage, or when and where to migrate.[76] How are these decisions made? Do more experienced 'leaders' exert more influence than other group members, or does the group make a decision by consensus?
