Nicolaus Copernicus was born and raised in Royal Prussia, a semiautonomous and polyglot region under rule by the Kingdom of Poland.[135][136] Copernicus was the child of German-speaking parents and grew up with German as his mother tongue.[137][138][139] His alma mater was the University of Kraków in Poland. When he later studied in Italy, at the University of Bologna Copernicus joined the "German Nation", the student organization for German-speakers of all allegiances (Germany would not become a nation-state until 1871).[140][141] His family stood against the Teutonic Order and actively supported the city of Toruń during the Thirteen Years' War. Copernicus' father lent money to King Casimir IV Jagiellon of Poland to finance the war against the Teutonic Knights,[142] but the inhabitants of Royal Prussia also resisted the Polish crown's efforts for greater control over the region.[135]
