It was announced in parliament that 7 589 conscripts failed to report for National Service in January 1985, as opposed to only 1 596 in the whole of 1984. [a] As there were two intakes annually, in January and July, this would suggest a tenfold increase in non-reportees over the previous year.  An estimated additional 7 000 "draft-dodgers" were also said to be living in Europe in 1985.This campaign received as significant boost when at 1983 Durban Conference the National PFP Youth, its Western Cape Chairperson Stephen Drus ( Stephen Darori) endorsed the ECC and proposed a motion calling for Alternative to Conscription. The motion  was passed unanimously.He proposed the  same motion  at the Annual Conference of the PFP in Cape Town a few months later which  passed with little opposition.Following intense backroom negotiations between Harry Schwarz and Philip Myburg, the Defense Spokesmen of the PFP, the Nationalist Government passed an amendment that introduced a four-year Alternative to Conscription. 1452 people opted for the Alternative to Conscription between 1984 and the cancelling of Conscription in South Africa in 1993.
