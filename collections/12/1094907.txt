News of Abraham's desire to release an official authorized film reached Hollywood, and American film producer, Moctesuma Esparza. Esparza immediately approached Abraham at his office in Corpus Christi, Texas about partnering to produce the film.[6] He educated Abraham about the filmmaking process and the support system he could provide while giving Abraham authoritative control over casting, approval of the script and choosing the director.[6] On August 30, 1995 (a week after he and Abraham agreed to partner), Esparza returned to Corpus Christi from California and brought Gregory Nava.[6] Abraham disliked Esparza's decision and expressed concern about Nava's potential involvement.[6] Abraham told Esparza he did not want Nava to be the director because of his ego, though Esparza convinced Abraham that he was the perfect candidate.[6] Producer Robert Katz later said Nava was chosen because other films he directed "has a very uplifting and positive quality" and believed they deal with "very strong and tragic elements."[6] The Dallas Morning News found Nava's works to give "moviegoers a passionate, powerful look at Hispanic life".[7] On September 8, 1995, Abraham informed the media on his decision to partner with Esparza/Katz Productions and announced the film's budget to be in the range of $15 and $20 million.[8] In an Entertainment Weekly interview, Abraham confessed on wanting the duo because they were "in tune with our culture".[8] Other Hispanic filmmakers were considered to direct the film including Luis Valdez and Edward James Olmos but had settled with Nava.[8] Katz said the team had overcome "what most people thought was a fatal contract" by entrusting Abraham's decisions and having a working relationship with him throughout the film's production: "working things out in advance so the studios knew exactly what we were proposing."[6]
