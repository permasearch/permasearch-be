Although the color is sometimes randomly chosen, professional queen breeders use a color that identifies the year a queen hatched, which helps them to decide whether their queens are too old to maintain a strong hive and need to be replaced. The mnemonic taught to assist beekeepers in remembering the colour order is Will You Raise Good Bees (white, yellow, red, green, blue).[8] Sometimes tiny convex disks marked with identification numbers (OpalithplÃ¤ttchen) are used when a beekeeper has many queens born in the same year.
