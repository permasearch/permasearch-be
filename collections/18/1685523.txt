Generalized transduction is the process by which any bacterial gene may be transferred to another bacterium via a bacteriophage, and very rarely a small number of phages carry the donor(bacterial genome)genome,(1 phage in 10.000 ones carry the donor genome).[5] In essence, this is the packaging of bacterial DNA into a viral envelope. This may occur in two main ways, recombination and headful packaging.
