Some of the Olympic values that the IOC promotes are practicing sport ethically, eliminating discrimination from sports, encouraging women’s involvement in sport, fighting the use of drugs in sport, and blending sport, culture, and education.[111] The IOC supports these values by creating different commissions that focus on a particular area. These commissions hold conferences throughout the year where different people around the world discuss ideas and ways to implement the Olympic values into the lives of people internationally.[111] The commissions also have the responsibility of reporting their findings to the President of the IOC and its Executive Board.[111] The President has the authority to assign members to different commissions based on the person’s interests and specialties.
