There are three main classifications of anaphylaxis. Anaphylactic shock is associated with systemic vasodilation that causes low blood pressure which is by definition 30% lower than the person's baseline or below standard values.[14] Biphasic anaphylaxis is the recurrence of symptoms within 1â€“72 hours with no further exposure to the allergen.[3] Reports of incidence vary, with some studies claiming as many as 20% of cases.[33] The recurrence typically occurs within 8 hours.[8] It is managed in the same manner as anaphylaxis.[7] Pseudoanaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions are a type of anaphylaxis that does not involve an allergic reaction but is due to direct mast cell degranulation.[8][34] Non-immune anaphylaxis is the current term used by the World Allergy Organization[34] with some recommending that the old terminology no longer be used.[8]
