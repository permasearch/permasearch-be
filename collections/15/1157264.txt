The game began on Saturday, April 18, 1981 at 8:25 p.m.,[1] after a delay of about 30 minutes due to problems with stadium lights, with 1,740 in attendance. It continued through the night and into Easter morning. Although most leagues have a curfew rule that would have suspended the game—the International League's activates at 12:50 a.m.[2]—the rule book that the home plate umpire Dennis Cregg[1] had did not contain one.[3] After Pawtucket's Russ Laribee's sacrifice fly drove in Chico Walker in the bottom of the ninth inning and tied the game at one run each,[citation needed] the teams continued playing.[3]
