In 838, the Cornish and their Danish allies were defeated by Egbert in the Battle of Hingston Down at Hengestesdune (probably Hingston Down in Cornwall). In 875, the last recorded king of Cornwall, Dumgarth, is said to have drowned.[89] Around the 880s, Anglo-Saxons from Wessex had established modest land holdings in the eastern part of Cornwall; notably Alfred the Great who had acquired a few estates.[90] William of Malmesbury, writing around 1120, says that King Athelstan of England (924â€“939) fixed the boundary between English and Cornish people at the east bank of the River Tamar.[13]
