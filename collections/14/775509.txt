A crime scene is often preserved by setting up a blockade to control the movement in and out of a scene as well as maintaining the scene's integrity.[4] A perimeter is taped off with barricade tape in order to keep only those necessary on site. This is done to prevent contaminated evidence. Investigators try to avoid contamination at all costs. While it is difficult to completely avoid contamination, many steps are taken to ensure the integrity of the crime scene remains intact. Officers take care to not eat, drink, smoke, or take their breaks near the crime scene. Anything leftover by the officers on scene could be mistaken for potential evidence and tamper with the success of the investigation.
