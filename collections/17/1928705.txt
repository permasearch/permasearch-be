Global warming and its consequences present new challenges to modern society. Among these is a degree of uncertainty among scientists about how to communicate the dramatic environmental changes that may be in store. For example, in 2007 James Hansen of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies published a paper about scientific reticence in Environmental Research Letters, an on-line science journal open to the public.[16] He proposed that normally quite articulate scientists become reluctant to communicate the full threat of potentially large and damaging future sea-level rise out of a misplaced sense of scientific conservatism.
