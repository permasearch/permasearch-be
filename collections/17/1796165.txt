Slaughter of cow (includes bull, bullock, ox, heifer or calf), and its progeny, is totally prohibited. The export of cattle for slaughter and the sale of beef are both prohibited. Anyone violating the law can be punished with imprisonment up to a maximum of 2 years or fine up to â‚¹1,000 or both. The law places the burden of proof on the accused. The crime is treated as a cognizable and non-bailable offence.[196]
