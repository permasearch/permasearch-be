Central obesity is associated with a statistically higher risk of heart disease, hypertension, insulin resistance, and Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 (see below).[6] With an increase in the waist to hip ratio and overall waist circumference the risk of death increases as well.[7] Metabolic syndrome is associated with abdominal obesity, blood lipid disorders, inflammation, insulin resistance, full-blown diabetes, and increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease.[8][9][10][11] It is now generally believed that intra-abdominal fat is the depot that conveys the biggest health risk.[5][12]
