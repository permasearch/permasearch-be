Albany City Hall, designed by Henry Hobson Richardson, was opened in 1883. The New York State Capitol was opened in 1899 (after 32 years of construction)[140] at a cost of $25 million, making it the most expensive government building at the time.[146] Albany's Union Station, a major Beaux-Arts design,[147] was under construction at the same time; it opened in 1900. In 1912, the Beaux-Arts styled New York State Department of Education Building opened on Washington Avenue near the Capitol. It has a classical exterior, which features a block-long white marble colonnade.[148] The 1920s brought the Art Deco movement, which is illustrated by the Home Savings Bank Building (1927) on North Pearl Street[149] and the Alfred E. Smith Building (1930) on South Swan Street,[150] two of Albany's tallest high-rises.[151]
