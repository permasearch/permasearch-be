In 1946â€“47, Abdullah said that he had no intention to "resist or impede the partition of Palestine and creation of a Jewish state."[75] Ideally, Abdullah would have liked to annex all of Palestine, but he was prepared to compromise.[76][77] He supported the partition, intending that the West Bank area of the British Mandate allocated for the Arab state be annexed to Jordan.[78] Abdullah had secret meetings with the Jewish Agency (at which the future Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir was among the delegates) that reached an agreement of Jewish non-interference with Jordanian annexation of the West Bank (although Abdullah failed in his goal of acquiring an outlet to the Mediterranean Sea through the Negev desert) and of Jordanian agreement not to attack the area of the Jewish state contained in the United Nations partition resolution (in which Jerusalem was given neither to the Arab nor the Jewish state, but was to be an internationally administered area). In order to keep their support to his plan of annexation of the Arab State, Abdullah promised to the British he would not attack the Jewish State.[79]
