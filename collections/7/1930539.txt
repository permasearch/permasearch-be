Although in almost all cases, the challenge is set for one gallon,[7] in some cases a different amount is used, such as six US pints (2.84 l; 5.00 imp pt).[12] Other variations of the challenge require that the contestant eat nothing during the hour of ingestion,[10] and specify that the type of milk chosen must have at least a 2% fat content (not skimmed milk).[10]
