After opening the final round with a par, eagle, and birdie, Goodman's play suddenly declined as he shot six over par for the next six holes; the lead was reduced to two strokes at the turn. Goodman bounced back and recorded four consecutive pars, then bogeyed 14, birdied 15, and  bogeyed 17. A par at the last gave him a 76 and a 287 total. At the final hole, Guldahl found a greenside bunker and missed the four-foot (1.2Â m) putt to save par that would have forced a Sunday playoff.[6] Brothers Mortie and Olin Dutra of California placed in the top ten at sixth and seventh, respectively.[5] Olin won the title the next year at Merion, near Philadelphia.
