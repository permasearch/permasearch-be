The album was not as highly rated upon its release as its predecessors with most reviewers noting that it did not seem to represent any musical advancement. In contrast, the original Rolling Stone review was more positive,[11] and ultimately the magazine gave it five stars in a later Hall of Fame review.[10] It has been called one of their strongest albums.
