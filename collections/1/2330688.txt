Vito Scaletta (Rick Pasqualone) looks through a photo album as he begins to recount his life story. Born in Sicily in 1925 to an extremely poor family, he and his family emigrate to the fictional city of Empire Bay in America a few years later, but they are no better off there than they were in Sicily. While in school, Vito gets involved with a local delinquent named Joe Barbaro (Robert Costanzo), who eventually becomes his best friend. In 1943, Vito is arrested during a botched robbery and given a choice: go to jail or join the Army. He chooses the latter and is sent to Sicily during World War II, where he serves as a paratrooper in Operation Husky for a further year and a half before being wounded and sent home on leave.
