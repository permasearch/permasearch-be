Seneca was a prolific writer of philosophical works on Stoicism, mostly on ethics, with one work (Naturales Quaestiones) on the physical world.[54] Stoicism was a popular philosophy in this period, and many upper-class Romans found in it a guiding ethical framework for political involvement.[54] It was once popular to regard Seneca as being very eclectic in his Stoicism,[55] but modern scholarship views him as a fairly orthodox Stoic, albeit a free-minded one.[56] He knew the writings of many of the earlier Stoics: he often mentions Zeno, Cleanthes, and Chrysippus;[57] and he frequently cites Posidonius, with whom Seneca shared an interest in natural phenomena.[58] His works contain many references to other ancient philosophers, and it has often been noted that he frequently quotes Epicurus, especially in his Letters.[59] However, Seneca's interest in Epicurus is mainly limited to using him as a source of ethical maxims.[60] Likewise Seneca shows some interest in Platonist metaphysics, but never with any clear commitment.[61] His surviving moral essays are based on Stoic doctrines,[62] but are formulated in Latin and usually in a non-technical language.[63] Seneca has in mind an audience who aren't necessarily Stoics.[62] His works discuss both ethical theory and practical advice, and Seneca stresses that both parts are distinct but interdependent.[64] His Letters to Lucilius remain one of his most popular works: by offering ethical guidance, they showcase Seneca's search for ethical perfection.[64]
