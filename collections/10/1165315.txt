Thomas Austin Preston Jr. was born on December 31, 1928, in Johnson, Arkansas, but when he was an infant his parents moved to Turkey, Texas. After they divorced, his mother returned to Johnson, while his father moved to Amarillo. Slim is quoted as saying: "It's a good thing he did, because Amarillo Slim sounds a heck of a lot better than Turkey Tom or Arkansas Austin."[7] Preston was divorced, had three children, and lived in Amarillo, Texas.[8]
