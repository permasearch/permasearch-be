A tradition on the "kettle" started in 1891, in San Francisco, by Salvation Army officer Captain Joseph McFee.[1] Captain McFee, resolving to provide a free Christmas dinner to the poor of San Francisco, remembered a sight he saw in Liverpool, England. From his days as a sailor McFee remembered a large pot displayed on the Stage Landing, called "Simpson's Pot." The pot took in donations put in by passersby. Taking this idea, McFee asked for permission from San Francisco city authorities to place a crab pot and tripod at the Oakland ferry landing. The kettle - and McFee's call of "Keep the Pot Boiling!" - drew in passengers and donations.
