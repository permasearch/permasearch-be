Average hexavalent chromium levels in Hinkley were recorded as 1.19 parts-per-billion (ppb) with an estimated peak of 20 ppb. The PG&E Topock Compressor Station averaged 7.8 ppb and peaks at 31.8 ppb based on the PG&E Background Study.[35] The proposed California health goal for hexavalent chromium was 0.02 ppb in 2011[36] In 1991 when the EPA raised the federal maximum contaminant level (MCL) for total chromium to 100 ppb, the State of California chose to remain with its 50 ppb MCL.[35] However, the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) now acknowledges that "at the time Total Chromium MCLs were established, ingested Hexavalent Chromium associated with consumption of drinking water was not considered to pose a cancer risk, as is now the case."[31]
