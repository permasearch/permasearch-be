Who Has Seen the Wind tells the story of young Brian O'Connal growing up in the 1930s on the Saskatchewan prairies. Broken into four parts covering different times in young Brian's life, the novel shows Brian struggling to come to terms with issues of life and death on the Canadian prairies. In Mitchell's own preface he clearly explains the central theme of the book when he states, "I have tried to present sympathetically the struggle of a boy to understand...the ultimate meaning of the cycle of life. To him are revealed in moments of fleeting vision the realities of birth, hunger, satiety, eternity, death. They are moments when an inquiring heart seeks finality, and the chain of darkness is broken."[6]
