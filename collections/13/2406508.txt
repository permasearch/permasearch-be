In 2013, the state assembly unanimously passed a resolution to study the impact of liquor prohibition.[120] In 2014, the state's narcotics minister noted that the liquor ban had produced some serious problems in Mizo society due to the drinking of spurious and unhealthy (locally made) liquor, known as zu. The government suggested it would introduce an amended liquor bill allowing retail shops to operate in Aizawl and other district headquarters to sell liquor â€” but not in bars. Furthermore, they would not consult the powerful church on the issue.[117] The amended bill was proposed to be tabled for state legislative assembly discussion after May 2014.
