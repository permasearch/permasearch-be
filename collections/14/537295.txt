On one side of the Ring is a large star, borrowed from the seal of the state of Texas. The oak leaves symbolize strength. On the other side of the Ring are a cannon, a saber, and a rifle, symbolizing Aggies' preparedness and valor in defending their land. The crossed flags of the United States and Texas symbolize allegiance to both nation and state.[17]
