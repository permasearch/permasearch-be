Red light cameras were first developed in the Netherlands by Gatso.[15] Worldwide, red light cameras have been in use since the 1960s, and were used for traffic enforcement in Israel as early as 1969.[2] The first red light camera system was introduced in 1965, using tubes stretched across the road to detect the violation and subsequently trigger the camera. One of the first developers of these red light camera systems was Gatsometer BV.[15]
