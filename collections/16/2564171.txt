Although that is true, some historians believe that there may be other reasons behind Mudd’s relationship to Booth. The trial brought forth many theories of Mudd’s involvement in the assassination of Lincoln. One theory posits that Mudd was involved in a completely different conspiracy to gain an upper hand for the southern states. Prior to the assassination of Lincoln, Booth originally intended to kidnap the president and hold him and other political affiliates of the Union for a large sum of money.[9] The plan was in effect until the night of the assassination, when Booth met up with Atzerodt, David Herold and Lewis Paine and disclosed the plot to assassinate the president.[9] Following the assassination, Pane came forth by stating that Booth had not told him until the meeting and that the other men did not know about the plot until the night of the assassination.[9] That supports the theory that Mudd may have been an accomplice to the plot to kidnap the president but not a conspirator to the assassination.
