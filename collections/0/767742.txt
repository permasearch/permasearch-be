On the other hand, many of the most successful fast bowlers have been well above average height; for example past greats Joel Garner, Courtney Walsh, and Curtly Ambrose were all approximately 2.00 m (6 ft 6 1⁄2 in) tall. Glenn McGrath regarded as one of the finest bowlers to play the game, was 1.95 m (6 ft 5 in) tall, well above average height similarly an example of Wasim Akram or Javagal Srinath may also be put forward who were 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m). Taller bowlers have access to a higher point of release, making it easier for them to make the ball bounce uncomfortably for a batsman. For extreme pace however, bowlers tend to be close to 5 ft 11 in (1.80 m) such as Dale Steyn, Shoaib Akhtar, and Malcolm Marshall all at 1.80 m (5 ft 11 in) thus combining advantage of shorter lever arms for pace generation with good ball release height. Since round arm bowling does not gain much advantage from taller release height, round arm bowlers tend to be shorter such as the classic Lasith Malinga at 1.68 m (5 ft 6 in). The fastest modern bowlers have ranged from Fidel Edwards 1.65 m (5 ft 5 in) through to Brett Lee at 1.87m (6 ft 2 in), and Steve Harmison and Shaun Tait at 1.93 m (6 ft 4 in).
