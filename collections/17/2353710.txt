According to Jermaine Jackson's 2011 book You Are Not Alone: Michael Through a Brother's Eyes, after the London concerts finished, Jackson was planning to extend his deal with AEG Live which included new music, a possible three-picture movie deal, a long series of one-off concert dates starting in China, a halftime slot during one of the future Super Bowl games to overshadow his own legendary halftime show performance at the Super Bowl XXVII in 1993 and another couple of tours (one of which was to be a final reunion with his brothers based on a promise made to their mother to see her sons perform together again one last time before she died). After the deal was completed, he planned to take time off from musical entertainment and move on to (possibly) directing his own film ideas, such as making a feature-length motion picture based on his 1982 song "Thriller" and the music video of the same name. It was also stated that a yearly Halloween television special based on his horror-themed songs, such as "Thriller" and "Ghosts", was part of Jackson's deal with AEG Live.
