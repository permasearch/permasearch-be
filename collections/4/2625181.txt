Conventional antiepileptic drugs may block sodium channels or enhance γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) function. Several antiepileptic drugs have multiple or uncertain mechanisms of action.[6] Next to the voltage-gated sodium channels and components of the GABA system, their targets include GABAA receptors, the GAT-1 GABA transporter, and GABA transaminase.[7] Additional targets include voltage-gated calcium channels, SV2A, and α2δ.[8][9] By blocking sodium or calcium channels, antiepileptic drugs reduce the release of excitatory glutamate, whose release is considered to be elevated in epilepsy, but also that of GABA.[10] This is probably a side effect or even the actual mechanism of action for some antiepileptic drugs, since GABA can itself, directly or indirectly, act proconvulsively.[10] Another potential target of antiepileptic drugs is the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha.[11][12][13][14][15][16][17] The drug class was the 5th-best-selling in the US in 2007.[18]
