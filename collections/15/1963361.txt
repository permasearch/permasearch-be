Mainly in the United States, several major lawsuits emerged in 2001 claiming that priests had sexually abused minors.[36] Some priests resigned, others were defrocked and jailed[37] and financial settlements were agreed with many victims.[36] In the US, where the vast majority of sex abuse cases occurred, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops commissioned a comprehensive study that found that four percent of all priests who served in the US from 1950 to 2002 faced some sort of sexual accusation.[38][39] Further, the Church was widely criticized when it emerged that some bishops had known about abuse allegations, and reassigned many of the accused after first sending them to psychiatric counseling, instead of removing them.[36][39][40][41] Some bishops and psychiatrists contended that the prevailing psychology of the times suggested that people could be cured of such behavior through counseling.[40][42] Pope John Paul II responded by declaring that "there is no place in the priesthood and religious life for those who would harm the young".[43] The US Church instituted reforms to prevent future abuse by requiring background checks for Church employees;[44] and, because the vast majority of victims were teenage boys, the worldwide Church also prohibited the ordination of men with "deep–seated homosexual tendencies".[42] [45] It now requires dioceses faced with an allegation to alert the authorities, conduct an investigation and remove the accused from duty.[44][46] In 2008, Cardinal Cláudio Hummes, head of the Vatican Congregation for the Clergy, affirmed that the scandal was an "exceptionally serious" problem, but estimated that it was "probably caused by 'no more than 1 per cent'" of the over 400,000 Catholic priests worldwide.[38] Some commentators, such as journalist Jon Dougherty, have argued that media coverage of the issue has been excessive, given that the same problems plague other institutions such as the US public school system with much greater frequency.[47][48]
