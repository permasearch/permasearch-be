"Days in the Sun" replaces the musical theatre version's song "Human Again",[4][13] and various critics noted that the new addition was more melancholy in comparison.[13][17] Santa Cruz Sentinel's Bob Strauss called it "a melancholy remembrance of freer and/or more human past".[17] "Days in the Sun" is performed in common-time at a slow tempo of 110 beats per minute,[3][18] and composed in the key of B-flat major.[3] Seven people perform the song, while its instrumental is provided by a guitar and a piano. One singer's vocal range spans from the low note of F3 to the high note of G5.[19]
