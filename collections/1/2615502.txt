Kit Kats were introduced to Japan in 1973 when Rowntree's made an agreement with Fujiya.[2] In 2014, they were the top-selling confection in the country.[5] The Kit Kat brand took the number one sales position from Meiji chocolate in 2012, though Meiji remains the leading confection company in Japan overall.[3]
