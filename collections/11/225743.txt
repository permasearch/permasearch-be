The Master, played by Geoffrey Beevers, returns in the Fourth Doctor audio plays Trail of the White Worm,[92] The Oseidon Adventure,[93] The Evil One,[94] Requiem for the Rocket Men[95] and Death Match.[96] Beevers also appears in the fiftieth anniversary story The Light at the End[97], where he attempts to erase the Doctor's travels by using an advanced weapon to erase the TARDIS from existence, and in the Companion Chronicle Mastermind[98], which looks at how he stole a new body in the early twentieth century after his essence escaped from the Eighth Doctor's TARDIS, and survived by possessing a series of human hosts until he tricked UNIT into helping him regain access to his TARDIS.
