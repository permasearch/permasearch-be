Freshman cadets in the Corps must maintain their "holes" in spotless condition at all times, and are prohibited from keeping accessories such as televisions, radios, posters, and even food in these quarters. Freshmen in uniform must also keep a number of unique items on their person, such as nail clippers, slide ruler, white glove or polishing cloth, university I.D. card, and a copy of The Cadence, a guide- and rulebook issued to all freshman cadets; a "dish card," bearing the core values of the Corps of Cadets, is also required. Most units also require their fish to run, rather than walk, inside the dorms during the academic day, and restrict them to the use of only one side of dormitory hallways (the exact amount of room permitted is usually delineated by floor tiles).
