In series 4, 6, and 8 the judges found out which category they would be mentoring at the same time that the contestants found out their mentor, but in series 5, 7 and 9 the contestants did not know who their mentor was until they revealed themselves at the house. The judges then disband for the "judges' houses" round, where they reduce their six acts to three for the live shows.[39][40] In series 7 and 8, a total of 32 acts went through to judges' houses, giving each judge eight acts instead of six.[15]
