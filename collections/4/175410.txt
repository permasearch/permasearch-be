Warnes described the agreement that she and Cocker had that "we toured the big wide world and never lip-synced once. That was our rule, no lip-syncing. Every performance was the real deal."[4] One of their earliest live appearances was on the November 20, 1982, episode of Solid Gold.[30] Saturday Night Live followed on February 5, 1983,[31] and their performance at the 25th Annual Grammy Awards came later that month, on February 23.[26] Backstage at the Grammys Warnes said about working with Cocker, "I was told it was the weirdest pairing ever,"[32] and regarding their April 11 appearance at the 55th Academy Awards,[33] she admitted, "Neither of us were comfortable in the Oscar world. Joe performing in a white tuxedo, me in pink taffetaâ€”how absurd."[8]
