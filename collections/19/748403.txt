Qantas management has expressed strong support for Marriage Equality and LGBTIQ issues,[58] with CEO Alan Joyce said to be, "arguably the most prominent corporate voice in the marriage equality campaign."[59] As official airline partner for the Sydney Mardi Gras, Qantas decorated one of its aircraft with rainbow wording and positioned a rainbow flag next to the tailâ€™s flying kangaroo.[60] Qantas also served pride cookies to its passengers.[61] It had a rainbow roo float in the Mardi Gras parade.[59][62] There has been criticism of Qantas using its corporate power to prosecute the private interests on their staff and the community. Peter Dutton has said that chief executives such as Alan Joyce at Qantas should "stick to their knitting" rather than using the company's brand to advocate for political causes.[63] A senior church leader has made similar comments.[64] Despite the criticism, Qantas will continue to advocate for marriage equality[65] which will include offering customers specially commissioned rings with the phrase, "until we all belong". This phrase will also appear on, Qantas boarding passes and other paraphernalia. The cost of the campaign by Qantas and other participating companies is expected to be more than $5 million.[66]
