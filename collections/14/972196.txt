This equilibrium does not involve a change in hydrogen ion concentration, so should be independent of pH. The red line on the predominance diagram is not quite horizontal due to the simultaneous equilibrium with the chromate ion. The hydrogenchromate ion may be protonated, with the formation of molecular chromic acid, H2CrO4, but the pKa for the equilibrium
