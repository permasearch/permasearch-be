By 1910, homesteaders filed claims on over five million acres, and by 1923, over 93 million acres were farmed.[162] In 1910, the Great Falls land office alone saw over 1,000 homestead filings per month,[163] and the peak of 1917– 1918 saw 14,000 new homesteads each year.[158] But significant drop occurred following drought in 1919.[160]
