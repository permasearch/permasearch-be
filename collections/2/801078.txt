Maureen Ryan from the Chicago Tribune was critical about the character's initial development. Reviewing the third season's premiere, she wrote the writers should give up on Callie explaining they have made her "far too obviously the “weird girl,” but there’s nothing underneath her brusque persona."[22] Her marriage to O'Malley was well received; Staci Krause of IGN wrote: "Their relationship has been a roller coaster and it was nice to see this turn of events, as she really is a perfect contrast to George."[23] Discussing the character in terms of her relationship with Hahn, Williams was largely positive, assessing that: "The story line offered both the drama Grey's is known for and a truthfulness network television has rarely achieved when it comes to lesbian relationships."[14] Trish Doolan and Nikki Weiss, invited by GLAAD to consult with Grey's Anatomy producers on the storyline, praised the effort put into researching the issue by the writers and actors involved, though were more negative on the scene which saw Hahn kiss Callie in an elevator in front of Mark Sloan. Weiss commented: "I just felt like, if they really cared about each other, I don't think they would do that as a stunt. That seemed a little, I don't know, forced. [...] [It] was more like a conquest, like he could have [Hahn] too or something."[14] LGBT website AfterEllen.com agreed with this view, criticizing the way the scene was edited so as to keep cutting to Sloan's point of view, as though "privileging the male gaze."[14] AfterEllen.com included Torres in their list of the Top 50 Lesbian and Bisexual Characters, ranking her at No. 6[24] and in their Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters.[25] The character was also listed in Wetpaint's "10 Hottest TV Doctors on TV".[26]
