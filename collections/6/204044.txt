The generals and staff officers had to reform Bartlett's brigade and deploy the men at right angles to the Confederate line so they would not be trapped if the Confederates managed a counterattack.[215] Chamberlain rushed two regiments to help.[215] Together, these units put the Confederates to flight, taking about 1,500 prisoners and several battle flags.[169][215] Bartlett and Chamberlain reorganized 150 to 200 stragglers and put them back into the battle.[215] Chamberlain saw Colonel Gwyn's battle flag to the rear and asked Gwyn to have his brigade assist Chamberlain's men, which Gwyn did.[213][215] Suddenly confronted by a large number of Confederates, Chamberlain feared being caught in a cross-fire when the Confederates suddenly threw down their arms and surrendered.[216]
