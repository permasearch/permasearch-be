Drew Brees holds the NFL record, 54 games, for consecutive games with at least one touchdown pass.[7] He set the record on October 7, 2012,[8] when he surpassed the streak of 47 consecutive games by Johnny Unitas which had stood since December 11, 1960.[1] Unitas had held the record for nearly 52 years after surpassing Cecil Isbell's streak of 23, which had been established as the record in 1942.[9][10] Brees's record streak ended on November 29, 2012, against the Atlanta Falcons.[7] Brees began another streak of 45 consecutive games with a touchdown pass one week later; therefore, he threw at least one touchdown pass in 99 out of 100 consecutive games.
