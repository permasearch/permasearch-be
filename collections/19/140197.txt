Martin has written several prequel novellas. The Tales of Dunk and Egg series, three novellas set ninety years before the events of the novel series, feature the adventures of Ser Duncan the Tall and his squire "Egg", the later King Aegon V Targaryen. The stories have no direct connection to the plot of A Song of Ice and Fire, although both characters are mentioned in A Storm of Swords and A Feast For Crows, respectively. The first installment, The Hedge Knight, was published in the 1998 anthology Legends. The Sworn Sword followed in 2003, published in Legends II.[42] Both were later adapted into graphic novels.[148] The third novella, titled The Mystery Knight, was first published in the 2010 anthology Warriors,[149] and is planned to be adapted as a graphic novel as well.[150] Martin planned to release the first three novellas as one collection in 2014.[151] Up to eight further Dunk and Egg installments are planned.[39]
