For a healthy human heart   the entire cardiac cycle typically runs less than one second. That is, for a typical heart rate of 75 beats per minute (bpm), the cycle requires 0.3 sec in ventricular systole (contraction)â€”pumping blood to all body systems from the two ventricles; and 0.5 sec in diastole (dilation), re-filling the four chambers of the heart, for a total time of 0.8 sec to complete the entire cycle.[2]
