Campbell had his most productive rushing yardage season in 1980, with 1,934 yards in 15 games—an average of 128.9 yards per game. He finished 70 yards short of breaking O. J. Simpson's single-season rushing yards record set in 1973.[37] He again led the league in rushing yards and touchdowns, and broke his own record for carries, with 373. Over 60 percent of his yards came in the fourth quarter. "That's when the tough get going," said Campbell.[38] He had four games of over 200 rushing yards, a single-season record that still stands as of the end of the 2016 season.[39] He also threw a 57-yard touchdown pass to receiver Billy "White Shoes" Johnson against the Steelers for his only career completion out of three attempts.[40] The Oilers again finished with an 11–5 regular season record, but lost the wild-card playoff game to the Oakland Raiders. For the third straight year, Campbell was awarded the Jim Thorpe Trophy by the Newspaper Enterprise Association as the league's MVP,[41] and named the Offensive Player of the Year by the AP.[37]
