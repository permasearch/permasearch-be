Brahmagupta's Identity:       (  x  2   − N  y  2   ) (  x  ′  2    − N  y  ′  2    ) = ( x  x ′  + N y  y ′   )  2   − N ( x  y ′  +  x ′  y  )  2     {\displaystyle \ (x^{2}-Ny^{2})(x'^{2}-Ny'^{2})=(xx'+Nyy')^{2}-N(xy'+x'y)^{2}}   which was a generalisation of an earlier identity of Diophantus:[72]  Brahmagupta used his identity to prove the following lemma:[72]
