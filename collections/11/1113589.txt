Monarch butterfly counts can be compared to bird counts. During a butterfly count, individuals and organized groups count the numbers of butterflies that they observe during a discrete time period and within a predetermined area. The western population of monarchs are counted during their 'Thanksgiving Butterfly Count'.[67] Methods differ but can include consistent observations of butterflies traversing areas within predetermined limits, presumably along the migratory route measured in butterflies/hour sometimes with recording vectors. Data collected are likely to be accurate and become more accurate with the increasing number of samples.[8] Concentrations of migrating monarchs are consistently monitored by Cape May Bird Observatory,[68] Peninsula Point Light, Michigan, and Point Pelee National Park, Ontario, Canada.
