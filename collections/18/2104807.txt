Before the US entered the War at the end of 1941, B-Dienst could also read several American codes. This changed after April 1942, when the US Navy changed their code systems, but earlier, the ability to read American message traffic contributed to the success of "Operation Paukenschlag" (Operation Drumbeat), the successful U-boat attacks off the American East Coast in early 1942.
