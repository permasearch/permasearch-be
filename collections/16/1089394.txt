Iorfida wrote in 2008 that the Bills and Dolphins had "one of the stranger rivalries in sports" due to the differences between Buffalo and Miami.[4] In 1980, The Miami News' Joe Crittenden referred to "the contrast between the two cities â€“ Miami, the resort center in the subtropics and Buffalo, the snowfall capital of the east".[9] He wrote that, when the Dolphins were building their 20-game winning streak in the 1970s, the differences contributed to the "intensity" of the rivalry.[9] The CBC also noted the long distance between the teams' cities as an oddity.[4] Despite this distance, they are both members of the AFC East, and have played at least two games per year since the Dolphins first joined the AFL.[2] Games between the Bills and Dolphins were often significant in the league standings during the 1980s and 1990s, and Monday Night Football had nine games from the rivalry during the period.[43]
