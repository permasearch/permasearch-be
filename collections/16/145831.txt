John William Henry II was born on September 13, 1949 in Quincy, Illinois. His parents were soybean farmers, and he split his time growing up between Illinois and Arkansas. His asthmatic condition[5] at the age of 15 prompted his family to move to Apple Valley, California.[6] After his graduation from Victor Valley High School in Victorville, he attended Victor Valley College,[7] then the University of California (at Riverside, Irvine, and Los Angeles), where he majored in philosophy but did not graduate[8] â€” partly the result of performing on the road in two rock and roll bands, Elysian Fields and Hillary.[citation needed][9]
