The islands of the eastern Caribbean are constantly threatened by tropical storms and hurricanes, mainly between August and October. Dominica is a rugged island, with spots of elevation as high as nearly 4,750 feet (1,450 m).[87] As Hurricane Jeanne moved through the region, 422.3 millimetres (16.63 in) of rain fell during the 24‑hour period ending on the morning of September 15, 2004.[41]
