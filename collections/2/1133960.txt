On 27 July 1794, members of the French Convention, the revolutionary parliament of France, rose up against its leader, Maximilien Robespierre, who was in the midst of executing thousands of suspected enemies of the Revolution. Robespierre and his leading followers were declared outside the law, and on 28 July were arrested and guillotined the same day. The Revolutionary Tribunal, which had sent thousands to the guillotine, ceased meeting and its head, Fouquier-Tinville, was arrested and imprisoned, and after trial was himself guillotined. More than five hundred suspected counter-revolutionaries awaiting trial and execution were immediately released.
