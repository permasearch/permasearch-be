In Late 2017, a reserve based on the Australian tropics was released, named Piccabeen Bay. The new exotic animals with this reserve included Water buffalo, Banteng, Sambar deer, and Rusa deer. Along with this reserve's release, a new thirst mechanism was added, along with a new camo set that kept the player from overheating.
