The first inspection on new passenger cars is required after three years, another one two years on, while thereafter passenger cars must pass the official inspection annually to remain roadworthy. Heavy trucks and motorcycles must undergo annual inspections from the very first year. Inspections are carried out by specially licensed garages and by Austria's two major automotive clubs. The Austrian motor vehicle inspection covers both aspects of vehicle safety and emissions standards.
