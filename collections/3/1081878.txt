In 2014, Amis Cameron co-founded, with her husband, director James Cameron, and Craig McCaw, Plant Power Task Force, an organization focused on showing the impact of animal agriculture on climate change and the environment.[7] Plant Power Task Force supported the first multi-country studies on global diets and climate change by the independent U.K.-based think tank, Chatham House: Livestock—Climate Change’s Forgotten Sector and Changing Diets, Changing Climate.[8] They also spearheaded the "MyPlate MyPlanet" initiative in spring 2015, a platform for hundreds of environmental and health organizations in support of linking health and the environment in the U.S. Dietary Guidelines.[9]
