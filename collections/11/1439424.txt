The name Perm is of Finno-Ugric etymology, likely of Uralic origin (Komi-Permyak: Перем, Perem; Komi: Перым, Perym). Komi is a member of the Permic group of Finno-Ugric languages, which is also named for Perm. In Finnish and Vepsian perämaa means "far-away land"; similarly, in Hungarian perem means "edge" or "verge".  The geologic period of the Permian takes its name from the toponym.
