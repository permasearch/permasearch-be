The Crimean War added three new place names to Paris: Alma, named for the first French victory on the river of that name; Sevastopol; and Malakoff, named for a tower in the center of the Russian line captured by the French. The war had two important diplomatic consequences: Alexander II became an ally of France, and Britain and France were reconciled. In April 1855, Napoleon III and EugÃ©nie went to England and were received by the Queen; in turn, Victoria and Prince Albert visited Paris, the first British monarch to do so in centuries.[82]
