The Protestant Reformed Churches in America (PRCA) traces its roots to the First Protestant Reformed Church (Grand Rapids, Michigan) whose pastor was Herman Hoeksema, the founder of the church.[95] A majority of the PRCA's Classis East churches, about 13 congregations, are located around Grand Rapids.[92][96][97]
