Shawnee Mission North High School was founded in 1922 in order to help educate the increasing number of students due to the emerging population of Shawnee Mission. Throughout the years, several expansions and add-ons were constructed to the school. In 1950, a large addition was added, finally connecting all of the buildings through hallways. A swimming pool and science wing were constructed in 1969 which connected to the south academic wing. A new library was added in the summer of 1997. In 2007, the school added a new auxiliary gym, new tennis courts, pool and auditorium remodeling, two new Biology classrooms, and expansion of the band and choir department.
