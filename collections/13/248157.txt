On 26 May 1991, the thrust reverser on the number one engine of Lauda Air Flight 004 deploys in flight without being commanded, causing the aircraft to spiral out of control, disintegrate, and crash about 100 miles northwest of Bangkok, with no survivors. Investigators later determined the cause of the false deployment to be an electrical failure, but could not determine what exactly failed.
