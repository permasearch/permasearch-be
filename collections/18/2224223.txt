The name of the Holiday Inn hotel chain was inspired by the film.[15] The title of the film had also inspired the 1946 renaming of a small 1800s inn in Intervale, New Hampshire. The owners of that inn were able to bar any other use of the name in that area of New Hampshire until they chose to relinquish the name, as their use preceded the naming of the chain.[16]
