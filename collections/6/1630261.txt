Following the system's $50 price cut and the release of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD on September 20, 2013, Wii U sales in North America saw a 200% rise over August.[186] From July to September 2013, the system sold approximately 300,000 units, which was up 87% from the three months prior.

Wii U software showed improvement in the Q2 period, reaching 5.27 million units, a 400% jump on the previous quarter.
