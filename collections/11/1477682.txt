One of the earliest attempts to use such a unitized and automated device to manage multiple engine control functions simultaneously was the "KommandogerÃ¤t" created by BMW in 1939, for their 801 14-cylinder aviation radial engine.[3] This device replaced the 6 controls used to initiate hard acceleration with one control in the 801 series-equipped aircraft. However, it had some problems: it would surge the engine, making close formation flying of the Fw 190 (Focke-Wulf Fw 190 Wurger), a single-engine single-seat German fighter aircraft, somewhat difficult, and at first it switched supercharger gears harshly and at random, which could throw the aircraft into an extremely dangerous stall.
