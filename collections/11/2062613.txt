In One Day International (ODI) matches, twenty-four bowlers have taken a wicket with their first ball. The first to accomplish this was English bowler Geoff Arnold, who bowled Graeme Watson on 24 August 1972. The most recent is Mosaddek Hossain, from Bangladesh, who struck with his debut delivery on 28 September 2016.[10] Not all of these bowlers took their first wicket in their debut match. Clive Lloyd, Inzamam-ul-Haq, Sadagoppan Ramesh, and Martin van Jaarsveld did not bowl in their debut matches, and took their first wicket on a later appearance.[11][12][13][14] Ramesh and Wavell Hinds took their first wickets during the same match on 6 September 1999; the former in the first innings of the match and the latter in the second.[15] It was also the only wicket taken by Ramesh during his ODI career.[16]
