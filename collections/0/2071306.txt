In a flashback, baby Pink is shown as "The Thin Ice" plays.  Growing up during his childhood, Pink longs for a father figure ("Another Brick In The Wall, Part I"). He discovers a scroll from "kind old King George" and other relics from his father's military service and death ("When The Tigers Broke Free, Part II").  One item he finds, a bullet, is placed on the track of an oncoming train, where he sees non-descript people riding the train.  At school, he is caught writing poems in class and humiliated by the teacher who reads a poem (part of verse 2 of the song "Money"). It is revealed that the teacher is verbally abusive to the students because his wife is verbally abusive to him ("The Happiest Days of Our Lives").  Young Pink imagines a surrealistically oppressive school system in which children fall into a meat grinder. The children then rise in rebellion and destroy the school, carrying the Teacher away to an unknown fate ("Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)"). Pink is also negatively affected by his overprotective mother ("Mother"). Such traumatic experiences are represented as "bricks" in the metaphorical wall he constructs around himself that divides him from society ("Empty Spaces").
