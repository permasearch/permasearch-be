The annexation of Taiwan was also based on practical considerations of benefit to Japan. Tokyo expected the large and productive island to furnish provisions and raw materials for Japan's expanding economy and to become a ready market for Japanese goods. Taiwan's strategic location was deemed advantageous as well. As envisioned by the navy, the island would form a southern bastion of defense from which to safeguard southernmost China and southeastern Asia. These considerations accurately forecast the major roles Taiwan would play in Japan's quest for power, wealth, and great empire.[15] Most armed resistance against Japanese rule occurred during the first 20 years of colonial rule. This period of Han and Aboriginal resistance is usually divided[by whom?] into three stages: the defense of the Republic of Formosa; guerilla warfare following the collapse of the Republic; and a final stage between the Beipu uprising of 1907, and the Tapani Incident of 1915. Afterwards, Han armed resistance was mostly replaced by peaceful forms of cultural and political activism, while the mountain Aboriginals continued to carry out armed struggle such as in the Musha incident in 1930.
