Differences in the film adaptation from the stage version include that "Tonight" is moved to follow "America"; Bernardo sings a line in "America" instead of Rosalia, with changes in the lyrics. Diesel is renamed Ice. "Gee, Officer Krupke" is moved before "Cool" and is sung by Riff instead of Action, and "Cool" is sung by Ice instead of Riff. After Riff is killed, Ice takes control of the Jets, rather than Action.[79]
