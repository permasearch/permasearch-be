In week 8, the Lions visited the Houston Texans. After a scoreless first quarter, the Texans took an early lead that they never relinquished with a pair of touchdowns. First, Brock Osweiler connected with C. J. Fiedorowicz on a six-yard touchdown pass, then Lamar Miller scored on a one-yard run. The Lions' only score of the first half was a 47-yard field goal from Matt Prater, making the halftime score 14–3. The only score of the third quarter was a 33-yard field goal from Houston's Nick Novak. Detroit responded with a one-yard touchdown catch by Theo Riddick in the fourth quarter, but the Texans went back up by 10 points after a 36-yard Novak field goal. The Lions scored the final points of the game with a 34-yard field goal. Despite the attempted late game comeback, Detroit came up short, losing 20–13 and snapping their three-game winning streak.
