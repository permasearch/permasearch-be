The title of Duke of Sussex was conferred upon Prince Augustus Frederick, the sixth son of King George III, on 24 November 1801.[3] Prince Augustus Frederick married Lady Augusta Murray at St George's Hanover Square Church, Westminster in 1793, and secondly Lady Cecilia Gore at Great Cumberland Place, London, on 2 May 1831. Both marriages were in contravention of the Royal Marriages Act 1772; thus the couple's children were illegitimate. Not being the Prince's legitimate wife, Lady Cecilia could not be received at court. On 30 March 1840, she was given the title of Duchess of Inverness in her own right by Queen Victoria.[6] Since Augustus Frederick had no legitimate issue, his titles became extinct on his death in 1843.
