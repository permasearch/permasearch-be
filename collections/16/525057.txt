Employers are liable to pay fringe benefit tax (FBT) on benefits given to employees in addition to their salary or wages (e.g. motor vehicles or low interest loans).[25] There are several methods available for calculating FBT liability, including an option of paying a flat rate of 64% on all benefits provided.[26]
