The Granny Smith is a tip-bearing apple cultivar, which originated in Australia in 1868.[1]  It is named after Maria Ann Smith, who propagated the cultivar from a chance seedling. The tree is thought to be a hybrid of Malus sylvestris, the European wild apple, with the North American apple Malus pumila as the polleniser.[citation needed]
