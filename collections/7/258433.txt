Harrison first introduced "Something" at a Beatles session on 19 September 1968, when he played it to George Martin's stand-in as producer of The Beatles, Chris Thomas, while the latter was working out the harpsichord part for Harrison's track "Piggies".[4] Despite Thomas's enthusiasm for the new composition, Harrison chose to focus on "Piggies".[27] He told Thomas that he intended to offer "Something" to singer Jackie Lomax,[4] whose debut album Harrison was producing for Apple Records.[28] "Something" was not among the tracks released on Lomax's album, however,[29] much of which was recorded in Los Angeles following the completion of the White Album.[30]
