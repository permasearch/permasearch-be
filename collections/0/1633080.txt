Criticism of the color filters did not prevent the film from topping the box office of 1958. It earned $6.4 million in rentals in North America.[9] In London, the film played continuously at the Dominion Theatre for nearly four-and-a-half years.[10] South Pacific had the honor of being the highest-grossing Rodgers and Hammerstein musical film until The Sound of Music was released seven years later.[6]
