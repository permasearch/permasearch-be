Her earliest professional recordings were made a few months later in mid-1967 for the Saga label,[7] featuring traditional songs and covers of folk contemporaries including her boyfriend of this period, the American singer-songwriter Jackson C. Frank. They were released on the albums Alex Campbell and His Friends and Sandy and Johnny with Johnny Silvo.[8] These songs were collected on the 1970 album It's Sandy Denny where the tracks from Sandy and Johnny had been re-recorded with more accomplished vocals and guitar playing.[8] The complete Saga studio recordings were issued on the 2005 compilation Where The Time Goes.[9]
