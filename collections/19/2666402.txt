The Texans responded to the 2010 poor defensive showing by firing defensive coordinator Frank Bush, secondary coach David Gibbs, linebackers coach Johnny Holland, and assistant linebackers coach Robert Saleh.[23] Kubiak, a ball boy for beloved former Houston Oilers head coach O.A. "Bum" Phillips in the 1970s, hired long-time friend, and son of Bum, Wade Phillips to take over as the Texans new defensive coordinator on January 5, 2011.[24] Phillips became available after being fired as head coach of the Dallas Cowboys halfway through the 2010 season.[25] Phillips was allowed to bring in his own assistant coaches. The Texans signed two high-profile free agent defensive backs, Johnathan Joseph and Danieal Manning, and used their first five draft picks, including two in the second round of the 2011 NFL Draft, on more defensive players.[26]
