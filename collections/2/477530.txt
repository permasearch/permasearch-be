In early 2014, there was some media speculation that an alliance might form between the AAP and Communist Party of India (Marxist). Prakash Karat, the CPI(M) leader, thought that there were some ideological similarities between the two parties, such as their agendas relating to social justice and decentralisation of power. The AAP's Prashant Bhushan explicitly refuted any joining of forces, claiming that there was corruption within the CPIM.[28][29] A columnist, T. C. A. Srinivasa Raghavan, said that the AAP was right-wing when it came to morality and left-wing when it came to economics.[30] However, the party advocates scrapping Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code and legalizing both homosexuality and same-sex marriage.[31] The party is also regarded as being populist[32] and to the left of the Indian National Congress economically.
