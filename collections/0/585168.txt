In Ancient Greece snapping of fingers was used by musicians and dancers as a way to keep the rhythm[1] and it was known with the words "ἀποληκέω" (apolekeo),[2] "ἀποκρότημα" (apokrotema)[3] (from the verb "ἀποκροτέω" - apokroteo, "to snap the fingers")[4] and "ἐπίπταισμα" (epiptaisma).[5] Finger snapping is still common in modern Greece.
