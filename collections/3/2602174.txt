Arnold hired Joseph Stansbury to initiate communications in May 1779, offering his services to the British not long after he married.  General Clinton gave Major André orders to pursue the possibility, and secret communications began between André and Arnold.  The messages that they exchanged were sometimes transmitted through Peggy's actions; letters written in her hand also include coded communications written by Benedict Arnold in invisible ink.
