At his teachers' recommendation, Stalin proceeded to the Spiritual Seminary in Tiflis.[29] He enrolled at the school in August 1894,[30] enabled by a scholarship that allowed him to study at a reduced rate.[31] Here he joined 600 trainee priests who boarded at the seminary.[32] Stalin was again academically successful and gained high grades.[33] He continued writing poetry; five of his poems were published under the pseudonym of "Soselo" in Ilia Chavchavadze's newspaper Iveria ('Georgia').[34] Thematically, they dealt with topics like nature, land, and patriotism.[35] According to Stalin's biographer Simon Sebag Montefiore, they became "minor Georgian classics",[36] and were included in various anthologies of Georgian poetry over the coming years.[36] As he grew older, Stalin lost interest in his studies; his grades dropped,[37] and he was repeatedly confined to a cell for his rebellious behaviour.[38] Teachers complained that he declared himself an atheist, chatted in class and refused to doff his hat to monks.[39]
