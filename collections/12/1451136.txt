Banks recalled writing "The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway" with Gabriel which turned out to be the last track they developed which was "a pretty good song to end on".[37] At its conclusion, the song borrows music and lyrics from the 1963 single "On Broadway" by The Drifters.[38] "Fly on a Windshield" originally came about through a band improvisation, sparked by an idea from Rutherford who suggested the idea of "Pharaohs going down the Nile" and proceed to play two chords. Banks added: "Instantly the rest of us would conjure up that particular mood."[39] Banks was particularly fond of the part when the drums and guitar come in, calling it one of the band's best ever moments.[12] Hackett chose to play "Egyptian phrases" and noted the group used a similar modulation to that of the end section of Bolero by Maurice Ravel.[15] "Back in N.Y.C." presents Genesis adopt a more aggressive sound than past compositions and includes Gabriel singing an expletive in the line "I'm not full of shit".[33] A personal highlight for Collins is "Silent Sorrow in Empty Boats"[40] and "The Waiting Room" which developed as a "basic good to bad soundscaping" jam while it was raining, before they stopped and a rainbow formed outside. Collins said that, "Steve [Hackett] played these dark chords, then Peter [Gabriel] blows into his oboe reeds, then there was a loud clap of thunder and we really thought we were entering another world or something. It was moments like that when we were still very much a unified five-piece".[12]
