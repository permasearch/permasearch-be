The engine used to power a Top Fuel drag racing car follows the basic layout found in the second generation Chrysler 426 Hemi "Elephant Engine" made from 1964-71. Although the Top Fuel engine is built exclusively of specialist parts, it retains the basic configuration with two valves per cylinder activated by pushrods from a centrally-placed camshaft. The engine has hemispherical combustion chambers, a 90 degree valve stem angle; 120 millimetres (4.8Â in) bore pitch. The configuration is identical to the overhead valve, single camshaft-in-block "Hemi" V-8 engine which became available for sale to the public in selected Chrysler Corporation (Chrysler brand) automotive products in 1950 (model year 1951).
