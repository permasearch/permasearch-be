Whitley was a longtime alcoholic, who began drinking early in his career at bluegrass gigs, long before he was legally allowed to drink alcohol. Many times, he had attempted to overcome his alcoholism, but failed; and his pre-existing depression made it more challenging for him to quit. Moreover, Whitley preferred to drink alone, making it difficult for anyone to detect that he had a problem. According to Lorrie Morgan, she tried to conceal all alcoholic beverages from him at the home they shared, even going to the extent of binding their legs together before going to bed to make it impossible for Whitley to awaken in the middle of the night to consume a drink without her knowledge - only to discover that he would drink various items such as perfume and nail polish remover to get intoxicated.
