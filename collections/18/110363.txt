The population of the Dominican Republic is mostly Spanish-speaking. The local variant of Spanish is called Dominican Spanish, which closely resembles other Spanish vernaculars in the Caribbean and the Canarian Spanish. In addition, it borrowed words from indigenous Caribbean languages particular to the island of Hispaniola.[135][136] Schools are based on a Spanish educational model; English and French are mandatory foreign languages in both private and public schools,[137] although the quality of foreign languages teaching is poor.[138] Some private educational institutes provide teaching on other languages, notably Italian, Japanese, and Mandarin.[139][140]
