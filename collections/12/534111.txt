A revised playoff system was utilized beginning with the 2012 season, which added a second wild card team for each league. The two wild card teams in each league play a one game playoff to advance. The winner of this game automatically faces the number 1 seed in the league in the Division Series, regardless of whether or not they are in the same division. Due to scheduling conflicts, the 2012 Division Series featured the lower seed hosting the first two games, with the higher seed hosting the next three games. For 2013 and beyond, the Division Series uses the 2-2-1 format previously used.[3]
