A main vertical stroke is called a stem. The letter m has three, the left, middle, and right stems. The central stroke of an s is called the spine.[5] When the stroke is part of a lowercase[2] and rises above the height of an x (called the x height), it is called an ascender.[6] Letters with ascenders are b d f h k l. A stroke which drops below the baseline is a descender.[6] Letters with descenders are g j p q y. An arching stroke is called a shoulder as in the top of an R[2] or sometimes just an arch, as in h n m. A closed curved stroke is called a bowl in b d o p q D O P Q ; B has two bowls. A trailing outstroke, as in j y J Q R is called a tail. The inferior diagonal stroke in K is called leg.[7] A short horizontal stroke, as in the center of e f and the middle stroke of E F, is called a bar. When the strokes connect as in A and H or cross strokes as in t is also known as crossbar.[7] A longer horizontal stroke at the top or bottom, as in E T, is called an arm.[2] The bottom of the two-story g is called a loop; the very short stroke at the top is called the ear.[8] i j each have a dot, jot, or tittle.[8] Angles of strokes are called apices if at the top and vertices if at the bottom. w has one apex and two vertices; v has one vertex.[8]
