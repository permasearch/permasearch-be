The "publication" and distribution of prose texts was common practice in Athens by the latter half of the fourth centuryÂ BC and Demosthenes was among the Athenian politicians who set the trend, publishing many or even all of his orations.[150] After his death, texts of his speeches survived in Athens (possibly forming part of the library of Cicero's friend, Atticus, though their fate is otherwise unknown), and in the Library of Alexandria. However, the speeches that Demosthenes "published" might have differed from the original speeches that were actually delivered (there are indications that he rewrote them with readers in mind) and therefore it is possible also that he "published" different versions of any one speech, differences that could have impacted on the Alexandrian edition of his works and thus on all subsequent editions down to the present day.[151]
