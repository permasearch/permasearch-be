In 1991, fast-pitch softball was selected to debut as a medal event for women-only at the 1996 Summer Olympics[15] The 1996 Olympics also marked a key era in the introduction of technology in softball; the IOC funded a landmark biomechanical study on pitching during the games.[citation needed] The 117th meeting of the International Olympic Committee, held in Singapore in July 2005, voted to drop softball and baseball for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games.[16][17] Attempts to get softball readded to the Olympic program for the 2016 games failed when the International Olympic Committee executive board instead selected golf and rugby sevens.[18] The United States have won three of the four Olympic tournaments.[19][20]
