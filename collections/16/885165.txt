CONUS, a technical term used by the U.S. Department of Defense, General Services Administration, NOAA/National Weather Service, and others, has been defined both as the continental United States, and as the 48 contiguous states.[14][15] The District of Columbia is not always specifically mentioned as being part of CONUS.[15]
