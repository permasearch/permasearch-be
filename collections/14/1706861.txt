During the 2016 election, presidential candidate and frontrunner, Davao City mayor Rodrigo Duterte, campaigned to restore the death penalty in the Philippines.[20][21][22] During the "Yes or No" segment of the second presidential debate on March 20, 2016, Duterte and Senator Grace Poe were the only candidates who said "Yes" when asked about the restoration of the death penalty in the country, favoring the decision.[23] Duterte, who won the election in May 2016, supports restoration of the death penalty by hanging.[24] It has been reported that he wants capital punishment for criminals involved in illegal drugs, gun-for-hire syndicates and those who commit "heinous crimes" such as rape, robbery or car theft where the victim is murdered,[24] while Poe has stated that the capital punishment should apply to criminals convicted of "drugs and multiple crimes where involved people can no longer be rehabilitated."[25] Duterte has theatrically vowed "to litter Manila Bay with the bodies of criminals."[26] In December 2016, the bill to resume capital punishment for certain "heinous offenses" swiftly passed out of Committee in the House of Representatives; it passed the full House of Representatives in February 2017.[27] As of March 2017[update], passage of the law awaits the Senate's approval.[27] However, the majority of Filipino senators have already expressed their disapproval of the death penalty, effectively blocking its reenactment.[citation needed]
