For years, Mexican authorities used the reconquering of Texas as an excuse for implementing new taxes and making the army the budgetary priority of the impoverished nation.[278] Only sporadic skirmishes resulted.[279] Larger expeditions were postponed as military funding was consistently diverted to other rebellions, out of fear that those regions would ally with Texas and further fragment the country.[278][Note 17] The northern Mexican states, the focus of the Matamoros Expedition, briefly launched an independent Republic of the Rio Grande in 1839.[280] The same year, the Mexican Congress considered a law to declare it treasonous to speak positively of Texas.[281] In June 1843, leaders of the two nations declared an armistice.[282]
