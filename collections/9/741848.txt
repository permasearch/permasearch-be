Gardner first travelled to England in 1987, leaving an adult daughter behind in Jamaica.[11][14] She entered the country legally using a six-month visitor's visa, but overstayed when the visa elapsed.[15] She was pregnant at the time of her arrival, and subsequently gave birth to a son. In September 1990 she married Briton John Gardner, who applied to the Home Office for his new wife to be granted permanent residence. Five weeks later they separated and he withdrew the request.
