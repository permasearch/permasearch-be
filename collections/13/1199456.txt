Gaston has received generally favorable reviews from film critics.[66] Simon Brew of Den of Geek was very receptive towards the character: "thanks to a mix of humour, believable character development, compelling motivation and the excellent voicing work of Richard White (proving you don’t need a big movie star on voice duties), he’s an utterly compelling antagonist, and an extremely interesting one."[21] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman hailed Gaston as "a wonderful character",[79] while The Daily Beast lauded the character as "a triumphantly funny villain".[80] The New York Times' Janet Maslin described Gaston's "fatuousness" as "well conveyed" while praising White's performance, writing that the actor "do[es] wonders in bringing ... Gaston to life."[81] Writing for IndieWire, Drew Taylor felt the fact that Gaston is "a strapping cad" as opposed to a witch or hideous creature contributes to making the film "a wholly unique experience".[82] Reviewing the film 25 years after its original theatrical release, Creative Loafing's Matt Brunson admitted that he "never grow[s] tired of watching the boorish Gaston".[83] The Seattle Times' John Hartl called White "hilarious" as Gaston.[84]
