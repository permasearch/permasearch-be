Clark established his headquarters at Redstone Old Fort on the Monongahela River, while three of Clark's associates from Dunmore's War, Joseph Bowman, Leonard Helm, and William Harrod, each began to recruit men.[12] Clark commissioned Captain William Bailey Smith as a major,[13] and gave him Â£150 to recruit four companies in the Holston River valley and then meet Clark in Kentucky.[14]
