Quiet Riot's second single "Cum on Feel the Noize" was released on August 27, 1983. A cover of the 1973 hit by Slade, the single spent two weeks at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in November 1983 and was the first heavy metal song to make the top 5 on that chart. The success of the single helped carry the album Metal Health to the top of Billboard album chart, making it the first American heavy metal debut album ever to reach No. 1 in the United States. On November 26, 1983 Quiet Riot became the first heavy metal band to have a top 5 hit and No. 1 album in the same week.[citation needed] Their success was aided in no small part by the "Cum on Feel the Noize" video's heavy rotation on MTV.[citation needed] Metal Health displaced The Police's Synchronicity at No. 1 and stayed there for just a week until Lionel Richie's Can't Slow Down took over the No. 1 spot.
