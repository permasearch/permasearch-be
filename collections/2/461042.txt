Campaigns of atrocities against civilians have been attributed to the SPLA.[110] In the SPLA/M's attempt to disarm rebellions among the Shilluk and Murle, they burned scores of villages, raped hundreds of women and girls and killed an untold number of civilians.[111] Civilians alleging torture claim fingernails being torn out, burning plastic bags dripped on children to make their parents hand over weapons and villagers burned alive in their huts if rebels were suspected of spending the night there.[111] In May 2011, the SPLA allegedly set fire to over 7,000 homes in Unity State.[69]
