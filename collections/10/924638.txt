Kościuszko's 1796 Philadelphia residence is now the Thaddeus Kosciuszko National Memorial, America's smallest national park or unit of the National Park System.[121] There is a Kościuszko Museum at his last residence, in Solothurn, Switzerland.[122] A Polish-American cultural agency, the Kosciuszko Foundation, headquartered in New York City, was created in 1925.[123]
