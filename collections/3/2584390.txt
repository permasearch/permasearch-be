After constant experimentation with size-changing via ingested capsules and particle-filled gas, Pym is eventually able to change size at will,[volume & issue needed] and mentally generate Pym particles to change the sizes of other living beings or inanimate objects.[volume & issue needed] Pym retains his normal strength when "ant" size, and possesses greatly increased strength and stamina when in "giant" form, courtesy of the increased mass. Pym's costume is synthetic stretch fabric composed of unstable molecules and automatically adapts to his shifting sizes.
