Mann's interest in English 20th century classical music saw him adapt Gustav Holst's Planets Suite and turn a version of the "Jupiter" movement into a UK hit entitled Joybringer (included on the 1973 album Solar Fire). Other classical music adaptations include "Questions" off the 1976 album The Roaring Silence (which is based on the main theme of Franz Schubert's Impromptu in G flat Major), "Solar Fire is in Earth, the Circle, Pt. 1" (which uses the melody from Claude Debussy's Jimbo's Lullaby), and "Starbird" also off 1976's The Roaring Silence (which is based upon Igor Stravinski's ballet The Firebird).
