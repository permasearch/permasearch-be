As Chicano studies programs began to be implemented at universities, it was necessary to provide infrastructure and support. In 1973, the University of California, Berkeley recognized the need to provide quality library materials to support the Chicano studies programs.[16] Chicano scholars also recognized the need to have a "Chicano-controlled academic" space.[17] Researchers began to study the impact that these new programs had on students, finding that Mexican-American students responded positively to Chicano studies and also to bilingual classes.[7][18] Many scholars felt that the philosophy of education in the United States at the time was "inconsistent with the values of the Chicano movement" and that Chicano studies needed to create tools for students to use in the real world and also a new type of research to solve problems.[10] It was also important to find ways to recruit Chicano teachers and administration within the schools to support students and research.[10] Further support for Chicano studies came in the form of the National Association for Chicana and Chicano Studies (NACCS) which was created in 1972 in San Antonio, Texas.[19] The NACCS allows scholars in Chicano studies to exchange ideas, share research, communicate and it also has an annual conference.[19] The conferences were important to help bring together scholars and legitimize Chicano studies, since other disciplines have similar annual conferences.[10]
