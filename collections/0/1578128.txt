Sexual dimorphism may also only appear during mating season, some species of birds only show dimorphic traits in seasonal variation. The males of these species will molt into a less bright or less exaggerated color during the off breeding season.[70] This occurs because the species is more focused on survival than reproduction, causing a shift into a less ornate state.[dubious â€“ discuss]
