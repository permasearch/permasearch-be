According to some archaeologists, more than 500 Harappan sites have been discovered along the dried up river beds of the Ghaggar-Hakra River and its tributaries,[34] in contrast to only about 100 along the Indus and its tributaries;[35] consequently, in their opinion, the appellation Indus Ghaggar-Hakra civilisation is justified. However, these arguments are disputed by other archaeologists who state that the Ghaggar-Hakra desert area has been left untouched by settlements and agriculture since the end of the Indus period and hence shows more sites than those found in the alluvium of the Indus Valley; second, that the number of Harappan sites along the Ghaggar-Hakra river beds has been exaggerated.[36] "Harappan Civilisation" remains the commonly used name, according to the archaeological norm of naming a civilisation after its first findspot.[citation needed]
