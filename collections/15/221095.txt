A relational database table may have one or more available keys (formally called candidate keys). One of those keys per table may be designated the "primary" key, alternatively another key ("surrogate key") may be used. Any remaining keys are called alternate keys. Although mainly used today in the relational database context, the term primary key pre-date the relational model and is also used in other database models[citation needed].
