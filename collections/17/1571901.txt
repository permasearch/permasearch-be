Jones was revealed to have been cast as Saru in November 2016.[11] Kelpiens, a new species created for Discovery, were hunted as prey on their home planet and thus evolved the ability to sense the coming of death. They have a reputation for cowardice in the Federation.[12] Jones was excited to, "from the ground up, develop and find this character and his species" and not have to honor a previous fan-favorite representation.[13] He based Saru's walk on that of a supermodel,[4] out of necessity thanks to the boots he had to wear to portray the character's hooved feet forcing Jones to walk on the balls of his feet.[14] The producers compared Saru to the characters Spock and Data from previous series.[12]
