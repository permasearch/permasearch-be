On 24 November 2011, Goodrem was confirmed to be a part of the judging panel of the Australian version of The Voice which aired in early 2012, coaching alongside Keith Urban, Joel Madden, and Seal.[63] Some of Goodrem's decisions on the show sparked criticism, with comments she was "all style" and "little substance".[64] Rachael Leahcar was Goodrem's contestant in the final four. This was after Goodrem chose Leahcar over Glenn Cunningham, who was Goodrem's back up singer on her Believe Again Tour in 2009. Leahcar finished third. Goodrem returned for season two in 2013, again with Madden and Seal, with Ricky Martin replacing Urban. Goodrem's finalist for season two was Celia Pavey who also finished third.[65]
