Chick-fil-A retains ownership of each restaurant. Chick-fil-A selects the restaurant location and builds it.[1] Chick-fil-A franchisees need only a $10,000 initial investment to become an operator.[18] Each operator is handpicked and goes through a rigorous training program; the interviews plus training can take months and is not an easy process. Chick-fil-A states on their site:  "This is not the right opportunity for you if you: - Are seeking a passive investment in a business. - Want to sell property to Chick-fil-A, Inc. - Are requesting that Chick-fil-A, Inc. build at a specified location. - Are seeking multi-unit franchise opportunities."
