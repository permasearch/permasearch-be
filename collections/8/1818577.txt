A number of reviewers praised Sebastian's villainous ways despite his decision to abandon his blackmail attempt. Futterman noted that people had just gotten "used to the idea of a well-played villain on the show", while Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times expressed doubt about a complete conversion: "We'll see how long that lasts."[20][33] Slezak called him a "gem when it comes to delivering spicy one-liners", though he was less enthusiastic about the character's vocal solos, as was Canning, who nevertheless hailed Sebastian as a "fine nemesis".[21][25]
