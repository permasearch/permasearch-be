Most recently, the American Athletic Conference announced on October 11, 2017 that it would begin sponsoring women's lacrosse in the 2019 season (2018–19 school year), which will lead to the departure of all current Big East women's lacrosse associates except Denver.[34] On that same date, the Big East announced that field hockey member Old Dominion would also become a Big East women's lacrosse member in the 2019 season, maintaining Big East women's lacrosse membership at 6 teams and preserving its automatic berth to the NCAA women's tournament.[35]
