7-Eleven is known for its relatively large drink sizes. 7-Eleven offers beverages that are 32 ounces (946ml) (Big Gulp), 44 U.S. fluid ounces (1.301Â L) (Super Big Gulp), 53 ounces (1567ml) (X-Treme Gulp), 64 ounces (1893ml) (Double Gulp), or 128 ounces (3785ml) (Team Gulp). These beverage sizes were all among the largest sold soft drinks when they were introduced.[28] 7-Eleven has often been associated with these large sodas in popular culture. For example, Mayor Michael Bloomberg's proposed ban on large sodas in New York City was frequently referred to as the 'Big Gulp ban'.[29]
