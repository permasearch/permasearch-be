In the International Court of Justice case Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v. Italy), the court ruled in favor of state immunity. In that case, decided in 2012, the court found that Italy had breached international law by allowing civil cases against Germany for World War II atrocities to proceed, despite Germany's claimed immunity. The decision was criticized by some commentators for not embracing a nascent development to waive immunity in cases of human rights violations. However, others pointed out that the decision reflected the consensus of actual international custom and practice.
