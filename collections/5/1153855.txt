Members of La Luz del Mundo believe that the Bible along with the teachings of their Apostle are the only source of Christian doctrine. It is used as the main source of ministers' and lay persons' talks during prayer meetings. Through organizational arrangements, such as Sunday school, church authorities attempt to maintain uniformity of teachings and beliefs throughout all congregations.[56] The Bible is the only historical reference used by La Luz del Mundo during religious services. Members can find cited Bible verses quickly, regardless of their level of education.[57] It is also seen as the one of two "sufficient rules of faith for salvation".[58]
