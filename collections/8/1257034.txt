When the subject distance     s   {\displaystyle s}   approaches the focal length, using the formulas given above can result in significant errors. For close-up work, the hyperfocal distance has little applicability, and it usually is more convenient to express DOF in terms of image magnification. Let     m   {\displaystyle m}   be the magnification; when the subject distance is small in comparison with the hyperfocal distance,
