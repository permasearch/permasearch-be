Harlem, a large neighborhood within the northern section of the New York City borough of Manhattan, is known as one of the worst areas for poverty and crime in New York City and the United States.[1] Violence, especially in East Harlem, has worsened since the 1980s with crack cocaine and other drug addictions. As of 1995[update], the leading cause of death among black males in Harlem was homicide.[2] According to a survey published in 2013 by Union Settlement Association, residents of East Harlem perceive crime as their biggest single concern; at the same time, the police department's statistics show an increase in crime by 17 percent over the previous year.[3]
