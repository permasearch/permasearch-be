During the Vietnamese "March to the South" or Nam tiến in which they, over the span of 700 years starting from the 11th century during the Lý dynasty gradually invaded and colonized the entire state of Champa and parts of the Khmer Empire. During the period of conquests, the Vietnamese attempted to assimilate all of the ethnic minorities in the territories that they had captured by forcing them to adopt Vietnamese customs. The Vietnamese saw themselves as belonging to a superior culture, having been Sinicized, unlike the Indianized states of Champa and the Khmer Empire. As such, they saw themselves as carrying out a civilizing mission against the minorities who were not sinicized and were seen as barbarians.[1] In spite of considering themselves as superior due to being sinicized, members of the Vietnamese royalty looked down upon those that were non-Vietnamese as inferior due to Chinese influence.[2]
