According to the Australian government, "green and gold have been popularly embraced as Australiaâ€™s national sporting colours" since the late 1800s.[1] Nearly every current Australian national sports team wears them (although the hues and proportions of the colours may vary between teams and across eras).[citation needed] Australia's cricket team first wore the colours in 1899, in the form of the baggy green, the cap presented to Australian cricket players.[5]
