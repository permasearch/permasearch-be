On April 14, 2012, the Red Hot Chili Peppers were inducted by Chris Rock into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Kiedis, Flea, Smith, Klinghoffer (who became the youngest inductee ever), Frusciante, Slovak, Irons and Martinez were the members inducted. Slovak was inducted on behalf of his brother, James while Frusciante, who was invited, declined the band's offer and didn't show up although was heavily praised during the induction speech by his former bandmates. Despite their contributions to the band's studio albums, Jack Sherman and Dave Navarro were neither inducted nor invited to the ceremony because the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame committee decided that only original members, current members or those who played on more than one album were able to be inducted. Both Martinez and Irons joined the band (marking the first time either drummer had performed with the Chili Peppers since their departures from the band in the 1980s) onstage for a performance of "Give It Away" and "Higher Ground", which ended up in an all-star jam involving some of the night's inductees and other guest musicians. The band released their eleventh studio album, The Getaway in June 2016.
