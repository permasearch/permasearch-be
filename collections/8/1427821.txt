Individual farmers and communities had several techniques of reducing their risk. Farmers usually had many different, scattered plots of land on which they planted a variety of crops. If one or more crops failed, others might be productive.[10] In many areas of the Andes, farmers, communities, and the Inca state constructed agricultural terraces (andenes) to increase the amount of arable land. Andenes also minimized the threat of freezes, increased exposure to sunlight, controlled erosion, and improved the absorption of water and aeration of the soil.[11] The construction and use of andenes for crops enabled agriculture in the Andes to expand into climatically marginal areas.[12] In some areas, raised beds (Waru Waru) was used for many of the same purposes as andenes and also to facilitate drainage.[13]
