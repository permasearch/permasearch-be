Although the horsepower rating increases only 8 hp compared to the latest version of the previous "DE" engine, the real horsepower difference was much greater due to Nissan adopting the 2006 SAE hp measurement guidelines for horsepower ratings in 2007. According to Consumer Reports an Infiniti G35 Journey sedan with a 5-speed Automatic transmission can reach 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) in 5.4 seconds, and the 1/4-mile (~400 m) 13.8 seconds. According to the also newly revised EPA guidelines, fuel economy is estimated at 17 mpg‑US (14 L/100 km; 20 mpg‑imp) in the city and 24 mpg‑US (9.8 L/100 km; 29 mpg‑imp) on the highway.[14] Fuel economy is virtually identical between generations, with the second generation earning a 1-mile-per-US-gallon (0.43 km/L; 1.2 mpg‑imp) edge in highway driving (both measured using EPA 2008 guidelines).[15]
