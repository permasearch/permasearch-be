Tributary missions from vassal states were commonly allowed to include traders, who thus gained opportunities to do business in the capital markets.

This was unquestionably the case, most notably, with a group of traders who appeared on the south coast in 166 AD claiming to be envoys from the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.[139]
