Several actors were offered the role of Judah Ben-Hur before it was accepted by Charlton Heston. Burt Lancaster stated he turned down the role because he found the script boring[53] and belittling to Christianity.[f] Paul Newman turned it down because he said he didn't have the legs to wear a tunic.[54] Marlon Brando,[54] Rock Hudson,[g] Geoffrey Horne,[h] and Leslie Nielsen[55] were also offered the role, as were a number of muscular, handsome Italian actors (many of whom did not speak English).[56] Kirk Douglas was interested in the role, but was turned down in favor of Heston,[i] who was formally cast on January 22, 1958.[58] His salary was $250,000 for 30 weeks, a prorated salary for any time over 30 weeks, and travel expenses for his family.[34]
