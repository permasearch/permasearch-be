An alternate etymology for the term "god" comes from the Proto-Germanic Gaut, which traces it to the PIE root *ghu-to- ("poured"), which from the root *gheu- ("to pour, pour a libation"). The term *gheu- is also the source of the Greek khein "to pour".[39] Originally the German root was a neuter noun, but the gender of the monotheistic God shifted to masculine under the influence of Christianity.[34]:230-231[39] In contrast, all ancient Indo-European cultures and mythologies recognized both masculine and feminine deities.[38]
