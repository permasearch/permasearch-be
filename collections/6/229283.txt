As the collector–base voltage (     V  CB   =  V  CE   −  V  BE     {\displaystyle V_{\text{CB}}=V_{\text{CE}}-V_{\text{BE}}}  ) varies, the collector–base depletion region varies in size. An increase in the collector–base voltage, for example, causes a greater reverse bias across the collector–base junction, increasing the collector–base depletion region width, and decreasing the width of the base. This variation in base width often is called the "Early effect" after its discoverer James M. Early.
