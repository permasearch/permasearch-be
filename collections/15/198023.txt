The forgery of an identity document is a separate felony in Missouri,[60] punishable by up to seven years in prison[58] and/or a fine of up to $5,000 (or if financial gain was made, up to the amount of that financial gain).[59] Possession of forgery instruments also is a felony with the same prospective punishments as that of ordinary forgery.[61]
