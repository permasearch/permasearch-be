Prince also used his appearance in the episode to premiere his new song "Fallinlove2nite", which features vocals from Deschanel.[13] The show had not featured Deschanel singing before, except with the opening theme song.[14] The actress told Sandy Coen of the Associated Press that the producers wanted her character to go up on stage and sing with Prince, so they asked her to lay down a vocal for the sound department, who sent it to Prince. The following day, her vocal was mixed into the song.[15] Shortly before the scene was filmed, Prince asked producer Erin O'Malley for a megaphone. As the song began to play, Prince used the megaphone to call out "Does anyone want to fall in love tonight?". The crowd of actors and extras gave an unscripted cheer.[5] Meriwether admitted that she teared up following the take.[6] The episode also featured Prince's "When You Were Mine" during the scenes where Prince gives Jess a makeover.[16]
