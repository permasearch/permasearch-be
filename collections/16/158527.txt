The one exception to the new Toon Boom Harmony pipeline was the "Almost There" dream sequence, which utilized an Art Deco graphic style based on the art of Harlem Renaissance painter Aaron Douglas.[37] Supervised by Eric Goldberg and designed by Sue Nichols,[38] the "Almost There" sequence's character animation was done on paper without going through the clean-up animation department,[9] and scanned directly into Photoshop. The artwork was then enhanced to affect the appearance of painted strokes and fills, and combined with backgrounds, using Adobe After Effects.[10][11]
