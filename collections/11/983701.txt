Vapour lock has been the cause of forced landings in aircraft. That is why aviation fuel is manufactured to far lower vapour pressure than automotive gasoline (petrol). In addition aircraft are far more susceptible because of their ability to change altitude and associated ambient pressure rapidly. Liquids boil at lower temperatures when in lower pressure environments.
