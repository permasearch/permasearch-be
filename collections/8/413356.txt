While being interviewed Conan revealed, “the production team asked for a song that conveys suffering and beauty concurrently. I repeatedly thought over how to express the strange feeling of beautiful sadness. During that period, it was to the point where 12 songs were rejected. After the song was finally chosen, it went through seven modifications.” When asked about their inspirations for the lyrics and titles of their tracks for "Goblin," Conan imparted that it was all thanks to the drama's script. The story itself truly inspired them, wherein he even shared that the drama team itself is very supportive which constitutes to what a dream team is. He also commended Ailee‘s hard work by saying, “During the recording process, Ailee’s health wasn’t in the best condition. However, she persevered and sang for us until the end. I’m very thankful towards her.”[5] "I Will Go to You Like the First Snow" was officially released for digital download on January 7, 2017.
