Since Ender's Game was published in 1985, author Orson Scott Card had been reluctant to license film rights and artistic control for the novel. Card explained that he had many opportunities through the 1980s and 1990s to sell the rights of Ender's Game to Hollywood studios, but refused when creative differences became an issue.[20] With the formation of Fresco Pictures in 1996 (which Card co-founded), the author decided to write the screenplay himself.[21] In a 1998 interview, Card discussed the process of adapting the novel into a screenplay.
