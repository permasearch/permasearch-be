Hydrogen is highly soluble in many rare earth and transition metals[93] and is soluble in both nanocrystalline and amorphous metals.[94] Hydrogen solubility in metals is influenced by local distortions or impurities in the crystal lattice.[95] These properties may be useful when hydrogen is purified by passage through hot palladium disks, but the gas's high solubility is a metallurgical problem, contributing to the embrittlement of many metals,[11] complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks.[12]
