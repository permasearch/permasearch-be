The Puerto Rican government-debt crisis is a financial crisis affecting the government of Puerto Rico.[a] After decades of mismanagement and centuries of colonial rule, the government's outstanding debt exceeds $70 billion (in addition to $50 billion in pension obligations). These debts increased the government's debt-to-GDP ratio to about 68%, which forced it to cut spending, increase tax revenue, and attempt to spark economic growth so that its obligations could be better funded. Despite drastic measures, the debt crisis continues as the Puerto Rican economy's health is precarious and aggravated by social distrust and unpleasantness.[b][c]
