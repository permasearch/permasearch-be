Plans to divert the Ubangi River into Lake Chad were proposed in 1929 by Herman SÃ¶rgel in his Atlantropa project and again in the 1960s. The copious amount of water from the Ubangi would revitalize the dying Lake Chad and provide livelihood in fishing and enhanced agriculture to tens of millions of central Africans and Sahelians. Interbasin water transfer schemes were proposed in the 1980s and 1990s by Nigerian engineer J. Umolu (ZCN scheme) and Italian firm Bonifica (the Transaqua canal scheme).[25][26][27][28][29] In 1994, the Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC) proposed a similar project, and at a March 2008 summit, the heads of state of the LCBC member countries committed to the diversion project.[30] In April 2008, the LCBC advertised a request for proposals for a World Bank-funded feasibility study.[citation needed] Neighboring countries have agreed to commit resources to restoring the lake, notably Nigeria.[31][32]
