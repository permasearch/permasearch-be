The 8086[1] ("eighty eighty-six", also called iAPX 86, or in the UK "eight-oh-eight-six")[2] is a 16-bit microprocessor chip designed by Intel between early 1976 and mid-1978, when it was released. The Intel 8088, released in 1979, is a slightly modified chip with an external 8-bit data bus (allowing the use of cheaper and fewer supporting ICs[note 1]), and is notable as the processor used in the original IBM PC design, including the widespread version called IBM PC XT.
