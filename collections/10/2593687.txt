Paul Getty, for the money, but was refused as Getty feared that if he were to pay the ransom, his 13 other grandchildren could also be kidnapped.[6] As time wore on, Paul's treatment by his captors grew worse: they took away his one source of amusement, his radio, killed a bird he had taken as a pet, and took to playing Russian roulette against his head.[12]
