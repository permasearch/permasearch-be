If the central office was known by a name, but no letters were dialed, it was common to capitalize only the first letter of the central office, e.g., Main 600W or Fairmont 33. Such numbers were assigned typically in manual offices, and the name would be spoken by a subscriber when requesting a destination. Often these were geographically significant names, such as the town's name.
