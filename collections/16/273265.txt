A number of other artists do not fit in any of these groups, above all Rembrandt, whose relatively few painted landscapes show various influences, including some from Hercules Seghers (c. 1589â€“c. 1638); his very rare large mountain valley landscapes were a very personal development of 16th-century styles.[59] Aert van der Neer (d. 1677) painted very small scenes of rivers at night or under ice and snow.
