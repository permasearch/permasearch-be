In an interview, Johansson elaborated on Kaa, saying that she uses both her voice and hypnotic gaze to entrance Mowgli so that he cannot resist her embrace. She also says Kaa uses her story-telling to seduce and entrap Mowgli and describes Kaa as a "window into Mowgli's past". She notes that the way Kaa moves is "very alluring", describing it as "almost coquettish".[2] Johansson also sings the song "Trust in Me" in the film; she described her thoughts on the song: "It's a strange melody. We wanted it to be a lullaby, but it has a very mysterious sound."[3]
