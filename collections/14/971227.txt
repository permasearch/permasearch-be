The Lustful King of Strongcliff desired sexual gratification and used his subjects to that regard. However, this addiction led him to sleep with Dora, who was an old woman, based on the illusion of what is beautiful. The reality of the Lustful King having slept with Dora as an old maid disgusts the King so much that he attempts to throw Dora to her death, claiming that she is a witch. Yet, Dora protests that the Lustful King demanded her presence, which was true. Yet, he falls in love with Dora and makes her his Queen once she is transformed into a beautiful maiden. The moral of the story is that the eyes can be misleading and what you see or believe you see should not be substituted for the truth of what is. On the flip-side, Dora is no different than the Lustful King she eventually marries - she desires wealth, title and sexual passions. When she receives youth, Dora traded Imma, who had been with her forever, for the man who had cast her to her death days before. This leads to Dora's condemnation to live the rest of her days alone and without Imma. For the Lustful King, he will never stop searching for his Queen who appeared to be the cure for his lustful addiction, when in fact, Dora was merely a reflection of himself that he could not see.
