The phonology associated with Brahmi are clearly documented in the Pratishakyas of Krishna Yajurveda, for example, the Taitiria praatishakhya. This predates any known scripting system and serves as a strong indicator for its origin in the Indian subcontinent. Some claim Brāhmī is derived from a Semitic script such as the Imperial Aramaic alphabet, as was clearly the case for the contemporary Kharosthi alphabet that arose in a part of northwest Indian under the control of the Achaemenid Empire. Rhys Davids suggests that writing may have been introduced to India from the Middle East by traders. Another possibility is with the Achaemenid conquest in the late 6th century BCE. It was often assumed that it was a planned invention under Ashoka as a prerequisite for the his edicts. Compare the much better documented parallel of the Hangul script.
