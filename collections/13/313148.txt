The ruling Kuomintang nominated president Lee Teng-hui in August 1995 at its 14th Party Congress after plans to institute a closed primary system by his opponents were thwarted.[2][3] As his running mate, Lee chose Lien Chan, who had attempted to resign his position as Premier of the Republic of China to join Lee's ticket.[4][5] Lee did not accept Lien's resignation, as Lien's potential successors to the premiership stood little chance of legislative confirmation.[6] After the election, the Judicial Yuan allowed Lien to keep both posts.[7]
