Here     arccos ⁡  (    3 q   2 p        − 3  p    )    {\displaystyle \arccos \left({\frac {3q}{2p}}{\sqrt {\frac {-3}{p}}}\right)}   is an angle in the unit circle; taking 1/3 of that angle corresponds to taking a cube root of a complex number; adding −k2π/3 for k = 1, 2 finds the other cube roots; and multiplying the cosines of these resulting angles by     2   −   p 3       {\displaystyle 2{\sqrt {-{\frac {p}{3}}}}}   corrects for scale.
