In the most prolific European football leagues, the Premier League and the Football League First Division before it, La Liga, Serie A and the Bundesliga, the top scorers per game have much lower tallies, seven in England and Spain and six in Italy and Germany. The last player in these leagues to score seven goals in a match was László Kubala in 1952 for Barcelona.
