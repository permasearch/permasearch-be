On 27 January 2012 the Spanish government temporarily stopped accepting applications for projects beginning operation after January 2013. Construction and operation of existing projects was not affected.[100] The country's electrical system had a â‚¬24 billion deficit.[101] FiT payments did not contribute significantly to that deficit.[102] In 2008 the FiT was expected to result in 400 MW of solar being installed. However, it was so high that over 2600 MW was installed.[103] Utilities in Spain reported that they had no way to pass on cost increases to consumers by increasing rates and instead accrued deficits, although this is under dispute.
