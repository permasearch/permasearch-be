Fixed capital is a concept in economics and accounting, first theoretically analyzed in some depth by the economist David Ricardo. It refers to any kind of real or physical capital (fixed asset) that is not used up in the production of a product. It contrasts with circulating capital such as raw materials, operating expenses and the like.
