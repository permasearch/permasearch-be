Before World War II, France was a leading producer of powerful luxury automobiles.[109] After World War II, the French government used puissance fiscale tax regulations to encourage manufacturers to build cars with small engines, and French motorists to buy them.[109] Since many export markets do not have this same constraint, the French automobile industry has become less relevant as an export power and currently produces no luxury brands.
