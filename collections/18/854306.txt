Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me received a reaction quite the contrary to the television series. The film was entered into the 1992 Cannes Film Festival,[18] where it was met with almost unanimous negative reviews. There is a persistent story that the film was met with boos and hisses from the Cannes audience,[6][19] though co-writer Robert Engels denies that this event ever happened[8] and a contemporary news report only says there were some "hoots and whistles" during a screening for critics and journalists.[20]
