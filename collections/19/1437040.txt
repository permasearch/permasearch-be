The first "Woman Detective Constable" was appointed in 1973. 1973 was also the year that the separate "Women's Department" was fully integrated into the Metropolitan Police.[42] Female police officers did not get equal pay with male police officers until 1974.[43] In 1976 the first "Woman Chief Superintendent" was appointed to take charge of a subdivision.[48] In 1977 the first female traffic officer, Dee Oâ€™Donoghue, was hired.[48] In 1979 the first female dog handler, Nicola Gray, was hired.[48] Prior to this, women were prohibited from being dog handlers since rules stated that an officer should have a wife who could look after a puppy while the officer went to work.[43] In 1995 Pauline Clare became the first female chief constable, for Lancashire.[42] The prefix "Woman" in front of female officers' ranks has been obsolete since 1999. In 2017 Cressida Dick became the first female Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Service and therefore the most senior Police Officer in England and Wales.[42]
