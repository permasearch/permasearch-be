Blunstone's voice was considered one of the main factors in making the Zombies' single, "She's Not There", a big hit worldwide. In 1968, the band broke up over management issues, shortly after completing the baroque pop classic album, Odessey and Oracle.[3] Blunstone briefly worked as a clerk in the insurance business before resuming his musical career.[4] In 1969, he signed with Deram and released three singles under the pseudonym of Neil MacArthur, including a re-make of "She's Not There", which charted in the UK.[1]
