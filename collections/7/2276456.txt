Google has been quite secretive regarding its plans on the future of the Google Books project. Scanning operations had been slowing down since at least 2012, as confirmed by the librarians at several of Google's partner institutions. At University of Wisconsin, the speed had reduced to less than half of what it was in 2006. However, the librarians have said that the dwindling pace could be a natural result of maturation of the project â€“ initially stacks of books were entirely taken up for scanning whereas now Google only needed to consider the ones that have not been scanned already.[51] The company's own Google Books history page ends in 2007, and the Google Books blog was merged into the Google Search blog in 2012.[113]
