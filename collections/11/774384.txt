Baptiste's map also names another group, known as the Casa, living north of the Muskingum River. It is not known who they were, but they were most likely connected to either the Fort Ancient or Monongahela Cultures. Assuming the above concerning the Mosopelea, it is important to note that the word closely resembles "Kansa," the Algonquian word for the Siouan-speaking peoples of what is now Arkansas & Missouri. Both managed to exist up to the early 17th century and are believed to have merged into a single, continuous culture group by that time.[citation needed] The Monongahela Culture—primarily from West Virginia & Pennsylvania—are also known to have once held land in that general area.[11][12][13][14]
