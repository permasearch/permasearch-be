In 1889, the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad finished laying track from Sapinero to Lake City; the distance spanned 36 miles, with 10 bridges.  The "High Bridge" was 800 feet long and 113 feet high.  The train averaged 12 miles per hour.  According to local residents, "You didnâ€™t want the Rio Grande engine to run over you because 'it was on you so long'."[citation needed] The final cost of the construction of the branch was $770,996.80, a considerable sum at the time.[13] The local newspaper welcomed the arrival of the D&RG:[14]
