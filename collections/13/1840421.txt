The period between 1933 and 1945 was marked by numerous changes for the quarterback position.[44] The rule requiring a quarterback to be five yards behind the line of scrimmage to pass was abolished.[45] Hash marks were added to the field that established a limited zone between which the ball was placed before snaps, making offensive formations more flexible.[45] Additionally, incomplete passes in the end zone were no longer counted as turnovers and touchbacks.[45]
