The last time we saw you was a week ago this morning when our lives seemed normal... then the unthinkable happened. Just then, our worst nightmare occurred, a second plane slammed into the South Tower. Now it was clear. This was a terrible act of terrorism. Then came the news that the Pentagon was hit and another hijacked plane crashed in Pennsylvania killing everybody on board. Today, the heroic effort continues and the death toll rises. But amid the despair, we continue to hope for signs of life beneath the debris. Exhausted rescue workers refuse to give up. Our nation has never been more united. Across the country, Americans are pulling together and everywhere you look, there are tremendous shows of support, patriotism, and faith. Terrorists tried to tear us apart but they failed. Instead, we as a nation have become stronger and have only been brought closer together.[23]
