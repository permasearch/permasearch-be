In some areas, the grizzly bear also regularly displaces cougars (Puma concolor) from their kills with some estimates showing cougars locally lose up to a third of their dietary energy to grizzly bears.[368] Cougars kill small bear cubs on rare occasions, but there was one report of a bear killing a cougar of unknown age and condition between 1993 and 1996.[369][370] Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), the largest type of lynx and the only one to regularly take large prey, is similarly an habitual victim of kleptoparasitism to brown bears throughout Eurasia.[371][372] Brown bears also co-exist with leopards (Panthera pardus) (in very small remnant wild parts of the Middle East, Jammu and Kashmir, northeastern China and Primorsky Krai) and snow leopards (Panthera uncia), in several areas of northern central Asia and the Tibetan Plateau). Although the brown bearsâ€™ interactions with these big cats are little known, they probably have similar relationships as grizzly bears do with cougars in North America. Snow leopards and Tibetan blue bears are verified, however, to be a threat to one another's cubs.[1][373][374]
