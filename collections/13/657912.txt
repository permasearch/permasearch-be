As a result of the island's long isolation from neighboring continents, Madagascar is home to an abundance of plants and animals found nowhere else on Earth.[23][24] Approximately 90% of all plant and animal species found in Madagascar are endemic,[25] including the lemurs (a type of strepsirrhine primate), the carnivorous fossa and many birds. This distinctive ecology has led some ecologists to refer to Madagascar as the "eighth continent",[26] and the island has been classified by Conservation International as a biodiversity hotspot.[23]
