The Digital Rosetta Stone Project is a collaboration between the University of Leipzig's Digital Humanities Chair and the Institute of Egyptology; and the British Museum and the Digital Epigraphy and Archaeology Project, to make available an annotated transcription of each of the three versions of the text, as well as providing them in XML format.[81][82] High-resolution images and a high-resolution 3D model of the stone will also be produced.[81]
