Northwestern named the ship after its president and chairman of the board, Edmund Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald's own grandfather had himself been a lake captain, and his father owned the Milwaukee Drydock Company that built and repaired ships.[21] More than 15,000 people attended Fitzgerald's christening and launch ceremony on June 7, 1958. But the event was plagued by misfortunes: When Elizabeth Fitzgerald, wife of Edmund Fitzgerald, tried to christen the ship by smashing a champagne bottle over the bow, it took her three attempts to break it. A delay of 36 minutes followed while the shipyard crew struggled to release the keel blocks. Upon sideways launch, the ship created a large wave that "doused" the spectators and then crashed into a pier before righting herself.  One man watching the launching had a heart attack and later died. Other witnesses later said they swore the ship was "trying to climb right out of the water". [22] On September 22, 1958, Fitzgerald completed nine days of sea trials.[23]
