As above, assume that a state      |  ψ ⟩   {\displaystyle |\psi \rangle }   is a state in the simultaneous eigenbasis of      J  2     {\displaystyle J^{2}}   and      J  z     {\displaystyle J_{z}}  . Its eigenvalue with respect to      J  2     {\displaystyle J^{2}}   can be written in the form      ℏ  2   j ( j + 1 )   {\displaystyle \hbar ^{2}j(j+1)}   for some real number j > 0 (because as mentioned in the previous paragraph,      J  2     {\displaystyle J^{2}}   has nonnegative eigenvalues), and its eigenvalue with respect to      J  z     {\displaystyle J_{z}}   can be written     ℏ m   {\displaystyle \hbar m}   for some real number m. Instead of      |  ψ ⟩   {\displaystyle |\psi \rangle }   we will use the more descriptive notation      |  ψ ⟩ =  |  j , m ⟩   {\displaystyle |\psi \rangle =|j,m\rangle }  .
