In 2001, the team identified in CS that the mutation is in the middle of a protein-coding gene.[3] Using a combination of bioinformatics and RNA analyses, they discovered that the gene codes for a novel protein belonging to the forkhead-box (FOX) group of transcription factors. As such, it was assigned with the official name of FOXP2. When the researchers sequenced the FOXP2 gene in the KE family, they found a heterozygous point mutation shared by all the affected individuals, but not in unaffected members of the family and other people.[3] This mutation is due to an amino-acid substitution that inhibits the DNA-binding domain of the FOXP2 protein.[28] Further screening of the gene identified multiple additional cases of FOXP2 disruption, including different point mutations[9] and chromosomal rearrangements,[29] providing evidence that damage to one copy of this gene is sufficient to derail speech and language development.
