Opéra bouffon is the French term for the Italian genre of opera buffa (comic opera) performed in 18th-century France, either in the original language or in French translation.[citation needed] The term was also used by Jacques Offenbach for three of his works: Orphée aux enfers, Le roman comique (fr) and Le voyage de MM. Dunanan père et fils.
