The term "Cab" in snowboarding generally refers to any switch-frontside spin (no matter what the amount of rotation) on any feature (halfpipe, jumps, rails, boxes).  For example, a "switch-frontside 1080 double cork" off a jump would be referred to as a "cab 1080 double cork". The term was originally only applied to a switch-frontside 360 in a halfpipe in which a rider would take off a wall switch, spin 360 degrees frontside, and land on his/her comfortable stance (regular/goofy). Therefore, the term "Cab" only applied to tricks in the halfpipe in which rotations were in full 360 increments, such as a "Cab 360" or "Cab 720." For example, since a switch-frontside 540 would land a rider in the same switch position he/she took off from in the halfpipe, it was not referred to as a "Cab 540" because the rider did not take off switch, spin frontside, and land in his/her comfortable stance.
