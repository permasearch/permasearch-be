In June 2013, Sony announced that all PlayStation 4 games would be compatible with Remote Play with the PS Vita, with the exception of games which conceptually would not work, such as ones that heavily revolve around PlayStation Eye use.[18] Otherwise, contrary to PS3 to PS Vita Remote Play, PS4 to PS Vita Remote Play is designed on a hardware level, meaning that all games are automatically compatible, and it is only up to developers to make sure the controls adapt well to being played on a Vita instead of a DualShock 4.[18] This iteration of Remote Play was developed by Gaikai,[20] who also developed PlayStation Now.[21] Remote Play on the updated PlayStation Vita 2000 was shown at Tokyo Game Show in 2013.[22]
