On the review aggregator website Metacritic, the sixth season scored 96 out of 100, based on 18 reviews, indicating "Universal acclaim".[21] In Time Out New York, Andrew Johnston placed The Sopranos at the top of his list of the best TV of 2007, stating: "Even before the final episode aired, the last half-season of David Chase's Garden State gangland saga embodied everything that was great about The Sopranos. Then came the Chase-directed 'Made in America,' which miraculously restored Journey's street cred and created the kind of zeitgeist moment that wasn't supposed to be possible anymore in a fragmented, 600-channel cable universe. Lots of TV dramas are compared to novels these days, but few others (maybe only The Wire) have achieved the scope and substance of literary fiction while painting between the lines of small-screen convention."[22]
