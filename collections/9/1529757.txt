This last technology is a fully industrial one (example: SineHolingÂ® technology of MITIS). Vibration drilling is a preferred solution in situations like deep hole drilling, multi-material stack drilling (aeronautics) and dry drilling (without lubrication). Generally it provides improved reliability and greater control of the drilling operation.
