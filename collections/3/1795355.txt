Swift has said that the song was "the hardest to write on the album", saying: "it took me a really long time to filter through everything I wanted to put in the song without it being a 10-minute song, which you can’t put on an album. I wanted a story that could work in the form of a song and I called my co-writer Liz Rose and said, ‘Come over, we’ve gotta filter this down,’ and it took me a really long time to get it."[4] Rose also has said that the song was originally "10, 12 or 15 minutes long" before cutting down to "the important pieces".[3] Even after cutting, the song is the longest track on the album.
