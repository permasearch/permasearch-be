Optical fibers can also be used for daylighting. A solar lighting system based on plastic optical fibers was in development at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 2004.[10][11] The system was installed at the American Museum of Science and Energy, Tennessee, USA, in 2005,[12] and brought to market the same year by the company Sunlight Direct.[13][14] However, this system was taken off the market in 2009.
