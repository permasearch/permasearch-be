One of the most important events of the 19th century was the rise of Indian nationalism,[457] leading Indians to seek first "self-rule" and later "complete independence". However, historians are divided over the causes of its rise. Probable reasons include a "clash of interests of the Indian people with British interests",[457] "racial discriminations",[458] and "the revelation of India's past".[459]
