In 1847, a curriculum was adopted which had nine main fields: mathematics, history, language, literature, drawing, natural philosophy, experimental philosophy, law, and political economy. The Academy's first graduation took place in 1853 in Niblo's Garden Theatre,[12] a large theater and opera house on Broadway, near Houston Street at the corner of Broadway and Prince Street.
