The King is Clara's father, and the source of all her bigoted beliefs. While Clara is a generic composite of nearly every Disney princess, the King seems to be based more specifically on Ariel's father, King Triton, from The Little Mermaid. He originally disliked Spanky Ham, but became friends with him after Spanky taught Clara how to laugh and have fun. He drives a carriage, sometimes while drunk (which, according to Clara's evil stepmother, is the reason Clara's mother is no longer around). His favorite activity is watching strippers, whose activities he always refers to as "the ballet"; in fact, his preoccupation with strippers made his relationship with Clara an emotionally distant one, since he always spent more time with strippers than he did with his daughter. In "Ghostesses in the Slot Machine", Clara takes up the profession to try to win his affection; though her efforts are initially unsuccessful, the King eventually tells Clara (and Foxxy) that he loves her after watching his daughter simulate lesbian sex with Foxxy on stage. He appears to have an incestuous interest in his daughter; in addition to being eager to see her strip (mentioned above), in "Dirty Pranking No. 2", he gives her a kiss that seems passionate rather than familial. He makes cameo appearances in "The Drawn Together Clip Show" and "Freaks & Greeks". His real name has not been revealed on the show. (Note: This character is not to be confused with the King of Insurance, a completely separate character from "Foxxy vs. the Board of Education".)
