The description in this article is given from west to east. This is the more popular direction, and the one given in the original and most of the current guides, and is the direction which keeps the prevailing wind and rain at one's back, and the evening sun out of one's eyes. Some walkers do start from the east coast, either because they wish to have the Lake District as the climax of their walk or because they have already walked the route in the conventional direction.
