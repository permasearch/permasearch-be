Mara Marini was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba,[1] and had wanted to be an actress since the age of four.[2] Her parents urged her to apply to multiple colleges so she would have options to pursue other than acting, and she was accepted to the University of Hawaii for marine biology, but ultimately did not study there.[1] After attending York University in Toronto, she auditioned for and was accepted to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Los Angeles, where she studied acting.[2]
