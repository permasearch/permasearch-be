After the show aired, Conger made numerous public comments about how she was offended by Rockwell's kissing her on stage, that they never consummated their marriage, and how the entire episode went against her set of morals. She posed nude for Playboy magazine in the August 2000 issue. Matt Lauer was publicly critical of Conger being asked to do multiple interviews on the Today Show; saying he didn't want her on after the first interview, became incredulous at her claims she didn't want to be well-known, and making sarcastic comments in the second interview where he pointedly said "You're not coming back, right?" and responding to her "Only if I do something amazing" response with the notion that he would never talk to her again. Lauer and Jeffrey Zucker agreed she would never be asked back to the Today Show.[12]
