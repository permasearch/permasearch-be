Visitors to Singapore can either enter the country without a visa or in some cases they must first obtain a visa. Citizens of almost 80% of the world's countries may travel to Singapore for a period of 30 days or 90 days without a visa, depending on their nationality.[1][2] Countries requiring visas are categorized into countries eligible to apply for an electronic visa and countries whose citizens need a visa vignette.
