The Central and State Government funded 58.91% of the total project cost. The remaining 41.09% was secured through loans from domestic and foreign financial institutions.[19] BMRCL secured ₹6,500 crore (US$1.0 billion) through long-term loans and ₹300 crore (US$46 million) by selling bonds, while the remaining project cost was funded by Central Government and the State Government. BMRCL secured loans from several agencies – ₹3,000 crore (US$460 million) from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), ₹600 crore (US$92 million) from the Housing and Urban Development Corporation Limited (HUDCO), ₹25 crore (US$3.8 million) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the rest from the French Development Agency. Approximately 10% of the ₹6500 crore must be paid as interest by the BMRCL every year. The Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry estimated that this amounted to an interest payment of ₹2 crore (US$310,000) per day. The BMRCL refuted claims that the interest was that high, but confirmed that it was "definitely more than ₹1 crore (US$150,000) per day."[64]
