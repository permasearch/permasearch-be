After Mars' sister in Los Angeles played Mars' demo for Mike Lynn, (the A&R at Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment), Lynn summoned Mars to Los Angeles.[19] In 2003, shortly after graduating from high school at the age of 17, Mars moved to Los Angeles, California, to pursue a musical career.[7][13] He adopted his stage name from the nickname his father gave him, adding "Mars" at the end because: "I felt like I didn't have [any] pizzazz, and a lot of girls say Iâ€™m out of this world, so I was like I guess I'm from Mars."[20] Moreover, the adoption of his stage name was also due to "the music industry tried to pigeonhole him as another Latino artist, and even convinced him to sing in Spanish."[21]
