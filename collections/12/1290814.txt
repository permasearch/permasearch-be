In February, Spieth was announced as the PGA Tour's Chairman of the Player Advisory Council, succeeding Davis Love III. The 16 member panel consults with the PGA Tour's Policy Board and commissioner Jay Monahan on issues affecting the tour; Spieth will serve a three-year term (2019â€“2021). On the course, Spieth had been having struggles with his trusty putter at the beginning of the year, but a tie for 9th at the Genesis Open left him feeling optimistic about his game: 'I putted extremely well this week, which is awesome. I feel great about the state of my game going forward. I feel like I'm in a great place at this time of the year as we're starting to head into major season.'[71] A tie for 14th would follow at the WGC-Mexico Championship.
