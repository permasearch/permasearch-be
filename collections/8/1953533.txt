Having reached his zenith, Berry did not have the same statistical success over his final seven seasons, but he remained a consistent target for Unitas. His 75 receptions in the 1961 season was second most in the league, and he finished 10th in receiving yards, but failed to record a touchdown for the first time since his rookie year.[8] He scored the first touchdown of that year's Pro Bowl on a 16-yard reception from Unitas in the first quarter.[26] His streak of Pro Bowl invitations ended at four, as he was not invited in 1962, but made consecutive Pro Bowl appearances in 1963 and 1964, the latter being his final.[8] The Colts returned to the postseason in 1964, where they were shutout 27â€“0 by the Cleveland Browns in the 1964 championship game.[27]
