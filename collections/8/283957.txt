In The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy (2001–2003) by Peter Jackson, the Nazgûl are almost always concealed by cloaks; however, they appear as white ghostly corpses to Frodo when he is wearing the Ring. The Nazgûl attack the inn themselves. Their deafeningly loud shrieks and fell beasts are highlighted. During the siege of Minas Tirith, the Witch-king of Angmar wears a distinctive helmet over his hood resembling a mask and a crown, as opposed to the crown worn underneath his hood in the book. Their shrieks are distorted recordings of producer and screenwriter Fran Walsh's scream.[13]
