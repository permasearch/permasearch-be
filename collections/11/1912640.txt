In December 2015 it was announced that the seven original members of Chicago — Cetera, Robert Lamm, Lee Loughnane, Walter Parazaider, James Pankow, Danny Seraphine, and Terry Kath — were to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the induction ceremony was set for April 8, 2016 at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York.[123][124]  Although initially Cetera and current band members had entertained the possibility of performing together for the induction ceremony,[121][125][126] ultimately, Cetera decided against it. He announced his decision via two posts to his web site, dated February 8, 2016,[127] and February 25, 2016,[128] and in those posts expressed his frustration with trying to work out the performance details with band members and show producers.[129] Cetera did not attend the ceremony even for the purpose of accepting his award.[130][131][132] Since then there have been indications that a reunion between Cetera and Chicago is unlikely to ever happen.[133][134][135]  Cetera declined to be interviewed for the 2017 documentary Now More Than Ever: The History of Chicago.[136][137]
