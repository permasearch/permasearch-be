In reviewing the anime adaptation, Kotaku called the Overlord anime a "magnificent power fantasy" which "brings up a very relatable theme for anyone who has played an MMORPG before."[70] However, a review by Monsters and Critics claimed that "fans were not too happy with the CGI animation" produced by studio Madhouse for the third season and the "biggest disappoint was Overlord Season 3 Episode 12, which animated the epic scene showing the Dark Youngs."[71]
