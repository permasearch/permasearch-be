Prior to the 2010 playoffs, the overtime winner was simply the first team to score any points;[4] however, they were changed to reduce the apparent advantage gained by the team that won the overtime coin toss. Under the prior rules, the team that won the coin toss would usually elect to receive the ball, then gain just enough yardage to win the game by kicking a field goal without the other team ever touching the ball. The coin toss winner won approximately 60% of overtime games under that rule.[5] The first overtime game played under the new overtime rules trial occurred in the 2011-2012 NFL AFC Wildcard Playoff game between the Denver Broncos and Pittsburgh Steelers at Sports Authority Field at Mile High, Denver, Colorado. Denver won the game on the first play in overtime, an 80-yard touchdown pass from Tim Tebow to Demaryius Thomas. The rule was expanded into the regular season for the 2012 season,[6] and the first game in which both teams scored in overtime was a 43-37 victory by the Houston Texans over the Jacksonville Jaguars on November 18, 2012.[7]
