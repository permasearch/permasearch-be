Charles 'Chuckie' Nevins Slott (Kellen Michael) is a recurring character in seasons 4-6. Chuckie is Sammi's son. He has an IQ of 71 and is naive to the intentions of others. He ends up in prison along with Carl for being his drug mule. He is released later than Carl and stays with the Gallaghers despite their previous tension with Sammi. Although Carl threatens to hurt Chuckie, Carl doesn't follow through his threat. In Season 6, Chuckie writes an essay expressing his absolute disapproval of minorities in America with propaganda provided by neo-Nazis in prison with school officials threatening to expel him; although Frank disapproved of Chuckies views, Frank defends Chuckies freedom of speech right and Chuckie is allowed to read out his essay to his class, with Frank chuckling, "...little Donald Trump". After the Gallaghers lose their home, they forget to inform Chuckie who is left to camp under the porch alone. Eventually, Sammi calls her mother Queenie to look after him and she takes him to live at her Eco Village. While there, he works tending poppy plants and is mauled by a mountain lion.
