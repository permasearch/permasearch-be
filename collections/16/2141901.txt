The first season aired from 2002 to 2004 with frequent reruns of the episodes. The season finale stated that soon the second season would be produced (with the actors leaving a "goodbye" message like in the promotional commercial). The second season marked the show return at the end of the first quarter of 2007 (continuing with the plot that had ended the first season years ago, in which a plane where they were traveling crashing in an island and the family having passed around 5 years living there, to compensate the years that had passed after the first season.), with the show now produced in a 16:9 (HDTV format) and airing constantly new episodes, using the same actors as in the first season (including the fact that the kids starring on it had grown up a lot).
