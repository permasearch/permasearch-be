The stunt "How to Milk a Horse" was originally shot for Wildboyz, but was saved for future use.[5] "The idea to drink the horse semen was not actually planned but was "in the back of everyone's mind."[6] To agree to do the stunt, Chris Pontius asked director Jeff Tremaine for a full day off of work, but discouraged doing so since Pontius had missed work the day before.[7] Additionally on screen Chris Pontius stated to Jeff Tremaine "This is going to make up for something bad I'm going to do in the future." This deal was verbally agreed upon and sealed with a handshake; it was also noted that said deal was videotaped for the camera.
