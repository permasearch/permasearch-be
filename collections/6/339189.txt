The St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League (NHL) play at the Scottrade Center. They were one of the six teams added to the NHL in the 1967 expansion. The Blues have never won the Stanley Cup, and are the oldest team not to do so. Prior to the Blues, the city was home to the St. Louis Eagles. The team only played in the 1934-35 season.
