On 13 November 2014, MPs were involved in a physical altercation with police when EFF MP Ngwanamakwetle Mashabela refused to leave the podium after being instructed to when she called President Jacob Zuma a thief. Several DA and EFF MPs were shoved and pushed when trying to intervene with police in order to support Mashabela. DA chief whip John Steenhuisen said of the incident: “Four of my [DA] members, two of them women, have been assaulted by police. They are Terri Stander, Gordon Mackay, Denise Robinson and Dean Macpherson,”[10]
