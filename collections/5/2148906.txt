Bjorlin announced during an interview with TV Guide on August 21, 2012, that she would return to the role of Chloe, with her first airdate being January 4, 2013. She began filming in September.[2] Speaking out about all of the rumors that had circulated, Bjorlin stated: "I find out a lot about myself through reading magazines  [sic] There was a little bit of talk throughout the year. "Would you ever be interested in returning?" That sort of thing. But never anything concrete  [sic] Now the timing is right. It's been a year since we've seen Chloe. Hopefully, the audience has forgotten what she was up to."[2] Speaking of her exit storyline the previous year, Bjorlin said that she herself would have written the character out: "Chloe is so near and dear to my heart and even I would have written her off after that storyline. She was spiraling out of control and the fans had stopped being able to recognize the character. I couldn't recognize her, either! A lot of what made Chloe so lovable — her integrity, her fun, her wit — was gone and I don't blame anyone for dropping her from the show."[2] She teased the character's return, hinting that she would return as "herself", and will have good self-esteem with a stronger and more confident mentality.[2]
