Infinite was also criticized for its playable roster at launch, which was smaller than the previous installment, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, and recycled many of its characters.[77][80][81][82][83] VentureBeat's Mike Minotti expressed his disappointment with the game's smaller selection of fighters, especially compared to its predecessors, and the meager amount of newcomers.[80] Yin-Poole pointed out the lack of diversity in the roster, particularly the lack of playable female characters.[82] GameCentral stated that the roster "smacks of laziness and/or a lack of budget" and suspected that most of the final roster decisions were made by lawyers and marketing people.[81] The omission of characters from the X-Men and Fantastic Four franchises was also chastised by critics, who speculated that the then-ongoing legal dispute between The Walt Disney Company, Marvel Studios, and 20th Century Fox over their film rights was the main motive behind their exclusion.[78][80][82][83] Prell and Yin-Poole both lamented the lack of X-Men characters, highlighting the franchise's significance in establishing the Marvel vs. Capcom series.[77][82] The latter declared their omission as "a dagger in the heart of every [Marvel vs. Capcom] fan - one that there is no recovering from."[82]
