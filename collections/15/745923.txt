Reaction from non-Christians has been mixed as well. Philip Pullman, an atheist supporter of secularism and humanism, has serious objections to the Narnia series[citation needed].  On the other hand, the books have appeared in Neo-pagan reading lists[29][better source needed] (by the Wiccan author Starhawk,[30] among others). Positive reviews of the books by authors who share few of Lewis' religious views can be found in Revisiting Narnia, edited by Shanna Caughey.
