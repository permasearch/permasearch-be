At Cortex's base, Uka Uka derides Cortex for failing to destroy Crash and replaces Cortex with his niece, Nina Cortex, despite protests from Neo, N. Gin and Tiny Tiger.[22] Nina has Coco brainwashed and makes her participate in the construction of the Doominator.[23] Throughout the course of the game, Crash and Aku Aku interrogate Tiny Tiger,[24] Doctor N. Gin[25] and Uka Uka on the whereabouts of Coco.[26] When they confront Nina Cortex inside the Doominator robot, Nina summons her Arachnina cyborg and fights Crash.[27] Crash eventually destroys the robot, liberating Coco and disabling the Doominator. The Doominator collapses and barely misses the Bandicoot home (and Crunch), sparing much of Wumpa Island. Escaping from the collapsed Doominator, Cortex praises Nina for betraying him, and promises to be more evil in the near future.[28] The Bandicoots decide that it is time for celebration, leading Crash to shout his first word in the series and the object of their celebration: pancakes.[29]
