Early physiologists believed the reflex plays a major role in establishing the rate and depth of breathing in humans.[4] While this may be true for most animals, it is not the case for most adult humans at rest.[4] However, the reflex may determine breathing rate and depth in newborns and in adult humans when tidal volume is more than 1 L, as when exercising.[4]
