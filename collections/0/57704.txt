This was the city of Chicago's first professional sports championship since the Chicago Fire won MLS Cup '98 (which came four months after the Chicago Bulls' sixth NBA championship that year). The next major Chicago sports championship came in 2010, when the NHL's Chicago Blackhawks ended a 49-year Stanley Cup title drought. With the Chicago Bears' win in Super Bowl XX and the Chicago Cubs' own World Series championship in 2016, all Chicago sports teams have won at least one major championship since 1985. Meanwhile, the Astros themselves made it back to the World Series in 2017, but this time as an AL team, where they defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in seven games, resulting in Houston's first professional sports championship since the 2006â€“07 Houston Dynamo won their back-to-back MLS Championships.
