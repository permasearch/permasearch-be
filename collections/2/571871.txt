In 1985, the BBC's EastEnders debuted and became a near instant success with viewers and critics alike, with the first episode attracting over 17 million viewers. The Christmas Day 1986 episode was watched by 30.15 million viewers and contained a scene in which divorce papers were served to Angie Watts (Anita Dobson) by her husband, Queen Vic landlord Den (Leslie Grantham). Critics talked about the downfall of Coronation Street[citation needed], but it continued to perform successfully. For the better part of ten years,[when?], EastEnders has shared the number one position with Coronation Street.
