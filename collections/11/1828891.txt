Because many Vietnamese sought asylum in West Germany or guest work in East Germany during and after the Vietnam War and because approximately 40% of the Vietnamese population carry one particular name, the surname Nguyen is notably common in Germany. In other countries with larger numbers of Vietnamese immigrants, Nguyen is even more frequent, as in France (835th) or the United States (229th).
