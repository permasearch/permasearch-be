Cinematographer Daniel Mindel stated that The Force Awakens would use real locations and scale models over computer-generated imagery to make it aesthetically similar to the original Star Wars trilogy.[180] Rian Johnson, director of The Last Jedi, reiterated that Abrams would use little CGI and more practical, traditional special effects, saying: "I think people are coming back around to [practical effects]. It feels like there is sort of that gravity pulling us back toward it. I think that more and more people are hitting kind of a critical mass in terms of the CG-driven action scene lending itself to a very specific type of action scene, where physics go out the window and it becomes so big so quick."[181] Abrams' intention in prioritizing practical special effects was to recreate the visual realism and authenticity of the original Star Wars.[182] To that end, the droid BB-8 was a physical prop that was developed by Disney Research,[183] created by special effects artist Neal Scanlan and operated live on set with the actors.[184][185]
