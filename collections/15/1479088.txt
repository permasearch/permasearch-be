The Walls of Dubrovnik (Croatian: Dubrovaƒçke gradske zidine) are a series of defensive stone walls surrounding the city of Dubrovnik in southern Croatia.[Note 1][1] With numerous additions and modifications throughout their history, they have been considered to be amongst the great fortification systems of the Middle Ages, as they were never breached by a hostile army during this time period.[2] In 1979, the old city of Dubrovnik, which includes a substantial portion of the old walls of Dubrovnik, joined the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites.[3][4]
