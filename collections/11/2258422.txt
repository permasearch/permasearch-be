Her reasons for suicide have been the subject of ongoing speculation. There were multiple stresses in the marriage,[30][29][28] and it has been suggested that she opposed Haber's work in chemical warfare. According to this view, her suicide may have been in part a response to Haber's having personally overseen the first successful use of chlorine gas during the Second Battle of Ypres, resulting in over 67,000 casualties.[31][32] Haber left within days for the Eastern Front to oversee gas release against the Russian Army.[33][34] Originally buried in Dahlem, Clara's remains were later transferred at her husband's request to Basel, where she is buried next to him.[7]:176
