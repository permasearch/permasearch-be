Ebola has a high mortality rate among primates.[123] Frequent outbreaks of Ebola may have resulted in the deaths of 5,000 gorillas.[218] Outbreaks of Ebola may have been responsible for an 88% decline in tracking indices of observed chimpanzee populations in the 420Â km2 Lossi Sanctuary between 2002 and 2003.[219] Transmission among chimpanzees through meat consumption constitutes a significant risk factor, whereas contact between the animals, such as touching dead bodies and grooming, is not.[220]
