The second leg of the Champions League quarter-final ended in dramatic fashion, as a last minute goal from Demba Ba sent Chelsea through to the semi-finals at the expense of PSG. Eden Hazard limped off early and was replaced by André Schürrle, who subsequently scored from a long throw-in after 32 minutes before Demba Ba's late goal secured Mourinho's unbeaten record in the Champions League quarter-final stage.[64]
