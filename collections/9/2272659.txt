(which is most accurate when     0 >   N P V   n   >   N P V   n − 1     {\displaystyle 0>\mathrm {NPV} _{n}>\mathrm {NPV} _{n-1}}  ) has been shown to be almost 10 times more accurate than the secant formula for a wide range of interest rates and initial guesses.  For example, using the stream of payments {−4000, 1200, 1410, 1875, 1050} and initial guesses      r  1   = 0.25   {\displaystyle r_{1}=0.25}   and      r  2   = 0.2   {\displaystyle r_{2}=0.2}   the secant formula with correction gives an IRR estimate of 14.2% (0.7% error) as compared to IRR = 13.2% (7% error) from the secant method.
