Since February 2017, Barrymore has starred in the Netflix television series Santa Clarita Diet, portraying a family wife who, after experiencing a physical transformation into a zombie, starts craving human flesh. Along with co-star Timothy Olyphant, Barrymore also serves as a executive producer on the single-camera series,[106] which was favorably received upon its premiere;[107] Rolling Stone felt that "much of [the series' laughs] comes down to the uncrushable Drew Barrymore charm" and furthermore remarked: "The show is a welcome comeback for Barrymore, the eternally beloved grunge-era wild thing â€”it's not just her big move into TV, but her first high-profile performance anywhere in years. In a way, it circles back to the roles she was doing in the early [90s], playing deadly vixens in flicks like Guncrazy or Doppelganger".[108] A second season was released in March 2018,[109] and a third one is slated for 2019.[110]
