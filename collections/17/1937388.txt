Under the Indo-French Agreement of June 1948, the first municipal elections were held in Chandernagore in August, elections in which the Congress Karmaparishad won 22 of the 24 seats. The new municipal assembly overwhelmingly voted for merger with the Indian Union but it took until June 9, 1952 before the Government of India took control. Later, Chandernagore became part of the Hoogly district of West Bengal.
