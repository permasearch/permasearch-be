Lead singer Ben Volpelierre-Pierrot was best known for wearing a beret in most pictures of the band.  He later revealed it was in fact a peaked fisherman's hat, turned round with the peak to the rear so that it resembled a beret. Ben VP (as he was billed on a number of solo singles in the mid 1990s) was frequently referred to as Bendy Ben (or Boozy Ben) in Smash Hits magazine. He also appeared as a model on the front of Mike Read's Pop Quiz board game.
