Negahban had just completed work on Aladdin (2019) when Hawley contacted him about taking on the role, and he watched the first season of the series during a weekend before joining the production. Production on the eighth episode was underway when Negahban arrived, and he had to reshoot the character's scenes for the first seven episodes. Negahban worked with the other actors, including Stevens and Plaza, to track the development of the Shadow King through the series,[29] and was given a map by the writers that helped explain his character's backstory. For a scene where the character speaks fluent French, Stevens helped Negahban with his pronunciation.[30]
