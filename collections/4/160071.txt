Certain behaviors such as eating, rumination, and lying down can be related to the health of the cow and cow comfort.[24] These behaviors can also be related to the productivity of the cows.[24] Likewise, stress, disease, and discomfort will have a negative effect on the productivity of the dairy cows.[24] Therefore, it can be said that it is in the best interest of the farmer to increase eating, rumination, and lying down and decrease stress, disease, and discomfort to achieve the maximum productivity possible.[24] Also, estrous behaviors such as mounting can be a sign of cow comfort, since if a cow is lame, nutritionally deficient, or are housed in an over crowded barn, the performance of estrous behaviors will be altered.[25]
