Amongst the participants that took part in the ninth series was ventriloquist Marc Métral, who auditioned for the show by performing comedic ventriloquism through his dog "Miss Wendy". Métral's act involves the use of a specially designed "ventriloquist mask" – a special device used by ventriloquists on human volunteers – which is attached to over the jaw of his dog and then operated by a remote control to move when the dog "speaks". The act was not the first time that such a form of ventriloquism was used; such a performance had been previously used by a participant for the seventh series of America's Got Talent in 2012. However, after Métral's audition was aired, several animal rights groups made complaints to ITV and Ofcom over the belief that the dog was being mistreated, while adding that they had concerns over the dog's welfare after they had felt it seemed to "tremble" on stage. The RSPCA, which had similar concerns, launched an investigation into the act to determine if the dog suffered any cruelty from its owner in the performance, particularly because of the mask it wore, but later felt satisfied that the dog's well-being and treatment on the show was very adequate after being invited by Simon Cowell to oversee her in rehearsals with her owner. Cowell later went onto Twitter to alleviate any further concerns over Métral's act:[26][27]
