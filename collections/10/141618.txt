Upon the onset of the war President James Madison ordered several naval vessels to be dispatched to patrol the American coastline. The U.S. flagship, President, with 44 guns, Essex, with 32, and with Hornet, bearing 18 guns, were joined in lower New York harbor by United States with its 44 guns, commanded by Decatur, Congress, bearing 38 guns, and Argus with 16 guns. Secretary of State James Monroe[g] had originally considered a plan that would simply use U.S. naval vessels as barriers that would sit idle in various ports guarding their entrances. However, through much protest and appeal from naval officers, the plan to confine America's naval vessels to port never materialized.[130]
