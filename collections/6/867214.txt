Davey, Woody and Nikki enter Mackey's home with Mr. Armstrong's video camera and explore a locked room in the basement, apparently decorated to resemble Mackey's childhood room. They enter an adjoining bathroom and are horrified to find the missing boy's dessicated corpse in the bathtub, along with a still-living recent abductee. They present their footage to the Ipswich Police Department, who issue an APB on Mackey.
