In the countries of the former USSR there is an interesting tradition associated with the colour of money. Denominations of 10 almost always have a red tinge, and are called "chervonets" (rus. червонец), which comes from the old Russian word "chervony" (rus. червоный) meaning "red". In the Russian Empire, the high-grade gold from which the coins were made was called "red gold." Then the corresponding denominations worth 10 rubles began to be issued with a red tinge that were subject to exchange for gold. In the USSR (which included almost all the regions of the former Russian Empire) in the early 1920s, banknotes of one chervonets were also issued, which were provided with gold.
