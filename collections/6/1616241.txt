Nearly all countries use one side or the other throughout their entire territory. Most exceptions are due to historical considerations and/or involve islands with no road connection to the main part of a country. China is RHT except the Special Administrative Regions of China of Hong Kong and Macau. The United States is RHT except the United States Virgin Islands.[5] The United Kingdom is LHT, but its overseas territories of Gibraltar and British Indian Ocean Territory are RHT.
