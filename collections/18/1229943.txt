England under Elizabeth I's reign, the Elizabethan Era, was ruled by the very structured and complicated Elizabethan government.  It was divided into the national bodies (the monarch, Privy Council, and Parliament), the regional bodies (the Council of the North and Council of the Marches), the county, community bodies and the court system.
