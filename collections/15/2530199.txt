Stella and Nathan are worried about both of their children now, so they take Matt to a psychologist. Sugar offers to let Kim stay at her flat for a while, to take a bit of stress off the rest of Kim's family. They agree to sleep in the same bed, facing opposite ends. Before Kim and Sugar go to sleep, Kim finds out that Sugar takes sleeping pills anyway, as she can't sleep without them. She then disappears underneath the covers.
