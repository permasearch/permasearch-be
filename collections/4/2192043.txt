Hughes was appointed as head coach of the Wales national team in 1999.[23] Initially appointed on a temporary basis alongside Neville Southall to replace Bobby Gould, Hughes had soon done enough to earn himself a long-term contract, with Southall eventually leaving the set-up.[24] When he had taken over Wales were going through a bad patch, but in the five years with Hughes in charge, Wales came close to qualifying for UEFA Euro 2004. In their Euro 2004 qualifying group, Wales ended up second, beating Italy 2â€“1 in Cardiff in the process, but was denied a place in the final tournament after losing to Russia in the playoffs.[25]
