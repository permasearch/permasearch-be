Jevon (Steven Woodcock) is a friend of Rodney and Mickey Pearce, first seen in Dates. Unlike Mickey, Jevon is successful with the ladies, though to his chagrin Cassandra Parry rebuffed him when he asked her to dance. He was even more surprised when she agreed to dance with Rodney. Jevon set up a trading partnership with Mickey Pearce, which lasted throughout the sixth series. They apparently gave up on the trading business at the end of that series though, following a run-in with the Driscoll brothers which left them both in plaster. Jevon made one further appearance in The Jolly Boys' Outing, after which Woodcock left the series to take the role of Clyde Tavernier in EastEnders and the character was not seen again. He appeared in The Jolly Boys' Outing, Little Problems, Sickness & Wealth, Yuppy Love and Dates.
