Tomlinson left the Chargers ranked eighth among NFL career rushing leaders with 12,490 yards. He also ranked second with 138 career rushing touchdowns, and third with 153 total touchdowns.[59] He became the fastest player to reach 150Â career touchdowns (137 games).[55] Tomlinson expressed a desire to eventually retire as a San Diego Charger, but acknowledged a difficult relationship with Chargers general manager A. J. Smith. He said he "felt disrespected" by comments Smith made in the past.[63] McClatchy Newspapers wrote in 2011 that Tomlinson was likely to have his number 21 retired by the Chargers once he retires.[64] Bob Wick, the San Diego Chargers equipment manager, said he tried to keep No. 21 out of circulation, even though it had not been officially retired.[65][66][67]
