A 2011 national study found that college students with a high socioeconomic status persisted in college 25% more than students with a low socioeconomic status.[174] In fact, students with a high socioeconomic status are 1.55 times more likely to persist in college than students with a low socioeconomic status. Attaining even higher degrees than a bachelor's degree can also be affected by socioeconomic status. A 2008 study reports that 11% of students with low socioeconomic status report earning a master's, medical, or law degree compared to 42% of high socioeconomic students.[175] Analyst Jeffrey Selingo wondered whether higher education had less and less ability to level the playing field.[3] A 2007 study found that 52% of low-income students who qualified for college enrolled within 2 years of graduation compared to 83% of high-income students.[167]
