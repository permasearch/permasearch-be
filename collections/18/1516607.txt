In the United States, the single reached number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, number 1 in Record World, and number 2 in Cashbox, where it was held off number 1 by the Supremes' "You Can't Hurry Love".[8] The single was released during the controversies about the "Butcher Cover" (the Yesterday and Today album cover)[8] and Lennon's remarks about Christianity,[14] which are cited as part of the reason the song failed to reach number 1 on all US charts. It sold 1,200,000 copies in four weeks and earned the Beatles their twenty-first US Gold Record award, beating the record set by Elvis Presley.[15]
