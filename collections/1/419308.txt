Archaeological evidence has made it possible to assess the historical plausibility of Biblical narratives with chronological elements. For example, the book of Kings (1 Kings 14:25) mentions Pharaoh Shishak, who could be the historical Shoshenq I. Likewise, the Merneptah Stele (c. 1200 BCE) may help place early Israel in a historical context and, much later, the Cyrus Cylinder (538 BCE) correlates to the return of Judean exiles in the books of Ezraâ€“Nehemiah.
