Team challenge: The teams were woken up early to retrieve and prepare Dover sole for dinner service. While bringing the fish in, Aaron claimed to suffer from cramps and Ramsay excused him from the challenge, automatically balancing out the teams. The teams had 30 minutes to carefully remove the skin and extract the roe from as many fishes as possible; Ramsay inspected each one and made a pass/fail determination. The men were let down by Vinnie having neglected to prepare any correctly, though Josh, Brad, Eddie and Rock pulled the score up to eight. Melissa single-handedly earned half of this by having four acceptable servings, while Julia had two. Despite Jen and Bonnie failing to earn any and Joanna having only prepared three, all three of hers were acceptable, leading to a victory for the women.
