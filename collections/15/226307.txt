By April and May 1941, the Luftwaffe was still getting through to their targets, taking no more than one- to two-percent losses per mission.[166] On 19/20 April 1941, in honour of Hitler's 52nd birthday, 712 bombers hit Plymouth with a record 1,000Â tons of bombs.[166] Losses were minimal. In the following month, 22 German bombers were lost with 13 confirmed to have been shot down by night fighters.[166] On 3/4 May, nine were shot down in one night.[166] On 10/11 May, London suffered severe damage, but 10 German bombers were downed.[166] In May 1941, RAF night fighters shot down 38 German bombers.[167] By the end of May, Kesselring's Luftflotte 2 had been withdrawn, leaving Hugo Sperrle's Luftflotte 3 as a token force to maintain the illusion of strategic bombing.[150] Hitler now had his sights set on Operation Barbarossa, and the Blitz came to end.[168]
