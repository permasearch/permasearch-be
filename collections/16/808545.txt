These three symbols     Ω ,  Ω  +   ,  Ω  −     {\displaystyle \Omega ,\Omega _{+},\Omega _{-}}  , as well as     f ( x ) =  Ω  ±   ( g ( x ) )   {\displaystyle f(x)=\Omega _{\pm }(g(x))}   (meaning that     f ( x ) =  Ω  +   ( g ( x ) )   {\displaystyle f(x)=\Omega _{+}(g(x))}   and     f ( x ) =  Ω  −   ( g ( x ) )   {\displaystyle f(x)=\Omega _{-}(g(x))}   are both satisfied), are now currently used in analytic number theory.[17]
