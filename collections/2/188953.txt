Cotton cloth started to become highly sought-after for the European urban markets during the Renaissance and the Enlightenment.[citation needed] Vasco da Gama (d. 1524), a Portuguese explorer, opened Asian sea trade, which replaced caravans and allowed for heavier cargo. Indian craftspeople had long protected the secret of how to create colourful patterns. However, some converted to Christianity and their secret was revealed by a French Catholic priest, Father Coeurdoux (1691â€“1779). He revealed the process of creating the fabrics in France, which assisted the European textile industry.[27]
