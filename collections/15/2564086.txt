John D. Rockefeller was born in Richford, New York, then part of the Burned-over district — a New York state area being the site of an evangelical revival known as the Second Great Awakening; it drew masses to various Protestant churches—especially Baptist ones—urging believers to follow such ideals as hard work, prayer and good deeds to build "the Kingdom of God on Earth". Early in his life, he regularly went with his siblings and mother Eliza to the local Baptist church — the Erie Street Baptist Church (later the Euclid Avenue Baptist Church) — an independent Baptist church which eventually came to associate with the Northern Baptist Convention (1907-1950; modern American Baptist Churches USA).[citation needed]
