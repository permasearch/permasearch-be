Barbara Gordon's Oracle persona was briefly mentioned in the Arrow episode "A.W.O.L," where Oliver mentions that the reason he didn't choose Oracle as Felicity Smoak's codename is because it was taken, referencing Barbara Gordon and even possibly Batman's existence in the Arrowverse, but still they didn't appear in that series.
