Hagrid introduces Harry to the wizarding world, bringing him to places filled with wonder and magic like Diagon Alley, a hidden London street where Harry purchases his pet owl Hedwig and his various school supplies, and Gringotts Wizarding Bank, where he uncovers a fortune left to him by his parents in his vault. There, he is surprised to discover how famous he truly is among witches and wizards, who refer to him as "the boy who lived".
