Like all European Union members, France agreed to cut carbon emissions by at least 20% of 1990 levels by the year 2020,[95] compared to the U.S. plan to reduce emissions by 4% of 1990 levels.[96] As of 2009[update], French carbon dioxide emissions per capita were lower than that of China's.[97] The country was set to impose a carbon tax in 2009 at 17 euros per tonne of carbon emitted,[98] which would have raised 4Â billion euros of revenue annually.[99] However, the plan was abandoned due to fears of burdening French businesses.[100]
