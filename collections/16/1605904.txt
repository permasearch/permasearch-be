A recurring thread throughout much of the first season is Morgan's obsessive love for Ellie Bartowski, which is not reciprocated. However, as the series progressed, the two came to an understanding and developed something of a friendship after "bonding over an 'I miss Chuck' moment".[8] Morgan has admitted that he sees Ellie as a sister, albeit one with whom he wants to have sex.[7] Morgan's crush on Ellie generated some problems in "Chuck Versus the Nemesis" when he brought Anna Wu to Thanksgiving dinner.
