Once at Rockefeller Center, the tree is supported[8] by four guy-wires attached at its midpoint and by a steel spike at its base. Scaffolding is erected around the tree to assist workers in hanging about 50,000 multi-colored LED lights and the star top.[9] The crystal star that has topped the tree since 2004 is 9.5 feet (2.9 m) in diameter and weighs 550 pounds (250 kg). This "Swarovski Star," containing 25,000 Swarovski crystals, 1 million facets, and LED lights, was created by German artist Michael Hammers.[10][11]
