Later, Melisandre visits Gendry and seduces him, tying him to a bed in the process. Having earlier stated that there is "power" in Gendry's kingly blood, she lays three leeches on him to draw his blood. Stannis enters and ritually burns the leeches, speaking the names of the usurpers to his throne: Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy, and Joffrey Baratheon.
