In 1514, the weakened and aging Vladislaus faced a major peasant rebellion led by György Dózsa. It was ruthlessly crushed by the Hungarian nobles led by János Szapolyai. The resulting degradation of order paved the way for Ottoman ambitions to acquire Hungarian territory. In 1521, the strongest Hungarian fortress in the south, Nándorfehérvár (modern Belgrade), fell to the Turks, and in 1526, the Hungarian army was crushed at the Battle of Mohács. The young King Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia died in the battle along with the leader of the Hungarian army, Pál Tomori. The early appearance of Protestantism further worsened internal unity in the anarchical country.
