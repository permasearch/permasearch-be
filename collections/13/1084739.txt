The Maruti Wagon R is an Indian version of the international Suzuki Wagon R, manufactured and sold by Suzuki's Indian subsidiary Maruti Suzuki. The Wagon R was launched in December 1999, and has since undergone four upgrades (one in 2003, another in 2006, another in 2010 and the most recent in 2013). When the second-generation Wagon R was launched in 2010, the car was built on a newer platform, and claimed more interior space, and new features such as an under-seat tray below the front passenger seat (top-end only).
