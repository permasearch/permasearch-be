Tywin hoped his daughter would marry Rhaegar Targaryen from a very young age and rejected the Princess of Dorne's proposal to betroth Oberyn Martell and Elia Martell to her and Jaime respectively. She became infatuated with Rhaegar and even hid her infatuation from her brother as her father advised her.[4] At the age of eleven, Jaime was sent away to serve as a squire for Lord Sumner Crakehall.[2] A year later, Aerys Targaryen rejected Cersei's marriage to his son, humiliating Tywin.[4] Tywin took Cersei to King's Landing and, in the following years, refused every other offer of marriage for her. In 281 AC, when Cersei and Jaime were fifteen, Jaime, newly knighted on the battlefield, came to King's Landing on his way to Casterly Rock to visit his sister, from whom he had been separated for years. She informed him that their father planned to marry him to Lysa Tully and persuaded him to join the Kingsguard in order to be near her, after sleeping together for the first time.[2] They started an affair which lasted until the morning of her marriage to Robert Baratheon. While she was happy marrying Robert at first,[5] he didn't return her affections and repeatedly cheated on her. She then resumed her incestuous affair with her brother, resulting in the births of Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen.
