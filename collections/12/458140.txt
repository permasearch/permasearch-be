England and Wales are treated as a single entity (companies may be ‘Registered in England and Wales’) with a unified register, separate from those of Scotland or Northern Ireland. Companies must advise Companies House of their intended registered office (the official address of the company), which may be in England and Wales, in Scotland, or in Wales.[1] Consequently, on incorporation, companies will be either ‘Registered in England and Wales’, ‘Registered in Scotland’, or ‘Registered in Wales’. Effectively, companies in England must register in England and Wales, companies in Scotland must register in Scotland, while companies in Wales may choose to register in either England and Wales, or in Wales.
