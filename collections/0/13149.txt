The succession follows the order of vice president, Speaker of the House of Representatives, President pro tempore of the Senate, and then the heads of federal executive departments who form the Cabinet of the United States. The Cabinet currently has fifteen members, beginning with the Secretary of State, and followed by the rest in the order of their positions' creation. Those heads of department who are ineligible to act as president are also ineligible to succeed the president by succession, for example most commonly if they are not a natural-born U.S. citizen.
