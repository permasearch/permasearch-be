The Red Bull House of Art is an art fellowship program that was launched by Red Bull.[94][95] The program is held in multiple cities, most notably the Red Bull House of Art programs in Detroit, Michigan and SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and the program typically consists of a three-month period during which time six to eight participants will create new artwork with the intent to display it in a final exhibition.[96][97] During the fellowship the artists receive unlimited access to the galleries and a stipend for art supplies.[98]
