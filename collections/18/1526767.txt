Australia, captained by Greg Chappell, won the toss and elected to bat. Although the first two days were affected by rain, Australia ended the first day on 227 for 2 and the second on 278 for 4, declaring at 385 for 5 on the third day, with centuries for Graeme Wood (112) and Kim Hughes (117). England were bowled out for 205, with Len Pascoe taking 5/59 and including a duck for England captain, Ian Botham. Australia declared on 189 for 4 in their second innings, setting England an unlikely target of 370 in less than one day to win. Geoffrey Boycott batted out the rest of the day, scoring 128 not out, leaving England on 244 for 3 at the close, and the match was drawn.
