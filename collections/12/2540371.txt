The Republic of Molossia claims to be at war with East Germany, alleging that they are responsible for military drills performed by Kevin Baugh while stationed with the United States Military in West Germany, and the resulting lack of sleep.[13][14] While East Germany formally ceased to exist in 1991 via the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany, Molossia argues that Ernst Th채lmann Island, which had been dedicated by Cuba to Weimar German politician Ernst Th채lmann and had not been mentioned in the Treaty on the Final Settlement or by the nation of Cuba either, therefore it remains East German land, allowing the war to continue.
