In the opening scene of the episode, the Griffin family is seen watching a television show entitled How I Met Your Father, a parody of the CBS comedy-sitcom How I Met Your Mother, which was created by Craig Thomas and Carter Bays, who were writers for MacFarlane's sister show, American Dad!. Actors Josh Radnor and Neil Patrick Harris make cameo appearances, voicing their characters, Ted Mosby and Barney Stinson, who end up kissing passionately by the end of the scene.[2]
