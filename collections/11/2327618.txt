The play was "freely"[8] adapted for film by writer-director Roger Paradiso— "filmed primarily from the point of view of a lisping videographer"[7]—with Joey McIntyre and Mila Kunis playing the title characters.[9] The film premiered on May 3, 2004 at the Tribeca Film Festival and received a limited theatrical run three-and-a-half years later.[7][9]
