"In the Dark" received generally positive reviews from music critics. Lewis Corner of British music website Digital Spy rated it four stars out of five, particularly praising the saxophone hook.[16] Corner commented, "[Dev] purrs in her sensual and sultry tones, accompanied by that saxophone hook spicier than an extra-hot peri peri chicken from Nandos – and, we should add, just as lip-lickingly addictive."[16] Garyn Ganz of Rolling Stone graded the song three stars out of five and briefly commented: "Dev speak-sings about her sex drive over a Nineties Latin house beat like a top-shelf version of Kesha – seductive, not sleazy."[18]
