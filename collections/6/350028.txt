Dual capacitors come in a variety of sizes, depending on the capacitance (µF), such as 40 plus 5 µF, and also the voltage. A 440 volt capacitor can be used in place of a 370 volt, but not a 370 in place of a 440 volt.[2] The capacitance must stay the same within 5% of its original value.[2]  Round cylinder-shaped dual run capacitors are commonly used for air conditioning, to help in the starting of the compressor and the condenser fan motor.[2]  An oval dual run capacitor could be used instead of a round capacitor, but the mounting strap should be changed to better fit the oval shape.[2]
