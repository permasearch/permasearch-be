The breed standards by European FCI and the American Kennel Club specify a minimum weight of 99 pounds (45 kg) for a female and 110 pounds (50 kg) for a male.[5] There is no formally stated maximum weight, but dogs must be balanced with regard to their overall type and the conformation standards of the breed.[citation needed]
