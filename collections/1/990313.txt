On July 21, 2016 Boeing reported charges of $847 million against two flight-test 787s built in 2009. Boeing had planned to refurbish and sell them, but instead wrote them off as research and development expense.[178] Boeing will build 14 787s per month (168 per year) from 2019, helping to offset the $28 billion in deferred production costs accumulated through 2015, and will add 100 aircraft to the current accounting block of 1,300 at the end of the 2017 third quarter.[179]
