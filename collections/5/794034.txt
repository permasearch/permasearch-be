Musician Rudy Vallee was one of the building's earliest residents.[4] Ginger Rogers was one of its residents during her Broadway days in the early 1930s.[5] Hat designer Lilly Dache with husband Jean Despres of Coty Perfume were residents following their 1931 marriage until 1935. Other residents of the building have included Donna Karan,[6] Calvin Klein, Ring Lardner, Jr., and Marsha Mason.[7] The duplex penthouse on the 19th and 20th floors was owned by composer Jerry Herman in the 1970s, before he sold it for $1 million to Klein (who later sold it, and then bought it again in the 1990s). David Geffen later purchased it for $6 million, before selling it for $8.6 million to music executive Steve Gottlieb, who in turn listed it the week his record label TVT Records filed for bankruptcy.[7][8] He sold the apartment to Marc Lasry (co-founder and CEO of the Avenue Capital Group) for $33 million in 2014.[7][8][9]
