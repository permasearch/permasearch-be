Observations, first with the Palomar Testbed Interferometer by David Ciardi and Gerard van Belle in 2001[80] and then later confirmed with the CHARA array at Mt. Wilson in 2006 and the Infrared Optical Telescope Array at Mt. Hopkins in 2011,[81] revealed evidence for an inner dust band around Vega. Originating within 8Â AU of the star, this exozodiacal dust may be evidence of dynamical perturbations within the system.[82] This may be caused by an intense bombardment of comets or meteors, and may be evidence for the existence of a planetary system.[83]
