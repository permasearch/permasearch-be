St Mary's Roman Catholic Church is based in the town centre at Mount Pleasant. The parish was founded in 1847, in a chapel in Chapel Street. The land for the church was purchased in 1851 and the first building erected in 1853. It was opened in June 1853.[citation needed] The church can sit 750 persons. St Mary's is described as "a jewel in the Liverpool Roman Catholic Archdiocese".[citation needed][who?] Pugin & Pugin of London and Hansom are the architects.[18] St Mary's bells are a magnificent example. They are recorded to be the eighth biggest set of Catholic bells, weighing a ton. The eight bells were blessed and each bell had the rite of baptism with its own name in 1894.[citation needed]
