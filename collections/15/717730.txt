First appearing in Daredevil #187, Stone was the favored pupil of Stick, the blind former mentor of costumed crime-fighter Daredevil and Elektra Natchios.[1] He is a member of the Chaste and is a highly trained martial artist and assists his sensei against the Hand. Like the other members of the Chaste, Stone is deeply advanced in the art of chi-manipulation. An offshoot of this is his ability to render himself invulnerable to physical harm - but only if he sees it coming.[2]
