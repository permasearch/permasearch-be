Species of the genus include the orchard mason bee Osmia lignaria, the blueberry bee O. ribifloris, and the hornfaced bee O. cornifrons. The former two are native to the Americas and the latter to eastern Asia, although O. lignaria and O. cornifrons have been moved from their native ranges for commercial purposes. The red mason bee, Osmia bicornis, is found across the European continent.  Over 300 species are found across the Northern Hemisphere. Most occur in temperate habitats within the Palearctic and Neartic zones,  and are active from spring through late summer.[2]
