Carbon taxes offer a potentially cost-effective means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.[8] From an economic perspective, carbon taxes are a type of Pigovian tax.[9] They help to address the problem of emitters of greenhouse gases not facing the full social cost of their actions. Carbon taxes can be a regressive tax, in that they may directly or indirectly affect low-income groups disproportionately. The regressive impact of carbon taxes could be addressed by using tax revenues to favour low-income groups.[10]
