Under the Obama administration, these cost sharing reduction payments were paid out because the Department of Health and Human Services argued that the premium tax credits and the cost sharing reductions were "economically and programmatically integrated" in the Affordable Care Act, and so the appropriation that covers the premium tax credits also allowed HHS to pay CSR payments. However, the House of Representatives sued the Administration over this, arguing that the lack of an explicit appropriation for CSRs means that the payments can not be made. The decision in this case, House of Representatives v. Burwell, was that CSRs required a specific appropriation, but stayed any cancellation of CSR payments if and when appeals to the decision were made. The arguments made in this case became the backdrop for why the Trump Administration would cancel these payments.[3]
