Children are transported in a bespoke stretcher designed and built in partnership with consultant paediatricians and transport nurses. It can carry a baby up to 8 kg being in a specialist ‘baby pod’, or facilitate larger babies and children on the stretcher mattress. The stretcher design allows for the equipment needed for paediatric intensive care to be secure and easily operated, whether in flight or on the ground.
