Knowing that the mansion and village will be attacked, Subaru seeks help from the other royal candidates, but they all decline. While gathering an evacuation, he encounters a legendary mabeast called the White Whale. Rem sacrifices herself to allow Subaru to escape. After returning to the mansion, Subaru encounters Ram and Emilia, who have no recollection of Rem. Disturbed by the situation, Subaru reveals his "Return by Death" ability to Emilia, only for her to die afterwards. Puck, enraged, transforms and kills Petelgeuse and his cult, then freezes Subaru to death as punishment for Emilia's death. After respawning, Subaru, having fallen into utter despair, has a serious conversation with Rem, asking her to run away with him. Rem, however, strongly encourages Subaru not to give up and confesses her love for him, already knowing that his heart is for Emilia. With newfound resolve, Subaru then decides that he will start again from zero.
