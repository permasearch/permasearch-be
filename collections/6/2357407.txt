Video game rights to Tolkien's literary works were first licensed to Vivendi, which produced The Fellowship of the Ring in 2002 and The Hobbit in 2003. At around the same time licensing agreements for products relating to the films produced by Peter Jackson were obtained by Electronic Arts (EA), leading to the release of a series of games, starting with The Two Towers in 2002. In 2005 EA acquired the rights to produce games based on the literary works as well,[4] producing further titles up to the release of The Lord of the Rings: Conquest in 2009, when the licensing agreement expired.[5] Video game rights then passed to Warner Brothers.[6]
