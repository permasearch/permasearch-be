On August 10, 2008, following a series of explosions at a propane facility in Toronto, Highway 401 was closed between Highway 400 and Highway 404 as a precautionary measure, the largest closure of the highway in its history.[130] The highway remained closed until 8 p.m., though several exits near the blast remained closed thereafter.[131][132]
