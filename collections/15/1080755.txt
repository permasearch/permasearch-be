Crime in South Africa remained a massive problem. The Economist reports the killing of approximately 1,500 white farmers in attacks since 1991,[10] and in both 1995 and 1998, the country led the world in reported murders.[citation needed] In an effort to combat the alarming murder rates, the government has published statistics showing a steady, albeit tiny decrease in the murder rate since 1994, however this varies across the country.[11] In 2001, a South African was more likely to be murdered than die in a car crash.[12]
