Taqi Usmani, however, explains that this is a "misconception". Paying more for credit when buying a product ("an exchange of commodities for money")[147][148] does not violate sharia law, but exchange of "one unit of money for another of the same denomination" ("an exchange of money for money")[147] and charging for credit is a violation of sharia.[138] The cash loan is different because "money has no intrinsic utility".[138]
