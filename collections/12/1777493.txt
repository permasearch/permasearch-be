Israel begins selling letters that she has forged that appear to have been written by deceased writers, playwrights and actors, aided by her friend Jack.  She laces her letters with intimate details and unguarded expressions of the purported authors' thoughts and feelings to command a higher price from dealers. When a letter that Israel says was written by Noel Coward raises suspicion, people stop buying letters from her. After reports of her forgeries become more widespread, the FBI begins investigating her and warns dealers against buying her letters.
