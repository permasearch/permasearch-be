Several early stone age or Lower Paleolithic habitations have been excavated in eastern Malwa.[2] The name  Malwa is derived from the name of the ancient Indian tribe of Malavas. The name Malava is said to be derived from the Sanskrit term Malav, which means “part of the abode of Lakshmi”.[3] The location of the Malwa or Moholo, mentioned by the 7th-century Chinese traveller Xuanzang, is plausibly identified with present-day Gujarat.[4] The region is cited as Malibah in Arabic records, such as Kamilu-t Tawarikh by Ibn Asir.[5]
