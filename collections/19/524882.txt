In its second weekend, the film expanded to 4,022 theaters, thereby breaking its own record of being the widest Universal Pictures release ever, and earned an estimated $59.6 million, declining by 60%, which is the third best second weekend holdover for a pre-summer film release.[121][122] It became the highest-grossing film in the Fast & Furious franchise, doing so only in ten days (the previous record which was held by Fast & Furious 6 took fifteen weeks to reach its entire lifetime gross of $238.67 million).[121][123] It also set the record for the biggest second-weekend April gross.[124] It topped the box office for four consecutive weekends,[125] becoming the first film to top the box office for four consecutive weekends since The Hunger Games in March 2012 and one of only 29 films since 1985 to have had four straight box office wins during their theatrical runs, although this highly depends on many factors, including the release time and the competition around.[126][127] It ended its theatrical run on July 24, 2015, playing in theaters for a total of 112 days[3] and became the thirty-first highest-grossing film of all time,[128] the fifth highest-grossing film of 2015,[129] the highest-grossing film in The Fast and the Furious franchise,[130] the second highest-grossing Universal film of 2015 (behind Jurassic World),[131] and the fifth highest-grossing film distributed by Universal.[131]
