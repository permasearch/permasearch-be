The Patriots defeated the Colts 45-7 in the AFC Championship Game at Gillette Stadium on January 18, 2015 following Indianapolis playoff wins over Cincinnati and Denver and New England's divisional round win over Baltimore.[24] With the victory the Patriots moved on to defeat the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLIX to win their fourth championship.[25] New England's victory has been controversial, as the Patriots were alleged to have deliberately or negligently underinflated footballs used in the game, which has been dubbed "Deflategate". The controversy was addressed by Bill Belichick in a snap press conference a week before Super Bowl XLIX and took a bizarre turn when Adam Schefter reported a league employee was fired after this game for stealing footballs and illegally selling them.
