In response, Rajiv Laxman (creative director of the show) said: ‘I firmly disagree with these allegations. We have strict rules that prevent the mingling of the crew with the cast. Swagata was the first contestant to be eliminated and didn’t even spend a night at the villa. She doesn’t have any linking of the way things work there.’
