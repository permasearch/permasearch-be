As a clan-based society, genealogy was all important.[44] Ireland 'was justly styled a "Nation of Annalists"'.[63] The various branches of Irish learning—including law, poetry, history and genealogy, and medicine—were associated with hereditary learned families.[64] The poetic families included the Uí Dhálaigh (Daly) and the MacGrath.[44] Irish physicians, such as the O'Briens in Munster or the MacCailim Mor in the Western Isles, were renowned in the courts of England, Spain, Portugal and the Low Countries.[62] Learning was not exclusive to the hereditary learned families, however; one such example is Cathal Mac Manus, the 15th century diocesan priest who wrote the Annals of Ulster.[64] Other learned families included the Mic Aodhagáin and Clann Fhir Bhisigh.[64] It was this latter family which produced Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh, the 17th century genealogist and compiler of the Leabhar na nGenealach.
