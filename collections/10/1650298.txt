Bobby, Zack, and Brandy are later confronted by a staff member from another house accusing them of filming inside a prohibited establishment, although they had turned their cameras off; Jeff, going to the woods to urinate, is confronted and chased by a man dressed in a bunny costume brandishing an axe, though the man turns out to be an actor. Zack also meets other guests who inform him that they experienced Blue Skeleton, and that it is in Louisiana that year; they also tell him of a bar where they can find a man who can take them to Blue Skeleton.
