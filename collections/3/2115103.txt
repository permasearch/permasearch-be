Most rare diseases are genetic and thus are present throughout the person's entire life, even if symptoms do not immediately appear. Many rare diseases appear early in life, and about 30% of children with rare diseases will die before reaching their fifth birthday.[1] With a single diagnosed patient only, ribose-5-phosphate isomerase deficiency is considered the rarest known genetic disease.
