The term "delayed grief" is also used to describe a pattern in which symptoms of distress, seeking, yearning (etc.), are occurring at a much later time period than is typical.[2] Delayed grief refers to any reaction that occurs later than usual, as a delayed onset of symptoms.[3] Contrast to the term "complicated grief" [3] as meaning a form of grieving that spans years (see full description at: Grief).
