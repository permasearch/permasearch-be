In 1879, Wilson attended the University of Virginia School of Law for one year; he was involved in the Virginia Glee Club and was president of the Jefferson Literary and Debating Society.[16] While there, he enjoyed frequent trips to his birthplace of Staunton. He visited with cousins, and fell in love with one, Hattie Woodrow, though his affections were unrequited.[17]
