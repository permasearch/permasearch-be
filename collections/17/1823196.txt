For better or worse, people are guided to Wikipedia when searching the Web for biomedical information.[2] So there is an increasing need for the scientific community to engage with Wikipedia to ensure that the information it contains is accurate and current. For scientists, contributing to Wikipedia is an excellent way of fulfilling public engagement responsibilities and sharing expertise. For example, some Wikipedian scientists have successfully integrated biological data with Wikipedia to promote community annotation.[3][4] This, in turn, encourages wider access to the linked data via Wikipedia. Others have used the wiki model to develop their own specialist, collaborative databases.[5][6][7][8] Taking your first steps into Wikipedia can be daunting, but here we provide some tips that should make the editing process go smoothly.
