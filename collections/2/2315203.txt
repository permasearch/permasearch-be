In the 17th century, European mathematicians Isaac Barrow, Ren√© Descartes, Pierre de Fermat, Blaise Pascal, John Wallis and others discussed the idea of a derivative. In particular, in Methodus ad disquirendam maximam et minima and in De tangentibus linearum curvarum, Fermat developed an adequality method for determining maxima, minima, and tangents to various curves that was closely related to differentiation.[13] Isaac Newton would later write that his own early ideas about calculus came directly from "Fermat's way of drawing tangents."[14]
