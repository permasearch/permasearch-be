Valack first appears in Season 4 "A Promise to the Dead" in his cell reading a romance novel. He is visited by Alan who introduces himself. Valack lets Alan know he's aware Alan's specialty is not actually "cats and dogs". Alan asks for information on Valack's knowledge of South American lore. Valack corrects Alan he wants to know about Kate Argent, about "La Loba" or "the Bone Woman". Alan wishes to know what Kate had done to Derek (regressing Derek back to his teenage self), the subsequent loss of his powers asking if Derek could be dying. Valack tells Deaton he'll have to move closer. Deaton reluctantly complies. Valack displays his third eye; it opens up and Alan receives a vision of La Iglesia, but is rendered unconscious. In "Smoke and Mirrors", after his plan to have Scott killed fails, Peter Hale is incarcerated for his crimes, and he is placed in Valack's cell. After Peter swears he'll escape, Valack humors the werewolf due to the mountain ash all around them. Peter demands to know who he is. Valack replies he could tell Peter, but that it will be easier to just "show (him)" and removes his bandage, revealing him his third eye. Peter screams in horror, slamming against the Plexiglas. Valack smirks.
