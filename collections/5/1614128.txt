Dolphins lead 53–50 as of the end of the 2016 season, but the Patriots lead the all-time playoff series 2–1.[citation needed] The rivalry briefly heated up during 2008 when the Dolphins became the first team other than the Patriots to win the AFC East since 2002. Recently the Patriots have had the upper hand, and since then have dominated the East.
