The first months of 2008 was a particularly troublesome period which caused Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke to "work holidays and weekends" and which did an "extraordinary series of moves".[56] It bolstered U.S. banks and allowed Wall Street firms to borrow "directly from the Fed".[56] These efforts were highly controversial at the time, but from the perspective of 2010, it appeared the Federal exertions had been the right decisions. By 2010, Wall Street firms, in Clark's view, were "getting back to their old selves as engine rooms of wealth, prosperity and excess".[55] A report by Michael Stoler in The New York Sun described a "phoenix-like resurrection" of the area, with residential, commercial, retail and hotels booming in the "third largest business district in the country".[57] At the same time, the investment community was worried about proposed legal reforms, including the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act which dealt with matters such as credit card rates and lending requirements.[58] The NYSE closed two of its trading floors in a move towards transforming itself into an electronic exchange.[24] Beginning in September 2011, demonstrators disenchanted with the financial system protested in parks and plazas around Wall Street.[59]
