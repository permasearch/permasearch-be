Including the guest stars from the season thirteen finale, "Rhodium Nights", Paget Brewster was first cast in the season premiere openers as Bureau Chief ADA Paula Foster, who is the prosecutor on the murder case against Cragen. Brewster hires the SVU squad's interim captain, Steven Harris, portrayed by Adam Baldwin.[5][6] Sue Simmons plays herself in this episode. Leight said, "It’s a big scandal within the world we’ve created, there’s a dead hooker in the captain’s bed, and we go to a newscaster to help us understand the story," said show runner/executive producer Warren Leight, "Sue opens the episode doing a news standup from outside 1 Police Plaza. We’ll bring her back for the second episode of the two-parter."[7]
