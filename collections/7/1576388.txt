In August 2013, Beasts of Bourbon played a series of shows in Sydney and Melbourne to celebrate their first 30 years.[18] The three shows in each city featured alternate lineups for each night with James Baker and Tony Pola sharing drumming, Boris Sujdovic and Brian Hooper swapping as bass player and Kim Salmon and Charlie Owen rotating on guitar. As it has been for the history of the band, Jones and Perkins are the only persistent members. A triple live album 30 Years On Borrowed Time was released to coincide with the live shows.
