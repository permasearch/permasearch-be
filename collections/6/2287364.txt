Officially known as the Southwest Airlines Orlando Pro Summer League for sponsorship reasons, this 25-game, week-long event will feature ten teams. Each team will play five games over the course of the week, with a championship day being played on the final day of the league. A point system will establish the standings leading up to the final day, with eight points awarded each game based on: four points for winning the game and one point for winning a quarter (in the event of a tied quarter, each team will receive 0.5 points). In the event of ties in seeding heading into championship day, three tiebreakers will be in place: 1) total point differential; 2) total points allowed; 3) coin flip.[2]
