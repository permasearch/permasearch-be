Provinces[xiv] are groups of municipalities and recognized by the constitution. Their competences and institutions of government vary greatly among communities. In all communities which have more than one province, provinces are governed by "provincial deputations" or "provincial councils",[xv] with a limited scope of administrative competences.[46]
