As the sun rises, Carlitos is still sleeping on the park bench, Enrique leaves to buy food and Carlitos is spotted by the police. Carlitos is questioned by the police and almost caught, but Enrique throws a cup of coffee at the officers, provoking the officers to chase him instead, yelling at Carlitos to run. Carlitos manages to escape, but Enrique is caught and handcuffed. After running for a bit Carlitos finds himself in a familiar place that matches all of his mother's descriptions and sees her across the street waiting at a payphone. Carlitos calls out to her and she is overjoyed to see that he is unharmed. There are too many cars for Carlitos to cross against the light, so the two anxiously wait on either side of the street. The movie ends with the 'walk' sign between the two turning on.
