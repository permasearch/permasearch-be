Hedge funds share many of the same types of risk as other investment classes, including liquidity risk and manager risk.[87] Liquidity refers to the degree to which an asset can be bought and sold or converted to cash; similar to private equity funds, hedge funds employ a lock-up period during which an investor cannot remove money.[65][90] Manager risk refers to those risks which arise from the management of funds. As well as specific risks such as style drift, which refers to a fund manager "drifting" away from an area of specific expertise, manager risk factors include valuation risk, capacity risk, concentration risk and leverage risk.[86] Valuation risk refers to the concern that the net asset value of investments may be inaccurate;[91] capacity risk can arise from placing too much money into one particular strategy, which may lead to fund performance deterioration;[92] and concentration risk may arise if a fund has too much exposure to a particular investment, sector, trading strategy, or group of correlated funds.[93] These risks may be managed through defined controls over conflict of interest,[91] restrictions on allocation of funds,[92] and set exposure limits for strategies.[93]
