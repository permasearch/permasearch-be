On 8 March 1869, Berlioz died at his Paris home, No.4 rue de Calais, at 30 minutes past midday.[68] He was surrounded by friends at the time. His funeral was held at the recently completed Église de la Trinité[69] on 11 March, and he was buried in Montmartre Cemetery with his two wives, who were exhumed and re-buried next to him. His last words were reputed to be "Enfin, on va jouer ma musique"[48][70][71] ("At last, they are going to play my music").[72]
