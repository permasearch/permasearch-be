Between the 8th and 7th centuries BC, the Phoenicians (and later the Carthaginians) established trading contacts in the southern part of the Iberian Peninsula as well as in part of the east coast. Their trading posts on the coast exported minerals and other resources of pre-Roman Iberia and imported manufactures from the Eastern Mediterranean.
