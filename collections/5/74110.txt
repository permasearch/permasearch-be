Around the turn of the century an organization named Fair Trade[48] emerged. In the past 20 years Fair trade coffee has become very popular. The idea of fair trade is to pay the farmers more money, so the farmers can have better lives. Most fair Trade's farmers come from Latin America. There is controversy about the effectiveness of Fair Trade. The proponents argue that Fair Trade helps the farmer receive a larger salary which allows them to live better lives.[49][unreliable source?] Opponents argue that Fair Trade does not keep records and therefore cannot be accountable.[50]
