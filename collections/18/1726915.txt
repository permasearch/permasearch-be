During the year 1841, in Khuzestan, Iran, Austen Henry Layard, accompanied by hunters from Luristan, saw a lion which "had done much damage in the plain of Ram Hormuz," before one of his companions killed it. He described it as being "unusually large and of very dark brown colour," with some parts of it body being almost black.[39]
