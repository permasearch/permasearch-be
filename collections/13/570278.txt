In 1971. the top-rate of income tax on earned income was cut to 75 percent. A surcharge of 15 percent on investment income kept the top rate on that income at 90 percent. In 1974 this cut was partly reversed, and the top rate on earned income raised to 83 percent. With the investment income surcharge this raised the top rate on investment income to 98 percent, the highest permanent rate since the war. This applied to incomes over £20,000 (equivalent to £191,279 in 2016 terms),[3]. In 1974, as many as 750,000 people were liable to pay the top-rate of income tax.[8] Margaret Thatcher, who favoured indirect taxation, reduced personal income tax rates during the 1980s.[9] In the first budget after her election victory in 1979, the top rate was reduced from 83percent to 60 percent and the basic rate from 33 percent to 30 percent.[10] The basic rate was also cut for three successive budgets, to 29 percent in the 1986 budget, 27 percent in 1987 and to 25 percent in 1988.[11] The top rate of income tax was cut to 40 percent in the 1988 budget.The investment income surcharge was abolished in 1985.
