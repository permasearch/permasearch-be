James Hunter of Rolling Stone praised the album for its "finely worked-out chunks of serious gun-metal rockcraft that depend on the San Francisco band's restless, edgy electric guitars" and concluded that the album was a rarity in the way it "works best as either background rock or intimate headphone material."[31] Elysa Gardner of Entertainment Weekly noted Jenkins' lyrics and vocal delivery and Cadogan's guitar-work as standout elements of the album.[29]
