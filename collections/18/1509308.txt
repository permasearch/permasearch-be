The flag is seen on many ships around the world as Liberia offers registration under its flag. Shipping companies do this to avoid taxes and restrictions that other countries enforce. As the second most popular flag of convenience (after the Republic of Panama), it is estimated that 1,700 foreign-owned ships fly the Liberian flag.[4] This brings in much of the country's revenue.[5]
