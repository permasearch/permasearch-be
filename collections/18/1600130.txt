A person from Michigan is called a Michigander or Michiganian;[70] also at times, but rarely, a "Michiganite".[71] Residents of the Upper Peninsula are sometimes referred to as "Yoopers" (a phonetic pronunciation of "U.P.ers"), and Upper Peninsula residents sometimes refer to those from the Lower Peninsula as "trolls" because they live below the bridge.[72]
