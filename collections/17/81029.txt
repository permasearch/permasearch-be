Topanga Lawrence-Matthews (Danielle Fishel) is Cory's main love interest. Her character underwent dramatic changes during the course of the series. When she was initially introduced in the first season, first as a guest character and later recurring, she was a hippie vegetarian and somewhat of an outcast, sitting at the table with the other "weird kids". Even her name was taken from a hippie hangout, Topanga. California. However, once the characters entered high school (and Danielle Fishel became a main character), she became more of a "regular teenage girl", and her beliefs about the environment and other topics were less emphasized. Much was now made of the fact that Topanga was the most attractive and the most popular girl at school, and academically successful. She also cut her trademark long hair in an episode in season 4 while trying to show Cory that true beauty is on the inside. She grows distant from her parents, whom she once was very close to; by the fourth season. In A Long Walk To Pittsburgh Part 1, her parents force her to move to Pittsburgh; but in part 2, she runs away from them back to Philadelphia to be with Cory. Her relationship with her parents became further apart after their divorce.
