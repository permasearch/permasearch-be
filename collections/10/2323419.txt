In the 1960s, Cathedral Latin High School was the only Catholic high school in Raleigh, and was not large enough to accommodate the growing population of Catholics. Bishop Waters built a new high school, Cardinal Gibbons High School, on a portion of the former Nazareth Orphanage site. The school was moved in the late 1990s to its current location after a request was made by Bishop F. Joseph Gossman.
