The primary slogan of the Trump campaign, extensively used on campaign merchandise, is Make America Great Again. The red baseball cap with the slogan emblazoned on the front became a symbol of the campaign, and is frequently donned by Trump and his supporters.[332] The hats were so important to the campaign that it spent more money to make them than on polling, consultants, or television advertisements.[333]
