Opening up economic opportunities for minorities and the poor was a focus of Rangel's during the 1990s.[41] His 1993 legislation created "empowerment zones", which provided tax incentives for investment and job creation in inner urban areas;[41] it would eventually account for $5 billion in federal spending across the nation's cities.[53][69] Rangel played a specific role in the creation of the 1995 Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone Development Corporation, which led to a $500 million spending of public and private monies towards changing the face of Harlem, including gentrification effects.[54] Rangel served on the corporation's board, and the effort was credited with helping the resurgence of Harlem that took place during the 1990s.[52][69]
