Jerry Ordway's 1990s The Power of Shazam! series also gave Billy the added ability to alter Captain Marvel's appearance to his will by visualizing alterations and then saying "Shazam!"[125] Billy uses this ability to disguise himself as his "uncle" to work and cash checks,[126] and to turn his Captain Marvel costume into a spacesuit for a mission in space.[127] In the late 2000s, when Billy replaced the wizard and took on a white costume and the name of "Marvel", he commanded the various magical abilities once owned by the wizard. However, he was required to remain on the Rock of Eternity and could only be away from it for 24 hours at a time.[128]
