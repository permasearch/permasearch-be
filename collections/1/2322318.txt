At launch, Texas Instruments listed the TI-Nspire CX at $165 and the CX CAS at $175 on their US online store.[4] The CX series were released in the same time frame as the Casio Prizm (fx-CG10/20),[5] Casio's color screen graphing calculator with similar features, priced at $130. The TI-Nspire CX series differ from all previous TI graphing calculator models in that the CX series are the first to use a rechargeable 1060 mAh Lithium-Ion battery (upgraded to 1200 mAh in 2013 rev.). Retail packages include an AC adapter for charging the battery; however, the device can also be charged via a PC USB connection. TI claims that the battery requires four hours to charge, that a full charge powers the device for up to two weeks under normal daily use, and that the battery should last up to 3 years before it requires replacement. The battery is user-replaceable and can be purchased via the TI education online store for $15 in the United States.[3]
