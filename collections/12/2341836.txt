Jeff Passan of Yahoo! Sports reported in January 2016 that Sandoval had switched agents and was now represented by Rick Thurman and Rafa Nieves of Beverly Hills Sports Council.[61] Looking to improve upon his first season in Boston, an overweight Sandoval struggled in spring training, and was replaced by Travis Shaw as the starting third baseman.[62] On April 13, 2016, Sandoval was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a shoulder strain.[63] On May 3, 2016, Sandoval underwent surgery on his left shoulder, sidelining him for the remainder of the season. On September 24, manager John Farrell told reporters that Sandoval was progressing ahead of schedule in his rehab, and could be an option for the Red Sox in the postseason should a need arise, as the team did acquire Aaron Hill during the season to help with third base depth.[64] Sandoval also made an effort at improving his fitness, losing 15 pounds by August while working at the Red Sox facility in Fort Myers.[65] Due to the injury Sandoval ended his 2016 season with six at bats.[66]
