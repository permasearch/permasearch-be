In South America, C. dirus specimens dated to the Late Pleistocene were found along the north and west coasts, but none have been found in Argentina, an area that was inhabited by Canis gezi and Canis nehringi.[20]:148 One study found that C. dirus was the most evolutionarily derived Canis species in the New World, and compared to C. nehringi was larger in the size and construction of its lower molars for more efficient predation.[23]:113 For this reason, some researchers have proposed that C. dirus may have originated in South America.[15]:116[17][24] In 2009 a proposal was made that C. armbrusteri was the common ancestor for both the North and South American wolves.[20]:148 The following year, a study yielded evidence that led to the conclusion that C. dirus and C. nehringi were the same species and thus that C. dirus had migrated from North America into South America, making it a late participant in the Great American Interchange.[30]:472
