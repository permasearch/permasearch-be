Monica Keena has praised the depth of her character, claiming "I think Lori's a very independent and tough character. She has an arc in the film because she learns that Freddy killed her mother and that inspires her to have a need to get revenge. She's the real hero of the story."[60] Jeff Katz, who worked on the original screenplay for Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash, explains that Lori and Will's deaths were a way to continue the long-running tradition of Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street survivors being killed off in subsequent films.[15]
