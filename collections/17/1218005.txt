Early in the morning of 2 July, some members of the party were forced to use a bear banger to scare away a wolf that wouldn't leave the campsite. At about 2am, a wolf began dragging Langevin, who had been asleep in the open in a sleeping bag. The wolf had moved him several meters away from the campfire when he awoke, sat up, and shouted. The wolf stopped, stepped back, and attacked at the midsection, still encased in the sleeping bag. Langevin fought it with his hands and arms, and rolled back towards the fire pit. The wolf bit him on the back and head, leaving multiple lacerations and separating a part of his scalp from the skull before being chased away by a group of other campers. The attack lasted about five minutes.The man was transported to hospital in Victoria, where his scalp flap was reattached with 50 stitches, and wounds to his hands and back were treated. The two adult wolves were killed the next day, tested negative for rabies. The same wolves had earlier menaced several nature photographers. The stomach contents showed no sign of scavenging human food.
