In the early 19th century an "exceedingly low" cost steamboat service used to run between Stirling and Newhaven or Granton.[75] The coming of the railways in 1848 started the decline of the river traffic,[76] not least because the Alloa Swing Bridge downstream restricted access for shipping. The railways did provide opportunity too with one Riverside company selling their reaping machines as far afield as Syria and Australia. Similarly, in 1861, a company making baby carriages was set up. These prams were exported to Canada, South America, India and South Africa.[77]
