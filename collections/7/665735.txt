Hedge funds are made available only to certain sophisticated or accredited investors and cannot be offered or sold to the general public.[1] As such, they generally avoid direct regulatory oversight, bypass licensing requirements applicable to investment companies, and operate with greater flexibility than mutual funds and other investment funds.[6] However, following the financial crisis of 2007â€“2008, regulations were passed in the United States and Europe with intentions to increase government oversight of hedge funds and eliminate certain regulatory gaps.[7]
