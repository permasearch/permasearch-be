The band performed the song live for the first time during the show Later... with Jools Holland on 1 November 2011.[50] Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone praised the performance saying: "Florence Welch is backed by her full band plus a string section, but as overwhelming as the sound gets, her incredible voice remains the focal point of the performance."[51] Later, on 20 November 2011, they performed the song on Saturday Night Live.[52][53][54] On 14 January, the band performed the song on The Jonathan Ross Show.[55] The performance aired on ITV and its regional counterparts at 9:30 pm on 14 January 2012. Nick Neyland of Prefix Magazine praised the performance saying, "Here, Florence delivers an efficient version of the track, via an extremely stoic performance in which she appears clad all in black and barely moves for the duration. The lavish musical backing and her impressive pipes do that talking here, creating the kind of anthemic feel that fast became her M.O. from day one."[56]
