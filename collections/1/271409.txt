Lee met fashion model and actress Ceren Alkaç at a concert while on vacation in Britain.[when?] Alkaç was born in İzmir, and emigrated with her family from Turkey to Australia soon afterward.[46] Following their initial meeting, the pair stayed in touch via email and texts, with Alkaç subsequently moving to the United States and starting a relationship with Lee.[47] The couple married in California in July 2008; a month later, Alkac gave birth to a daughter named Casper.[45][48][49] The couple had their second child, a son named Sonny, in 2012.[50] In 2017, the couple welcomed their third child, a daughter named Alberta 'Birdy' Lee.[51] Their separation was rumored in December 2015, again allegedly due to Lee's strong attachment to Scientology.[52] This was later proven to be false.[53] As of 2016, Lee no longer practices Scientology.[54][55]
