In 2003, an inspection programme was launched (costing £1.2 million) to assess the condition of the main suspension cables after corrosion was discovered in a number of older bridges in the United States of a similar design and size. The study was completed two years later and reported that the main cables had suffered an 8–10% loss of strength. Future projections highlighted the likelihood of this accelerating, with traffic restrictions to limit loading required in 2014 in the worst-case scenario, followed by full closure by 2020.[21]
