On the Island, Dogen (Hiroyuki Sanada) tells Jack that Claire has been consumed by the same "infection" that threatens Sayid.  At about the same time, Jin is attacked by men from the temple, and then rescued by Claire, who has adapted to an existence on the Island like Rousseau's. She tells Jin about a friend she now has on the island, the fake John Locke â€” of whose falsity she is aware. Claire reveals that she's been searching for Aaron and believes the people in the Temple have him. Observing Claire's erratic behavior, Jin decides not to convince her otherwise. She therefore plans to invade the temple to find her son.[25][26]
