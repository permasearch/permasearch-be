Other brain stimulation techniques used to treat depression include electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES). Deep brain stimulation is currently under study as a treatment for depression. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is under study as a therapy for both depression and epilepsy.[40] Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation (TNS) is being researched at UCLA as a treatment for epilepsy.[41]
