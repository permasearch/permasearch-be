The structure of Chicago Public Schools was redefined after Mayor Richard M. Daley convinced the Illinois General Assembly to place CPS under the mayor's control. Illinois school districts are generally governed by locally elected school boards, where each district board hires a superintendent, who in turn hires administrators such as principals, who then must be approved by the school board. In contrast, CPS is headed by a Chief Executive Officer and school board appointed by the mayor. CPS is headquartered in the 42 West Madison building in the Chicago Loop, formerly headquartered in the 125 South Clark Street building from 1998 until November 2014.[48] The district has offices in Bridgeport, Colman, and Garfield Park.[49][50] The 20 story building, managed by MB Real Estate, and originally built as the Commercial National Bank,[51] has 570,910 square feet (53,039Â m2) of space.[52]
