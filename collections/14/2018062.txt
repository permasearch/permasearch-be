Tequila comes in an abundant array of colors that ranges from a simple clear distilled beverage to a dark amber brown. The color of the tequila varies greatly on the aging process and the type of wood used for storage.[30] The white version of tequila, known as silver tequila or blanco, is the product obtained without or very little additional aging process. As well, the spirit must contain between 38-55% alcohol content, which is fermented from a wort, which contains no less than 51% sugars from the agave plant.[30] Consuming silver tequila provides for the purest form as little aging has occurred. What is known as gold, joven or oro tequila is usually silver tequila with the addition of grain alcohols and caramel color,[30] however, some higher end gold tequilas may be a blend of silver and reposado. Rested (reposado) or aged tequila (aÃ±ejo) are aged in wooden containers.[30] The aging process can last between two months and three years and can create or enhance flavors and aromas. The aging process generally imparts a golden color.[30]
