The Mongol Empire conquered Persia in 1230; Chormaqan became military governor. There were then no hostilities with the Seljuk Turks. 'Ala al-Din Kayqubad I and his immediate successor Giyath al-Din Kaykhusraw II swore an oath of vassalage with the payment of at least token tribute to the Great Khan Ã–gedei.[10][11] However, in 1238 the Mongols raided part of Greater Armenia, which was a vassal of the Sultan of Rum.
