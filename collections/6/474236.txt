It is no coincidence that Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. was founded in the year 1913. That year was a pivotal year for issues regarding race and equality in the United States. In January of that year, African-Americans celebrated the 50 year anniversary of the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation. And in February of the same year, Rosa McCauley (later Rosa Parks) the "Mother of the Civil rights movement" was born in Tuskegee, Alabama. In March 1913, the Women's suffrage march occurred, and the United States lost one of the most prolific freedom fighters the country has ever seen, when Harriet Tubman died in New York. In May, Samuel Owensby, a Black man in Hogansville, Georgia was lynched near the local jail, after which his body was riddled with bullets. The nation's justice system condoned lynching in both southern and northern parts of the country. This violence was so entrenched in the United States that one report called the record of lynchings that year a "small number" based on a 13% decrease from the year prior.[108]
