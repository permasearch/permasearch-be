Novichok (Russian: Новичо́к, "newcomer") is a series of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union and Russia between 1971 and 1993.[a][2][3] Russian scientists who developed the agents claim they are the deadliest nerve agents ever made, with some variants possibly five to eight times more potent than VX,[4][5] and others up to ten times more potent than soman.[6]
