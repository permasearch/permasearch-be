While the Third Supply was stranded in Bermuda, the colony at Jamestown was in even worse shape. In the "Starving Time" of 1609â€“1610, the Jamestown settlers faced rampant starvation for want of additional provisions. During this time, lack of food drove people to eat snakes and even boil the leather from shoes for sustenance.[36] Only 60 of the original 214 settlers at Jamestown survived.[33] There is scientific evidence that the settlers at Jamestown had turned to cannibalism during the starving time.[37][38][39]
