Multidimensional big data can also be represented as tensors, which can be more efficiently handled by tensor-based computation,[55] such as multilinear subspace learning.[56] Additional technologies being applied to big data include massively parallel-processing (MPP) databases, search-based applications, data mining,[57] distributed file systems, distributed databases, cloud and  HPC-based infrastructure (applications, storage and computing resources)[58] and the Internet.[citation needed] Although, many approaches and technologies have been developed, it still remains difficult to carry out machine learning with big data.[59]
