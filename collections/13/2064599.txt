The frequency rate of Addison's disease in the human population is sometimes estimated at roughly one in 100,000.[25] Some put the number closer to 40–144 cases per million population (1/25,000–1/7,000).[1][26] Addison's can affect persons of any age, sex, or ethnicity, but it typically presents in adults between 30 and 50 years of age.[27] Research has shown no significant predispositions based on ethnicity.[26]
