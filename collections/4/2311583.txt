The third-generation Sebring borrowed many styling cues from the 2003 Chrysler Airflite concept. It also has several Chrysler-signature styling cues, several of which were borrowed from the Chrysler Crossfire. The Sebring sedan and convertible were also sold in right-hand drive through Chrysler's UK and Ireland dealer network.
