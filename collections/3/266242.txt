One explanation as to Kramer's personality and traits, with respect to his mysterious childhood and background, is hinted in "The Chicken Roaster". After a series of conflicts, Jerry is forced to live in Kramer's apartment and vice versa, which quickly has an effect on both characters. Jerry, bothered endlessly by the many oddities and idiosyncrasies associated with Kramer's home (as an example, the apartment creaks "like the hull of a ship" at night), quickly begins behaving like his wacky friend. Conversely, when Kramer begins living in Jerry's regular, normal apartment, he quickly and briefly becomes more like his calm, quick-witted friend. The clear implication is that Kramer is radically and negatively influenced by his living environment but has grown so used to it that he does not even realize the impact it has on him.
