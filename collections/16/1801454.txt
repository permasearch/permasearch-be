In 1975 Peru became the first country to recognize Quechua as one of its official languages.[13] Ecuador conferred official status on the language in its 2006 constitution, and in 2009, Bolivia adopted a new constitution that recognized Quechua and several other indigenous languages as official languages of the country.[14]
