In mathematical terms, if the demand function is f(P), then the inverse demand function is fâˆ’1(Q), whose value is the highest price that could be charged and still generate the quantity demanded Q.[2] This is to say that the inverse demand function is the demand function with the axes switched. This is useful because economists typically place price (P) on the vertical axis and quantity (Q) on the horizontal axis.
