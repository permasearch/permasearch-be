Before 1879, the Royal Marines had no warrant officers:[22] by the end of 1881, the Royal Marines had given warrant rank to their sergeant-majors and some other senior non-commissioned officers, in a similar fashion to the army.[23] When the army introduced the ranks of warrant officer class I and class II in 1915, the Royal Marines did the same shortly after.[24] From February 1920, Royal Marines warrant officers class I were given the same status as Royal Navy warrant officers and the rank of warrant officer class II was abolished in the Royal Marines, with no further promotions to this rank.[25]
