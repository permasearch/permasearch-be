A fluid flowing over the surface of a body exerts a force on it. It makes no difference whether the fluid is flowing past a stationary body or the body is moving through a stationary volume of fluid. Lift is the component of this force that is perpendicular to the oncoming flow direction.[2] Lift is always accompanied by a drag force, which is the component of the surface force parallel to the flow direction.
