This is a list of released video games for the Wii video game consoles which allow use of Classic Controller/Classic Controller Pro and/or GameCube controller. This list does not include games released on Nintendo's Virtual Console as the Classic Controller and GameCube controller can also be used for all Virtual Console games, with the exception of some TurboGrafx-16 games.[citation needed] Many of the games on this list are ports of prior generation games or games that were concurrently released on other consoles with traditional control schemes such as PlayStation 2, 3, and 4 and the Xbox 360 and One.
