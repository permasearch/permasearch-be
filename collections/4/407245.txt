Lyme and other deer tick-borne diseases can sometimes be reduced by greatly reducing the deer population on which the adult ticks depend for feeding and reproduction. Lyme disease cases fell following deer eradication on an island, Monhegan, Maine[116] and following deer control in Mumford Cove, Connecticut.[117] It is worth noting that eliminating deer may lead to a temporary increase in tick density.[118]
