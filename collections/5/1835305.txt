Garza, still hiding out west of the Pecos River in Crow Town, soon meets another notorious denizenâ€”the legendary Texas gunfighter, John Wesley Hardin. After Maria arrives to warn him, she kills the town's "devil pig" and later butchers it after Joey disappears and steals her horse. She then sets off back home, but not after inviting the town's whores to accompany her on the walk back. Mox Mox and his gang soon arrive in Crow Town looking for Garza, seeking him for the payrolls he stole and denied them, and leave after a tense stand-off with Hardin.
