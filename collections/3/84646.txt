Biogenic ACP has been found in the inner ear of embryonic sharks, mammalian milk and dental enamel. However whilst the unequivocal presence of ACP in bones and teeth is the subject of debate, there is evidence that transient amorphous precursors are involved in the development of bone and teeth.[3] The ACP in bovine milk is believed to involve calcium phosphate nanoclusters covered in a shell of casein phosphopeptides. A typical casein micelle of radius 100 nm contains around 10,000 casein molecules and 800 nanoclusters of ACP each of an approximate diameter of 4.8 nm. The concentration of calcium phosphate is higher in milk than in serum but it rarely forms deposits of insoluble phosphates.[5] Unfolded phosphopeptides are believed to sequester ACP nanoclusters,[6] and form stable complexes in other biofluids such as urine and blood serum, thus preventing deposition of insoluble calcium phosphates and calcification of soft tissue. In the laboratory, stored samples of formulations of artificial blood, serum, urine and milk (which approximate the pH of the naturally occurring fluid) deposit insoluble phosphates. The addition of suitable phosphopeptides prevents precipitation.[5]
