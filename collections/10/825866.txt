Dalton aimed to emulate Meryl Streep's character in The Devil Wears Prada, who never spoke above "a conversational level...She didn't pound on her chest and make sure everybody knew that she's powerful, she just was."[43] Dalton also changed his voice to represent the memories of Will Daniels and Nathaniel Malick "just a little bit. I tried to change my voice in there, I tried to change even my level of expression in there because I was supposed to be channeling somebody else entirely coming through."[44][45] Dalton called the coat that Hive wears later in the third season "iconic and timeless", noting that "fashion wasn't on the forefront of [Ward's] mind", while Hive is more theatrical, "colorful without having to do much."[43]
