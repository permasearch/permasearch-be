Officers switched to regular rank titles in 2006 (having previously used distinct titles such as "Section Officer" and "Divisional Officer"), and to regular rank insignia in 2013. The CLSC is led by the Chief Officer (currently Special Commander James Phipson), three Special Superintendents, two Special Chief Inspectors, five Special Inspectors and a number of Special Sergeants. The previous Chief Officer, Special Commander Ian Miller, MBE, remains a warranted officer but on secondment to the College of Policing.
