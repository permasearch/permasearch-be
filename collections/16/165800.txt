Processes play a crucial role in development. Proximal processes are fundamental to the theory. They constitute the engines of development because it is by engaging in activities and interactions that individuals come to make sense of their world, understand their place in it, and both play their part in changing the prevailing order while fitting into the existing one.[23] The nature of proximal processes varies according to aspects of the individual and of the contextâ€”both spatially and temporally.[22] As explained in the second of the two central propositions, the social continuities and changes occur overtime through the life course and the historical period during which the person lives.[22] Effects of proximal processes are thus more powerful than those of the environmental contexts in which they occur.
