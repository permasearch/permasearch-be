The Polar Medal (French: Médaille polaire) and Sovereign's Medal for Volunteers (French: Médaille du souverain pour les bénévoles) were both created by Queen Elizabeth II in 2015, incorporating and replacing the Governor General's Northern Medal (established by Governor General Adrienne Clarkson in 2005) and the Governor General's Caring Canadian Award (established by Governor General Roméo LeBlanc in 1995), respectively.[84][85] This made them honours of the Crown, permitting them to be incorporated into the Canadian honours system.
