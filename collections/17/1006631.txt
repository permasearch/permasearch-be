On August 28, 1968, around 10,000 protesters gathered in Grant Park for the demonstration. At approximately 3:30Â p.m., a young man lowered the American flag that was there.[11] The police broke through the crowd and began beating the young man, while the crowd pelted the police with food, rocks, and chunks of concrete.[25] The chants of some of the protesters shifted from "hell no, we won't go" to "pigs are whores".[26]
