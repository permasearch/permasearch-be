Mount Meager is part of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt (GVB), the northernmost segment of the Cascade Volcanic Arc. This volcanic belt includes cinder cones, calderas, stratovolcanoes and subglacial volcanoes that have been active in the last 10,000 years.[6][7][8][9] The latest explosive eruption in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt occurred at a crater on the northeastern flank of Mount Meager about 2,400 years ago, which forms a clearly defined depression.[10][11]
