Townshend wanted the Who to stop touring and become a studio act; Entwistle threatened to quit, saying, "I don't intend to get off the roadÂ ... there's not much I can do about it except hope they change their minds."[233] Townshend did not change his mind, and so the Who embarked on a farewell tour of the US and Canada[234] with the Clash as support,[235] ending in Toronto on 17 December 1982.[233]
