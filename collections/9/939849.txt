Since Deadpool is aware that he is a fictional character,[70] he uses this knowledge to his advantage to deal with opponents or gain knowledge to which he should not normally have access, such as reading past issues of his and others' comics.[97] For example, Deadpool knows he has a Wikipedia article and hopes his fans keep his page updated.[98]
