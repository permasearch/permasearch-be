Project Runway: Threads aired directly after the season finale of Project Runway Season 13, premiering on October 23, 2014. Each week of eight three young designers competed for a scholarship to study fashion design in addition to sewing materials and equipment. The host was Vanessa Simmons. The judges were Christian Siriano (Project Runway Season 4 winner), Seventeen magazine Fashion Director Gina Kelly and Accessories Editor Jasmine Snow, and Ingrid Nilsen who is a video blogger on YouTube. Since each week there are three new competitors, there is no one winner, but rather eight spread across the eight episodes.
