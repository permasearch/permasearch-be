The Rocky Mountain elk subspecies has been reintroduced by hunter-conservation organizations in the Appalachian region of the eastern U.S., where the now extinct eastern elk once lived[64] After elk were reintroduced in the states of Kentucky, North Carolina and Tennessee, they migrated into the neighboring states of Virginia and West Virginia, and have established permanent populations there.[65] In 2017, a male elk, likely from the Smoky Mountains population, was sighted in South Carolina for the first time in nearly 300 years.[66] Elk have also been reintroduced to a number of other states, including Pennsylvania,[67][68] Michigan, Wisconsin, Missouri [69] and Etolin and Afognak Islands in Alaska.[70] Reintroduction of the elk into Ontario began in the early 20th century, and is still ongoing due to the limited success.[71] As of 1989, population figures for the Rocky Mountain subspecies were 782,500, and estimated numbers for all North American subspecies exceeded 1 million.[72] Prior to the European colonization of North America, there were an estimated 10 million elk on the continent.[23]
