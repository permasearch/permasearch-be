In April 2005, the band played a number of shows as the Past-Present-Future tour â€“ announced as their last for at least two years. The band released an EP entitled God Save the Manics with only a limited number of copies available and given out to fans as they arrived at the venue. After all the copies were gone, the band made the EP available as a free download on their website.[69] In September, the band contributed the new track "Leviathan" to the War Child charity album Help!: A Day in the Life.
