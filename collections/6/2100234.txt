There may have been some isolated Australian branches of Keith Miller's British Doctor Who club,[21] and there was at least one small suburban club-ette in Sydney around 1974 (recalled by Kerrie Dougherty),[citation needed] as well as occasional signs of fan activity here and there (e.g. a fan organised film screening in Sydney of Daleks - Invasion Earth 2150 AD in 1975,[citation needed] and an issue of a Tolkien fanzine devoted to Doctor Who, issued as "Macra" in late 1975.[22][citation needed] But before 1976 there was no solid fan organisation.[citation needed] The last three of these strands came together at Sydney University in 1975-76, which led to the formation of a national club in August 1976. Members of the Sydney University Science Fiction Association ("SUSFA"), decided to build a Dalek to enter in a planned Dalek race to be held over Easter 1976 year to race other Daleks at a University Science Fiction Convention "Unicon 2" at Melbourne University over Easter (for photos of these Daleks and others, go to "External Links" below for the site "Daleksdownunder").[citation needed] Although the Melbourne students had built their Dalek in 1975, and Adelaide students also built one, there is no evidence either group went on to form a Doctor Who club. However, after winning this race the SUSFA members were fired up and organised screenings of both Dalek films, and arranged a number of other activities involving the Dalek around campus at Sydney University during 1976.[23]
