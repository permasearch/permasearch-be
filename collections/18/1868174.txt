Initially, the show focuses on the life and arranged marriage of two female cousins (Gopi and Rashi) and their contrasting personalities. Urmila and Jitu adopt Gopi (the latter's niece) after Gopi's parents pass away; she is left illiterate, naive, kind and shy while Rashi, their own daughter, is educated, outgoing, vivacious and cunning. It is the story of how Kokila Modi â€“ the strict, strong-minded mother-in-law of Gopi, transforms the latter into a confident and smarter woman so that she gets accepted by her husband. Rashi tries numerous unsuccessful attempts to create difficulties for Gopi, but in the end both cousins happily get accepted into their families and by their spouses. Kinjal, Kokila's daughter, gets married to Dhaval, Rashi's maternal cousin. Gopi gives birth to a daughter, while Rashi to twin boys. Gopi also succeeds in finding her long-lost parents, who were thought to be dead. The season ends with Gopi's biological sister Radha killing Gopi and Ahem's daughter, Meera, while Gopi gets the blame, and is thrown out of the Modi Bhavan.
