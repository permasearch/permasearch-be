Saturation levels of uric acid in blood may result in one form of kidney stones when the urate crystallizes in the kidney. These uric acid stones are radiolucent and so do not appear on an abdominal plain X-ray.[citation needed] Uric acid crystals can also promote the formation of calcium oxalate stones, acting as "seed crystals".[49]
