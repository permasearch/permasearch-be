A (エー, Ē) is the Fourth Raikage (四代目雷影, Yondaime Raikage). A fierce man with extreme conviction, A's only somewhat soft spot is his love for his younger adoptive brother, Killer Bee. He is the son of the Third Raikage, groomed especially to succeed him, and believes that ninja must always show resolve even when they are defeated. He is also considered by many to be the fastest ninja in the world following Minato's death, up until when Naruto is able to dodge his attacks. A would later fight in the Third Shinobi World War, where he would frequently fight with Minato Namikaze, only for all of their battles to create stalemates.[ch. 542] After Killer Bee is seemingly abducted by Taka, A resolves to kill Sasuke and ridicules Naruto for trying to defend him. He and Sasuke later fight at the Five Kage Summit, during which A loses his left arm;[ch. 464] after learning the truth about Killer Bee, he helps him defeat Kisame.[ch. 473] A eventually becomes the Supreme Commander of the Allied Shinobi Forces, and after allowing Naruto and Killer Bee to fight in the war once they defeat him, fights and loses against Madara. A is voiced by Hideaki Tezuka in Japanese and by Beau Billingslea in English.
