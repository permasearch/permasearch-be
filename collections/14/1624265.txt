Mell lives in the magical world of Merci Hills (メルシーヒルズ, Merushī hiruzu) where everyone is living happily while their feelings are connected towards each other and words like "thank you" can bring warmth to everyone's hearts. Mell and her friends were guided by the Rainbow Fairy, Ciel, who gives them advice. A lot of Mell's friends also live in Merci Hills, and each come from different countries and have their own mission given to them by Ciel.
