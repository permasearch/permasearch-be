The international community tends to react adversely to coups by reducing aid and imposing sanctions. A 2015 study finds that "coups against democracies, coups after the Cold War, and coups in states heavily integrated into the international community are all more likely to elicit global reaction."[54] Another 2015 study shows that coups are the strongest predictor for the imposition of democratic sanctions.[55] A third 2015 study finds that Western states react strongest against coups of possible democratic and human rights abuses.[55] A 2016 study shows that the international donor community in the post-Cold War period penalizes coups by reducing foreign aid.[56] The US has been inconsistent in applying aid sanctions against coups both during the Cold War and post-Cold War periods, a likely consequence of its geopolitical interests.[56]
