Johns Island is located to the west of James Island and to the east of Wadmalaw Island and inshore of Seabrook Island and Kiawah Island. It is separated from the mainland by the tidal Stono River, which forms part of the Intracoastal Waterway.  Roughly one-third of the island is within the city limits of Charleston. The island is home to the Angel Oak, a Southern live oak tree estimated to be 400â€“500 years old and named for Justus Angel, nineteenth-century owner of the land on which it stands.[4][5][6] It is also known for its farms, producing tomatoes and numerous other agricultural products.
