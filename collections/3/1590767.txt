Warner Bros. invested over $100 million in a marketing campaign for Edge of Tomorrow.[48] The film was initially titled All You Need Is Kill after the light novel. In July 2013, Warner Bros. changed the title to Edge of Tomorrow;[49] Warner Bros. president Sue Kroll said the title was changed partly due to "negative chatter" about the word "kill" in the title.[50] Doug Liman, who said he rejected the title All You Need Is Kill because it "didn't feel like it was the tone of the movie I had made", wanted to rename the film Live Die Repeat, but Warner decided to use that just as the tagline.[22]
