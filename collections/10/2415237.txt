UK domestic recycling policy is geared towards encouraging more people to take control of recycling in their own homes, and over the last decade a number of new regulations have been introduced to encourage greater amounts of recycling. These include fines for people who donâ€™t cut their household waste and a greater emphasis on separating waste into different recyclable materials, with each council applying different rules.
