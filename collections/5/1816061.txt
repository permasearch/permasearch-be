Hugo Taylor has been credited as one of the creators of the show, having originally created a pilot with an almost identical concept for MTV in 2008 before the programme was sold to E4 and Monkey Productions.[citation needed] Hugo had signed up many genuine socialites and high-society members who then dropped out when they realised being on the programme could affect their social standing. Princess Eugenie was being mooted to make a cameo but like many others she pulled out too.[citation needed] In 2008 Hugo was rumoured to be dating Princess Eugenie.[citation needed] He is also known to be friends with Chelsy Davy, the ex-girlfriend of Prince Harry.[citation needed]
