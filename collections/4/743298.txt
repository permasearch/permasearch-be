Berigan's recording and the song itself, however, have continued to be prized by lovers of jazz. Billie Holiday recorded it on September 15, 1938,[9] so did Nat Cole, and before long Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra and a host of other vocalists did likewise. It is also a favorite of trumpet players who are willing to risk comparison with Berigan. A few, like Dizzy Gillespie and Maynard Ferguson have done notably well, and jazz recordings on tenor sax by Lester Young and Stan Getz are admired.
