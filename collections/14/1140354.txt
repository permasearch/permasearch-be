Msgr. José Abriol appointed Zaragoza and engineer Eduardo Santiago to expand the church in 1984, to accommodate more devotees. Jaime Cardinal Sin, then-Archbishop of Manila, reconsecrated the church on 28 September 1987, and the following year the church was declared a Minor Basilica. The church was conferred the title Basilica Minor of the Nuestro Padre Jesús Nazareno in 1988.[2] Papal Nuncio to the Philippines, Most Rev. Bruno Torpigliani, blessed the altar of Saint Lorenzo Ruíz on 1 February of that year.
