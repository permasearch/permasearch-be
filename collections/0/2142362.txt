Taiwan High Speed Rail's first and only HSR line opened for service on 5 January 2007, using Japanese trains with a top speed of 300 km/h (190 mph). The service traverses 345 km (214 mi) from Nangang Station to Zuoying Station in as little as 105 minutes. Once THSR began operations, almost all passengers switched from airlines flying parallel routes[35] while road traffic was also reduced.[36]
