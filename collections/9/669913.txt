The video takes place at a party in an underground club where Dev gives out signals to the crowd when to dance.[21][22] It also includes scenes of Dev and several other women standing against a wall while thrusting their chests out.[21][22] The scenes are interspersed with shots of things being broken and a scrolling shot of people standing still like statues.[21] Ron Slomowicz of About.com positively reviewed the video, calling it "pretty simple but fun".[21]
