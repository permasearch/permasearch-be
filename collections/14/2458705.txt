Known also as Mahameru (The Great Mountain), it is very steep rising abruptly above the coastal plains of eastern Java. Maars containing crater lakes have formed along a line through the summit of the volcano. It was formed south of the overlapping Ajek-ajek and Jambagan calderas.[2] Semeru lies at the south end of the Tengger Volcanic Complex.
