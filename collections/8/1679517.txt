The song was initially suggested as a suitable vehicle for the band by their manager Jim Dickson.[20] Lead guitarist Jim McGuinn felt that it would make an effective cover version, but David Crosby, the band's rhythm guitarist, felt that covering another Dylan song was formulaic.[21] The Byrds had already released a total of six Dylan covers on their first two albums, Mr. Tambourine Man and Turn! Turn! Turn!, enjoying particular success with their recordings of "Mr. Tambourine Man" and "All I Really Want to Do".[17][22][23] Despite Crosby's objections, the band recorded "My Back Pages" between December 5 and December 8, 1966, during the recording sessions for their fourth album.[24] Upon its release, this cover was received well by the critics and is today regarded as one of The Byrds' strongest Dylan interpretations.[25][26] Following its release on Younger Than Yesterday, the song would go on to become a staple of The Byrds' live concert repertoire, until their final disbandment in 1973.[27] On December 4, 1968, a later line-up of The Byrds re-recorded an excerpt of "My Back Pages" as part of a medley that was included on their 1969 album, Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde.[24][28] The song was also performed live by a reformed line-up of The Byrds featuring Roger McGuinn, David Crosby, and Chris Hillman in January 1989.[27]
