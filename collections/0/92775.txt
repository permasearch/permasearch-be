Anant Chaturdashi is the last day of the Hindu festival of Ganeshotsav. It is generally the 10th or 11th day after Ganesh Chaturthi. All the Ganesh deities brought into homes and communities are immersed in the sea or nearby lakes and rivers.[3] On this day, people travel to waterfronts with the idols dancing and singing in large processions. Lord Ganesha is departed, only to be welcomed the next year with equal excitement.
