According to Sestero and Greg Ellery, Wiseau rented a studio at the Birns and Sawyer film lot and bought a "complete Beginning Director package", which included two film and HD cameras.[13] Wiseau was confused about the differences between 35 mm film and high-definition video. He wanted to be the first director to film an entire movie simultaneously in two formats. He achieved this by using a custom-built apparatus that housed both cameras side-by-side and required two crews to operate.[14][7] Only the 35Â mm footage was used in the final edit.[15]
