In August 2007, the airport operator applied for planning permission from the government of Upper Bavaria. More than 60,000 objections have been filed during public display of the plans. The objections, lawsuits, and results of a citywide referendum against the third runway were later overturned by the Bavarian Administrative Court, allowing for construction plans to proceed.
