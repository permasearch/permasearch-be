This story is set in a world where magic is real and anyone can use it with varying degrees of success by learning at academies around the world. At the very best of all academies, Sistine Fibel, a talented female mage student with family wealth and an attitude to back her up, learns in hopes to become a mage archaeologist. In doing so, she plans to fulfill her grandfather's dream in uncovering the secrets of a floating castle in the sky (AKA Sky Castle) from an ancient civilization which no one knows much about. When her favorite teacher inexplicably leaves, her class gets a substitute instructor who doesn't quite measure up to her high expectations.
