(Has +I effect in the reaction ) Typical Grignard reactions involve the use of magnesium ribbon. All magnesium is coated with a passivating layer of magnesium oxide, which inhibits reactions with the organic halide. Specially activated magnesium, such as Rieke magnesium, circumvents this problem.[16] The oxide layer can also be broken up using ultrasound, using a stirring rod to scratch the oxidized layer off,[17] or by adding a few drops of iodine or 1,2-Diiodoethane.
