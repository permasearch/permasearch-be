Henry responded by mounting campaigns against the rebel barons and deepening his alliance with Theobald.[240] Baldwin of Flanders was wounded in battle and died in September 1118, easing the pressure on Normandy from the north-east.[241] Henry attempted to crush a revolt in the city of Alençon, but was defeated by Fulk and the Angevin army.[242] Forced to retreat from Alençon, Henry's position deteriorated alarmingly, as his resources became overstretched and more barons abandoned his cause.[243] Early in 1119, Eustace of Breteuil and Henry's daughter, Juliana, threatened to join the baronial revolt.[244] Hostages were exchanged in a bid to avoid conflict, but relations broke down and both sides mutilated their captives.[245] Henry attacked and took the town of Breteuil, despite Juliana's attempt to kill her father with a crossbow.[245][nb 25] In the aftermath, Henry dispossessed the couple of almost all of their lands in Normandy.[247]
