Aylesbury ducks, meanwhile, were becoming inbred, meaning fertile eggs were scarcer and the ducks were more susceptible to disease.[30][32] Exhibition standards had led to selection for an exaggerated keel by breeders, despite it being unpopular with dealers and consumers.[8] Poultry show judges also admired the long neck and upright posture of Pekin ducks over the boat-like stance of the Aylesbury.[8] Some of the breeders in the Aylesbury area began to cross Pekin ducks with the pure Aylesbury strain. Although the Aylesbury-Pekin cross ducks did not have the delicate flavour of the pure Aylesbury, they were hardier and much cheaper to raise.[8]
