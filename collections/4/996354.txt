There is very little documentation of any sort of sports in general Puritan lifestyle. The Puritan doctrine advocated a life intent on avoiding idle action.[7] The Puritans placed significant emphasis on the value of work and saw it as a duty to the Lord as his chosen people to spend all time productively. Distraction from that narrow lifestyle was seen as a vice.[8] Sport was often considered a form of leisurely or idle activity, and therefore a vice. This prevented sport flourishing in the American colonies among the Puritans.
