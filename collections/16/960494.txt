In addition to the popular Mother Gothel Classic Doll[36] and appearing alongside Rapunzel, Flynn, Pascal and Maximus in the Rapunzel Tangled Figure Play Set,[37] the character's likeness has since been adapted and modified by Disney into a much more glamorous doll for sale alongside several re-imagined Disney villainesses as part of the company's Disney Villains Designer Collection, released in 2012.[38] Costumed in a long burgundy gown made of satin, Gothel wears her thick black hair in "a theatrical up-do."[39]
