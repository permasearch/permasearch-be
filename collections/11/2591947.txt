In 1965 Schildkraut formulated the catecholamine theory of depression.[123] This was subsequently the most widely cited article in the American Journal of Psychiatry.[124] The theory stated that "some, if not all, depressions are associated with an absolute or relative deficiency of catecholamines, in particular noradrenaline (NA), at functionally important adrenergic receptor sites in the brain. However, elation may be associated with an excess of such amines."
