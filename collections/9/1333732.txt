According to then-Mayor Jose Torres, Paterson had 52 distinct ethnic groups in 2014.[71] Paterson's rapidly growing Bangladeshi American,[72] Turkish American, Arab American,[73] Palestinian American,[52] Albanian American, Bosnian American, Dominican American, and Peruvian American communities are among the largest and most prominent in the United States, the latter owing partially to the presence of the Consulate of Peru.[74] Paterson's Muslim population has been estimated at 25,000 to 30,000.[1] Paterson has become a prime destination for one of the fastest-growing communities of Dominican Americans, who have become the city's largest ethnic group.[75] The Puerto Rican American population has established a highly significant presence as well.[76]
