Columbia Record Club was formed in 1955 by CBS/Columbia Records as an experiment to market music directly by mail,[4] spurring sales to rural consumers and heading off competition from mail-order companies from outside the record industry.[5] New members to the club were enticed with a free record just for joining.[4] To appease brick-and-mortar retailers, titles in the club's catalog were only made available six months (later, three months) after retail release, and retailers that helped recruit members got a 20% commission. By the end of that year, the club had 125,175 members who had purchased 700,000 records[4] ($1.174 million net). The operation grew so quickly that, in 1956, it was moved from New York City to a new home base: a distribution center in Terre Haute, Indiana, a railway-accessible city where Columbia had recently opened a record pressing facility.[4] Within a year, the club had 687,652 members and had sold 7 million records[4] ($14.888 million net) and, by 1963, it commanded 10% of the recorded music retail market.[5]
