Pfeiffer Beach is very popular but is only accessible via a 2 miles (3.2Â km) narrow dirt road. The small parking lot at the beach is usually full on summer and holiday weekends. The wide sandy expanse offers views of a scenic arch rock offshore. It is sometimes confused with the beach at Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park to the south.[75]
