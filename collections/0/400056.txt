Captain Schettino stated that, before approaching the island, he turned off the alarm system for the ship's computer navigation system.[43] "I was navigating by sight, because I knew those seabeds well. I had done the move three, four times."[44] He told investigators that he saw waves breaking on the reef and turned abruptly, swinging the side of the hull into the reef.[45] "I have to take responsibility for the fact that I made a judgment error."[45] "This time I ordered the turn too late."[46] The captain initially stated that the ship was about 300 metres (330Â yd) from the shore (about the length of the vessel) and hit an uncharted rock.[47] However, the ship's first officer, Ciro Ambrosio, told investigators that Schettino had left his reading glasses in his cabin and repeatedly asked Ambrosio to check the radar for him.[48][49]
