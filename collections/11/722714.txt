At an individual level, a combination of excessive food energy intake and a lack of physical activity is thought to explain most cases of obesity.[81] A limited number of cases are due primarily to genetics, medical reasons, or psychiatric illness.[9] In contrast, increasing rates of obesity at a societal level are felt to be due to an easily accessible and palatable diet,[82] increased reliance on cars, and mechanized manufacturing.[83][84]
