Israel has made polygamy illegal.[71][72] Provisions were instituted to allow for existing polygamous families immigrating from countries where the practice was legal. Furthermore, former chief rabbi Ovadia Yosef[73] has come out in favor of legalizing polygamy and the practice of pilegesh (concubine) by the Israeli government.
