Kol (portrayed by Kenneth Mitchell) is the Commanding Officer of the Klingons, and opponent of T'Kuvma's goals.[46][22] Kol is a member of the house of Kor, a character portrayed by John Colicos in the original series. Mitchell described Kol as both "complicated" and "powerful",[47][48] and said that he studied Colicos's "subtle" performance and read the novel The Final Reflection to prepare.[48]
