The characters in the film, while different in their motives and demeanor, all have a sophisticated and classy appearance in the black community (with the exception of Sharp Eye Washington). Poitier made it a point to represent black actors on screen in an elegant way, which contrasted the image of Blacks that were often thought of in Hollywood. During his career, he refused a role if the character had negative stereotypes, and chose to play characters who were "dignified, proud, and ethical". African-American men in the film carried themselves in a poised, calm manner in all situations. This is most notable with Steve Jackson, who is well-mannered and cautious. Critics have noted on Poitier's pattern of his characters. "In all his films, [Poitier] was educated and intelligent. He spoke proper English, dressed conservatively, and had the best of table manners."[6]
