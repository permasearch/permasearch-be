The general use of piggy banks is to store loose change in a quaint, decorative manner. Modern piggy banks are not limited to the likeness of pigs, and may come in a range of shapes, sizes and colors. As locked money boxes with a narrow opening to drop cash or coins, they are most commonly used by temples and churches. The box is opened via a plug underneath it at regular intervals, when the collected money is counted and recorded.
