In the early 1970s she became immersed in the rock music scene. She and four other girls decided to form a group and begin promoting bands. They each gave themselves nicknames and Trumbull chose the name "Pennie Lane" in part from the song by the Beatles. The other girls in the group were Marvelous Meg, Sexy Sandy, The Real Camille, and Caroline Can-Can. The girls had matchbooks made with The Flying Garter Girls printed on them to promote themselves, and quickly became successful and worked with countless rock bands over a period of three years, after which the girls left the rock music world behind them.[3]
