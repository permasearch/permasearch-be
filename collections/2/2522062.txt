Other products are equally affected. Windows 10 itself cannot be clean installed because the bootable installation media lack the RAID drivers (the installation would have them but it is the installer itself that lacks them).  Rescue media built by the 'Backup and Restore' utility cannot restore the backed-up image to the SSD drive because it cannot see it.  Even third-party disc imaging utilities such as Acronis True Image lack RAID drivers in the rescue media which are generally based on a Linux system. The RAID drivers can be injected into the boot image on USB stick rescue media (though not on DVD-based media).
