Wally was born after his mother's abandonment of her family, leading Joe and Iris to be unaware of his existence for eighteen years until Iris finds out. Wally finally meets his father and sister during a Christmas party shortly before his mother dies, and he has since struggled to bond with Joe and Iris. He also forms a brotherly bond with Barry Allen, although he is suspicious of Barry's weird behavior. Formerly a drag racer, Wally is enrolled at the same university Iris attended, majoring in mechanical engineering. After repeatedly being rescued by the Flash, Wally becomes fascinated with the superhero and discovers that his father has a connection with him, but is unaware that he is Barry. He is inspired by both his father and the Flash to help people, resulting in him ultimately becoming close to Joe. Later, when Wally and Jesse Wells are locked in the Time Vault at S.T.A.R. Labs, they work together to escape but are accidentally affected by the dark matter released from the attempt to restore Barry's powers; his father and later Barry, suspect that Wally is turning into a metahuman after the incident. Eventually, Wally discovers Barry's secrets when Zoom abducts and kills Barry's father, and fully accepts Barry after he rescues Joe from Zoom.
