Writer and acting coach Paul Ryan noted Hartman's work ethic with his impressions. He assembled a collection of video footage of the figure he was preparing to impersonate and watched this continually until he "completely embodied the person". Ryan concluded that "what made [Hartman's impressions] so funny and spot on was Phil's ability to add that perfect touch that only comes from trial and error and practicing in front of audiences and fellow actors."[44] Hartman described this process as "technical."[9] Journalist Lyle V. Harris said Hartman showed a "rare talent for morphing into [...] anybody he wanted to be".[45]
