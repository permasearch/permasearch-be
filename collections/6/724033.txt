The turkey burger was introduced in 2013 as part of a spring-time limited time offering promotion called Festival of Burgers.[46] The new sandwich was part of a series of new, updated or modified sandwiches and along with a revamped veggie burger, as a newer more healthier offering than its beef-based burgers. With the introduction of the sandwich, the chain became the largest restaurant chain to offer a turkey burger as part of its menu.[46] Despite being declared a healthier option, the sandwich still weighed in at 10 oz (280 g) and 25% of a person's daily nutritional intake by the USDA standards.[47] Despite its size, the sandwich was one of the chain’s more healthful options, approximately 50 calories more than its TenderGrill chicken sandwich giving the chain three lower-calorie non-burger options.[48]
