During historical times the beach was used by smugglers.[1] To the northwest along the coast is Gravel Bay, Black Cave, East Pickard Bay, West Pickard Bay, Guttle Hole, Parsonsquarry Bay and Sheep Island.[2] The headland between Sheep Island in the northwest and Linney Head in the southeast consists primarily of red sandstones, which "form irregular, steep cliffs with fallen rocks at the back of beaches".[3] Older Lower Palaeozoic mudstones and siltstones are situated towards the centre, and to both the north and the south are old red sandstones. Behind the bays are extensive dune fields such as Broomhill Burrows and Gupton Burrows and a river valley.[4] The low cliffs on the south facing coast reach an elevation of 55 metres (180 ft), rising gently behind to 63 metres (207 ft).[3]
