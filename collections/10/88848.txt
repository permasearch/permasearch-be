Warner Bros. instructed cinemas to stop screening a trailer for the film Gangster Squad, which preceded The Dark Knight Rises screenings in some cities (though not in Aurora),[140] because it contained a scene involving the main characters shooting at a movie theater audience with machine guns.[141][142] The film's release date was rescheduled to January 2013, and the theater scene was replaced by a new sequence in a different setting.[143]
