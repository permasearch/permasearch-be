Much of the municipality's economy is now tied to the influx of tourists and foreigners who come to live, mostly retirees. A Wikipedia sister site Wikivoyage has an entry for San Miguel de Allende. In 2002, 250,000 visitors spent about 8.4 million USD at the town's attractions, but those who live here contribute far more to the economy.[17] Most of this is concentrated in the town of San Miguel proper. It accounts for over 36% of the municipality's jobs and most of the municipality's income. Tourism accounts for almost all of the municipality's income from outside.[2] This began in the mid 20th century as a cheap place to live; however, despite recent economic downturns, it no longer is. This has not lessened San Miguel's attraction for foreign visitors and retirees as homes and hotels here are still significantly cheaper than in the U.S. or Europe.[11][17][31] Despite not having a casino or an airport and being 400 miles from the nearest beach, this small city has been ranked by magazines such as Time and Leisure and Cond√© Nast Traveler as one of its preferred places to live and visit.[4]
