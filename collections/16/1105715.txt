In 2013, she was cast in the leading role in the Lifetime drama/dark comedy series Unreal, a show about the inner workings of a reality show (a show within a show), which premiered on June 1, 2015, and was produced by former The Bachelor producer, Sarah Gertrude Shapiro and writer Marti Noxon.[18] To research her role as a reality show dating show producer, Appleby said that she spent time with a producer to quiz them about the work.[16] She said that one of the appeals of the show was that the central focus was not about her character being in a romantic relationship.[15] The show garnered strong reviews and had been picked up for four seasons.[19][20][21] In 2016, Appleby directed her first episode of Unreal, titled "Casualty". She went on to direct multiple episodes of the series. In July 2018, the series ended after four seasons.[22]
