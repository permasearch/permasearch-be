The APTTA agreement allows Afghan trucks to transport exports to India via Pakistan up to the Wagah crossing point,[6][7] but does not offer Afghanistan the right to import Indian goods across Pakistani territory,[17] out of fear that Indian goods would end up on the Pakistani black market in the same manner that was common under the 1965 ATTA. Instead, Afghan trucks offloaded at Wagah may return to Afghanistan loaded only with Pakistani, rather than Indian goods,[18] in an attempt to prevent the formation of a black market for Indian goods in Pakistan.
