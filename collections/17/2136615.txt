The modernization of grappa distillation is relatively recent, probably in 1979 in Northern Italy. Initially it was carried out by direct flame but soon the advantages of a bain-marie or steam distillation to obtain a better product became obvious. Modern refinements included the distillation of pomace under vacuum, the use of varietal grapes and aging in casks of various types of wood to improve the flavor of the liquor. Oak is the most used, but some high-end grappas are aged successively in casks of acacia, ash and cherrywood, an innovation introduced by the Marzadro Distillery. In Sardinia, Grappa is colloquially known as (iron wire)as most of the distillation was homemade and illegal to avoid customs and excise taxes. The illegally made liquor was bottled, sealed and then buried in orchards fields and pastures, awaiting commercialization. A bit of iron wire was tied around the bottleneck, barely protruding the soil. after some time the wire would rust and disappear completely save for a faintly brown red color stain to the topsoil on the spot where the bottle was buried. While the peasant distiller could easily recognize the colored spot, the urban-bred Guardia di Finanza officers were generally unable to tell the difference.
