The researchers concluded that the evolution of the Cit+ trait occurred in three distinct phases in which mutations accumulated that increased the rate of mutation to Cit+, the trait itself appeared in a weak form, and, finally, the trait was improved by later mutations. Blount et al. suggested that this pattern might be typical of how novel traits in general evolve, and proposed a three-step model of evolutionary innovation:
