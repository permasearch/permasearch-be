The constitutional status of the Australian Antarctic Territory is unclear, with successive governments treating it either as a separate territory (as in the United Kingdom and Norway) or an integral part of the state (as in New Zealand and France). As of 2018[update], the present government appears to take the view that it is not constitutionally part of Australia.[9]
