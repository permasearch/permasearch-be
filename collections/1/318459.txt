The Dominican Republic is a third world country plagued with poverty. In a 2010 CIA estimate, it was shown that 34.4 percent of Dominicans live below the poverty line. In addition, the CIA estimated in 2012 that unemployment of the Dominican Republic was 14.7 percent.[7] Due to the Dominican Republic's weak economy, Dominican men have very few options for employment. It is this absence of options, the storied history of the sport, and the great success of those who make it to the major leagues that make it easy for Dominican youth to view the game as economic salvation.[4] Baseball provides children living in the impoverished Dominican streets hope of a future where they can provide for themselves and their families. Because of this, children begin playing organized baseball as early as six years old,[6] and compete with others in leagues with the hopes of being recognized by baseball scouts. The roster of the Dominican team at the 2013 World Baseball Classic featured 20 MLB players; the combined salaries of these athletes amount to $104,590,000,[7] an amount that could sustain many individuals in Dominican communities.
