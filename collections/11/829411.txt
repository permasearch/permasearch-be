Bill Ponderosa (Lance Barber) first appears in "Mac Fights Gay Marriage" and the follow-up episode "Dennis Gets Divorced" as Dee's high school crush and the brother of Dennis's high school girlfriend Maureen Ponderosa. He has put on a lot of weight since high school. Dee eventually becomes his mistress when Dee thinks he bought her a new car when in fact the car belongs to another of Bill's mistresses. Bill returns to his wife. Bill later returns in "Dee Gives Birth" as one of Dee's potential baby's daddies. Bill reveals that he tells girls he's had a vasectomy so he doesn't have to use a condom. He appears in the episode "The Maureen Ponderosa Wedding Massacre" where he spikes a punch bowl with bath salts and it is revealed that Frank is his AA sponsor. He also displays an affinity for cocaine. Ponderosa also appears in the Season 11 episode "Being Frank," where it is revealed that he and Frank have developed a friendship based on hard partying and other social activities, and Frank has nicknamed him "Pondy." Frank borrows Ponderosa's car to help the rest of the Gang spring Dennis' Land Rover from a city impound lot without paying, dropping Ponderosa off at a roller rink where he ends up being brutally beaten by a group of men for hitting on underage girls. Ponderosa also makes a brief appearance in the season 12 episode "Making Dennis Reynolds a Murderer," where in an interview he implies that he does not miss his dead sister and that Dennis "did us all a favor. You ever seen a grown woman take a dump in a sandbox?" He states that Dennis did not kill Maureen, who "died three years ago," he killed Bastet, a reference to Maureen having come to identify as a cat and begun transitioning, having renamed herself after the Egyptian cat goddess.
