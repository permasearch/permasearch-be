Tires are not desired at landfills, due to their large volumes and 75% void space.[7] Tires can trap methane gases, causing them to become buoyant, or bubble to the surface. This 'bubbling' effect can damage landfill liners that have been installed to help keep landfill contaminants from polluting local surface and ground water.[6]
