The constitution also established two "routes" to accede to autonomy. The "fast route" or "fast track",[25] also called the "exception",[24] was established in article 151, and was implicitly reserved for the three "historical nationalities"[7][26][30]—the Basque Country, Catalonia and Galicia—in that the very strict requirements to opt for this route were waived via the second transitory disposition for those territories that had approved a "Statute of Autonomy" during the Second Spanish Republic[30] (otherwise, the constitution required the approval of three-fourths of the municipalities involved whose population would sum up at least the majority of the electoral census of each province, and required the ratification through a referendum with the affirmative vote of the absolute majority of the electoral census of each province—that is, of all registered citizens, not only of those who would vote).
