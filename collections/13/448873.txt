The first version the day after that of FruityLoops (1.0.0) was developed by Didier Dambrin for Image-Line and was partially released in December 1997. Its official launch was in early 1998, when it was still a four-channel[14] MIDI drum machine.[15] Dambrin became Chief Software Architect for the program,[16][17] and it quickly underwent a series of large upgrades that made it into a popular and complex digital audio workstation. FL Studio has undergone twelve major updates since its inception.[18]  On 22 May 2018, a macOS-compatible version of FL Studio was released.
