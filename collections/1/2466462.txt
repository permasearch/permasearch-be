In Japan, up to 1,500 raccoons were imported as pets each year after the success of the anime series Rascal the Raccoon (1977). In 2004, the descendants of discarded or escaped animals lived in 42 of 47 prefectures.[237][238][239] The population of raccoons in Japan grew from 17 prefectures in 2000 to all 47 prefectures in 2008.[240] It is estimated that raccoons cause thirty million yen of agricultural damage on Hokkaido alone.[241]
