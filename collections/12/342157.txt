With the construction of canals, newly reclaimed Everglades land was promoted throughout the United States. Land developers sold 20,000Â lots in a few months in 1912. Advertisements promised within eight weeks of arrival, a farmer could be making a living, although for many it took at least two months to clear the land. Some tried burning off the sawgrass or other vegetation, only to learn that the peat continued to burn. Animals and tractors used for plowing got mired in the muck and were useless. When the muck dried, it turned to a fine black powder and created dust storms.[109] Though initially crops sprouted quickly and lushly, they just as quickly wilted and died, seemingly without reason.[110]
