Because XOR is linear, an attacker may be able to manipulate an encoded pointer by overwriting only the lower bytes of an address.  This can allow an attack to succeed if the attacker is able to attempt the exploit multiple times or is able to complete an attack by causing a pointer to point to one of several locations (such as any location within a NOP sled).[28]  Microsoft added a random rotation to their encoding scheme to address this weakness to partial overwrites.[29]
