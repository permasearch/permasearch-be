The HouseGuests will be competing for the main prize of $500,000.[1] Cash prizes of varying amounts may be offered as "temptations" over the course of the season. Kevin Schlehuber was awarded $25,000 on the premiere episode.[10] The second cash temptation of the season was also claimed by Kevin; this time, it was a smaller sum of $27.[11]
