Brighton's proximity to London made it an ideal place to provide short holidays for Londoners.[157] In the 1830s, during the summer, the London Brighton road would see around 40 coaches a day plus a number of private carriages taking visitors to the coast.[157] The road was in a poor condition so proposals to build a railway were suggested as early as 1806.[157] However, it was not till 1823 that a serious scheme was mooted.[157] There followed years of discussion and argument with various groups proposing different routes, then finally in 1837 the London and Brighton Railway Bill with branches to Shoreham and Newhaven received Royal assent.[157] In 1838 the directors of the London and Brighton Railway Company (L&BR) stated that the railroad would be different from the rest of the country in that it would be a passenger only railway.[157]
