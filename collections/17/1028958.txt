In June 1986, Boeing announced the development of the 737-400,[49] which stretched the fuselage a further 10 ft (3.0 m), increasing the passenger load to 188.[50] The -400s first flight was on February 19, 1988, and, after a seven-month/500-hour flight-testing run, entered service with Piedmont Airlines that October.[51]
