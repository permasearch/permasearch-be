Following Lennon's death in 1980, Roxy Music added a version of the song to their set while touring in Germany, which they recorded and released in February 1981.[10] The single was released by Polydor with "To Turn You On" as the B-side, with catalogue number "ROXY 2".[10][11] The song was the only UK No. 1 hit for Roxy Music, topping the charts for two weeks in March 1981.[12] "To Turn You On" later appeared on the 1982 album Avalon, although it was slightly remixed.[13] Roxy Music's cover of "Jealous Guy" features on many Bryan Ferry/Roxy Music collections and 1980s music compilations, though not always in its full-length version.
