On March 28, 2014, Bradley was optioned to Triple-A Pawtucket after he was unable to beat Grady Sizemore for the starting center field position, but was recalled three days later after the team placed Shane Victorino on the 15-day disabled list. Bradley saw regular time as the team's center fielder throughout the 2014 season, but was optioned back to Triple-A Pawtucket on August 18 after hitting just .216 with one home run and 30 RBI, despite playing exceptional defense.[8]
