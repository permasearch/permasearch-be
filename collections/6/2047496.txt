The Dixie House (now closed) is located in the Lakewood area of east Dallas, Texas. It served a variety of Southern, home-cooked style foods, such as a signature chicken-fried steak.[12] The Dixie House was acquired by Black-Eye  and the two restaurants shared many menu items. It retained a distinct, neighborhood-restaurant style. It received a mention in the 2008 Best Neighborhood Restaurant notices of D Magazine.[13]
