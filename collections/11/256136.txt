Humankind gradually evolved from early members of the genus Homo—such as Homo habilis, who used simple stone tools—into fully behaviorally and anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens sapiens) during the Paleolithic era.[6] During the end of the Paleolithic, specifically the Middle and or Upper Paleolithic, humans began to produce the earliest works of art and engage in religious and spiritual behavior such as burial and ritual.[7][8] The climate during the Paleolithic consisted of a set of glacial and interglacial periods in which the climate periodically fluctuated between warm and cool temperatures. Archaeological and genetic data suggest that the source populations of Paleolithic humans survived in sparsely wooded areas and dispersed through areas of high primary productivity while avoiding dense forest cover.[9]
