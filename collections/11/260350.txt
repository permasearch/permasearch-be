The direct and immediate source of As You Like It is Thomas Lodge's Rosalynde, Euphues Golden Legacie, written 1586-7 and first published in 1590.[2] Lodge's story is based upon "The Tale of Gamelyn",[3] wrongly attributed to Geoffrey Chaucer and sometimes printed among his Canterbury Tales.[citation needed] Although it was first printed in 1721, "The Tale Gamelyn" must have existed in manuscript form in Shakespeare's time.[citation needed] It is doubtful that Shakespeare had read it, but Lodge must have built his pastoral romance on the foundation of "The Tale of Gamelyn," giving it a pastoral setting and the artificial sentimental vein, much in fashion at the time.[citation needed] The tale provided the intertwined plots, and suggested all the characters except Touchstone and Jaques.[citation needed]
