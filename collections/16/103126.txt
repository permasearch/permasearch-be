Complicating this picture of a collapsing cloud are the effects of turbulence, macroscopic flows, rotation, magnetic fields and the cloud geometry. Both rotation and magnetic fields can hinder the collapse of a cloud.[24][25] Turbulence is instrumental in causing fragmentation of the cloud, and on the smallest scales it promotes collapse.[26]
