As for the local economic consequences, it was established by Fernand Ouellet that once the direct damage of warfare was addressed, economic fallout was minimal. In fact, the outcome of British conquest was manifestly positive on the economic front. For example, the conquest of Quebec formed the genesis of a logging trade that was inexistent during the French regime. From 6000 barrels of pine per year, the Colony under English dominion increased production to 64 000 barrels by 1809.[14]:282 Furthermore, the British encouraged the immigration prerequisite to the economic expansion of Canada during the 19th century. Indeed, in 1769, Canadian exportations were valued at 127,000 pounds sterling, and by 1850 they had grown to 2,800,000 pounds sterling.[14]:283
