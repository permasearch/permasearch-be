Exile on Main St was not well received by most contemporary critics, who found the quality of the songs inconsistent.[18] In a review for Rolling Stone, Lenny Kaye said the record had "a tight focus on basic components of the Stones' sound as we've always known it," including blues-based rock music with a "pervading feeling of blackness". He nonetheless said the uneven quality of songs meant "the great Stones album of their mature period is yet to come".[26] Richard Williams from Melody Maker was more enthusiastic and deemed it the band's best album, writing that it would "take its place in history" as it "utterly repulses the sneers and arrows of outraged put down artists. Once and for all, it answers any questions about their ability as rock 'n' rollers."[27] In a year-end list for Newsday, Christgau named it the year's best album and wrote that "this fagged-out masterpiece" was the peak of rock music in 1972 as it "explored new depths of record-studio murk, burying Mick's voice under layers of cynicism, angst and ennui".[28]
