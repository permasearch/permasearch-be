In 1982 in Boston, after Ingrid arrive in the Land Without Magic, she visits Madame Faustina to see the future on a yet-to-be born child. Madame Faustina agrees to use her crystal ball to see the child’s future. Halfway, Madame Faustina mistakenly tells the child name as “Susan” when the child to-be’s name is “Emma”. Angrily, Ingrid storms out of the shop and tries to use her ice magic on Madame Faustina. As Ingrid does not have her magic in this land, Madame Faustina chases her away with a broomstick.
