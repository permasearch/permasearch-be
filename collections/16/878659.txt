On May 17, 2018 YouTube announced the upcoming rebranding of the service as YouTube Premium, which officially took effect on June 18. The rebranding came alongside the re-launch of YouTube Music, with a separate subscription service focused solely on music (that, as before, will be bundled with the larger YouTube Premium service, and also offered to Google Play Music subscribers). YouTube also announced that the price of the service would increase from US$50.99 (which will serve as the price point for the YouTube Music Premium service) to US$30.99 per-month for new subscribers. Alongside the rebranding, the services also expanded into Canada, and 11 European markets (including Austria, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Russia, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom), with more expansion to come in the future.[20][21][22]
