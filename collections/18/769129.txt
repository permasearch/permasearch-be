In 1934, British anthropologist Sir Flinders Petrie, along with a team of archaeologists, discovered various primitive bowling balls, bowling pins and other materials in the grave of a protodynastic Egyptian boy dating to 3200 BCE, very shortly before the reign of Narmer, one of the very first Egyptian pharaohs. Their discovery represents the earliest known historical trace of bowling.[2][3] Others claim that bowling originated in Germany around 300 CE,[2][3] as part of a religious ritual in which people would roll stones at clubs (or "kegels") to absolve themselves of sins.[4]
