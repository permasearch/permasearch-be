In November 2002, Stanley Mouse filed a lawsuit, in which he alleged that the characters of Mike and Sulley were based on drawings of Excuse My Dust, a film that he had tried to sell to Hollywood in 1998.[61] The lawsuit also stated that a story artist from Pixar visited Mouse in 2000, and discussed Mouse's work with him.[61] A Disney spokeswoman responded, by saying that the characters in Monsters, Inc. were "developed independently by the Pixar and Walt Disney Pictures creative teams, and do not infringe on anyone's copyrights".[58] The case was ultimately settled under undisclosed terms.[62]
