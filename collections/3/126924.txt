The High Court has described the concept of a superior court (and associated 'notions derived from the position of pre-Judicature common law courts') as having 'no ready application in Australia to federal courts.'[11] Despite this, Australian courts are frequently characterised as either 'superior' or 'inferior.' The Federal Court[12] and the Supreme Courts of each State and Territory are generally considered to be superior courts.
