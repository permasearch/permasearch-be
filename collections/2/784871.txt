The second season introduces a new title sequence. Several elements from the original title sequence are changed, including the images of a horse are now replaced with a bison. Other new images in the title sequence include the Man in Black's black hat, a mother cradling her child (evocative of Maeve), and a blonde woman's hair being mechanically combed (representing Dolores). Ramin Djawadi's score stays the same, with the images of the player piano intact.[87]
