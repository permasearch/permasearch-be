Known as Aerobics Studio (エアロビスタジオ) in Japan, Dance Aerobics is the third game in Bandai's Family Trainer series, and is the only music game. Unlike the two previous installments and later Street Cop, this game was never published by Bandai in North America though it still saw a release in that region by Nintendo.
