In 1980, Takei began a campaign for California State Assemblyman (District 46) from the greater Los Angeles area. However, he chose to withdraw after his opponent challenged the airing of episodes of Star Trek on local television under the Federal Communication Commission's Fairness Doctrine "equal time" regulations,[34][35] saying also that "this is the wrong time to interrupt my career as an actor and author."[34] He also appeared as a sadistic Japanese POW camp commander in the WW2 film Return from the River Kwai (1989).
