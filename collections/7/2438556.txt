"Simple, yet extraordinarily textured, this is Rodgers' autobiographical and bittersweet lament of an unrequited love. Dominant here is the song's four-note riff, which plays out across the intro on bells before being swept up in the lilting strings which ultimately drive the melody. Echoed by both horns and vocals, the slightly melancholy refrain "I want your love, I need your love" was the passionate repetition that made the song so endearing an unending circle -- a sonic masterpiece."[8]
