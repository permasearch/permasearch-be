He scored his 29th touchdown against the Denver Broncos in just 13 games (Alexander set the record in 16).[29] His 2 touchdown passes do not count toward this record because the NFL treats them in a separate category. With the first touchdown against Kansas City on December 17, he surpassed the NFL record for most points in a season which had stood for 46 years.[30] Tomlinson would finish his record breaking season with 2,323Â yards from scrimmage and 31 touchdowns (28 rushing, 3 receiving).[31]
