Israel, subject to the Arab League boycott, does not stamp passports anymore. Instead, it issues ID cards to visitors. Previously, it was possible to get the stamp on a separate piece of paper. Kuwait,[365] Lebanon,[366] Libya,[367] Saudi Arabia,[368] Sudan,[369] Syria[370] and Yemen[371] do not allow entry to people with evidence of travel to Israel, or whose passports have either a used or an unused Israeli visa.
