Enrique Peña Nieto has been known for his occasional lapses in memory or gaffes during public events or interviews.[119] The most-noted incident occurred during the International Book Fair of Guadalajara on 3 December 2011.[120] On that day, during a question and answer session, he was asked by an audience member to name three books that had influenced him, being only able to correctly reference the Bible.[121][122] He then "rambled, tossing out confused title names, asking for help in recalling authors and sometimes mismatching" the two others.[123] Other incidents have involved him not being able to recall Benito Juárez's year of birth,[124] being unable to remember the acronym of the Federal Institute of Access to Information (IFAI),[125][126] changing the date of foundation of the state of Hidalgo,[127][128] mistaking the capital of the State of Veracruz,[129] mentioning the U.S. presidential candidate "La señora Hillary Trump" (Mrs. Hillary Trump),[130] among others,[131] of varying degree of substantiation or credibility. However, they have become viral on social media, especially Twitter[132][133] and a website that counts the number of days since his last gaffe.[134]
