Persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD) results in a spontaneous, persistent, and uncontrollable genital arousal in women, with or without orgasm, unrelated to any feelings of sexual desire.[112] Clitoral priapism, also known as clitorism, is a rare, potentially painful medical condition and is sometimes described as an aspect of PGAD,[112] in which the erect clitoris does not return to its relaxed state for an unusually extended period of time (ranging from minutes to days), despite the absence of both physical and psychological stimulation; PGAD can also be associated with morphometric and vascular modifications of the clitoris.[113]
