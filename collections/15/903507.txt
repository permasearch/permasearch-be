A man mourns his true love for "a twelve month and a day". At the end of that time, the dead woman complains that his weeping is keeping away her from peaceful rest. He begs a kiss. She tells him it would kill him. When he persists, wanting to join her in death, she explains that once they were both dead their hearts would simply decay, and that he should enjoy life while he has it.
