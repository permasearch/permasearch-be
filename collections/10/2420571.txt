The tariff of 1816 was the first – and last – protective tariff that received significant Southern support during the “thirty-year tariff war” from 1816 to 1846.[19] A number of historical factors were important in shaping Southern perceptions of the legislation. Acknowledging the need to provide sufficient government funding, and with no adequate alternative propositions, the South felt compelled to consider protection. Southern support of the tariff was not demonstrably linked to any significant trend towards industry in the South, or to the existence of textile mills in the Congressional districts of Southern representatives.[20]
