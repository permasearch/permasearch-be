A title similar to such a lordship is known in French as Seigneur du Manoir, Welsh as Breyr, Gutsherr in German, Godsherre in Norwegian and Swedish, Ambachtsheer in Dutch and Signore or Vassallo in Italian. In Italy, especially in the kingdom of Sicily before 1812, the feudal title signore was often used; like its English equivalent, it came into wide use under the Normans as seigneur.
