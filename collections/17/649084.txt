After being picked up by Pop, American reception has been similarly mixed. The Los Angeles Times described the show as "very funny, beautifully played, sometimes touching and, though its premise is familiar — rich family loses money — quite its own animal."[22] and the New York Post stated that "The Levys nicely develop their fish-out-of-water concept by showing how the family tries to fit in out of necessity."[23] On the other end of the spectrum, Mike Hale of The New York Times called Schitt's Creek "a show that’s drab and underwritten, with potentially amusing (if familiar) situations that never build to more than a chuckle or a nod of recognition: Yeah, that could have been funny."[24]
