France adopted the new calendar with Sunday, 9 December 1582, being followed by Monday, 20 December 1582.[7] The Dutch provinces of Brabant and Zeeland, and the States General adopted it on 25 December of that year; the provinces forming the Southern Netherlands (modern Belgium) except the Duchy of Brabant adopted it on 1 January 1583; the province of Holland adopted it on 12 January 1583.[8] The seven Catholic Swiss cantons adopted the new calendar in January 1684 while Geneva and several Protestant cantons adopted it in January 1701 or at other dates throughout the 18th century. The two Swiss communes of Schiers and Gr√ºsch were the last areas of Western and Central Europe to switch to the Gregorian calendar, in 1812.[9]
