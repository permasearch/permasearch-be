Nerdstrom (portrayed by Jeffrey Asch) is a rich nerd (appearing in 2 episodes in seasons 2 & 4) who is Violet Bickerstaff’s boyfriend and treats her rather poorly, although he does buy her a gold-plated pocket protector. His poor treatment of her is one of the factors in her becoming Screech’s girlfriend. While most of the nerds comport themselves with a bumbling dignity at most, Nerdstrom goes above and beyond, behaving as a pompous, stuck-up geek. He defeats Zack in a game of poker, but gets his comeuppance in the end. Perhaps Maxwell's most noted accomplishment at Bayside is mistakenly kissing Screech’s dog, "Hound Dog" believing him to be Jessie, to everybody’s delight. He is later humiliated when Screech pointed out that Maxwell kissed his dog and tells Maxwell to stay out of Violet's life.
