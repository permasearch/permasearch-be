On 5 June 2014, it was announced that the regatta would be sailed in 62-foot-long (18.9 m) foiling catamarans, the AC62. The entry fee was $3 million. Each challenging team could build only one boat while Oracle Team USA could build two.[18] A nationality rule was agreed, requiring 25 percent of the crew to be from the entry's country. This nationality rule had been lifted prior to the 2003 America's Cup. The rules specified the combined weight of the crew could not exceed 525Â kg. The neutral International adjudicating yachting panel was dropped in favour of a three-man panel appointed by the defender.
