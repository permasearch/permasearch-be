George Townsend set up a business in 1851 in Redditch making sewing needles. In 1882 his son, also named George, started making components for cycle manufacturers including saddles and forks. By 1886 complete bicycles were being sold under the names Townsend and Ecossais. This business suffered a financial collapse in 1891. [2] [3] Albert Eadie, sales manager of Birminghamâ€™s Perry & Co Ltd, pen makers who had begun to supply components for cycles, and Robert Walker Smith, an engineer from D. Rudge & Co[4], were chosen by Townsend's bankers to run the business. Then, in 1892, the firm was re-incorporated and named Eadie Manufacturing Company Limited; it was based in Snow Hill, Birmingham.[5][6] Later, in 1907, after serious losses from their newly floated Enfield Autocar business, Eadie Manufacturing and its pedal-cycle component business was absorbed by BSA.[7] Years later, the BSA chairman was to tell shareholders that the acquisition had "done wonders for the cycle department".[8] Eadie still retained a separate identity when Raleigh bought BSA's cycle interests in 1957.[9]
