Frank has a meek disposition and is uncomfortable upon learning his father's identity publicly in front of the whole of Camp Jupiter. He suspected himself a son of Apollo, given his skill with a bow and arrow. On his quest in The Son of Neptune, and later during the series as well, he uses an enchanted spear given to him by Mars. To Frank's surprise, the spear summons a skeleton warrior that defeats the basilisks. Frank calls this skeleton "Gray".
