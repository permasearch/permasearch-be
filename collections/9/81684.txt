McGraw released the video to the song on his Facebook page on January 21, 2016.[5] At the time of the video release, the song was expected to be released as the second single from the album in early February.[5] The video was the result of a brainstorm McGraw had while running on a treadmill and seeing a 30-second trailer for Oprah Winfrey's Belief series. After taking some initiative, McGraw got Winfrey to avail footage for the video.[6] The video, which was directed by Wes Edwards, featured scenes from around the world from Winfrey's fall 2015 documentary series.[3] The video won the top honor, "Video of the Year", at the 2016 CMT Music Awards.[7]
