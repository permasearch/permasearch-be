In June 2006, Variety reported that New Line Cinema, with producers Neal Moritz and Roy Lee, intended to produce a new American film adaptation of Battle Royale.[20] However, New Line never secured remake rights and following the Virginia Tech massacre in April 2007, Lee stated that prospects for the project had been "seriously shaken."[21] In 2012, Lee stated a remake would no longer be possible due to the release of the film adaptation of The Hunger Games, which has been criticized for its similarities to Battle Royale, stating that: "Audiences would see it as just a copy of Games â€” most of them wouldn't know that Battle Royale came first. It's unfair, but that's reality." However, he stated that he might return to the film in ten years to "develop a Battle Royale movie for the next generation."[22]
