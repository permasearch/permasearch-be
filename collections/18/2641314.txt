All CGI sequences are storyboarded before getting superimposed onto the live footage of the miniatures. Each set is then individually scanned as a 3D print to provide reference for the CGI elements to be accurately registered within the environments. This is followed by rough computer modelling of CGI elements needed for the sequence. Details are then introduced, including as textures, craft setup, atmospheric particles and flying debris. The UK-based company Milk VFX is responsible for the final composition.[11]
