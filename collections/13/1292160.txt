Bob Hugin launched his primary campaign on February 13 in Springfield.[13] He began advertising on television two weeks later, attacking Menendez on the airwaves[14] and was soon considered the presumptive nominee.[15] His opponent, Brian Goldberg, attempted to connect himself to President Donald Trump and his supporters by inserting the President's abbreviated slogan, "MAGA", in to his ballot slogans and aligning himself with other pro-Trump, anti-establishment candidates.[16] Goldberg also attacked Hugin's running mates, urging Republicans to write-in the deceased Charlton Heston in primary races where a Republican congressional candidate was running unopposed.[17] Ultimately, Hugin won overwhelmingly with a majority of votes in each of the state's 21 counties.[18]
