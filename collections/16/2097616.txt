The invasion was legitimised by the provisions of the Papal Bull Laudabiliter, issued by Adrian IV in 1155. The bull encouraged Henry to take control in Ireland in order to oversee the financial and administrative reorganisation of the Irish Church and its integration into the Roman Church system.[47] Some restructuring had already begun at the ecclesiastical level following the Synod of Kells in 1152.[48] There has been significant controversy regarding the authenticity of Laudabiliter,[49] and there is no general agreement as to whether the bull was genuine or a forgery.[50][51]
