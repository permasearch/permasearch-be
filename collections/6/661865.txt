As the Indira Gandhi National Widow Pension Scheme (IGNWPS) only covers widows aged 40–59, some State Governments have launched state widow pension schemes. In Chhattisgarh, the Sukhad Sahara Yojana provides a monthly pension to all widows aged 18–50.[12] The Lakshmi Bai Pension Yojana[13] in Bihar covers all widows above 18 years of age whose annual family income is below ₹60,000 (US$920).
