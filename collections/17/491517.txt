Following the two song competition in 2011, the rules were changed once more. The number of nominations is now contingent upon the number of submissions. Depending on the amount received by the Academy there would be five, three or no nominations each year.[7] Since then, there have always been five nominees, except in 2013 when one was disqualified.
