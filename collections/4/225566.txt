The hymn "Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep", with words written in the 1830s by Emma Willard and tune by Joseph Philip Knight,[7][8] was recorded several times around the start of the twentieth century, by the Original Bison City Quartet before 1894,[9] the Standard Quartette in 1895,[10] John W. Myers at about the same time,[11] and Gus Reed in 1908.[12] By that time, the specific phrase "rocking and rolling" was also used by African Americans in spirituals with a religious connotation.[2] The earliest known recording of the phrase in use was on a 1904 Victor phonograph record, "The Camp Meeting Jubilee" by the Haydn Quartet,[13] with the words "We've been rockin' an' rolling in your arms/ Rockin' and rolling in your arms/ Rockin' and rolling in your arms/ In the arms of Moses." Another version was issued on the Little Wonder record label in 1916. "Rocking" was also used to describe the spiritual rapture felt by worshippers at certain religious events, and to refer to the rhythm often found in the accompanying music.[2]
