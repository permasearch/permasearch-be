After the departure of Fey, Poehler continued as co-anchor along with new co-anchor Seth Meyers for the 2006â€“2007 season.[8] The duo began a string of running gags, including "Really!?! with Seth and Amy", in which the pair lambast celebrities for lack of common sense. Poehler left SNL in fall 2008 to give birth to her first child.
