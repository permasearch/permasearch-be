On 17 July 2007, as part of the financing for the Tussauds deal, Merlin sold the freehold of Madame Tussauds to private investor Nick Leslau and his investment firm Prestbury under a sale and leaseback agreement.[21] Although the attraction sites are owned by Prestbury, they are operated by Merlin based on a renewable 35-year lease.[22]
