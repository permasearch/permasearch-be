The guns at Five Forks and part of Steuart's brigade still held the intersection.[222] Colonel Pegram had posted his three guns to the west of Ford's Road in a little salient as directed by Pickett, then went to sleep.[240][241] When the firing started, Pegram woke up and rushed to the Five Forks intersection.[240] Pegram's three cannon fired at the charging Union cavalrymen, who were firing at the artillerists with repeating carbines.[198] Pegram rode out between the guns to give orders without dismounting and, after shouting "Fire your canister low, men!," was mortally wounded.[198][199][210][242] Pegram died the following morning.[243]
