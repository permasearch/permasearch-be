Best Buy debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in 1987.[25][26] In 1989, the company introduced a new store concept dubbed “Concept II.”[21][25] Concept II replaced dimly lit industrial-style stores with brighter and more fashionably fixtured stores.[21] Stores also began placing all stock on the sales floor rather than in a stock room, had fewer salespersons and provided more self-help product information for its customers.[25][26] Best Buy also did away with commissioned salespeople.[19][25] The commission-free sales environment “created a more relaxed shopping environment free of the high-pressure sales tactics used in other stores,” but was unpopular with salespersons and suppliers.[25] Some suppliers, such as Maytag, Whirlpool and Sony, were upset that salespeople would no longer be pushing their products and stopped selling their wares in Best Buy stores.[19][20] The suppliers returned after Best Buy’s sales and revenue grew following the roll-out of Concept II.[24]
