In Torcaso v. Watkins (1961), the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution prohibits states and the federal government from requiring any kind of religious test for public office. In the Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet (1994),[12] The Court concluded that "government should not prefer one religion to another, or religion to irreligion."[13] In a series of cases in the first decade of the 2000s—Van Orden v. Perry (2005),[14] McCreary County v. ACLU (2005),[15] and Salazar v. Buono (2010)[16]—the Court considered the issue of religious monuments on federal lands without reaching a majority reasoning on the subject.
