Fire Station Museum - Housed in the 1940 WPA-financed fire station, changing exhibits from the permanent collection include nature and history displays of butterflies, bird eggs, violins, toys, seashells, antique tools, wood carvings, and Native American artifacts. The dental chair and equipment that were once used by Dr. Con Smith in Mount Vernon is on display. Exhibits upstairs include a collection of bird eggs and Native American artifacts from Franklin County and other parts of Texas and a collection of butterflies. The museum is one of only 13 museums holding eggs of the extinct Carolina parakeet, heath hen, and passenger pigeon. An exhibit of sports memorabilia related to the life and career of home-town boy and pro-football legend Don Meredith is also housed here. The museum is open Thursday through Saturday, 10 A.M. to 2 P.M., and otherwise by appointment. It is located at 111 S. Kaufman Street.
