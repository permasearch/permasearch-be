Usurper King Zant (僭王ザント, Senō Zanto) is a member of the Twili who willingly offered himself to Ganondorf, whom he saw as a god, so he could have the means to depose Midna and begin an invasion of Hyrule. Though Midna recruits Link to help her collect Fused Shadows so she can regain both her original form and her birthright as the ruler of the Twili, Zant reveals the curse he placed on Midna is Ganondorf's after being fatally wounded. Though Zant claims he would be revived while being subsequently destroyed by a furious Midna, Zant's death is assured with Ganondorf's. The final battle against Zant involves fighting him in the arenas of other bosses and sub-bosses in the game such as Blizzeta, before fighting him in a final sword fight in front of Hyrule castle. During the events of Hyrule Warriors, Zant is summoned from the past by Cia to fight for her before becoming a follower of the revived Ganondorf.
