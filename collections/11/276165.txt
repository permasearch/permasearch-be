Many power poles and trees were downed by the tornadoes near Maple City, and one of the EF2 tornadoes rolled a manufactured home.[38] Numerous severe thunderstorms, including several tornadoes, impacted the Northeastern United States the following day. An EF2 tornado snapped many large trees and damaged businesses in Kent, New York. The towns of Oxford, Connecticut and Patterson, New York sustained minor damage from EF1 tornadoes as well.
