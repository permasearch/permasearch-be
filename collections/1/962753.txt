There were four German offensives, codenamed Michael, Georgette, Gneisenau, and BlÃ¼cher-Yorck. Michael was the main attack, which was intended to break through the Allied lines, outflank the British forces, which held the front from the Somme River to the English Channel and defeat the British Army. Once that was achieved, it was hoped that the French would seek armistice terms. The other offensives were subsidiary to Michael and were designed to divert Allied forces from the main offensive effort on the Somme.
