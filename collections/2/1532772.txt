As with many of the other prophets,[5] there is no external evidence to directly associate composition of the book with a prophet by the name of Zephaniah.[1] Some scholars, such as Kent Harold Richards and Jason DeRouchie, consider the words in Zephaniah to reflect a time early in the reign of King Josiah (640–609 BCE) before his reforms of 622 BCE took full effect,[6][2] in which case the prophet may have been born during the reign of Manasseh[6] (698/687–642 BCE).[7] Others agree that some portion of the book is postmonarchic,[8] that is, dating to later than 586 BCE when the Kingdom of Judah fell in the Siege of Jerusalem.[7] Some who consider the book to have largely been written by a historical Zephaniah have suggested that he may have been a disciple of Isaiah because of the two books' similar focus on rampant corruption and injustice in Judah.[6]
