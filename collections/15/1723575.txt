In Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (1686), Isaac Newton gave a theoretical explanation for the "bulging equator" which also explained the differences found in the lengths of the "second pendulums",[19] theories that were confirmed by the Académie's expedition to Peru in 1735.[20][Note 3]
