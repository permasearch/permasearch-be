Miss America is a competition that is held annually and is open to women from the United States between the ages of 17 and 25.[2] Originating in 1921 as a "bathing beauty revue", the contest is now judged on competitors' talent performances and interviews.  As of 2018, there is no longer a swimsuit portion to the contest, or consideration of physical appearance.[3]  Miss America travels about 20,000 miles a month, changing her location every 24 to 48 hours, touring the nation and promoting her particular platform of interest.[4] The winner is crowned by the previous year's titleholder.
