HICS incident management team charts depict the hospital command functions that have been identified and represent how authority and responsibility are distributed within the incident management team. In the 2014 HICS Guidebook, the term "incident management team" was changed to "hospital incident management team" or "HIMT", in order to eliminate any potential for confusion with other response agencies that may be deployed to aid in managing the incident. The following link provides the most updated HIMT organizational chart. [1][2]
