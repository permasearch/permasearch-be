There exist a number of former US Navy ships which are museum ships (not listed here), some of which may be US government-owned. One of these, USSÂ Constitution, a three-masted tall ship, is one of the original six frigates of the United States Navy. It is the oldest naval vessel afloat, and still retains its commission (and hence is listed here), as a special commemoration for that ship alone.
