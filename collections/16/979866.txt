In the DC Rebirth reboot, Wonder Woman's origin is retold in the "Year One" storyline. A group of people called the "Sear" terrorize a mall where Diana and her friends are exploring. They have been infected with the Maru Virus which causes them to lash out in homicidal rage, though Diana and Steve Trevor are able to defeat them and Barbara Ann Minerva discovers 'Sear' is an anagram of 'Ares.'
