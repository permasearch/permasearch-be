The Five Nights at Freddy's games have proven popular to be played by video streamers to their audience, so as to capture the players' jump scares and other frightened reactions, becoming a common game for Let's Play videos. Popular video streamers such as PewDiePie, Markiplier, and Jacksepticeye helped the games to receive additional attention through their playthroughs.[3][143] In May 2015, YouTube reported that playthroughs of the Five Nights at Freddy's series were the eighth most-watched of all video game series on the service.[144] Channels such as Game Theory do occasionally feature Five Nights at Freddy's related videos, although they seldom provide gameplay footage, giving more attention to discussion of the game.[145]
