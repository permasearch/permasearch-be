Under Bill C-37 which went into force on 17 April 2009, every person born outside of Canada as the first generation born abroad (i.e. born to a Canadian parent who derives their citizenship from birth or naturalization in Canada) on or after 17 April 2009 is automatically a Canadian citizen by descent at birth. The Bill also granted Canadian citizenship, for the first time, to children of former Canadian citizens whose citizenship was restored on that day (which was every person who involuntarily lost Canadian citizenship under the 1947 Act). On 11 June 2015, Bill C-24 further granted Canadian citizenship by descent to children of British subjects who were born or naturalized in Canada but never had Canadian citizenship. The acquisition of citizenship under both bills is not retroactive to birth.[9]
