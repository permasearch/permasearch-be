In 1968, Reprise planned to release a series of 78Â rpm singles from their artists on their label at the time, called the Reprise Speed Series. Only one disc actually saw release, Randy Newman's "I Think It's Going to Rain Today", a track from his self-titled debut album (with "The Beehive State" on the flipside).[32] Reprise did not proceed further with the series due to a lack of sales for the single, and a lack of general interest in the concept.[33]
