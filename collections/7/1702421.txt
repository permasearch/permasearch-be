Modern developments have changed the insurance coverage terms, availability, and pricing.[2] Homeowner's insurance has been relatively unprofitable, due in part to catastrophes such as hurricanes as well as regulators' reluctance to authorize price increases.[2] Coverages have been reduced instead and companies have diverged from the former standardized model ISO forms.[2] Water damage due to burst pipes in particular has been restricted or in some cases entirely eliminated.[2] Other restrictions included time limits, complex replacement cost calculations (which may not reflect the true cost to replace), and reductions in wind damage coverage.[2]
