The second curing salt blend is called "prague powder II" or "insta-cure #2".  Also colored pink to differentiate it from table salt, it contains 6.25% sodium nitrite, 4% sodium nitrate, and 89.75% table salt..  This mixture is used for dry sausages that require a longer drying period which requires the presence of nitrate.[15]
