There is no way to choose a positive integer at random so that each positive integer occurs with equal probability, but statements about "randomly chosen integers" such as the ones above can be formalized by using the notion of natural density. For each positive integer N, let PN be the probability that two randomly chosen numbers in     { 1 , 2 , … , N }   {\displaystyle \{1,2,\ldots ,N\}}   are coprime. Although PN will never equal     6  /   π  2     {\displaystyle 6/\pi ^{2}}   exactly, with work[9] one can show that in the limit as     N → ∞   {\displaystyle N\to \infty }  , the probability      P  N     {\displaystyle P_{N}}   approaches     6  /   π  2     {\displaystyle 6/\pi ^{2}}  .
