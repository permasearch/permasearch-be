The parkland was first developed as the host site of the Chicago World's Fair in 1893, memorialized today by the Statue of The Republic. The Museum of Science and Industry resides in the remaining "palace" in the park from that era, and a Japanese garden traces its history to the fair. The park includes woodland trails, playing fields, a beach, golf course, and a boat harbor. It is the future site of the Barack Obama Presidential Center and library.
