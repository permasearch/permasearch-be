Hannibal, aware of the situation, sent a number of embassies to the Gallic tribes in the Po valley. In 220Â BC, he had begun to communicate intimately with the Padane Gauls (called the "Padane Gauls" because the Po in this era was called the "Padus" by the Romans), and these embassies brought with them offers of money, food and guides to the Carthaginian.[34]
