The Black Forest was visited on several occasions by Count Otto von Bismarck during his years as Prussian and later German chancellor (1862â€“1890). Allegedly, he especially was interested in the Triberg Waterfalls.[26] There is now a monument in Triberg dedicated to Bismarck, who apparently enjoyed the tranquility of the region as an escape from his day-to-day political duties in Berlin.
