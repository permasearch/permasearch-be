A Ryan Seacrest Type (voiced by Adam Conover) is the name of a human character who hosts "Excess Hollywood" (later renamed "Excess Hollywoo" after BoJack steals the D in the Hollywood Sign and the D is accidentally destroyed in a helicopter crash) and interviews celebrities. He also hosts "Morning Time, Hollywoo" with a female human called Some Lady. In the third season, he is run over by BoJack driving a limo. He is later revealed to have somehow survived and hosts a late night talk show as well as co-hosting Excess Hollywoo with "A Billy Bush Type" (voiced by Kevin Bigley). He briefly co-anchors the ski race between Mr. Peanutbutter and Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz with Tom Jumbo-Grumbo, but quits after being sensitive to the cold weather.
