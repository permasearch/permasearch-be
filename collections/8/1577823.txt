Air traffic has continued to grow during the 2010s with 3,385,794 passengers recorded in 2011. After a European Union investigation into high subsidies being granted to Ryanair on their scheduled routes, the airliner pulled out of Villafranca Airport in 2012. This caused a reduction in passenger traffic in 2013.[1][2]
