He asks Pooja if she is coming for the party at the night, Pooja says she will have to take permission from her dad and only if he allows her, she will come. Ronit tells Pooja that he will be waiting for her. Pooja smiles and leaves. Accha hai, Ronit aur Pooja. Akash comes there and asks Ronit whether he told Pooja about how he got the slides - Ronit says No and Akash is surprised. He tells him that he should have told her.
