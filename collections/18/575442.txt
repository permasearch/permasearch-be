Agriculture remained by far the most important part of the English economy during the 12thÂ and 13th centuries.[16] There remained a wide variety in English agriculture, influenced by local geography; in areas where grain could not be grown, other resources were exploited instead.[48] In the Weald, for example, agriculture centred on grazing animals on the woodland pastures, whilst in the Fens fishing and bird-hunting was supplemented by basket-making and peat-cutting.[49] In some locations, such as Lincolnshire and Droitwich, salt manufacture was important, including production for the export market.[50] Fishing became an important trade along the English coast, especially in Great Yarmouth and Scarborough, and the herring was a particularly popular catch; salted at the coast, it could then be shipped inland or exported to Europe.[51] Piracy between competing English fishing fleets was not unknown during the period.[50] Sheep were the most common farm animal in England during the period, their numbers doubling by the 14th century.[52] Sheep became increasingly widely used for wool, particularly in the Welsh borders, Lincolnshire and the Pennines.[52] Pigs remained popular on holdings because of their ability to scavenge for food.[18] Oxen remained the primary plough animal, with horses used more widely on farms in the south of England towards the end of the 12th century.[18] Rabbits were introduced from France in the 13th century and farmed for their meat in special warrens.[53]
