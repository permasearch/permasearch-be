Old English borrowed Latin Y to write the native Old English sound /y/ (previously written with the rune yr ᚣ). The name of the letter may be related to 'ui' (or 'vi') in various medieval languages;[citation needed] in Middle English it was 'wi' /wiː/,[citation needed] which through the Great Vowel Shift became the Modern English 'wy' /waɪ/.
