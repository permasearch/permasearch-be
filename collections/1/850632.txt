In 2003, the AH-64 participated in the invasion of Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom.[114] On 24 March 2003, 31 Apaches were damaged, one shot down and its crew captured, in an unsuccessful attack on an Iraqi Republican Guard armored brigade near Karbala.[115] Iraqi tank crews had set up a "flak trap" among terrain and effectively employed their guns.[116][117] Iraqi officials claimed a farmer with a Brno rifle shot down the Apache,[118] but the farmer denied involvement.[119] The helicopter came down intact and both the pilot and co-pilot were captured.[116] The AH-64D was destroyed via air strike the following day.[120][121]
