To protect and maintain the elk population in the future, the DeBar Mountain Game Refuge was established within the Forest Preserve.[17] It should be noted that this act of preserving the species was motivated for hunting purposes rather than an ecological or natural aspect.[17] The Game Refuge was defined by a wire fence, numerous postings, and caretakers employed by the State.[17] This effort to control nature was also observed in the actions of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), work crews who established access roads and water supply expansion.[17]
