In the Philippines, civilians salute to the national flag during flag raising and upon hearing the Philippine National Anthem by standing at attention and doing the same hand-to-heart salute as their American, Italian, Nigerian, and South African counterparts. People wearing hats or caps must bare their heads and hold the headwear over their heart. Members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the Philippine National Police and the Philippine Coast Guard and sometimes airline pilots and civilian ship crews, meanwhile do the traditional military salutes if they are in uniform on duty; off-duty personnel do the hand-to-heart salutes. During the Martial Law years from 1972â€“1981 up to the 1986 EDSA Revolution, the "clenched fist" salute was done during the singing and playing of the National Anthem by some groups.
