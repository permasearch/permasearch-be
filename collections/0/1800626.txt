Stanislavski's attitude to the use of emotion memory in rehearsals (as distinct from its use in actor training) had shifted over the years.[256] Ideally, he felt, an instinctive identification with a character's situation should arouse an emotional response.[257] The use of emotion memory in lieu of that had demonstrated a propensity for encouraging self-indulgence or hysteria in the actor.[257] Its direct approach to feeling, Stanislavski felt, more often produced a block than the desired expression.[257] Instead, an indirect approach to the subconscious via a focus on actions (supported by a commitment to the given circumstances and imaginative "Magic Ifs") was a more reliable means of luring the appropriate emotional response.[258]
