The characters below are not canonical to the Street Fighter storyline. Arika, a company formed of former Capcom employees, owns the characters and the copyright to them.[79] Series producer Yoshinori Ono originally said that the possibility of them appearing in future titles had not been ruled out, stating that Capcom still has a good relationship with Arika,[80] but he has since amended his stance stating that the chances of the characters coming back are very small.[81] A new fighting game featuring these characters, Fighting EX Layer, is currently being developed by Arika.[82]
