How the word "chocolate" came into Spanish is not certain. The authority on the Spanish language, the Royal Spanish Academy, derives it from the Nahuatl word "xocolatl" (pronounced [ ʃoˈkolaːtɬ]) made up from the words "xococ" meaning sour or bitter, and "atl" meaning water or drink.[15] However, as William Bright noted[16] the word "chocolatl" doesn't occur in central Mexican colonial sources making this an unlikely derivation. Santamaria[17] gives a derivation from the Yucatec Maya word "chokol" meaning hot, and the Nahuatl "atl" meaning water. More recently Dakin and Wichman derive it from another Nahuatl term, "chicolatl" from Eastern Nahuatl meaning "beaten drink".[18] They derive this term from the word for the frothing stick, "chicoli". The word xocoatl means beverage of maize.[19] The words "cacaua atl" mean drink of cacao.[19] The word "xocolatl" does not appear in Molina's dictionary.[19]
