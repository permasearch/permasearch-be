This mosaic cycle depicts in the three sections above the high altar, the Last Judgement with a gigantic, majestic Christ and the Angels of Judgement at each side by Coppo di Marcovaldo, the rewards of the saved leaving their tomb in joy (at Christ's right hand), and the punishments of the damned (at Christ's left hand). This last part is particularly famous: evil doers are burnt by fire, roasted on spits, crushed with stones, bit by snakes, gnawed and chewed by hideous beasts.
