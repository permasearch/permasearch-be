The music video for "Yellow Flicker Beat" was directed by Emily Kai Bock,[26] and was released on 7 November 2014 at midnight (NZDT), when Lorde turned eighteen years old.[27] The video starts with Lorde singing in a faintly lit motel room, where her hair is done up in a pompadour. Afterwards, the clip showcases Lorde in several different locations: a kitchen, a highway, an airplane hangar and a 1920s-inspired cocktail party.[28] For each location, Lorde is seen with different styles, costumes and makeups.[29] During several scenes, Lorde "shows off her twitchy, witchy dance moves."[30]
