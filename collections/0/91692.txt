Other names for the vascular cambium are the main cambium, wood cambium, or bifacial cambium. In more detail, the vascular cambium is a plant tissue located between the xylem and the phloem in the stems and roots of certain vascular plants.[1]:125 It is a cylinder of unspecialized meristem cells that divide to form secondary vascular tissues. It is the source of both secondary xylem growth inwards towards the pith,[2] and secondary phloem growth outwards to the bark. Unlike the xylem and phloem, it does not transport water, minerals or food through the plant.[2]
