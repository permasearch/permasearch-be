In deprived areas, Victorian houses were often very small, for example, back-to-back houses built in extremely cramped conditions.  Some of these areas became slums or 'rookeries', and were later cleared. Some smaller, two-up two-down houses still survive, for example in Salford, Greater Manchester.
