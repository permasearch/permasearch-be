A disadvantage of timing belts is the need for regular replacement of the belt.[14] Recommended belt life varies between designs; belts made from neoprene for older vehicles might have a recommended life of around 20,000 miles (32,000 km) while newer designs with lower torque loading and made from hydrogenated nitrile butadiene rubber (HNBR) may have a recommended life of 60,000 miles (97,000 km) or more.[15] By 2004, the range for timing belt life for new engine designs was 60,000–100,000 miles (97,000–161,000 km), with some designs having no fixed replacement schedule but with continued use based on visual inspection.[16] Torque loading, vibration, oil, heat and dirt reduce belt life.[14] Timing belts are regularly replaced during engine overhauls.[17]
