The Hawaiian language has about 2,000 native speakers, about 0.15% of the total population.[122] According to the United States Census, there were over 24,000 total speakers of the language in Hawaii in 2006–2008.[123] Hawaiian is a Polynesian member of the Austronesian language family.[122] It is closely related to other Polynesian languages, such as Marquesan, Tahitian, Māori, Rapa Nui (the language of Easter Island), and less closely to Samoan and Tongan.[citation needed]
