Newman initially felt that the song was not suitable for the film because he doubted that children would be interested in sitting through it, but was ultimately convinced otherwise. The song was offered to McLachlan after Newman and the filmmakers determined that it would be more appropriate to have a woman sing the song. "When She Loved Me" is a pop song backed by simple musical accompaniment. Various interpretations have been offered about its lyrics; while the song is about losing a friend, it has also been interpreted as a love song, while some music journalists have said that the song can be about children growing up and becoming independent from their parents.
