Upinder Singh states that the Rig Veda is familiar with slavery, referring to enslavement in course of war or as a result of debt. She states that the use of dasa (Sanskrit: दास) and dasi in later times were used as terms for male and female slaves, suggests that initially ethnic differences may have been an important basis of enslavement. She adds that hymns in praise of gifts (dana-stutis) in later Rig Vedic books mention gifts of cows, horses, chariots, gold, clothes and female slaves given by kings to priests.[25]
