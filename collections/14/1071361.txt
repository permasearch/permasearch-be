In Love and Death was recorded at Foxy Studios in Los Angeles, California with producer John Feldmann[7] in mid-March.[5] Feldmann also acted as an engineer with assistance from Mark Blewett and Alan Hessler.[7] Throughout most of the sessions, the band members argued about the album's direction, and had a confrontation with Feldmann on multiple occasions. Steineckert explained that there was "always some kind of butting-heads going on, whether it was big or little stuff", which "created this underlying tension throughout the record".[8] In addition, two of McCracken's close friends died during the sessions. McCracken said "everything that went into the record — me having lost two friends, tension within the band and tension with our producer — was mostly positive because it all made the songs come together like magic".[8]
