The exact ethnic genealogy of Naraka is in dispute, with authors such as N N Vasu and K L Barua claiming he was Dravidian,[10] whereas authors like P C Choudhury consider him to be of Alpine origin.[11] Since the claim to Naraka's lineage was made at the end of the Varman dynasty (Bhaskarvarman);[12] and since it was natural for the ruling house to fabricate a respectable lineage,[13] authors like Sircar refuse to give much importance to these claims.[14]
