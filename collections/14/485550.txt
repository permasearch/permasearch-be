The river was mentioned by Ptolemy in the second century AD as Namade[15] and by the author of the Periplus.[16][17] The Ramayana,[18] the Mahabharat, and the Puranas refer to it frequently. The Rewa Khand of Vayu Purana and the Rewa Khand of Skanda Purana are entirely devoted to the story of the birth and the importance of the river, and hence Narmada is also called the Rewa.
