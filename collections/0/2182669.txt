This section includes events that entail the mass killings of political opposition (such as those of certain ideology, class or just someone protesting the government) in what are sometimes called "Red" or "White" Terrors depending on who is committing them and the type of opposition they target (Red = Communist, White = Anti-Communist/Nationalist). Another term used to refer to these types of killing is politicide. This list is incomplete; please help by adding to it. See also Red Terror (disambiguation), White Terror, and Politicide.
