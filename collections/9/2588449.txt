The Importation Act 1822 decreed that corn could be imported when the price of domestically harvested corn rose to 80/- (£4) per quarter but that the import of corn would again be prohibited when the price fell to 70/- per quarter. After this Act was passed, the corn price never rose to 80/- until 1828. In 1827 the landlords rejected Huskisson's proposals for a sliding scale, and during the next year Huskisson and the new Prime Minister, the Duke of Wellington, devised a new sliding scale for the Importation of Corn Act of 1828 whereby, when domestic corn was 52/- (£2/12/0d or £2.60p) per quarter or less, the duty would be 34/8, (£1/14/8d or £1.73p) and when the price increased to 73/- (£3/13/0d or £3.65p), the duty decreased to 1/- (5p).[13]
