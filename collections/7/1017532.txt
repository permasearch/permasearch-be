Jesse and Mike scout a house selling the blue meth from the hijacked truck, but Jesse grows impatient and tricks one of the meth users into letting him into the house, where he knocks out the other. Mike notices the message "Ready to talk?" written on the stolen container in Spanish. Gus meets with Mike at a diner that night and decides to try and negotiate with the cartel; incidentally, Gus seems impressed with Jesse's actions at the house and tells Jesse why he gave him another chance, saying "I like to think I see things in people." Skyler arrives home and demands that Walter return Junior's car, as buying lavish things threatens their cover story, saying "someone has to protect this family from the man who protects this family" (i.e., Walter).
