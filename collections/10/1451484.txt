Hugh Ross Williamson[12] argues that the man in the iron mask was actually the real father of Louis XIV, as opposed to the traditional interpretation that Louis XIII was the father. According to this theory, the "miraculous" birth of Louis XIV in 1638 would have come after Louis XIII had been estranged from his wife for 14 years. Furthermore, Louis XIII was old, weak, ill, and not expected to live much longer, and thus may have been impotent at the time, implying that he was not the father.
