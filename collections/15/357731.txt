The Responsibility to Protect differs from humanitarian intervention in four important ways. First, humanitarian intervention only refers to the use of military force, whereas R2P is first and foremost a preventive principle that emphasizes a range of measures to stem the risk of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing or crimes against humanity before the crimes are threatened or occur. The use of force may only carried out as a measure last resort, when all other non-coercive measures have failed, and only when it is authorized by the UN Security Council.[30] This is in contrast to the principle of 'humanitarian intervention', which allows for the use of force as a humanitarian imperative without the authorization of such bodies like the Security Council.
