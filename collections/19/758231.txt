On January 6, 1853, Governor Thomas Brown signed a bill that provided public support for higher education in Florida.[18] Gilbert Kingsbury was the first person to take advantage of the legislation, and established the East Florida Seminary, which operated until the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861. The East Florida Seminary was Florida's first state-supported institution of higher learning.[19]
