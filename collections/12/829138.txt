The record was released worldwide on October 6.[40] The album's lyric booklet was printed on Bible paper, with the lyrics also formatted to resemble biblical text.[41] The record was mastered by Brian Lucey,[41] the engineer who masters the majority of Bates' soundtrack work. He was chosen because, according to Manson, the album contains "some extreme experiments with sound. We were very particular in not allowing someone else to master it, who might accidentally eliminate them. We've got some very intense, alchemical, scientific, binaural sounds that sometimes even make me have a panic attack while I'm listening to it."[22] These sounds are most prevalent in the title track and "Saturnalia", which Manson highlighted as centerpieces of the record.[42] Japanese editions of the album contain a Mystery Skulls remix of "Kill4Me" as a bonus track.[43]
