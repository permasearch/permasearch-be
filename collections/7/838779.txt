Several major temples in Hampi have an embedded kitchen and 100-or-more-pillared feeding halls.[57][58] Hampi also had a dedicated public Bhojana shala (house of food) where numerous thali (dish) were carved in series in a rock on both sides of a water channel. One example is found near an octagonal fountain in the south of the royal centre;[109] according to epigraphical sources, this Hampi bhojan shala was a utada kaluve or "canal connected with eating".[110]
