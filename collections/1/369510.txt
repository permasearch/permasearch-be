The defeat of the English opened up the north of England to Scottish raids[10] and allowed the Scottish invasion of Ireland.[26] These finally led, after the failure of the Declaration of Arbroath, to reach this end by diplomatic means, to the Treaty of Edinburghâ€“Northampton.[26] Under the treaty the English Crown recognised the full independence of the Kingdom of Scotland, and acknowledged Robert the Bruce, and his heirs and successors, as the rightful rulers.
