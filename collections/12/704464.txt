A second television adaptation was made with Geraldine McEwan as Marple in the TV series, Agatha Christie's Marple and was filmed in Chilham, Kent.[11] It first aired on 12 February 2006.[12] This adaptation changes the personality of Jerry a bit from the novel and sets the story a little later than the novel is set, per a review of the episode:  "Miss Marple, observing the tragic effects of these missives on relationships and reputations, is practically in the background in this story, watching closely as a nihilistic young man (James D'Arcy) comes out of his cynical, alcohol-laced haze to investigate the source of so much misery." and is "set shortly after World War II."[13]
