“This was the inspiration behind the establishment of the Stock Exchange Institute. The growth of this Institute has demonstrated that it fills a real need. Through Institute classes and lectures in New York, and through Correspondence Courses available to those at a distance, instruction is furnished in all important phases of the security business. Through these facilities, any young man or woman may, while working, obtain an education in finance and allied subjects.”
