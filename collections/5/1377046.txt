In the United States Military, end of day or close of business is the time when all scheduled training and administrative work stops. The unit's senior noncommissioned officer may hold a formation at this time. During this formation, guidance is given to the enlisted members, the unit commander may publish information and the unit is given the command fall out, which usually means done for the day. However, some members of the unit, especially maintenance crews, may continue working.
