Sheffield F.C. in Sheffield, England, is the world's oldest surviving independent football club â€“ that is, the oldest club not associated with an institution such as a school, hospital or university. It was founded in 1857.[22] Sheffield F.C. initially played Sheffield rules, a code of its own devising, although the club's rules influenced those of the England Football Association (FA (1863) including handball, free kicks, corners and throw ins. While the international governing body of association football, FIFA and the FA recognise Sheffield F.C. as the "world's oldest football club",[23] and the club joined the FA in 1863, it continued to use the Sheffield rules. Sheffield F.C. did not officially adopt association football until 1877.
