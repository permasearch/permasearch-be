The group of people inhabiting these Islands developed a culture made rich by the abundance of the land and sea. These people became the Haida.  The Haida were a matriarchal society â€“ the women made the decisions prior to European discovery.[citation needed] The Haida are a linguistically distinct group, and they have a complex class and rank system consisting of two main clans: Eagles and Ravens.
