Finally having completed the cut, but at a loss for titles, Wong was listening to a then-recent album by Bryan Ferry and Roxy Music, called Slave To Love: The Very Best Of The Ballads, and noticed a resonance in the song "I'm In the Mood for Love", which shared its title with a popular jazz standard of the mid 20th century. Many of Wong's previous English language titles had come from pop songs, so he found this title particularly appropriate.
