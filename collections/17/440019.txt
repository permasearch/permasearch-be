The name most strongly associated with the particle and field is the Higgs boson[82]:168 and Higgs field. For some time the particle was known by a combination of its PRL author names (including at times Anderson), for example the Brout–Englert–Higgs particle, the Anderson-Higgs particle, or the Englert–Brout–Higgs–Guralnik–Hagen–Kibble mechanism,[Note 17] and these are still used at times.[54][162] Fuelled in part by the issue of recognition and a potential shared Nobel Prize,[162][163] the most appropriate name was still occasionally a topic of debate until 2013.[162] Higgs himself prefers to call the particle either by an acronym of all those involved, or "the scalar boson", or "the so-called Higgs particle".[163]
