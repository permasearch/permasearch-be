Luther and his colleagues introduced the new order of worship during their visitation of the Electorate of Saxony, which began in 1527.[123] They also assessed the standard of pastoral care and Christian education in the territory. "Merciful God, what misery I have seen," Luther wrote, "the common people knowing nothing at all of Christian doctrine ... and unfortunately many pastors are well-nigh unskilled and incapable of teaching."[124]
