Since iron was becoming cheaper and more plentiful, it also became a major structural material following the building of the innovative first iron bridge in 1778. This bridge still stands today as a monument to the role iron played in the Industrial Revolution. Following this, iron was used in rails, boats, ships, aqueducts, and buildings, as well as in iron cylinders in steam engines.[115] Railways have been central to the formation of modernity and ideas of progress[116] and various languages (e.g. French, Spanish, Italien and German) refer to railways as iron road.
