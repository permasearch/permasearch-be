Doctor Morrison (Philip Baker Hall, Seasons 4, 7) is a doctor who treats Larry for a cut he got when Mel Brooks hit him in the head with a door in "Mel's Offer." He returned in "The Hot Towel" to treat a hand injury Larry received due to a hot towel on a flight that Larry thought was "put in the microwave". He ended up giving Larry his personal number to ease the communication between the two, but regretted the decision instantly. He first appeared in "Mel's Offer."
