Some of Georgetown University's professors criticized CSIS staff members for giving academically unsupported assessments of foreign policy issues during public interviews.[21] Donations to Georgetown University decreased because of its association with CSIS.[citation needed] A special committee studied the friction, and its report stated that CSIS was more focused on the media than to scholarly research and recommended that CSIS be formally separated from Georgetown University.[21] On 17 October 1986, Georgetown University's board of directors voted to sever all ties with CSIS.[21]
