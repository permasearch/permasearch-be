It is possible that an early Christian monastic cell was founded on the island in the 6th or 7th century, dedicated to Donn√°n of Eigg, an Irish saint who was martyred on Eigg in April 617. No remains of any Christian buildings survive, though fragments of vitrified stone, subjected to very high temperatures, have been discovered indicating the presence of an Iron Age or early medieval fortification.[5][6]
