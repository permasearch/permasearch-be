Francis I, King of France, allied himself once more with Suleiman I of the Ottoman Empire and on July 12, 1542 declared war on the Holy Roman Empire.[60]  Francis I launched his final invasion of Italy against the town of Perpignan.  A Franco-Ottoman fleet under the command of Ottoman admiral Hayreddin Barbarossa captured the city of Nice on August 22, 1543,[60] and laid siege to the citadel.  The defenders of the citadel were relieved within a month.  For Christian and Islamic troops to act in coordination to attack a Christian town was regarded as shocking.  Thus, in this attack on Nice, King Francis needed to play down the role of the Ottoman Turks.[61]  However, Francis I did something even more scandalous when he turned the French naval port of Toulon over to Barbarossa to use as winter quarters for the Ottoman fleet.[61]
