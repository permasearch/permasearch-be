Treatment initially is typically with pain medications.[2] It is generally recommended that people continue with activities to the best of their abilities.[3] Often all that is required is time: in about 90% of people the problem goes away in less than six weeks.[2] If the pain is severe and lasts for more than six weeks then surgery may be an option.[2] While surgery often speeds pain improvement, long term benefits are unclear.[3] Surgery may be required if complications occur such as bowel or bladder problems.[2] Many treatments, including steroids, gabapentin, acupuncture, heat or ice, and spinal manipulation, have poor evidence for their use.[3][6]
