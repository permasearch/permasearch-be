The American Breed's 2:05 single mix of this song was sped-up during mastering for release, while the widely available original 2:25 version was done at a normal speed. The following year, The American Breed released their last single, "Anyway That You Want Me", which borrowed its title phrase from this hit. Co-songwriter Scott English later went on to write and sing "Brandy", which Barry Manilow later covered as his 1974 breakout hit "Mandy".
