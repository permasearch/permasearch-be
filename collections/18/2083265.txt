The Treaty of Bajor is signed aboard Deep Space Nine in the Season Seven finale, "What You Leave Behind, Part II". The conclusion to the Dominion War arc formed the resolution to Deep Space Nine as a series, and a moment for the production staff to settle the destinies of the main characters. Berman and Behr agreed with Paramount that the final episode of the series should concentrate on human drama rather than the endgame of the Dominion War.[79] Moore opines the production staff succeeded in ensuring the Dominion War acted as a means of deepening characterization.[80] Although further plots would have been scripted had Deep Space Nine continued into an eighth season, Behr accepted the resolution of the Dominion War at the end of Season Seven.[9]
