The Browns won the AAFC's Western Division with their perfect record and faced the Buffalo Bills, the winners of the Eastern Division, in the AAFC championship game.[34] The Bills had tied with the Colts for the lead in the Eastern, forcing a playoff that the Buffalo won on December 12 in Baltimore.[34] The championship game took place in Cleveland in 35-degree weather and was sparsely attended.[35] The Browns were expected to win the game, having beaten the Bills twice in the regular season and possessing a significantly better record than the 7–7 Bills.[34] The scoring began with a late-first-quarter Edgar Jones touchdown run, followed by a fumble return for a touchdown by George Young in the second period that put the Browns ahead 14–0 at halftime.[35] Cleveland scored two more touchdowns in the third quarter on runs by Jones and Motley before Buffalo scored its first points.[35] Aided by a roughing the kicker penalty on the Browns, the Bills capped an 80-yard drive with a short touchdown pass from Jim Still to Al Baldwin.[35] Motley scored two more touchdowns in the fourth quarter, however, and Lou Saban ran back an interception for a third to make the final score 49–7.[35] Motley and Edgar Jones led the Browns offense in the game, accounting for a large share of the team's offensive production.[35] Graham had an uncharacteristically quiet day, passing for just 118 yards on 11 completions.[35] The victory made the Browns the first professional team to win three league championships in a row, following AAFC titles they won in 1946 and 1947.[35] It was also the first time a professional football team finished a full season unbeaten and untied since a championship game was instituted in the NFL in 1933.[34] The Chicago Bears had finished with perfect records in 1934 and 1942, but lost the NFL championship both times.[34] The Browns had won 18 consecutive games stretching to the 1947 season, a professional record that stood until 2004.[36]
