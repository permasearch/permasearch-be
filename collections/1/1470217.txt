Julian B. Rotter, a professor at Ohio State University published his book, Social Learning and Clinical Psychology in 1954.[7] His theories moved away from the strictly behaviorist learning of the past, and considered instead the holistic interaction between the individual and the environment. In his theory, the social environment and individual personality created probabilities of behavior, and the reinforcement of these behaviors led to learning.He emphasized the subjective nature of the responses and effectiveness of reinforcement types.[7] While his theory used vocabulary common to that of behaviorism, the focus on internal functioning and traits differentiated his theories, and can be seen as a precursor to more cognitive approaches to learning.[6]
