After the end of apartheid, from 1995 to 1998, several meetings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission were held in the church, presided over by Archbishop Desmond Tutu.[2] From 1995 on, funds were raised to restore the church. The campaign eventually collected 1.5 million rands, and restorations were made.[3]
