Employment discrimination based on sexual orientation varies by country. Revealing a lesbian sexual orientation (by means of mentioning an engagement in a rainbow organisation or by mentioning one's partner name) lowers employment opportunities in Cyprus and Greece but has, overall, no negative effect in Sweden and Belgium.[70][71][72][73] In the latter country, even a positive effect of revealing a lesbian sexual orientation is found for women at their fertile ages.
