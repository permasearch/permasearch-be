In Isleta Pueblo, the settlers were attacked by the Puebloans, but they were defeated. So Otermin held a ceremony in which he re-established the Spanish power in the region and spared the natives for their actions. Otermin also gave large amounts of corn of local inhabitants, as was claimed by them, although gave scarce amounts in the Isleta.
