Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave Space Jam a thumbs up,[15] as did Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune, although his zeal was more subdued.[16] In his print review, Ebert gave the film 3 1/2 stars, noting, "Space Jam is a happy marriage of good ideasâ€”three films for the price of one, giving us a comic treatment of the career adventures of Michael Jordan, crossed with a Looney Tunes cartoon and some showbiz warfare. ... the result is delightful, a family movie in the best sense (which means the adults will enjoy it, too)."[15] Siskel focused much of his praise on Jordan's performance, saying, "He wisely accepted as a first movie a script that builds nicely on his genial personality in an assortment of TV ads. The sound bites are just a little longer."[16] Leonard Maltin also gave the film a positive review (three stars), stating, "Jordan is very engaging, the vintage characters perform admirably ... and the computer-generated special effects are a collective knockout."[17] Todd McCarthy of Variety praised the film for its humor. He also praised the Looney Tunes' antics and Jordan's acting.[18]
