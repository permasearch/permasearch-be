Kenneth and Kelay, not knowing which hospital Kenji is in, goes to one hospital to another until a much older Lucas comes and tells them that he knows where he is. And so Kenneth and Kelay go in his car. Kenneth then asks Lucas, out of curiosity, if he knows the reason why Athena and his father did not end up together. Lucas says he knew why and decides to finish the story.
