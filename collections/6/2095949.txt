At the 2008 World Championships, O'Sullivan compiled a record-breaking ninth competitive maximum break against Mark Williams.[214] It was his third of the season, and also his third maximum at the Crucible. It was the fourth maximum to be compiled in a winning frame of a match (following those of Hendry, Williams, and O'Sullivan himself). Interviewed by Steve Davis just after beating Williams 13–7, he said "I can finally buy a Bentley Continental GT".[215] Soon after O'Sullivan potted the final black, commentator Dennis Taylor called him a "total genius".[216] However, O'Sullivan's 147 was equalled by Ali Carter in the same tournament, thus halving the prize money.[217] O'Sullivan defeated Liu Chuang, Mark Williams, Liang Wenbo and Stephen Hendry en route to the final of the tournament. After the match, Hendry described O'Sullivan as "the best in the world by a country mile".[218] He then beat Carter 18–8 to win the title on 5 May. In an interview after his third world title win, he hinted again that he might not play in the 2008/2009 season, but also stated that he might go on to pursue many more world titles.[219] At the end of the season O'Sullivan left management company 110sport, to join the Romford-based Grove Leisure.[220]
