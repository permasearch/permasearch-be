Townsville has a younger population than the Australian and Queensland averages.[49] The city has traditionally experienced a high turnover of people, with the army base and government services bringing in many short to medium term workers. The region has also become popular with mine workers on fly in/fly out contracts. In 2005–06, the Townsville Statistical District grew at just over 3 per cent and was the fifth-fastest-growing district or division in Australia.[50] Between 2000 and 2005 the annual average population growth in Townsville was 2.5%, compared with 2.2% for Queensland overall.[43] However, growth has slowed in more recent years with population growth over the 2014–15 period being 1%, compared with the state average of 1.2%.[51]
