The Defence Act was amended May 1964 to provide that National Servicemen could be obliged to serve overseas, a provision that had been applied only once beforeâ€”during World War II. The 1964 amendments applied only to the permanent military forces and excluded the Citizen Military Forces. In 1965, the Defence Act was again amended to require the CMF to serve overseas which was not included in the 1964 amendments.[25] In March 1966, the Government announced that National Servicemen would be sent to South Vietnam to fight in units of the Australian Regular Army and for secondment to American forces.[26] Requirements for overseas service were detailed by the Minister for the Army Malcolm Fraser on 13 May 1966.[27] Men who wished to avoid National Service could join the Citizen Military Forces and serve only inside Australia, claim a student deferment, or attempt a conscientious objection application. To be exempted on the basis of conscientious objection, an applicant needed to demonstrate his moral objection to 'all' wars in court and be legalised as a pacifist. This meant that the rate of success for conscientious objection applications was generally low.[citation needed]
