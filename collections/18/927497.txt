As a result of this "tactical error", Murray's melody appeared, without credit, in several subsequent publications. By 1914, the melody was attributed to "Carl Mueller",[26] and this attribution was repeated several times in other publications.[2] The identity of "Carl Mueller" is unknown, but the tune is widely known as "Mueller" as a result.
