First aired December 18, 2014 Welcome to Hawaii! The players will be competing for two weeks in Kauai, taking advantage of all the island has to offer. The contestants work out on the beach, taking advantages of the water, sand and rocks all around them. Sonya feels great - she's smaller than she was at the height of her softball career and realizes her glory days are now. For some of the contestants, however, it's surreal to be back in a place they've visited while at their heaviest. They missed out on a lot of the opportunities Hawaii has to offer the first time and refuse to repeat the past. Dolvett is concerned about Rob, whom he thinks isn't showing up in full force. Rob isn't feeling well - he's dizzy and blacking out and doesn't want to be here.
