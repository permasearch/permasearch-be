From June 2005 new local numbers in London with an initial "3" like (020) 3222 1234 began to be allocated. Owing to the lingering confusion, people unaware of the correct format are beginning to assume erroneously that there is now a new London code, "0203".  Even some local and national newspapers have given this misinformation.[14][15] Some people report mis-dialling of London 3xxx xxxx numbers, where callers are dialling 0207 in front of the local number part instead of just 020. This call connects to (020) 73xx xxxx (ignoring the final digit) instead of to the expected number.
