During development, the original DirectXbox name was shortened to Xbox. Microsoft's marketing department did not like the Xbox name, and suggested many alternatives.

However, consumer testing revealed that Xbox was preferred by far over the other suggested names and "Xbox" became the official name of the product.[16]
