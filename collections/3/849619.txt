As of 16 August 2006, when Serbia played its first international match as a resurrected national team (against the Czech Republic), the team is called the Орлови (Eagles).[19] The name is referring to the white double-headed eagle found on the coat of arms of Serbia, a national symbol of Serbia and Serbs.
