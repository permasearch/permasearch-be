Smith was born in New Lisbon, Wisconsin, the son of Mabel Annette Lund (nÃ©e Larson) and George Smith.[1]Smith's father was a Major during the Second World War and was killed in Europe.[2]Smith's mother was a fan of a country singer named Kurt (or Curt) in the early 1940s. However, she thought "Kurt Smith" was too short a name, so she added "wood" ("she just tacked it on to the end", he said). Smith has said that he is likely the only Kurtwood.[3] Smith grew up in the San Fernando Valley and graduated from Canoga Park High School of Canoga Park, California in 1961; he was class president in his senior year.[1] Smith graduated from San Jose State University in 1965 with a B.A. and Stanford University in 1969 with an MFA.[4]
