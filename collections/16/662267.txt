Following its launch in November 2003, the computer version of Knights became the third-best-selling computer title of its debut week, according to NPD.[34] Although it dropped out of NPD's weekly top 10 by its third week,[35][36] it claimed sixth place in computer game sales for November overall, and ninth for December.[37] It returned to the weekly top 10 during the December 28-January 3 period,[38] but was absent again on the next week's chart.[39] NPD ultimately declared it the 17th-best-selling computer game of 2004.[40] By August 2006, the computer version had sold 470,000 copies and earned $14.7 million in the United States alone. Edge ranked it as the country's 32nd-best-selling computer game released between January 2000 and August 2006.[41]
