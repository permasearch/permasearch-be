The Wolf also made appearances in other Disney cartoons. In Old King Cole, with the exception of Practical, Fifer, and Fiddler, the Wolf is seen going to Old King Cole's castle with Little Red Riding Hood, and later on, he is seen dancing with Little Red Riding Hood while dancing along with the other Fairy Tale characters during the jamboree in Old King Cole's castle. In Toby Tortoise Returns, Practical and the Wolf made cameo appearances during the boxing match between Toby Tortoise and Max Hare. The Wolf also appeared in Mickey's Polo Team, directed by David Hand and first released on January 4, 1936. The short featured a game of Polo between four of Disney's animated characters (one of whom was the Wolf) and four animated caricatures of noted film actors.
