The only weapon the policeman carried was his truncheon which was four feet long. Then violence would be met with violence, and a local tradition of the police "beating first and arresting after" was formed. The general pattern of law enforcement in the 1840s was, once arrested the police took the accused to the station or if he was recalcitrant, held him and sent to call the sergeant. All police stations were Courthouses as Magistrates travelled from one Police Station to another. This was until 1844 when trial by jury and the English statutes were introduced into Trinidad.
