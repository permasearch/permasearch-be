A significant issue is that as many as 4% of infants are intersex (formerly known as androgynous or hermaphrodite), though it is incredibly difficult to determine the frequency of these cases.[4][5] Gender reveal parties may be problematic for expectant parents whose children's biological sex cannot accurately be assigned before birth, and can set the stage for future issues when the babies will not fit squarely into a pink or blue box.[1] Modern practices in intersex management have moved away from the presumption that infants should be subjected to sex assignment surgery by guesswork shortly after birth, and it is perceived to be more important for children to have the autonomy to match a surgical intervention to their chosen gender.[3] Psychologists believe that a child is able to declare their own gender identity â€œaround age two or three".[3]
