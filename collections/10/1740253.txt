Söderling had a dip in form after poor results in both Rome Masters and Madrid Masters winning just one match against Paolo Lorenzi in Rome. His final tournament before Roland Garros was Open de Nice Côte d'Azur where he was the first seed. There, after receiving bye in the first round, he fell in the second round as Olivier Rochus upset the Swede 6–2, 4–6, 4–6.
