He acted in basement plays in New York's theatrical underground but was rejected for the Actors Studio as a teenager.[6] Pacino then joined the Herbert Berghof Studio (HB Studio), where he met acting teacher Charlie Laughton (not to be confused with the British actor Charles Laughton), who became his mentor and best friend.[6] In this period, he was often unemployed and homeless, and sometimes slept on the street, in theaters, or at friends' houses.[4][13]
