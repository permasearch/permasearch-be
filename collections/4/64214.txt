Clark Kent, Superman's secret identity, was based partly on Harold Lloyd and named after Clark Gable and Kent Taylor.[163][164] Creators have discussed the idea of whether Superman pretends to be Clark Kent or vice versa, and at differing times in the publication either approach has been adopted.[165][166] Although typically a newspaper reporter, during the 1970s the character left the Daily Planet for a time to work for television,[166] whilst the 1980s revamp by John Byrne saw the character become somewhat more aggressive.[159] This aggressiveness has since faded with subsequent creators restoring the mild mannerisms traditional to the character.
