The Weights and Measures Act 1897 made the provision that metric units could be used in addition to the traditional imperial units for purposes of trade.[5][6] In practice, the actual choice of units was restricted by price marking orders which listed packaging sizes and pricing structures that might be used in specific circumstances. For example, as of April 2012, wine for consumption on premises may only be sold in 125, 175, and 250 mL glasses while draught beer may only be sold in ​1⁄3, ​1⁄2, ​2⁄3 and one pint glasses. Prior to 1973, when the United Kingdom joined the EEC, such specifications were almost all in imperial units.
