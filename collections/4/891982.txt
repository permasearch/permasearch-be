In Parade Magazine's 2012 poll, Big Time Rush was voted the "Best Boy Band in the World", topping both One Direction and The Wanted. Over 800,000 votes were cast. The band was featured on the cover of the August 5, 2012 issue of Parade which was a national top seller. An interview and photo set highlighting the group's win that coincided with the honor was featured in the same issue.[24][25][26] The magazine's website also featured the group amongst its list of "Greatest Boy Bands of All-Time", along with NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys. Big Time Rush have been honored and recognized multiple times by major media outlets throughout their time as a group. Due to their extreme worldwide popularity and success(along with being heavily credited as one of the bands that helped bring back the boy band wave)The Washington Times Magazine ranked Big Time Rush Number 15 of their Top 20 Best Boy Bands of the decade in 2012. And number 28 on the POP! Goes The Charts website list of the Top 40 Best Boy Bands of the past 25 years in 2013.[27] To Toronto Sun, Pena talked about the group's impact on both music and television: "I think the music could stand alone, but I don't know if it would be as powerful. The show has definitely been our main audience. We have four million kids watching. So when you put a song out, four million kids hear it. When you put a song on the radio, you're not going to have four million people listening. It's a blessing and a curse being on Nickelodeon â€“ it's gotten us where we are now, though some people are standoffish to us because of that. But we have to be grateful that Nickelodeon gave us this opportunity. Abandoning the show would not be the best idea".[28]
