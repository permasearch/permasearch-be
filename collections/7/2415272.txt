Mavis Baker was a Jamaican woman who lived illegally in Canada for 11 years as a domestic worker. During this time she gave birth to four children in Canada. When the government discovered that she was in Canada illegally she was ordered deported. She brought an application for permanent residence under section 114(2) of the Immigration Act, 1976.  The immigration officer rejected her application without giving reasons. Baker was able to make a request for the immigration officer's notes, and, based on the notes, she applied for judicial review of the decision.
