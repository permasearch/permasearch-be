Shortly after Kiss' first concert at the park, Devereaux attempts to discredit them by unleashing a robotic copy of Gene Simmons to wreak havoc on the park and the security guards. The band is questioned the next day, but no action is taken. Melissa seeks help from the band to find Sam, unaware that the security pass she received from Devereaux is a tracking device. Devereaux has Sam break into the band's lair and steal their talismans, but the plan is foiled due to the force field on the talismans' case. Kiss sneak into the park to confront Devereaux, but they lose their powers and are imprisoned after Sam manages to steal the talismans and Devereaux neutralizes them with a ray gun. Devereaux sends his robotic Kiss copies to ruin their concert and incite a riot, but the real Kiss manage to regain their powers and escape to defeat the imposters and save the concert.
