A similar technology is the Water-Gate Flood barrier, a rapid-response barrier which can be rolled out in a matter of minutes. It is unique in the way that it self deploys using the weight of water to hold it back. The product has been FM Approved following testing from the US Army. It is used in 30 countries around the world, and notably by the Environment Agency in the UK.
