Melvyn Goldstein described Tibet as having had serfdom until 1959,[4][5] but whether or not the Tibetan form of peasant tenancy that qualified as serfdom was widespread is contested by other scholars.[6][7] Bhutan is described by Tashi Wangchuk, a Bhutanese civil servant, as having officially abolished serfdom by 1959, but he believes that less than or about 10% of poor peasants were in copyhold situations.[8]
