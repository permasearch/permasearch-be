Description of "carrying a weapon" as seen from a legal standpoint. "A person commits the offense of carrying a weapon if he or she possesses a handgun, knife, or club on or about his or her person, in a vehicle occupied by him or her, or otherwise readily available for use with a purpose to attempt to UNLAWFULLY employ the handgun, knife, or club as a weapon against a person." the Act's subsections go on to describe the specific circumstances in which one may legally carry that weapon. Though the language in some of Act 746 had created confusion over the legalities of open and concealed carry without a permit with some state officials and law enforcement it has since been amended to correct these confusions and goes on to describe the specific instances and places where it is legal to carry a weapon and in no way legally overrides the law of a license required for conceal carry in the state.
