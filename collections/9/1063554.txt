In traditional music theory, most countries in the world use the naming convention Do–Re–Mi–Fa–Sol–La–Si, including for instance Italy, Spain, France (though in this country Ut substitutes for Do), Romania, most Latin American countries, Greece, Bulgaria, Turkey, Russia, and all the Arabic-speaking or Persian-speaking countries. However, within the English-speaking and Dutch-speaking world, pitch classes are typically represented by the first seven letters of the Latin alphabet (A, B, C, D, E, F and G). A few European countries, including Germany, adopt an almost identical notation, in which H substitutes for B (see below for details). In Indian music the Sanskrit names Sa-Re-Ga-Ma-Pa-Dha-Ni is used, as in Telugu Sa-Re-Ga-Ma-Pa-Da-Ni (స రి గ మ ప ద ని), and in Tamil (ச-ரி-க-ம-ப-த-நி) Byzantium used the names pa-vu-ga-di-ke-zo-ni.
