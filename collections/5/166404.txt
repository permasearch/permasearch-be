Davis disagreed with the majority's view that Congress had consented to the transfer of the two counties when it debated the proposed West Virginia constitution. There was nothing in the debates to ever suggest that, he wrote.[51] What Congress agreed to was that the two counties should be offered the chance to join West Virginia by the time of the new state's admission to union with the United States.[51] These conditions had not been met by the time of admission, and thus no transfer could be constitutionally made.[51] Congress had not agreed to additional legislative acts of transfer, and thus they could not be made without Virginia's assent (which was now withdrawn).[51]
