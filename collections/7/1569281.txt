The episode opens with a combined replay of the black-and-white scenes that led some of the episodes during the second season, which show numerous investigators from the NTSB collecting and cataloging debris, including a half-burnt pink teddy bear, that had fallen around the Whites' neighborhood. In the distance, two columns of smoke can be seen.
