You can "deep link" to a section of an article (or other Wikipedia page), using a hash character (#), then the section's title, with underscore characters (_) replacing spaces. For example, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitten#External_links links to the same section as Kitten#External links. However, be aware that section heading names are case sensitive (i.e. 'External' and 'external' are treated differently). Also, section headings may be renamed or deleted and so such links may break.
