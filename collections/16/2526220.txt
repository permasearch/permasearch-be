I.e., not only      u  A     {\displaystyle u_{A}}   and      u  B     {\displaystyle u_{B}}   must be substituted by α and β, respectively (the first entity means "spin up", the second one "spin down"), but also the sign + by the − sign, and finally ri by the discrete values si (= ±½); thereby we have     α ( + 1  /  2 ) = β ( − 1  /  2 ) = 1   {\displaystyle \alpha (+1/2)=\beta (-1/2)=1}   and     α ( − 1  /  2 ) = β ( + 1  /  2 ) = 0   {\displaystyle \alpha (-1/2)=\beta (+1/2)=0}  . The "singlet state", i.e. the − sign, means: the spins are antiparallel, i.e. for the solid we have antiferromagnetism, and for two-atomic molecules one has diamagnetism. The tendency to form a (homoeopolar) chemical bond (this means: the formation of a symmetric molecular orbital, i.e. with the + sign) results through the Pauli principle automatically in an antisymmetric spin state (i.e. with the − sign). In contrast, the Coulomb repulsion of the electrons, i.e. the tendency that they try to avoid each other by this repulsion, would lead to an antisymmetric orbital function (i.e. with the − sign) of these two particles, and complementary to a symmetric spin function (i.e. with the + sign, one of the so-called "triplet functions"). Thus, now the spins would be parallel (ferromagnetism in a solid, paramagnetism in two-atomic gases).
