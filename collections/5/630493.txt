Chibs was excommunicated from the Real IRA by the group's leader, Jimmy O'Phelan, who out of jealousy scarred Chibs' face, told him never to return to Ireland, stole Chibs' wife Fiona Larkin (who, as shown in Season 2 remains married to and still loves, but is estranged from Chibs), and raised Chibs and Fiona's daughter, Kerrianne. Chibs then joined SAMBEL in Ireland, until he transferred to SAMCRO in the United States, whose Charming charter has Real IRA links via the club's Belfast charter.
