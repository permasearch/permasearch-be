In November 2014, when Gunn said he had the "basic story" for Vol. 2 while working on the first film, he also said he had ideas for a potential third film.[242] Despite this, Gunn was unsure in June 2015 if he would be involved with a third Guardians film, saying it would depend on his feelings after making Vol. 2.[7] In April 2016, Feige said the future MCU films are "still a big chess board for 2020 and beyond, but certainly I would say Guardians 3 is [one film that's] up there. I don't know what exactly the order will be."[243] In March 2017, Gunn stated there would be a third film "for sure. We're trying to figure it out,"[244] also adding, "There are no specific plans for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. But we know unless something goes horribly—which is always possible, you never know—I think that Marvel would want to make another movie."[245] He also reiterated he was still unsure if he would be involved with the film, and that he would figure out his involvement and his next project "over the next couple of weeks."[244] The following month, Gunn announced he would return to write and direct Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.[246] Klementieff is expected to reprise her role as Mantis.[247] Vol. 3 is scheduled to be released in 2020.[248]
