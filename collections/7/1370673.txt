A long and tedious power struggle between the governor and the Assembly had as a consequence that no provincial troops were raised by North Carolina in 1759. The governor vetoed a bill for raising troops for 1760, due to riders he disapproved of. By now the Anglo-Cherokee War, long simmering, finally had erupted into open warfare with a Cherokee attack on Fort Dobbs. The militia refused to serve outside the province's border, and the Assembly reconvened and voted a levy of 300 provincial soldiers for 1760, a reorganization of the militia, and the authorization for its embodiment. At the end of year the Assembly again met and voted to raise 500 men for common action with Virginia and South Carolina against the Cherokees, but once again the governor vetoed the bill.[104] [105] The offensive against the Cherokees were instead supported by North Carolina volunteers, not provincial soldiers; men who served without pay, but was later reimbursed for cash expenditures by the Assembly.[106]
