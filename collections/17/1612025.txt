Anderson and Guinness' story was inspired by several works by the Austrian writer Stefan Zweig, particularly the novella Twenty-Four Hours in the Life of a Woman (1927), the novels Beware of Pity (1939) and The Post Office Girl (1982), and his autobiography The World of Yesterday (1934â€“42).[25][26] Wes Anderson suggested editor Barney Pilling watch Ernst Lubitsch's The Shop Around the Corner and the films of Jacques Tati as references.[27]
