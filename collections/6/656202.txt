Critic Alfred Habegger has written that the main character of Portrait was inspired by Christie Archer, the protagonist from Anne Moncure Crane's novel, Reginald Archer (1871). Crane (1838â€“1872) may have influenced James, who Habegger considers was interested in Crane's female characters.[citation needed]
