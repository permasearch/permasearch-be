Opinion on The Man with the Golden Gun has for the most part remained the same as it was in 1974 and as of November 2015, the film holds a 45% rating from Rotten Tomatoes (although these contain contemporary reviews),[70] while Ian Freer of Empire found the film "an entertaining 007 adventure, something that tonally, if not qualitatively, could happily sit within the Connery era."[71] IGN chose The Man with the Golden Gun as the worst Bond film, claiming it "has a great conceptÂ ... but the execution is sloppy and silly",[72] and Entertainment Weekly chose it as the fourth worst, saying that the "plot is almost as puny as the sidekick".[73] On the other hand, Norman Wilner of MSN chose it as the tenth best, with much praise for Christopher Lee's performance.[74]
