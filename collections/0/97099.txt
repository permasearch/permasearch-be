The new biometric Philippine passport costs 950 pesos (approximately $18) in the Philippines or $60 abroad. Overtime processing for new passports costs an additional 250 pesos. Persons who take advantage of overtime processing get their passports within seven days for applications for Metro Manila (DFA Consular Affairs office, ASEANA, Para√±aque, Alabang Town Center, SM Megamall, and Robinsons Galleria), Pampanga (Marquee Mall, Angeles and DFA Pampanga regional office), DFA Lucena regional office, and Robinsons Lipa, and 15 to 20 days in other provinces. For Filipinos abroad it will take up to 120 days. Passports previously could be amended for 100 pesos (approx. $2.50) in the Philippines or $20 abroad, although machine-readable passports are no longer amendable.
