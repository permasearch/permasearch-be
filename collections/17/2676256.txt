Just wanted to point out a line that isn't true. This line: "However she claims that she has only been using Lelouch so that she can die."  I think whoever wrote this misunderstood what happened in the episode where they reveal her wish. What actually happened was that she couldn't bring herself to make Lelouch immortal. This is also furthered by what happened in episode 21, when she had forsaken Ragnarok, instead choosing to live. Both points show that the above line is apparently incorrect. I am far from a good enough editor to make a substantial change to that, as explaining what she actually thought of Lelouch would be a bit complicated. I'd appreciate it if someone changed it for me.70.95.124.91 (talk) 12:45, 16 September 2008 (UTC)
