Ferns were traditionally classified in the class Filices, and later to phylum, i. e., division of the Plant Kingdom, denominated Pteridophyta or Filicophyta. Pteridophyta is no longer recognised as a valid taxon because it is paraphyletic. The ferns are also referred to as "Polypodiophyta" or, when treated as a subdivision of Tracheophyta (vascular plants), "Polypodiopsida", although this name sometimes only refers to leptosporangiate ferns. Traditionally, all of the spore producing vascular plants were informally denominated the pteridophytes, rendering the term synonymous with "ferns and fern allies". This can be confusing because members of the phylum "Pteridophyta" were also denominated "pteridophytes" (sensu stricto).
