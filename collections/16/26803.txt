In 2017 a permit evader who tried to climb Everest without the 11,000 dollar permit, faced among other penalties a 22,000 dollar fine, bans, and a possible four years in jail after he was caught (he had made it up past the Khumbu icefall).[234] In the end he was given a ten-year mountaineering ban in Nepal and allowed to return home according to the British newspaper Daily Mail.[234] The rogue mountaineer, who in fact had not climbed other mountains, said he was "ecstatic" and that he would try again but buy a permit next time.[234]
