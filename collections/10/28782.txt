There are allegations that Vote Leave broke electoral law and that the breach influenced the result. Kyle Taylor of Fair Vote Project (which aims to rerun the referendum) stated, “let’s take back control of our democracy The issue is too big to have half the country or more than half the country, wonder ‘was that actually the result? Is this the future the country wants?’ That’s first and foremost, let’s be certain, everybody play by the rules.” Taylor maintains further, “on the basis of fairness, it has to be the same vote posed in the same way”.
