Valley of Fire State Park is a public recreation and nature preservation area covering nearly 46,000 acres (19,000 ha) located 16 miles (26 km) south of Overton, Nevada.[3] The state park derives its name from red sandstone formations, the Aztec Sandstone, which formed from shifting sand dunes 150 million years ago.[4] These features, which are the centerpiece of the park's attractions, often appear to be on fire when reflecting the sun's rays.[5] It is Nevada's oldest state park, as commemorated with Nevada Historical Marker #150.[6] It was designated as a National Natural Landmark in 1968.[7]
