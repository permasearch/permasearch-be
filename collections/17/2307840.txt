Frodo did not appear until the third draft of A Long-Expected Party (the first chapter of The Lord of the Rings), when he was named Bingo (after a family of toy koala owned by Tolkien's children), son of Bilbo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck.[1] In the fourth draft, he was renamed Bingo Bolger-Baggins, son of Rollo Bolger and Primula Brandybuck.[2] Tolkien did not change the name to Frodo until the third phase of writing, when much of the narrative, as far as the hobbits' arrival in Rivendell, had already taken shape.[3] Prior to this, the name "Frodo" had been used for the character who eventually became Peregrin Took.[4]
