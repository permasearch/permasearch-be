Seventy-four years before the start of the story, a civil war was waged against the Capitol, led by District 13 which was a center of militaryâ€“industrial production. The Capitol put down the rebellion and razed District 13 to the ground, ostensibly wiping out its residents. The government refers to this war as "the Dark Days", and to punish the rebellious districts and remind all generations of the Capitol's power, instituted an annual pageant known as the "Hunger Games" for which each district is compelled to provide one male and one female "tribute" between the ages of 12 and 18, chosen by lottery. The twenty-four tributes are sent to an arena and forced to fight to the death, until a single victor remains.
