Gerhardt finds Viktor digging up a body from a graveyard to use for his experiments. They are interrupted by a guard, who fatally shoots Gerhardt. Viktor attempts to revive Gerhardt in the laboratory, but the procedure burns his heart into charcoal. Alphonse discovers what has happened and disowns Viktor. Rumplestiltskin appears again and offers Viktor a magical heart in exchange for "putting on a show" for his "friend," Regina. After receiving the heart, Viktor successfully brings Gerhardt back to life. Alphonse is initially pleased, but becomes dismayed when he discovers Gerhardt is now an animalistic "monster." He assaults Viktor, which prompts Gerhardt to attack Alphonse. Viktor stands by and allows Gerhardt to beat him to death, after which Gerhardt becomes distraught and runs off.
