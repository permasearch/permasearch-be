The first "production" pocket transistor radio was the Regency TR-1, released in October 1954[17]. Produced as a joint venture between  the Regency Division of Industrial Development Engineering Associates, I.D.E.A. and Texas Instruments of Dallas Texas, the TR-1 was manufactured in Indianapolis, Indiana.  It was a near pocket-sized radio featuring 4 transistors and one germanium diode. The industrial design was outsourced to the Chicago firm of Painter, Teague and Petertil. It was initially released in one of four different colours:  black, bone white, red, and gray.  Other colours were to shortly follow.[25][26][27]
