The CWGC's work is funded predominantly by grants from the governments of the six member states. In the fiscal year 2012/13, these grants amounted to £58.6 million of the organisation's £66.5 million of income.[116] This equates to an approximate cost of C$85 per commemorated war dead.[117] The contribution from each country is proportionate to the number of graves the CWGC maintains on behalf of that country. The percentage of total annual contributions for which each country is responsible is United Kingdom 7001784000000000000♠78.4%, Canada 7001101000000000000♠10.1%, Australia 7000610000000000000♠6.1%, New Zealand 7000210000000000000♠2.1%, South Africa 7000210000000000000♠2.1% and India 7000120000000000000♠1.2%.[116]
