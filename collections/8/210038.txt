In aqueous solution, vanadium(V) forms an extensive family of oxyanions. The interrelationships in this family are described by the predominance diagram, which shows at least 11 species, depending on pH and concentration.[16] The tetrahedral orthovanadate ion, VO3− 4, is the principal species present at pH 12-14. Similar in size and charge to phosphorus(V), vanadium(V) also parallels its chemistry and crystallography. Orthovanadate VO3− 4 is used in protein crystallography[17] to study the biochemistry of phosphate.[18] The tetrathiovanadate [VS4]3− is analogous to the orthovanadate ion.[19]
