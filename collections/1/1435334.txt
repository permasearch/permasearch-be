Following the victory of Christian emperor Constantine in the Civil Wars of the Tetrarchy (306â€“324), the total Christianization of the Roman Empire began.[117][118] Within a few months, the First Council of Nicaea (first worldwide Christian council) confirmed the status of Aelia (Jerusalem) as a patriarchate,[119] at which point the city is generally taken to have been renamed Jerusalem. Theodosius I declared Christianity the state religion of the empire in 380, and Palestine became part of the Eastern Roman Empire ("Byzantium") after the division of the Roman Empire into east and west (a fitful process that was not finalized until 395 CE).[citation needed]
