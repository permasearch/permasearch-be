Around the mid-Eastern Han period,[54] a simplified and easier-to-write form of clerical script appeared, which Qiu terms "neo-clerical" (新隶体 / 新隸體, xīnlìtǐ).[56] By the late Eastern Han, this had become the dominant daily script,[54] although the formal, mature bāfēn (八分) clerical script remained in use for formal works such as engraved stelae.[54] Qiu describes this neo-clerical script as a transition between clerical and regular script,[54] and it remained in use through the Cao Wei and Jin dynasties.[57]
