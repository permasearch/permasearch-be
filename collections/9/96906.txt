The chain reaction in the first critical reactor, CP-1, was initiated by neutron sources generated during its prior subcritical test runs. The very first of those could have been initiated by ambient cosmic-ray neutrons. Similarly, in modern reactors (after startup), delayed neutron emission from fission products suffices to sustain the amplification reaction while yielding controllable growth times. (In comparison, a bomb is based on immediate neutrons and grows exponentially in nanoseconds.)
