Rodman entered an outpatient rehab center in Florida in May 2008.[84] In May 2009, his behavior on Celebrity Apprentice led to an intervention which included Phil Jackson as well as Rodman's family and other friends. Rodman initially refused to enter rehabilitation because he wanted to attend the Celebrity Apprentice reunion show.[85][86] In 2009, Rodman agreed to appear on the third season of Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew.[87][88] Rodman remained a patient at the Pasadena Recovery Center for the 21-day treatment cycle.  A week after completion he entered a sober-living facility in the Hollywood Hills, which was filmed for the second season of Sober House. During episode seven of Sober House, Rodman was shown being reunited with his mother Shirley, from whom he had been estranged for seven years.[89]  During this same visit Shirley also met Rodman's two children for the first time.[90]  On January 10, 2010, on the same day that Celebrity Rehab premiered, Rodman was removed from an Orange County, California restaurant for disruptive behavior.[91] In March 2012, Rodman's financial advisor said, "In all honesty, Dennis, although a very sweet person, is an alcoholic. His sickness impacts his ability to get work."[92]
