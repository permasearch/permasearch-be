With his own family spanning Catholic and Aglipayan traditions, de los Reyes was tolerant of religious diversity among his children. Isabelo de los Reyes Jr., a son from his second marriage, was ordained an Aglipayan priest and later became Obispo Máximo IV of the church. His daughters Ángeles, Elisa, and Elvira from his second marriage, along with Crescencia from his third marriage, became professed nuns in the Catholic Church.[3]
