There is no solid evidence that folate or vitamin B12 improves outcomes in those with cognitive problems.[101] Statins also have no benefit in dementia.[102] Medications for other health conditions may need to be managed differently for a person who also has a diagnosis of dementia. The MATCH-D criteria can help identify ways that a diagnosis of dementia changes medication management for other health conditions.[103] It is unclear if there is a link between blood pressure medication and dementia. There is a possibility that people may experience an increase in cardiovascular-related events if these medications are withdrawn.[104]
