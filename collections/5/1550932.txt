Diana Steenbergen from IGN rated the episode with 9/10 saying that the show has turned into one of the better guilty pleasures on TV and that the cliffhangers are plentiful at the end of the hour. "One of the great things about The Vampire Diaries is the pacing. The storylines move at breakneck speed; a conflict is introduced one week, it is resolved the next and a new conflict crops up. The big ticket items this week are Elena finding out who her father really is, Bonnie admitting that she did not remove the power of Johnathan Gilbert's device, and Damon's newfound humanity. Each storyline is suitably addressed in the hour, and as usual, new problems present themselves by the end." Steenbergen also praised Somerhalder, saying that is the best part of the show: "He is ridiculously entertaining as Damon, the sometime evil Salvatore brother. Damon has a bit of an advantage on poor Stefan, since it is so much fun to watch the snarky, obnoxious behavior Damon dishes out to everyone."[5]
