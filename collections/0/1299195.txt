Rodney is accused in the death of Joe Chernak, who refused to accept Rita’s dumping him and falling for Norman. District Attorney John Fowler (John Kerr), son of the former DA who retired heartsick over learning he got a wrongful conviction against Elliot, is also unaware his wife Marian (Joan Blackman), is the driver who struck Allison. Elliot and Steven suspect the younger Fowler wants to avenge his father via another Harrington, since Leslie’s original failure convicted Elliot. Against his family attorney’s advice, Rodney gives a statement to the police and the DA. Leslie returns to Peyton Place, and ultimately succeeds in getting Rodney bail. Only Allison truly believes in Rodney’s innocence before her accident, which happened after she visited Rodney in jail. Norman is haunted by his wish that Joe were dead because he abused Rita. The return of autocratic patriarch Martin Peyton (George Macready) fascinates and unnerves Peyton Place.
