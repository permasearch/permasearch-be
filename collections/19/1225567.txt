Not much is known about the architectural appearance of the Acropolis until the Archaic era. During the 7th and the 6th centuries BC, the site was controlled by Kylon during the failed Kylonian revolt,[10] and twice by Peisistratos; each of these were attempts directed at seizing political power by coups d'Ã©tat. Apart from the Hekatompedon mentioned later, Peisistratos also built an entry gate or Propylaea.[11] Nevertheless, it seems that a nine-gate wall, the Enneapylon,[12] had been built around the biggest water spring, the Clepsydra, at the northwestern foot.
