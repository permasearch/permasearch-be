Words of Tamil origin occur in other languages. A notable example of a word in worldwide use with Dravidian (not specifically Tamil) etymology is orange, via Sanskrit nāraṅga from a Dravidian predecessor of Tamil nartaṅkāy "fragrant fruit". One suggestion as to the origin of the word anaconda is the Tamil anaikkonda, "having killed an elephant".[138] Examples in English include cheroot (churuṭṭu meaning "rolled up"),[139] mango (from māngāi),[139] mulligatawny (from miḷaku taṇṇīr, "pepper water"), pariah (from paraiyan), curry (from kari),[140] and catamaran (from kaṭṭu maram, "bundled logs"),[139] congee (from kanji - rice porridge or gruel).[141]
