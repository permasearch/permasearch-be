A flashback shows Claire and Eric sitting in adjacent seats on the plane, along with the other passengers, Mr. Arkin (who is revealed to be the pilot on the plane) and the man who blamed him. During the flight, Claire and Eric share a conversation and develop feelings for each other. When the plane depressurizes, Eric tells her to stay with him and they'll be alright. Claire smiles and caresses Eric's face as the screen fades to white.
