Waiting restrictions are indicated by both signs and road markings. On-street parking places may be designated for a particular class of vehicle (e.g. solo motorcycles or car) or for a particular user (e.g. permit holders or disabled badge holders). Parking may be free or paid for (e.g. "pay and display" or parking meters).
