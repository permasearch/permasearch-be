The third track on the album, "TMZ", which is a parody of "You Belong with Me" by Taylor Swift,[4][10] is about celebrities whose failings, no matter how minor, appear on the celebrity gossip site, TMZ.com. The music video, by Bill Plympton, is about a female celebrity whose bare butt is photographed by a TMZ paparazzo and then appears everywhere she goes. Voice actor and comedian Tom Kenny is featured as a voice shouting out various tabloid headlines during an instrumental solo.[11] Yankovic performed the song on the February 9, 2012 episode of The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson.[12]
