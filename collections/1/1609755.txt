The contents of ROM chips can be extracted with special hardware devices and relevant controlling software. This practice is common for, as a main example, reading the contents of older video game console cartridges. Another example is making backups of firmware/OS ROMs from older computers or other devices - for archival purposes and/or because in many cases, the original chips are PROMs and thus at risk of exceeding their usable data lifetime.
