A proposed third species, D. breedorum, was coined by Samuel Welles through Welles and Pickering (1999) for the specimen UCMP 77270 collected in 1964. Tykoski (2005) performed an ontogenetic analysis in his thesis and concluded that D. breedorum is an adult Dilophosaurus wetherilli.[20] This was the first specimen of the genus to preserve a nearly complete cranial crest.[21] Welles concluded that differences between the original specimens and UCMP 77270 justified the naming of separate species.[4] He was unable to complete a manuscript describing this during his lifetime, and the name eventually came out in a private publication distributed by Pickering.[22] This species has not been accepted as valid in other reviews of the genus, which see it as a nomen nudum and/or a junior subjective synonym.[3][23]
