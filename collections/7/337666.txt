Education in Australia encompasses the sectors of early childhood education[8] (preschool) and primary education (primary schools), followed by secondary education (high schools), tertiary education (universities, TAFE colleges, and vocational education and training providers) and adult education (referred to as adult and community education or ACE)[9]. Regulation and funding of education is primarily the responsibility of the States and territories, but the Federal Government also plays a funding role.[10]
