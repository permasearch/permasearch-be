"Je t'aime… moi non plus" (French for "I love you… neither do I") is a song written by Serge Gainsbourg, for Brigitte Bardot in 1967, who dueted in an early version not released until 1986. In 1969, Gainsbourg recorded the most well known version with Jane Birkin. The duet reached number one in the UK, and number two in Ireland, and was banned in several countries due to its overtly sexual content. In 1976, Gainsbourg directed Birkin in an erotic film of the same name.
