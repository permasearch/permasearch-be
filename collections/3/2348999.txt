According to Cartoon Network executive Linda Simensky, the first season did "remarkably well" in ratings ever since its premiere, becoming one of the top-rated series on the network and prompting Cartoon Network to quickly order a second season for a November 1999 premiere,[5] making it one of four seasons which Ed, Edd n Eddy was set to run.[6] Antonucci stated that change in the characters from the first to the second season is "very" noticeable, due to the amount of development they've went through.[3] Antonucci directed the season, and co-wrote the episodes with Jono Howard and Mike Kubat, although Robert Leighton was credited as a co-writer for "To Sir with Ed".[7]
