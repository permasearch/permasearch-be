Booth is from Philadelphia[3] but was raised in Pittsburgh.[4] He is a fan of the Philadelphia Flyers hockey team; pictures of the team hang on the back wall of his office, as well as he has been seen wearing a Flyers T-shirt in several episodes he also proceeded to watch a Flyers game at a funeral.[5][6] During many episodes he is seen drinking from a Pittsburgh Steelers coffee mug, suggesting he is also a fan of that football team. In his apartment Booth has a Pittsburgh Penguins hockey jersey of Mario Lemieux, which implies he is a fan of the Penguins. He is implied to be a Philadelphia Phillies supporter as well; in season 8, his mother brings his childhood toy – a miniature Phillie Phanatic stuffed toy – to give to Christine[7] and in season 6, episode 16 "The Blackout in the Blizzard" he acquires a row of seats from the former Veterans Stadium and recounts for Dr. Brennan how he attended game 6 of the 1980 World Series with his father, describing it as the "best day of [his] life".[8] A deeply religious man, he was raised and still is a practicing Catholic,[1] having served as an altar boy during his youth;[9] throughout the series he is often seen wearing a St. Christopher medal, which was given to him by his grandfather before being deployed to Somalia,[10] around his neck.[11] Little is known about his schooling years, though it has been implied that he went through the public school system[12] and he once mentioned attending five different schools by the time he was nine.[13] It is not mentioned where or when he attended college but he has stated that he attended on an athletic scholarship before a shoulder injury ended any dreams of going professional[14][15] and taught dance to help pay for tuition.[16] He has been an avid athlete[5][17] and sports fan since his high school days. His home and office walls are adorned with various sports memorabilia including a signed picture of Bruins player Bobby Orr and the jerseys of NHL legends Mario Lemieux and Bobby Clarke.[18]
