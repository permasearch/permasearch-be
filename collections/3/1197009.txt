Selena's murder had a widespread impact. Reactions to her death were compared to those following the deaths of musicians John Lennon, Elvis Presley, and U.S. president John F. Kennedy.[78][157] Major television networks interrupted their regular programming to break the news; Tom Brokaw referred to Selena as "The Mexican Madonna".[158] Her death was front page news in The New York Times for two days.[159] Numerous vigils and memorials were held in her honor, and radio stations in Texas played her music non-stop.[160] Her funeral drew 60,000 mourners, many of whom traveled from outside the United States.[160] The news struck the Hispanic community extremely hard; many fans traveled thousands of miles to see Selena's house and boutiques, and the crime scene.[161][162] By mid-afternoon, police were asked to form a detour because a line of cars began backing up traffic from the Quintanillas' houses.[163] Among the celebrities who were reported to have contacted the Quintanilla family to express their condolences were Gloria Estefan, Celia Cruz, Julio Iglesias, and Madonna.[164] Other celebrities—including Stefani Montiel, Jaime DeAnda (of Los Chamacos), and Shelly Lares—appeared on radio stations to express their thoughts about Selena's death.[165] An issue of People magazine was released several days after her murder. Its publishers believed interest would soon wane; they released a commemorative issue within a week when it became apparent it was growing. The issue sold nearly a million copies,[166] selling the entire first and second print runs within two weeks. It became a collector's item, a first in the history of People.[167] Betty Cortina, editor of People, told Biography they never had an issue that was completely sold out; "it was unheard of".[167] In the following months, the company released People en Español aimed at the Hispanic market, due to the success of the Selena issue.[167] This was followed by Newsweek en Espanol and Latina magazine.[168]
