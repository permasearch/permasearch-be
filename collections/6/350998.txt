In May 2005, producers mentioned the possibility of following Extinction with a sequel entitled Afterlife, to be shot and set in Tokyo, Japan and Alaska.[9] Despite Resident Evil: Extinction being billed on the official website and elsewhere as the final installment of the Resident Evil film series; on September 23, 2007, Rory Bruer, Sony's head of distribution explained, "It absolutely would not surprise me considering the success of the franchise that they find a way to come up with another. It's a real possibility."[10] Producer Jeremy Bolt also stated that while there was no intention of making a fourth film, that the third had been particularly well done and that Paul Anderson was talking with Sony about the possibility.[11] In June 2008, Anderson noted that negotiations were underway with Sony for creating the film.[12] In December 2008, Anderson stated that he was working on the script.[13] The following year, it was announced that Sony was aiming to release Resident Evil: Afterlife by August 27, 2010.[14]
