In the same year, Neale published the first documented English translation, beginning with "Draw nigh, draw nigh, Emmanuel," in MediÃ¦val Hymns and Sequences. He revised this version for The Hymnal Noted, followed by a further revision, in 1861, for Hymns Ancient and Modern. This version, now with the initial line reading "O come, O come, Emmanuel," would attain hegemony in the English-speaking world (aside from minor variations from hymnal to hymnal).[19]
