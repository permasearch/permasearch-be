On the aesthetic difference between CSI: Miami and CSI: NY, senior writer Andrew Lipsitz stated that "all cities are fantasies, made up of the dreams of individual inhabitants. New York is its own fantasy—it’s the great fantasy of anyone who came here from another country. It may or may not be more real, it may or may not be baked in the sun, but it’s an amalgam of everyone’s dreams."[169] Anthony Zuiker also stated that, while "Miami feature[s] self-contained episodes that favor solving crimes over exploring characters' lives... NY [will] be more character-driven".[5] USA Today later observed that "structurally, the CSI's bear striking similarities. Each unit, which uses advanced forensic techniques to solve crimes, is headed by a veteran male, joined by a leading female", yet "climate offers variation. NY offers the prospect of frozen corpses."[5]
