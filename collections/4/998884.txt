The mobile version helped to boost popularity of the game, attributed to the nature of the game being able to be played in a pick-up-and-go manner ideally suited for mobile devices. Tommy Palm, one of the four developers for Candy Crush Saga, stated that the first weekend numbers after the game's mobile release were over ten times greater than the estimates they expected.[15] By January 2013, Candy Crush Saga overtook Zynga's Farmville 2 as the top-played game on the Facebook platform.[18]
