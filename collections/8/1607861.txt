House and the team are intrigued by Scott (Ashton Holmes), a man who has undergone a corpus callosotomy procedure to treat epilepsy. Due to this, both sides of his brain are at war for dominance over the body resulting in him having Alien Hand Syndrome where he can't control his left arm. At the same time Cuddy and House try to deal with their relationship after spending the night at his apartment. The next day, House tells Wilson that he has stopped taking drugs and had sex with Cuddy, to which Wilson responds "Wow". But he also tells him that Cuddy may be repressing her feelings for him, and is trying to avoid him. Finally House realizes that his night with Cuddy and her helping him to stop his addiction to Vicodin was all an elaborate hallucination. With his hallucinations spiraling out of control, House is forced to go into a mental health facility after becoming unable to tell fantasy from reality.[28][29]
