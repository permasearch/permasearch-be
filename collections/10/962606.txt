Taft and Roosevelt met twice in 1910; the meetings, though outwardly cordial, did not display their former closeness.[130] Roosevelt gave a series of speeches in the West in the late summer and early fall of 1910.  Roosevelt not only attacked the Supreme Court's 1905 decision in Lochner v. New York,[m] he accused the federal courts of undermining democracy, and called for them to be deprived of the power to rule legislation unconstitutional. This attack horrified Taft, who privately agreed that Lochner had been wrongly decided. Roosevelt called for "elimination of corporate expenditures for political purposes, physical valuation of railroad properties, regulation of industrial combinations, establishment of an export tariff commission, a graduated income tax" as well as "workmen's compensation laws, state and national legislation to regulate the [labor] of women and children, and complete publicity of campaign expenditure".[131] According to John Murphy in his journal article on the breach between the two presidents, "As Roosevelt began to move to the left, Taft veered to the right."[131]
