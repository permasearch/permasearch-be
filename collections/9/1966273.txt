The "Oldest House" title dates from a period when the house was believed to have been built in the 16th century. The currently recognized oldest house in the United States is the Fairbanks House, which was built in 1639. However, The González–Alvarez house is still the oldest house in Florida, so the "oldest house" title still has some merit, even though it is not the oldest in America.
