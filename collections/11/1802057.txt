As of 2015, Chessington operates four annual continuing events; African Adventures, Roar & Explore, Howl'o'ween, and Winter's Tail. The first is African Adventures, a February Half-term event. For the week Chessington Zoo opens with African artwork and culture workshops.[21] Selected theme park rides often open early for this event.[22] For the event, African tribal dancers and street explorers can be found roaming and interacting with guests.
