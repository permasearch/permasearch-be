As has been demonstrated, China dominated silver imports. The market value of silver in the Ming territory was double its value elsewhere, which provided great arbitrage profit for the Europeans and Japanese.[8] The abundance of silver in China made it easy for the country to mint it into coinage. That process was so widespread that local Chinese government officials would demand taxes to be paid in silver to the point that silver eventually backed all of China's economy. As the increasing supply of silver from the Spanish and other European powers caused the price of silver to inflate, however, China's over-reliance on that precious metal eventually fueled the Ming Dynasty's collapse.
