This episode begins with Harumi Fujiyoshi bumping into Nozomu while she is on her way to make copies of her dōjinshi for Comiket. Harumi tells him about her hobby, but Nozomu misunderstands, thinking of dōjinshi in the literary sense rather than in the manga and anime sense. At Comiket, Chiri confronts Harumi about the structure of her dōjin, demanding that she redo it in the yonkoma format of Kishōtenketsu; this leads to Nozomu adding a fifth panel to the standard form. The second half of the episode involves the girls at a matsuri, where overzealous festival-goers begin piling random objects and people on portable shrines and dancing and parading around with them.
