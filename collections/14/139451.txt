The amplification of perturbations of a jet by its intrinsic instability can be observed when looking at a plume of cigaret smoke. Any small amplitude motion of the hand holding the cigaret results into an oscillation of the plume increasing with distance upwards and eventually a chaotic motion (turbulence). The same jet oscillation can be triggered by gentle air flow in the room, which can be verified by waving with the other hand.
