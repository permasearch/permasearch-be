Despite his earlier good intentions for the relationship with Jeanne, Tony cannot bring himself to tell her that he loves her, which causes trouble between them.[64] In the episode "Grace Period", Tony is told by his earlier love interest, Paula Cassidy, who has just lost two of her agents and blames herself for their deaths, that if he loves someone, he should tell her while he still can. Tony is left distraught following the death of Cassidy during a suicide bomb attack on Gibbs' team. He later goes to see Jeanne and, following Cassidy's advice, tells her he loves her. The last scene shows Tony embracing Jeanne while crying on her shoulder with R.E.M.'s Everybody Hurts playing in the background.[65]
