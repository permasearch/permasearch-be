The third tube opened on May 25, 1957, to the south of the original two tunnels.[8] It cost $94 million, 6% less than projected;[201] the tube itself had only cost $44 million, but the approaches cost $23 million and other costs made up the remaining $27 million.[8] The third tube's opening made the Lincoln Tunnel the world's first tunnel with three separate, parallel tubes.[10] Unlike with the previous two tubes, which had killed a total of 15 workers,[186] no one had been killed during the construction of the third tube.[10] At this time, the center tube was converted back to a bidirectional tube, while the new third tube became eastbound-only. The center tube could be used for unidirectional traffic during peak hours, doubling capacity in the peak direction. A traffic light system was instituted for the center tube to indicate whether a given direction could use one or both lanes.[8][10] A new 18-booth toll plaza was inaugurated on the left side, collecting tolls on the left-hand (driver's) side of each lane; this replaced the previous right-handed 12-booth plaza, which collected tolls from the passenger side, and was thus expected to speed traffic. The agency also inaugurated two extra ventilation buildings, which would filter air from the new tube.[10] Due to increased traffic loads, the New York City government released plans to widen nearby streets later that year.[202]
