The principles of astronautical hygiene should be used to assess the risks of exposure to lunar dust during exploration on the Moon's surface and thereby determine the most appropriate measures to control exposure. These may include removing the spacesuit in a three-stage airlock, "vacuuming" the suit with a magnet[10] before removal, and using local exhaust ventilation with a highâ€“efficiency particulate filter to remove dust from the spacecraft's atmosphere.[11]
