Lê Quang Vinh popularly known as Ba Cụt was a military commander of the Hòa Hảo religious sect, which operated from the Mekong Delta and controlled various parts of southern Vietnam during the 1940s and early 1950s. He was captured on April 13 and after a short trial Ba Cụt was publicly guillotined[22][23] on July 13, 1956, in Cần Thơ.[24] Some followers, led by a hardcore deputy named Bay Dom, retreated to a small area beside the Cambodian border, where they vowed not to rest until Ba Cụt was avenged.[25] Many of his followers later joined the Viet Cong—the movement that succeeded the Việt Minh their leader had fought—and took up arms against Diệm.[25]
