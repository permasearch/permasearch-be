Holmes cannot resist such an intriguing mystery, and he and Watson set out across the city to determine how the jewel traveled from the room of the Countess of Morcar to a goose's crop. The proprietor of the Alpha Inn informs them that the goose was purchased from a dealer in Covent Garden. At Covent Garden, a salesman named Breckinridge gets angry with Holmes and refuses to help. The merchant complains of pestering he has endured about geese sold recently to the landlord of the Alpha Inn. Holmes, realizing that he is not the only one aware of the carbuncle's connection to Baker's goose, tricks an irate Breckinridge into revealing that the bird was supplied by a Mrs. Oakshott, a poultry and egg purveyor in Brixton.
