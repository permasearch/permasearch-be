Alexithymia creates interpersonal problems because these individuals tend to avoid emotionally close relationships, or if they do form relationships with others they usually position themselves as either dependent, dominant, or impersonal, "such that the relationship remains superficial".[43] Inadequate "differentiation" between self and others by alexithymic individuals has also been observed.[44][45]
