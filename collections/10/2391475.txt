Pitted keratolysis (also known as "Keratolysis plantare sulcatum,"[1] "Keratoma plantare sulcatum,"[1] and "Ringed keratolysis"[1]) is a non-contagious[citation needed] skin infection that can be caused by wearing tight or restricting footwear and excessive sweating. The infection is characterized by craterlike pits on the surface of the feet and toes, particularly weight bearing areas. Treatment consists of the application of topical antibiotics. Pitted Keratolysis is caused by bacteria,[2] which thrive in these environments.[3]
