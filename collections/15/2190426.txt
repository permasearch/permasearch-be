Due to its glassy internal structure, obsidian is relatively easy to work, as it breaks in very predictable and controlled ways via conchoidal fracturing.  This contributed to its prolific use throughout Mesoamerica.  It is obtained by either quarrying source sites or in nodule form from riverbeds or fractured outcrops.
