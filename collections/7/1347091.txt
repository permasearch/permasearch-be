A prehistoric maxilla (upper jawbone) fragment was uncovered in the Kents Cavern locate in Torquay, Devon, England during a 1927 excavation by the Torquay Natural History Society, and named Kents Cavern 4. In 2011, the fossil was tested and redated to at least 41,500 years old and confirmed to be Cro-Magnon, making it the earliest anatomically modern human (AMH) fossil yet discovered in northwestern Europe.[14]
