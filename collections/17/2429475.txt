The standard Box–Muller transform generates values from the standard normal distribution (i.e. standard normal deviates) with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. The implementation below in standard C++ generates values from any normal distribution with mean     μ   {\displaystyle \mu }   and variance      σ  2     {\displaystyle \sigma ^{2}}  . If     Z   {\displaystyle Z}   is a standard normal deviate, then     X = Z σ + μ   {\displaystyle X=Z\sigma +\mu }   will have a normal distribution with mean     μ   {\displaystyle \mu }   and standard deviation     σ   {\displaystyle \sigma }  . Note that because the random number generator rand has not been seeded, the same series of values will always be returned from the generateGaussianNoise function.
