The Antarctic vegetation consists of algae or lichens, and some bacteria and fungi. Mosses and lichens dominate though. The algae and lichens grow where there is moisture, and they hide in cracks to be protected from the wind. The dominate grassland is the tussock. These grasses get to be 2 m (6 ft 7 in) high, so they provide habitat for many mammals.[23] Of the 14,000,000 km2 (5,400,000 sq mi) of land that makes up Antarctic, less than 2% of it does not have snow or ice.[24]
