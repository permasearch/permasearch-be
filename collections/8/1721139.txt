Eligible for salary arbitration for the first time before the 1999 season, the arbitrator awarded Jeter a $5Â million salary.[58] Jeter led the AL in hits that season with 219, while finishing second in the league in batting average (.349) and runs scored (134), appearing in his second All-Star game that year.[51] His season totals in batting average, runs, hits, runs batted in, doubles (37), triples (9), home runs (24), SLG (.552), and OBP (.438) are all personal bests.[51] Jeter, who for part of the year hit third in the batting order, also drove in 102 runs, becoming only the second Yankee shortstop to do so, following Lyn Lary's 107 RBI in 1931.[51] In the postseason, Jeter batted .455 in the ALDS, .350 in the ALCS, and .353 in the World Series,[51] as the Yankees defeated the Braves to win another championship, Jeter's third.[59]
