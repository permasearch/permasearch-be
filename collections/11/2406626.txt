The guitar work on the song has been attributed to three different guitar players: Pat Hare, Mel Brown, and Wayne Bennett.[1] However, Bland noted that Hare was the session guitarist, having been chosen by arranger/trumpeter Joe Scott.[1] It was Hare's only session with Bland, although he was in Junior Parker's Blue Flames, who sometimes provided backup while Bland was on tour.[1] Bennett and Brown were Bland's later guitarists.[1]
