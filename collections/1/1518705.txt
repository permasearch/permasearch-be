Albert Pierrepoint (/ˈpɪərpɔɪnt/; 30 March 1905 – 10 July 1992) was a long-serving hangman in England. He executed at least 400 people, including William Joyce ("Lord Haw-Haw") and John Amery. In Germany and Austria, after the Second World War, he executed some 200 people who had been convicted of war crimes. In England, Pierrepoint hanged Timothy Evans for a crime committed by his neighbour John Christie, who was also hanged by Pierrepoint.
