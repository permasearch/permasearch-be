A random variable X with values in a measurable space     (   X   ,   A   )   {\displaystyle ({\mathcal {X}},{\mathcal {A}})}   (usually       R   n     {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}   with the Borel sets as measurable subsets) has as probability distribution the measure X∗P on     (   X   ,   A   )   {\displaystyle ({\mathcal {X}},{\mathcal {A}})}  : the density of X with respect to a reference measure μ on     (   X   ,   A   )   {\displaystyle ({\mathcal {X}},{\mathcal {A}})}   is the Radon–Nikodym derivative:
