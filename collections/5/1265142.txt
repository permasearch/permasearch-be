The spacecraft splashed down in the North Atlantic at coordinates near 21°20′N 68°40′W﻿ / ﻿21.333°N 68.667°W﻿ / 21.333; -68.667, 40 miles (64 km) short of the planned landing zone.[13] Retrofire calculations had not taken into account spacecraft weight loss due to use of onboard consumables. USS Noa, a destroyer code-named "Steelhead", had spotted the spacecraft when it was descending on its parachute. The destroyer was about 6 miles (9.7 km) away when it radioed Glenn that it would reach him shortly. Noa came alongside Friendship 7 seventeen minutes later.
