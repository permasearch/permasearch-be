Social disorganization theory is based on the work of Henry McKay and Clifford R. Shaw of the Chicago School.[17]  Social disorganization theory postulates that neighborhoods plagued with poverty and economic deprivation tend to experience high rates of population turnover.[18] This theory suggests that crime and deviance is valued within groups in society, ‘subcultures’ or ‘gangs’. These groups have different values to the majority norm values in society. These neighborhoods also tend to have high population heterogeneity.[18] With high turnover, informal social structure often fails to develop, which in turn makes it difficult to maintain social order in a community.
