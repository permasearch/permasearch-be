In his review of the album Marc Anthony, Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic called "I Need to Know" a "catchy, mid-tempo single" and said that the music was "gently danceable".[15] Chuck Taylor of Billboard magazine praised the track as "[a]bsolutely smashing", commended the production and musical style of the record and said that Anthony "remains true to his salsa roots with a sexy, swaying cha-cha number".[11] Barry Walters from Entertainment Weekly gave the song a B+ rating, and said the music "flaunts—rather than disguises—its mambo moves" and called it "radical pop waiting to happen."[16]  While reviewing songs that were nominated for Record of the Year at the 1st Annual Latin Grammy Awards, an editor for the Los Angeles Times said the track "is the aural scrapbook of an American artist with Latino roots who found the ideal middle ground to satisfy both Anglo and Latino fans".[13] Parry Gettelman of the Orlando Sentinel was more critical of the song, describing it as "hooky but disposable", and he criticized the chorus as "so over-produced". Although Gettelman was more favorable towards "Dímelo", he said the drums in the production are "still annoying as all get-out".[12]
