The paint colour used most widely today is known as "currant red" and is defined by a British Standard, BS381C-Red539.[4] This slightly brighter red was introduced with the K8 model in 1968, but went on to be used across the estate on previous models too. Hence, for complete historical accuracy, any kiosks in pre-1968 settings should really be painted in the previous, and slightly darker, shade BS381C-Red538.
