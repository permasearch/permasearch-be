Scandal was renewed for a fifth season on May 7, 2015, by ABC.[1] The series will continue to air at Thursdays in the timeslot 9:00Â p.m. E.T. like the previous season, as it was moved to the timeslot to make room for ShondaLand Production Company's new TV series, How to Get Away with Murder. Production began on May 21, 2015, when Rhimes announced on Twitter that the writers were in full swing mapping the fifth season.[3]
