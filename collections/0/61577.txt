"How You Remind Me" is a song by Canadian rock band Nickelback. It was released on August 21, 2001 as the lead single from their third studio album Silver Side Up (2001). A "Gold Mix" was made for latter editions of the single with the heavier guitars edited out of the chorus. Lead vocalist and guitarist Chad Kroeger wrote the song about his old girlfriend Jodi, with whom he had a dysfunctional relationship.[2] He referred to this song as the song that put Nickelback on the map when played at their concert in Sturgis, South Dakota, and is often considered to be their signature song.
