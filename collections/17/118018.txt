The sweeper (or libero) is a more versatile centre-back who "sweeps up" the ball if an opponent manages to breach the defensive line.[3][4] This position is rather more fluid than that of other defenders who man-mark their designated opponents. Because of this, it is sometimes referred to as libero ([Ëˆlibero]), which originated from the Italian name for this position libero da impegni di marcatura (i.e., "free from man-marking tasks").[5][6]
