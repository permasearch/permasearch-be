In Octoberâ€“November 1857 Clara and Joachim took a recital tour together to Dresden and Leipzig.[30] St. James's Hall, London, which opened in 1858, hosted a series of "Popular Concerts" of chamber music, of which programs from 1867 through 1904 are preserved.[31] Joachim visited London annually beginning in 1866.[32] Clara also spent a few months of many years in London and participated in Popular Concerts with Joachim and Piatti. Most often on the same concert programmes would be second violinist Joseph Ries and violist J. B. Zerbini. George Bernard Shaw, the leading playwright who was also a music critic, wrote that the Popular Concerts helped greatly to spread and enlighten musical taste in England.[33] Playing chamber music bypassed the issues Clara had with English orchestra conductors.
