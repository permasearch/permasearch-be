As a spin-off of long-running British cultural artefact Doctor Who, Torchwood's launch into British popular culture has received many positive and negative reviews, commentary and parody following the hype of its inception, especially regarding its status as an "adult" Doctor Who spin-off as well as its characterisation and portrayal of sex. Reviews for the first series were largely negative, with sites such as Behind the Sofa giving many more negative reviews than positive ones. Reviews of the second series were more positive. The third series, which took the form of a five-part story arc with the blanket title of Children of Earth, received a number of positive reviews. Critics described it separately as a "powerful human drama";[120] "Best. Torchwood. Ever.";[121] and "...Â against all expectations, a work of Proper Drama".[122] Conversely, The Daily Mirror gave the mini-series a negative review, describing it as "the modern-day Blake's 7: ludicrous plot, hammy acting, an adolescent penchant for 'Issues'".[123] Metacritic, an American review aggregator website, gives Torchwood series one a rating of 74 out of 100, indicating "generally favourable reviews".[124] The show's second series rates above the first, scoring an aggregated 80 out of 100.[125] The third series rated higher, at 81, indicating "universal acclaim". Its highest scores were a 100 from TV Guide and a 91 from TIME; the lowest was a 60 from The New York Times.[126]
