The episode received mixed reviews by critics who gave a polarised view on the writing and handling of Shepherd's death. Ashley Bissette Sumerel of TV Fanatic gave the episode the highest praise in a 5 out of 5 star review highlighting the "interesting possibilities" that the death would offer for the show. However, she stated, "I'm beyond heartbroken. [...] We've seen tragic deaths and lost beloved characters, but never quite like this. I don't think I'll ever get over it." She also acknowledged the show's emotional connect with its audience and its courage to attempt the "inconceivable".[19] Ariana Bacle of Entertainment Weekly took the opportunity to reminisce the early years of the show saying that it is the compelling characters that have made committing to Grey's "irresistible". She added that despite some "weak moments" that the series suffers from, characters like "Meredith or Derek or Webber will have a moment that reminds me why I keep watching, why I never stoppedâ€” so watching one of those characters die hurts. It really, really hurts."[20] In a mixed review for the episode, a Spoiler TV writer criticized the plot calling it a "self-indulgent episode", contrasted it with "well crafted departure of Mark Sloan, or by Lexie Grey". Also criticizing the absence of the series' major cast from the episode the review said, "The presence of so many inconsequential and uninteresting characters was continually in danger of swamping the dreaminess of Derek."[21] However, appreciative of Pompeo's character, the reviewer remarked, "the writing of Meredith was completely on point. She was clinical, as we would expect her to be."
