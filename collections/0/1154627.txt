The governments of the Baltic countries,[30][31] the European Court of Human Rights,[32] the United Nations Human Rights Council,[33] the United States,[34] and the European Union (EU),[35][36] regard Latvia as being occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940 under the provisions of the 1939 Molotovâ€“Ribbentrop Pact. The European Parliament in recognising[37] the occupation of the Baltic states from 1940 until the fall of the Soviet Union as illegal, led to the early acceptance of the Baltic states into the NATO alliance.
