Jane Stanford has been described as having a "Victorian aversion to blank space"[72] and so created a church that is "a dimly lit cavern of glowing mosaic surfacesÂ ... and vibrant, stained-glass windows".[64] The church is richly decorated throughout, its architectural features carved with formalized foliate ornament, and the walls adorned with mosaics in the Byzantine manner.[9] The stained-glass windows were crafted by J. and R. Lamb of New York.[73] The chandeliers, installed in 1915, are in the Art Nouveau tradition and have gold decorative patterns cast in pot metal.
