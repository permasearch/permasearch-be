With five regular-season MVPs (tied for second place with Bill Russellâ€”only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has won more, with six), six Finals MVPs (NBA record), and three All-Star MVPs, Jordan is the most decorated NBA player. Jordan finished among the top three in regular-season MVP voting a record 10 times, and was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996. He is one of only seven players in history to win an NCAA championship, an NBA championship, and an Olympic gold medal (doing so twice with the 1984 and 1992 U.S. men's basketball teams).[159] Since 1976, the year of the NBA's merger with the American Basketball Association,[160] Jordan and Pippen are the only two players to win six NBA Finals playing for one team.[161] In the All-Star Game fan ballot, Jordan received the most votes nine times, more than any other player.[162]
