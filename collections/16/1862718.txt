On April 11, 2004, BMF courier and high-level distributor Jabari Hayes was pulled over in Phelps County, Missouri along I-44 driving a 40-foot motor home, supposedly for swerving over the fog line. Two suitcases containing approximately 95 kilograms of cocaine and 572Â grams of marijuana were found in the back of the Range Rover after a K-9 unit was alerted to drugs in the vehicle.[6]
