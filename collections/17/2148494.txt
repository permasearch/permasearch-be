Sandra Roelofs, the Dutch-born wife of Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili, has recently promoted a program encouraging Afrikaans South African farmers to migrate to Georgia. The country is actively recruiting Afrikaner farmers to help revive the nation's moribund agriculture. In the 20 years since the collapse of the Soviet Union, half of Georgia's farmland has gone out of production.[8]
