Overall, the majority of royal biographers have agreed that even if Charles and Camilla wanted to marry or did try for approval to get married, it would have been declined, because according to Charles's cousin and godmother Patricia Mountbatten, palace courtiers at that time found Camilla unsuitable as a wife for the future king. In 2005, she stated, "With hindsight, you can say that Charles should have married Camilla when he first had the chance. They were ideally suited, we know that now. But it wasn't possible."[…][55] "it wouldn't have been possible, not then."[…][56] When Charles heard of the engagement of Camilla and Andrew Parker Bowles in 1973, he wrote to Lord Mountbatten: "I suppose the feeling of emptiness will pass eventually."[57] Nevertheless, they remained friends.[58][59] In August 1979, Lord Mountbatten was assassinated by the IRA. Charles was grief-stricken and relied heavily on Camilla for solace. During this period, rumours began circulating among family, friends and neighbours that they had rekindled their intimate relationship.[60] A source close to Camilla confirmed that by 1980 they had indeed rekindled as lovers.[61] However, other sources assert it occurred earlier.[62] Reportedly, Parker Bowles gave consent to the relationship during their marriage,[63] while he also saw other women.[64] In 1981, Charles married Lady Diana Spencer.[65]
