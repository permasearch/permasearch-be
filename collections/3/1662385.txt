Security is often compromised through the lax application of theft-prevention practices and human nature in general. The average anti-theft device does not require any additional effort while using the secured item, without reducing the level of security. In practice, users of security systems may intentionally reduce the effectiveness of an anti-theft system to increase its usability (see passwords). For example, a home security system will usually be enabled and disabled with an easy-to-remember code such as "1111" or "123", instead of a more secure combination.
