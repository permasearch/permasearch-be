The theory behind the core self-evaluations construct is abstract.[47]  It posits that a person's own fundamental evaluations can influence most other appraisals they make about their self and their environment.[1]  For this reason, it is difficult to empirically test the CSE trait and its subconscious effect on locus of control, neuroticism, self-esteem, and generalized self-efficacy.  Moreover, it is unclear why CSE theory chose the four dimensions that it encompasses.[47]
