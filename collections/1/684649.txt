Henry IV's claim to the throne was through his father, John of Gaunt, third surviving son of Edward III. The childless Richard II had nominated Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March as his successor, but there was little support at the time for the counter-claim of the young Mortimer. As Henry's initial popularity waned, the Mortimer family's claim to the throne was a pretext for the major rebellion of Owain Glynd≈µr in Wales, and other, less successful, revolts in Cheshire and Northumberland. There were uprisings in support of the Mortimer's claim throughout Henry IV's reign, which lasted until 1413.
