Foster care[72] adoption is a type of domestic adoption where the child is initially placed into a foster care system and is subsequently placed for adoption. Children may be placed into foster care for a variety of reasons; including, removal from the home by a governmental agency because of maltreatment.[73] In some jurisdictions, adoptive parents are licensed as and technically considered foster parents while the adoption is being finalized.[74] According to the U.S Department of Health and Human Services Children's Bureau, there were approximately 408,425 children in foster care in 2010. Of those children, twenty-five percent had a goal of adoption. In 2015, 243,060 children exited foster care and twenty-two percent were adopted.[75] Nationwide, there are more than one hundred thousand children in the U.S. foster care system waiting for permanent families.[76]
