A fragile six-month truce between Hamas and Israel expired on December 19, 2008.[80] Hamas and Israel could not agree on conditions to extend the truce.[81] Hamas blamed Israel for not lifting the Gaza Strip blockade, and for an Israeli raid on a purported tunnel, crossing the border into the Gaza Strip from Israel on November 4,[82] which it held constituted a serious breach of the truce.[83] Israel accuses Hamas of violating the truce citing the frequent rocket and mortar attacks on Israeli cities.[84]
