Three series, each consisting of six episodes, have been broadcast in the UK, as of August 2018. Each series deals with a new case, introducing seemingly unconnected characters who are gradually revealed to have some relationship with the victim. As the murder mystery unfolds, the emotional ramifications of the crime are also explored in the lives of those affected.[2] Sometime after the third series finished ITV announced that a fourth series was to be made, and is expected to air sometime in 2019.
