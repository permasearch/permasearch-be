"Flow" is defined as "the rhythms and rhymes"[56][57][58] of a hip-hop song's lyrics and how they interact â€“ the book How to Rap breaks flow down into rhyme, rhyme schemes, and rhythm (also known as cadence).[59] 'Flow' is also sometimes used to refer to elements of the delivery (pitch, timbre, volume) as well,[60] though often a distinction is made between the flow and the delivery.[57][56]
