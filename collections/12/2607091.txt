On tour with his band Atoms for Peace, singer Thom Yorke debuted a solo acoustic version of "Lotus Flower" at the Echoplex in Los Angeles on 2 October 2009.[1] Like the rest of The King of Limbs, the song was possibly recorded in the house of actress Drew Barrymore, who is thanked in the album's liner notes.[2]
