After his mother's death, Jafar becomes the servant boy of the Sultan of Lower Agrabah, despite hoping to live at the palace as his son. One day, Jafar speaks up during a diplomatic meeting between the Sultan, his heir Mirza, and diplomats from other cities of Agrabah. Due to this, the Sultan drowns him but Jafar is resurrected back to life. Jafar later trains with sorceress Amara with hopes to get even with the Sultan. As an adult, he seeks out genie bottles, betraying Amara by cursing her into a serpent staff to channel her magic. When he loses the last bottle, Jafar moves to the Capital and controls the Sultan of Agrabah, but is defeated by Aladdin. Soon afterwards, he tricks Pincess Jasmine into marrying him to gain the Jewel of Agrabah, which he use to remove Agrabah from human's reach. He then tracks the final bottle in Wonderland, where he teams up with the Red Queen.
