Blikkiesdorp has become well known for its high crime rate, its substandard living conditions, and its extremely hot or cold, windy and sandy living environment.[35][36][37][38] NGOs, international human rights organisations, and the Anti-Eviction Campaign have publicly criticised the conditions in Blikkiesdorp and how they say it is used to reinforce the eviction of poor families especially to make way for the 2010 World Cup.[16][38][39][40] Residents also threatened to burn down Blikkiesdorp before the World Cup begins because of the bad conditions in the settlement.[41]
