Before the relatively recent discovery of neurons and their role in pain, various different body functions were proposed to account for pain. There were several competing early theories of pain among the ancient Greeks: Hippocrates believed that it was due to an imbalance in vital fluids.[44] In the 11th century, Avicenna theorized that there were a number of feeling senses including touch, pain and titillation.[45]
