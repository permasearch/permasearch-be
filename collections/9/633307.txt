A series of anti-Chinese riots erupted throughout Korea in 1931 as a result of public anger against the treatment of Korean migrants in Manchuria. In the small town of Wanpaoshan near Changchun, "violent clashes" broke out between the Chinese and Korean residents. The Governor-General of Korea announced there were more than 100 dead Chinese victims.[44] Approximately 127 Chinese people were killed, 393 wounded, and a considerable number of properties were destroyed.[45] The worst of the rioting occurred in Pyongyang on 5 July. The Chinese further alleged the Japanese authorities in Korea did not take adequate steps to protect the lives and property of the Chinese residents, and blamed the authorities for allowing inflammatory accounts to be published. The anti-Chinese sentiments benefited the Japanese, as these sentiments "displaced attention and resentment away from Japanese imperialism".[45] As a result of this riot, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Kijūrō Shidehara, who insisted on Japanese, Chinese, and Korean harmony, lost his position.[45]
