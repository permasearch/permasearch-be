The young women were eager to expand the Sorority after its founding. However they wanted to ensure that any new chapters would maintain the same high scholastic and other standards of its members and that they would be properly initiated. The sorority initially expanded with a second chapter, Beta, established at Wilberforce University, February 5, 1914.[20] The third chapter, Gamma, was established in 1918 at the University of Pennsylvania. Soon after, Delta Chapter was established (April 4, 1919) at the University of Iowa and Epsilon Chapter at The Ohio State University (November 19, 1919).[21]
