Efferent vagus nerve fibers innervating the pharynx and back of the throat are responsible for the gag reflex. In addition, 5-HT3 receptor-mediated afferent vagus stimulation in the gut due to gastroenteritis is a cause of vomiting.[4] Stimulation of the vagus nerve in the cervix uteri (as in some medical procedures) can lead to a vasovagal response.
