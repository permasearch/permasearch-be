This state experiences a temperate climate and has a large coastal area. Fewer snakes are present than in warmer states, for snakes prefer a warmer and sunnier environment where they can bask. Being poikilothermic, they depend heavily upon external heat for survival. The White-Lipped Snake is one of few species that is able to survive in the cold highland regions on Victoria. Its preferred habitat is tussock grass or sedge fields where the small snake finds shelter under logs or dense vegetation. Since the habitat is so frigid, its oviparous characteristic is very remarkable; the snakeâ€™s small size and secretive habits most likely play a role in its survival under such conditions. Although these harsh conditions do not have much of an impact on the snake's eggs, it does affect its fecundity by limiting reproduction to every 2 to 3 years.
