Police procedurals were enormously popular in Australia in the 1960s and 1970s, but by the 1980s they had been replaced by home-grown soap operas and mini-series. Blue Heelers, however, was Australia's most popular television drama while it lasted. The series drew more than 2.5Â million viewers every week at its peak.[2] Along with Homicide, Blue Heelers holds the Australian record for most episodes produced of a weekly prime-time drama. It was also nearly the longest-running series,[4][5] but Homicide lasted one calendar month longer and, due to five feature-length episodes, had more time on air.
