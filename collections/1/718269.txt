Like the momentum, this distribution is seen to be the product of three independent normally distributed variables      v  x     {\displaystyle v_{x}}  ,      v  y     {\displaystyle v_{y}}  , and      v  z     {\displaystyle v_{z}}  , but with variance        k T  m     {\displaystyle {\frac {kT}{m}}}  . It can also be seen that the Maxwell–Boltzmann velocity distribution for the vector velocity [vx, vy, vz] is the product of the distributions for each of the three directions:
