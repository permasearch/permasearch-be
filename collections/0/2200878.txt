At the 1987 Big Game, Kelly was attacked by several Cal students who had run onto the field during the halftime show. Barely escaping, Kelly led them to the drum section where all three Berkeley students were tackled and then pummeled. No sticks were dropped in the process. The Cal students were arrested and carted off to cheers from the student section.
