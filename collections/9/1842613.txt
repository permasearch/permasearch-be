SDUSA's politics were criticized by former Socialist Party Chairman Michael Harrington, who in 1972 announced that he favored an immediate pull-out of US forces from Vietnam (without requiring any guarantees); after losing all votes at the 1972 convention that changed the Socialist Party to SDUSA, Harrington resigned in 1973 and formed his Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (DSOC), which welcomed the New Politics and middle-class leadership.[2][4] The 1972 changing of the name of the Socialist Party of America to SDUSA and the 1973 formation of DSOC represented a split in the U.S.Â socialist movement.
