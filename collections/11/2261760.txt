The North Terminal, designed by Gensler and built by Walbridge/Barton Malow Joint Venture,[35] opened September 17, 2008, as the replacement for the aged Berry and Smith terminals, which housed all non-SkyTeam airlines. Initially, Wayne County Airport Authority sought bids for the naming rights of the North Terminal, however, after two years with no successful offers, the effort ceased and the North Terminal name remained.[36]
