"Deeper Underground - Chillington Mix" is featured on the second release of "Canned Heat". Chillington is not the name of an artist or DJ, but the name of the studios at Jay's Home in Buckinghamshire. The Chillington Mix samples heavily from the Jamiroquai song Getinfunky which is found on some special releases of Synkronized, such as the Japanese release where it replaced "Deeper Underground" as the bonus track, and alongside Wolf In Sheep's Clothing on the Australian double disc. On the High Times: The Singles DVD, Jay comments on a bonus feature that the original Godzilla song was just made of "Ominous noises" which strongly matches the sound of Getinfunky. When the title or the remix and "Ominous noises" evidence is pared it strongly suggests that "Getinfunky" is an early version of the Godzilla song which later evolved into "Deeper Underground".
