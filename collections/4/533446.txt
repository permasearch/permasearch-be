The directive function of autobiographical memory uses past experiences as a reference for solving current problems and a guide for our actions in the present and the future.[1] Memories of personal experiences and the rewards and losses associated with them can be used to create successful models, or schemas, of behaviour. which can be applied over many scenarios.[10] In instances where a problem cannot be solved by a generic schema, a more specific memory of an event can be accessed in autobiographical memory to give some idea of how to confront the new challenge.[1]
