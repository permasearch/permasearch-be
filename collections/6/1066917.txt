Noon chai is traditionally made from special tea leaves, milk, salt, and usually cooked in a samavar.[5] A pinch of baking soda gives it a pronounced pink color. Sugar is not traditionally used in Kashmiri home recipes, although newer commercial preparations in Pakistani restaurants and tea stalls may include sweetener. In Kashmiri culture, this beverage may be consumed two to three times a day with traditional Kashmiri breads and pastries like lavasa, sheermaal, kandir Chaeut, bakarkhani kulcha, Tailwoud, Makaiee chauet,& the mostly with saet.
