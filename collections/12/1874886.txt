Woodland caribou were historically found in most of the northern Rocky Mountains, possibly ranging as far south as Wyoming. They have declined dramatically over most of their range and have been almost entirely eliminated in the United States. Currently, populations are found in the Canadian Rockies, the Selkirks, and several other ranges. The primary cause for their decline is the logging of old-growth forests. British Columbia is attempting to reverse their decline by culling the province's abundant wolves.
