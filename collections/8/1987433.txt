At Governor Barrios’ suggestion, the Presidio of San Agustin de Ahumada was erected in the summer of 1756 near El Orcoquisac, the spot of Blancpain’s capture.  The mission of Nuestra Senora de la Luz (Our Lady of Light) was made by its side.  The site of El Orcoquisac, the name of the settlement on the Trinity, was near a lagoon a short distance east of the Trinity, about two leagues from the head of the bay.
