Ellen Kathleen Pompeo was born in Everett, Massachusetts, on November 10, 1969, the daughter of Joseph E. Pompeo and Kathleen B. Pompeo (née O'Keefe).[1][2][3] Her father was of Italian, English, and Irish descent, while her mother was of Irish ancestry.[4][5] She was raised as a Catholic.[6] Her mother died of a painkiller overdose when Ellen was five, and her father remarried soon after; he died on September 1, 2012.[7] In 2006, Pompeo told Allure "I think having my mother die at such a very young age – when she was 33 – I appreciate life so much."[8] She has five siblings: three sisters and two brothers. She was nicknamed "the pencil", and "stracciatella" (Italian Ice Cream flavour).[9] Pompeo worked as a barmaid in Miami when she started dating fashion photographer Andrew Rosenthal.[10] Together, they moved to New York City in 1995 where she was approached by a casting director to appear in various adverts for Citibank and L'Oreal.[1][10]
