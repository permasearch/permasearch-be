The Second Avenue Subway (internally referred to as the IND Second Avenue Line by the MTA; abbreviated to SAS) is a New York City Subway line that runs under Second Avenue on the East Side of Manhattan. The first phase of this new line, with three new stations on Manhattan's Upper East Side, opened on January 1, 2017. The full Second Avenue Line, if and when funded, is to be built in three more phases that will eventually connect 125th Street to Hanover Square. The proposed full line would be 8.5 miles (13.7Â km) long with 16 stations and a projected daily ridership of 560,000, costing more than $17 billion.
