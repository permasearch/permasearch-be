Adult corn snakes have a body length of 61–182 centimetres (2.00–5.97 ft).[11] In the wild, they usually live around 6–8 years, but in captivity can live to an age of 23 years or more.[12] They can be distinguished from Copperhead snakes by their brighter colors, slender build, round pupils and lack of heat-sensing pits.[13]
