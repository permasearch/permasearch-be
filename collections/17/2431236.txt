No, you're not hearing me correctly. Grayson grilling the IG is but one example of the recent FED outrage. There are 170 plus CO-SPONSORS to a bill which will audit the FED entirely. That's not sensationalism, that's huge, legitamite news and MUST be added to the article. The proposed titles were merely propositions. Perhaps Audit Bill of 2009 would be the best choice here.
