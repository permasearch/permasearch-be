Scenes for the caravan park have been shot at the Jackaroo Ranch in Kenthurst since the show began airing in 1988. The caravan park and house were severely damaged during a bush fire in 2002, causing production to move.[7] Other filming locations for the caravan park included the Lane Cove River Tourist Park and Waratah Park Earth Sanctuary in Duffys Forest.[8] The caravan park set moved back to the Jackaroo Ranch following a rebuild, and returned to screens in 2015.[9] Sarah Thomas of The Sun-Herald wrote that the caravan park has been "a pillar of the community since Home & Away's beginnings in 1988."[8] Thomas also described the park as "a fictional budget-friendly holiday spot".[8]
