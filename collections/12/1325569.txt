Black Francis recalled that he wrote "Here Comes Your Man" around the time he was age 14 or 15.[3] Years later after the Pixies were formed, producer Paul Kolderie noted the group didn't want to record "Here Comes Your Man" for its demo "The Purple Tape". The group referred to it as "the Tom Petty song", according to Kolderie. Producer Gary Smith said, "There was some reluctance to do 'Here Comes Your Man' because it was too pop, there was something too straight about it."[4]  When 4AD label head Ivo Watts-Russell handpicked the track listing for the group's debut release Come on Pilgrim, he intentionally left out "Here Comes Your Man". Watts-Russell stated that he liked the song, but "it felt just too obviously commercial and I didn't know what we were doing with [the band]".[5] Watts-Russell also felt it was too reminiscent of Mink DeVille's "Spanish Stroll".[6] For a post-Surfer Rosa single, 4AD rejected another recording of the song; they later chose "Gigantic", with "River Euphrates" on the B-side.[7]
