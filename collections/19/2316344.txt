On January 17, 1941, the National Football League franchise owners voted to change the league's constitution in an attempt to bring all professional football leagues under the authority of a single Commissioner, who would have similar powers to that of Commissioner of Baseball Kenesaw Mountain Landis. The owners had already reached working agreements with the American Football Association and the Dixie League and invited all other leagues, including the American Football League to join.[7]
