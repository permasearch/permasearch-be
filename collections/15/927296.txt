The Netherlands has a low rate of births and abortions among teenagers (5 births per 1,000 women aged 15â€“19 in 2002[5]). Compared with countries with higher teenage birth rates, the Dutch have a higher average age at first intercourse and increased levels of contraceptive use (including the "double Dutch" method of using both a hormonal contraception method and a condom[citation needed]).
