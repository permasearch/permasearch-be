Ringer and Cassie begin their infiltration of the base. Upon landing, the pilot runs away, telling Ringer that she is an idiot and they were instructed not to kill her because Vosch wanted her to return. He then screams to the soldiers that the helicopter has a bomb. Cassie (now dressed in a soldier uniform) runs one way as Ringer runs another. Ringer detonates the first bomb and in the confusion Cassie is able to hide among the troops. Cassie and Ringer plan to make it to the command center from opposite directions. As Cassie makes her way there, Ringer sets off additional bombs to continue causing chaos. During Cassie's travels she continuously hears an alarm warning that General Order 4 will commence in 5 minutes and all forces are to head to their designated safe areas. Not knowing what it means, she continues to fight more troops as she proceeds forward. Upon making it to the last door (where she is too wait for Ringer to reunite with her) General Order 4 activates. All the lights in the base go dark. Cassie, still not understanding, assumes the order was to blackout the base. While waiting for Ringer, the sprinkler system goes off. Cassie assumes the bombing must have set it off and thinks nothing of it, within a few minutes Cassie's skin begins to burn and boils appear. She realizes General Order 4 is a small version of the first three waves used as a defense mechanism for the base. Power goes out, water floods and disease as poison is spread. In burning pain, she runs towards a window and shoots it out. Now outside, she rolls around in the dirt to try and get the poison off her skin.
