In the episode "Someone to Watch Over Me", the piano player riffs on a theme which Starbuck identifies as the second movement of Nomian's 3rd Sonata; the theme is Stu Phillips' "Exploration", the trumpet fanfare from the prelude to the original theme.[7] The prelude fanfare is also heard during the ceremonial squadron flyby in the first part of the miniseries.
