GAs are usually synthesized from the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway in higher plants.[12] In this pathway, bioactive GA is produced from trans-geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP).[12] In the MEP pathway, three classes of enzymes are used to yield GA from GGDP: 1) terpene synthases (TPSs), 2) cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), and 3) 2-oxoglutarateâ€“dependent dioxygenases (2ODDs).[9] There are 8 steps in the methylerythritol phosphate pathway: - 1) GGDP is converted to ent-copalyl diphosphate (ent-CPD) by ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase - 2) etn-CDP is converted to ent-kaurene by ent-kaurene synthase - 3) ent-kaurene is converted to ent-kaurenol by ent-kaurene oxidase (KO) - 4) ent-kaurenol is converted to ent-kaurenal by KO - 5) ent-kaurenal is converted to ent-kaurenoic acid by KO - 6) ent-kaurenoic acid is converted to ent-7a-hydroxykaurenoic acid by ent-kaurene acid oxidase (KAO) - 7) ent-7a-hydroxykaurenoic acid is converted to GA12-aldehyde by KAO - 8) GA12-aldehyde is converted to GA12 by KAO. GA12 is processed to the bioactive GA4 by oxidations on C-20 and C-3, which is accomplished by 2 soluble ODDs: GA 20-oxidase and GA 3-oxidase.[9]
