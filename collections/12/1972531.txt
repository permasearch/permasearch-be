In The New 52 (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Deathstroke is known as a top mercenary around the world.[30] Deathstroke is hired by a man named Cristoph for a mission that forces him to work with a team of younger mercenaries known as the Alpha Dogs. Their target is Jeffrey Bode, an arms dealer traveling on a plane. After discovering that the weapons Bode is trafficking are clones of the villain Clayface, Deathstroke and the other mercenaries are able to dispatch them, killing Bode in the process and retrieving a suitcase he had in his possession. Deathstroke subsequently betrays and kills the Alpha Dogs, enraged by the notion that his employers feel he is unable to accomplish his tasks alone. Deathstroke then begins to take on increasingly dangerous missions in an effort to prove his worth but is also spurred on by the contents of the suitcase he retrieved from Bode â€“ namely the mask and knife belonging to his son Grant, both of which were stained with fresh blood indicating that he may be alive.[31] During this time, Deathstroke is pursued by a new villain known as Legacy.[32] Deathstroke kills Legacy, but another Legacy, donning the same colors as the last one, appears again, and again. It turns out the parents of one of the Alpha Dog members have hired multiple mercenaries to kill Deathstroke, all donning the green and purple color, to get revenge on him. Deathstroke tracks them down, but is confronted by his son Grant. It is revealed that all of this has been a plot to lure Deathstroke to him. Although Deathstroke manages to kill both the parents, Grant defeats him, claiming superior of Deathstroke. Grant is about to finish Slade, but he hesitates, and leaves. Recovering from his injuries, Grant takes another contract, Slade happy that his son has become a better warrior than him, and then visits his father's hospital bed to mention he has grown up to be a greater man than him.
