McDonald's in Taiwan serve kao fan (烤飯, kǎo fàn) (literally "baked rice"), a burger-like entrée with rice patties instead of buns.[48] It is modelled on the eponymous product of McDonald's Japanese rival, MOS Burger. McDonald's locations in Taiwan sell fried chicken legs to compete with KFC. Additionally, corn soup is available as a substitute for French fries or à la carte.
