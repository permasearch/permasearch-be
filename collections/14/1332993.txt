Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, saying "Good old reliable American Dad was again the best of the bunch, though I suspect I would have liked this episode a lot more if I had any real knowledge about My Morning Jacket, a band I always mean to get into but never do. The show seems to do a lot of plots where Stan is introduced to some new craze by one of the supporting characters and then he goes nuts for it, but it's usually funny because Stan is such a straitlaced character. So his obsession with the band, which seemed like it would stop being funny roughly a minute after it was introduced, kept getting weirder and weirder and funnier and funnier."[3] The episode was watched by a total of 5.52 million people, this made it the fourth most watched show on Animation Domination that night, losing to The Cleveland Show, The Simpsons and Family Guy with 7.38 million.[4]
