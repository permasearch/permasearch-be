CLV1 has been shown to interact with several cytoplasmic proteins that are most likely involved in downstream signalling. For example, the CLV complex has been found to be associated with Rho/Rac small GTPase-related proteins.[2] These proteins may act as an intermediate between the CLV complex and a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which is often involved in signalling cascades.[8] KAPP is a kinase-associated protein phosphatase that has been shown to interact with CLV1.[9] KAPP is thought to act as a negative regulator of CLV1 by dephosphorylating it.[9]
