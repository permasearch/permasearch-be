Epic and Streamline Records released the song as a digital download on October 7, 2014.[4][5] It was initially promoted as the lead single from Braxton's fourth studio album Calling All Lovers,[5] but was later replaced by the 2015 track "If I Don't Have You" as its lead single.[6] The Walmart deluxe edition of the album includes the song as a bonus track.[7] In a 2017 interview, Braxton said that radio stations refused to play "Let Me Know" because it included a rapper. According to her, radio stations had requested a version without Future for airplay. Due to the experience, she said that she would never release a hip hop song in her future career.[8]
