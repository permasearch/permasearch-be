As with its chassis, the 1978â€“1979 Bronco derives much of its body from the F-Series truck line, sharing the doors, front roofline and sheetmetal, and interior with the F-Series.[13] Retaining the wagon body of its predecessor and adopting the configuration of the Blazer/Jimmy, the Bronco was fitted with a removable hardtop and folding rear seat. Similar to the Ford LTD Country Squire, the glass of the rear window rolled down into the tailgate (via a dash-mounted switch or from using the key on the outside), allowing the tailgate to fold down.
