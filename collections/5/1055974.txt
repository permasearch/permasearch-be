Billings Clinic started in 1911 as the general practice of Dr. Arthur J. Movius. By 1939, three new general practitioners had joined Dr. Movius's practice and the name was changed to The Billings Clinic. Billings Deaconess Hospital (founded in 1907) merged with Billings Clinic in 1990 to form the current hospital.[90] Billings Clinic currently employs around 3,400 people and is one of the largest employers in all of Montana.[91] In July 2012, Billings Clinic received a score of 72/100 for patient safety from Consumer Reports, making it the safest hospital out of the 1,159 hospitals rated.[92] Additionally, in January 2013, Billings Clinic was added to the Mayo Clinic Care Network, only the 12th hospital nationally to be added to the network and the only such health system in Montana.[93]
