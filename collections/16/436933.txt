Heavy logging in the late 19th century and early 20th century devastated much of the forests of the Smokies, but the National Park Service estimates 187,000 acres (760Â km2) of old growth forest remains,[3] comprising the largest old growth stand in the Eastern United States. Most of the forest is a mature second-growth hardwood forest.  The range's 1,600 species of flowering plants include over 100 species of native trees and 100 species of native shrubs.  The Great Smokies are also home to over 450 species of non-vascular plants, and 2,000 species of fungi.[11][12]
