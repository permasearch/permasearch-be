Phonon (quantized lattice vibration wave) is a central thermal energy carrier contributing to heat capacity (sensible heat storage) and conductive heat transfer in condensed phase, and plays very important role in thermal energy conversion. Its transport properties are represented by the phonon conductivity tensor Kp (W/m-K, from the Fourier law qk,p = -Kp⋅∇ T) for bulk materials, and the phonon boundary resistance ARp,b [K/(W/m2)] for solid interfaces, where A is the interface area. The phonon specific heat capacity cv,p (J/kg-K) includes the quantum effect. The thermal energy conversion rate involving phonon is included in         s ˙     i  -  j     {\displaystyle {\dot {s}}_{i{\mbox{-}}j}}  . Heat transfer physics describes and predicts, cv,p, Kp, Rp,b (or conductance Gp,b) and         s ˙     i  -  j     {\displaystyle {\dot {s}}_{i{\mbox{-}}j}}  , based on atomic-level properties.
