As time went on, their props and stage equipment became increasingly sophisticated. When they started to fill stadium sized venues and bigger, they ran into the problem of the audience no longer being able to see them due to the increased seating capacity – this problem was especially clear in their free 2006 concert in Rio de Janeiro on the A Bigger Bang tour,[356] which used over 500 lights, hundreds of speakers, and a video screen almost 13 metres in length.[357][358][359] Due to the vast size of the beach which the Stones performed on (2.5 km),[359] sound systems had to be set up in a relay pattern down the length of the beach, in order to keep the sound in sync with music from the stage;[359] for every 340 metres of beach, the sound had to be delayed an additional second.[358][359]
