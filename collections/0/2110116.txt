During the period that the complex served as an interests section, the U.S. was represented by Switzerland, and the Swiss maintained both the embassy complex and its effects. Renovations were completed on the complex in 1997. The building was upgraded from an interests section, and returned to its original role as the American embassy in Cuba, on July 20, 2015.[6][7][8][13]
