Early wind turbine control systems were designed for peak power extraction, also called maximum power point trackingâ€”they attempt to pull the maximum possible electrical power from a given wind turbine under the current wind conditions.[77] More recent wind turbine control systems deliberately pull less electrical power than they possibly could in most circumstances, in order to provide other benefits, which include:
