For the Secondary School Certificate Board (Standards 5-10), the pass marks for moving to the next standard are 35% (aggregate). Students who fail to get 35% in any one subject are deemed to have failed that subject. A student must pass every subject to move to the next standard. A student failing in any 1 subject is made to repeat the same standard. The same rules apply for the HSC board (standards 11 and 12).
