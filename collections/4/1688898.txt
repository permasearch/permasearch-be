Northern Cyprus fulfills all the classical criteria of statehood.[110] United Nations Peace Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) operates based on the laws of Northern Cyprus in north of Cyprus island.[111] According to European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), the laws of Northern Cyprus is valid in the north of Cyprus.[112] ECtHR did not accept the claim that the Courts of Northern Cyprus lacked "independence and/or impartiality".[113] ECtHR directed all Cypriots to exhaust "domestic remedies" applied by Northern Cyprus before taking their cases to ECtHR.[114] In 2014, United States' Federal Court qualified Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus as a "democratic country".[115][116][117] In 2017, United Kingdom's High Court decided that "There was no duty in UK law upon the UK's Government to refrain from recognising Northern Cyprus. The United Nations itself works with Northern Cyprus law enforcement agencies and facilitates cooperation between the two parts of the island."[118] UK's High Court also dismissed the claim that "cooperation between UK police and law agencies in northern Cyprus was illegal".[119]
