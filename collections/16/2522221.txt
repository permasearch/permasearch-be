Returning to England, the band went to Clearwell Castle to rehearse,[10] then entered Olympic Studios to record this album in May and June, with help from producers Doug Bennett and Roy Thomas Baker. The lead singles "Psychedelic Warlords (Disappear In Smoke)" (coupled with "It's So Easy") in the UK and an alternate version of "You'd Better Believe It" (coupled with "Paradox") in France were issued on 2 August, followed by the album on 6 September. Alternate studio versions of "It's So Easy", "You'd Better Believe It" and "Wind of Change" were later released in 2011 on Parallel Universe.
