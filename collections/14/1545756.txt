The main period of decolonisation in Africa began after World War Two, after growing independence movements, indigenous political parties and trade unions along with pressure within the imperialist powers. The majority of the continent was decolonised in 1980, however some areas today still remain colonised such as The Canary islands and Madeira, and countries such as South Africa still remain a large population of European descent and the European influence can still be felt in many parts of the continent of Africa. Brown describes how Western colonial authorities through the use of ‘Abjectivication’, still form the basis of the view of Africa as the less significant due to the dirt and lack of sanitation that has been put in place, and justifying the case of the west civilising process and affecting Africa still today.[30]
