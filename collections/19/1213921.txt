The strangest twist to the seemingly endless rivalry involved a small candy company in San Antonio, called Judson Candies.  In 1965, the Pearl Brewing Company bought Judson Candies from the three sons whose father had helped found the business.[20]  On its own, Judson was a profitable company that had an established name in the candy industry.  Judson was not on the level of Hershey or Mars, but  did have strong sales in the Southwest.  Pearl simply made the Judson sons an offer they could not refuse.  So, in 1965, Judson Candies joined the Pearl and Goetz families under the umbrella of the Pearl Brewing Company.
