The use of a seal by men of wealth and position was common before the Christian era, but high functionaries of the Church adopted the habit. An incidental allusion in one of St. Augustine's letters (217 to Victorinus) indicates that he used a seal.[23] The practice spread, and it seems to be taken for granted by King Clovis I at the very beginning of the Merovingian dynasty.[24]
