In 1909 Handy and his band moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where they played in clubs on Beale Street. The genesis of his "Memphis Blues" was a campaign song written for Edward Crump, a successful Memphis mayoral candidate in 1909 (and future political boss). Handy later rewrote the tune and changed its name from "Mr. Crump" to "Memphis Blues."
