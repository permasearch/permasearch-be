In the 1930s, Thorpe appeared in several short films and features. Usually, his roles were cameo appearances as an Indian, although in the 1932 comedy, Always Kickin, Thorpe was prominently cast in a speaking part as himself, a kicking coach teaching young football players to drop-kick. In 1931, during the Great Depression, he sold the film rights to his life story to MGM for $1,500 ($24,000 today).[118][119] Thorpe portrayed an umpire in the 1940 film Knute Rockne, All American.[120] He played a member of the Navajo band in the 1950 film Wagon Master.[121]
