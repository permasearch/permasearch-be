The evacuation of districts is part of disaster management. Many of the largest evacuations have been in the face of war-time military attacks. Modern large scale evacuations are usually the result of natural disasters. The largest peace-time evacuations in the United States to date occurred during Hurricane Gustav[citation needed] and the category-5 Hurricane Rita (2005) in a scare one month after the flood-deaths of Hurricane Katrina.
