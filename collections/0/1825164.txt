Mauji (Varun Dhawan),an incompetently illiterate young man, has inconvenient work and individual life. His boss treats him like a dog, his father never stops cursing him, and he has not even touched his wife Mamta's (Anushka Sharma) hand despite being married for years due to lack of space at home. But he always carries himself with a big smile despite facing odds.
