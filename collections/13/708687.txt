On 3 November 1994, the Taliban in a surprise attack conquered Kandahar City.[70] Before 4 January 1995, they controlled 12 Afghan provinces.[70] Militias controlling the different areas often surrendered without a fight. Omar's commanders were a mixture of former small-unit military commanders and madrassa teachers.[75][76][77][78][79] At these stages, the Taliban were popular, because they stamped out corruption, curbed lawlessness, and made the roads and area safe.[70]
