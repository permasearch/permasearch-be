Olympic ceremonies could be held in two venues simultaneously; the ceremony would begin at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Exposition Park to honor the legacy of the Olympics in Los Angeles and then transfer to the new Los Angeles Stadium at Hollywood Park in Inglewood to proceed with the parade of athletes, oaths, traditional Olympic protocol and the lighting of a cauldron. LA 2024 bid leaders wish to use the new LA stadium to dispel negative thought about using the LA Memorial Coliseum for a third Olympics. They also cite ticket sales at both sites as extra cash flow for the committee. The LA 2024 team also stated they would reverse the closing ceremony with a start at LA Stadium and close the show at the LA Coliseum if chosen.[63]
