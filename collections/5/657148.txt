During a press conference on October 4, Newton was asked a question by Jourdan Rodrigue, a female sportswriter for The Charlotte Observer, regarding passing routes. Newton smirked and said it was "funny" to hear a female talk about routes, then answered her question.[136] His remarks were viewed as sexist by Rodrigue as well as many in the media.[137][136][138] It later surfaced that Rodrigue had previously mocked Newton using a Twitter account with which she had also posted racist comments, causing the publication BlackSportsOnline.com to label her a hypocrite.[139] The following day, yogurt company Dannon dropped Newton as a sponsor.[140][141] Newton uploaded a video to Twitter later that day in which he apologized for his remarks.[142]
