Ben has a financial crisis and decides to do business with a loan shark, which is discovered by Mike. Mike then reveals that Renee got twelve million dollars in her divorce, so Ben, who had been ignoring Renee, suddenly begins treating her nicer and even plans to propose to her, but refrains from doing so and admits to her that he wanted to marry her for her money. Ben finally takes the money from the loan shark, but later has trouble paying him back and even has a stress-related attack, and ends being taken to hospital. Mike tells Renee about the situation, so she pays off the loan shark behind Ben's back. Ben attends Mike's funeral (he was murdered by the loan shark) as an usher.[citation needed]
