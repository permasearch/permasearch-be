In July 2002, AgustaWestland received a contract to conduct a formal assessment phase of the Future Lynx.[6] On 22 July 2002, a collaboration agreement was signed between AgustaWestland and Thales Group, under which Thales was assigned development responsibility for the programme's core avionics, including communications, navigation, and flight management electronics;[7] that same day, additional MOD funding for the fledgling Future Lynx programme was announced as having been allocated.[8] By April 2003, the in-service dates for the BLUH and SCMR programmes were reported as being April 2007 and April 2008 respectively.[6] Early on, AgustaWestland elected to adopt a glass cockpit incorporating electronics upgrades from the AgustaWestland AW101 along with various airframe improvements, such as a redesigned tail rotor and nose, as well as an increased use of machined components over fabricated counterparts, for the Future Lynx.[6][9] By July 2004, the option of upgrading and remanufacturing the first generation Lynx had reportedly been judged to be uneconomical, and the BLUH programme of building a new generation airframe had been given prominence instead.[10]
