Thomas is often described as an originalist, or textualist, and a member of the conservative wing of the Supreme Court.[5][91][92] He is also often described as the most conservative member of the Supreme Court,[16][93][94] although others gave Justice Scalia that designation.[95][96][97] Scalia and Thomas had similar but not identical judicial philosophies, and pundits speculate about the degree to which Scalia thought some of Thomas's views are implausible.[98][99]
