The U.S. Green Building Council also supported the Streamlining Energy Efficiency for Schools Act of 2014 (H.R. 4092; 113th Congress), a bill that would require the United States Department of Energy to establish a centralized clearinghouse to disseminate information on federal programs, incentives, and mechanisms for financing energy-efficient retrofits and upgrades at schools.[10] The U.S. Green Building Council said that the bill "aims to make important improvements to existing federal policies."[11]
