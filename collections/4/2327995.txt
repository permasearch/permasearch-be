Shew (シュウ, Shū, sometimes romanized as Shu or Xiu) is the successor of the Nanto Hakuroken (南斗白鷺拳, "South Dipper White Heron Fist") style, which specializes in kicks. He represents the Star of Benevolence (仁星, Jinsei), as well as a friend of Lei. Shew was once Thouzer's second-in-command and close friend. Some time before the events of the series, Shew met a young Kenshiro who was participating in a kumite against ten Nanto Seiken practitioners. Kenshiro had defeated all 9 prior opponents, leaving Shew as his final opponent, while Thouzer watched and mused about Kenshiro's strength. Shew quickly defeated Kenshiro, but chose to spare the young warrior in exchange for his eyesight. Through this self-mutilation, Shew gained the ability to see opponents using his heart, a skill which he would soon find to be his strongest asset. After the Nuclear War, Shew leads a resistance movement against Thouzer and his empire and is reunited with the now grown Kenshiro. Shew eventually fights Thouzer to save his villagers, but is defeated after Thouzer severs the tendons in his legs, rendering Shew unable to perform his acrobatic techniques. Shew is forced to carry the apex that will complete Thouzer's Holy Cross Mausoleum. He climbs to the top of the pyramid, but then gets impaled by several arrows. Kenshiro arrives, and tries to save Shew, but Thouzer hurls a heavy spear through Shew's chest as a Coup de grâce, mortally wounding the warrior, much to Kenshiro's horror. Shew miraculously recovers his eyesight and is able to see Kenshiro for the last time before being crushed by the apex.
