By 1925, Rothstein was one of the most powerful criminals in the country, and had forged a large criminal empire. For a time he was the largest bootlegger in the nation, until the rise of George Remus. With a reported wealth of over $10 million (which is worth roughly $125 million in 2016 dollars [20]) Rothstein was one of the wealthiest gangsters in US history, and is widely considered to be the founding father of organised crime in the United States.[21]
