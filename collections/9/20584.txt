A botanist H.J.Dittmer(1937) worked out that a 4 month-old rye plant had an aggregate root length of about 600 km. The number of root hairs in it exceeded 14 billions and their estimated total length would have even exceed 10,000 km. Thus, alltogether, the root of any plant provides a huge surface area to facilitate the absorption of water.
