Rwandan RPF troops finally left Congo in 2002, leaving a wake of disease and malnutrition that continued to kill thousands every month. However, Rwandan rebels continue to operate (as of May 2007) in the northeast Congo and Kivu regions. These are claimed to be remnants of Hutu forces that cannot return to Rwanda[28] without facing genocide charges, yet are not welcomed in Congo and are pursued by DRC troops.[29] In the first 6 months of 2007, over 260,000 civilians were displaced.[30] Congolese Mai Mai rebels also continue to threaten people and wildlife.[31] Although a large scale effort at disarming militias has succeeded, with the aid of the UN troops, the last militias are only being disarmed in 2007. However, fierce confrontations in the northeast regions of the Congo between local tribes in the Ituri region, initially uninvolved with the Hutu-Tutsi conflict but drawn into the Second Congo War, still continue.[citation needed]
