Chemical barriers also protect against infection. The skin and respiratory tract secrete antimicrobial peptides such as the Î²-defensins.[18] Enzymes such as lysozyme and phospholipase A2 in saliva, tears, and breast milk are also antibacterials.[19][20] Vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier following menarche, when they become slightly acidic, while semen contains defensins and zinc to kill pathogens.[21][22] In the stomach, gastric acid and proteases serve as powerful chemical defenses against ingested pathogens.
