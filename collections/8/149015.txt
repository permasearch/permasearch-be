Chargers are in use with numerous police agencies in North America as both marked and unmarked patrol cars. Law enforcement agencies outside of the U.S. have also purchased the Charger, including police services in Canada, Mexico, Chile,[51] the Czech Republic,[52] and the Middle East, including Bahrain, Kuwait, Lebanon, and the United Arab Emirates.[53]  Both V6 and V8 models are being adopted, with highway patrols favoring the 5.7 L (345 cu in) Hemi V8 engine and cities more likely to purchase the base police package with the 3.5L V6 fuel-efficient engine. The Charger is also in service with the U.S. federal government and in its military police services.
