Until 1 October 2011, with the exception of members of any ruling or formerly ruling dynastic houses (a measure of precaution against monarchist subversion,  and primarily aimed at members of the House of Habsburg), anyone entitled to vote in elections to the National Council who is at least 35 years of age is eligible for the office of president. The exception of ruling or formerly ruling dynasties has been abolished meanwhile within the WahlrechtsÃ¤nderungsgesetz 2011[11] (Amendment of the law on the right to vote 2011) due to an initiative by Ulrich Habsburg-Lothringen.
