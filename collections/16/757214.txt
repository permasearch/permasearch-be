Economist Paul Krugman notes the subprime boom "was overwhelmingly driven" by loan originators who were not subject to the Community Reinvestment Act.[111] One study, by a legal firm which counsels financial services entities on Community Reinvestment Act compliance, found that CRA-covered institutions were less likely to make subprime loans (only 20â€“25% of all subprime loans), and when they did the interest rates were lower. The banks were half as likely to resell the loans to other parties.[112]
