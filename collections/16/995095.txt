Manchuria was "cleansed" by Soviet forces of any potential military resistance. With Soviet support for the spread of communism,[40] Manchuria provided the main base of operations for Mao Zedong's forces, who proved victorious in the following four years of the Chinese Civil War. These military successes in Manchuria and China by the Communist Chinese led to the Soviet Union giving up their rights to bases in China — promised by the Western Allies — because all of the land deemed by the Soviets to be Chinese (as distinct from what the Soviets considered to be Soviet land which had been occupied by the Japanese), was eventually turned over to the People's Republic of China.[40] Before leaving Manchuria, Soviet forces and bureaucracy dismantled almost all of the portable parts of the considerable Japanese-built industry in Manchuria and relocated it to "restore industry in war-torn Soviet territory". That which was not portable was either disabled or destroyed; the Soviets had no desire for Manchuria to be an economic rival, particularly to the underdeveloped Far Eastern Soviet Territories.[30] After the establishment of the People's Republic of China the bulk of the Soviet economic assistance went to Manchuria to help rebuilding the region's industry.[41]
