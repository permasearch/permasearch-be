Liberty University has been been described as a "stage of choice in Republican presidential politics",[14] and a "pilgrimage site for GOP candidates."[12] According to the Washington Post, Republican candidates are drawn to the university because it is seen as a "bastion of the Christian right".[14] Ronald Reagan's close relationship with the university gave it significant publicity in its early years.[12] In 1990, 41st U.S President George H.W. Bush was the first sitting U.S. president to speak at Liberty's commencement.[22] Republican presidential candidates Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, John McCain and Mitt Romney have visited the campus.[11][15] Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson spoke at the university.[23] In 2017, President Donald J. Trump gave his first college commencement speech as sitting president at Liberty University.[24]
