The northern part of Sagar brought heavy rain and some minor flooding to coastal towns of Yemen.[11] Yemen's temporary capital Aden was hit by strong winds as tropical cyclone Sagar approached, prompting authorities to a call on residents to evacuate areas near the shore in the southern port city.[12]  Sagar brought heavy rainfall to coastal areas in Yemen's Hadramawt and Mahra provinces and Socotra Island. Strong winds in Hadramawt and Mahra damaged homes and led to numerous power outages,[12] and the deaths of 52 people,[13] including 23 from a landslide in Ethiopia.[14][15]
