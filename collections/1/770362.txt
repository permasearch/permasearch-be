She has spiritual powers, and academic Dani Cavallaro refers to C.C. as the "Witch of Fate" of the Code Geass series.[11] C.C. has the power of the "Code", given to her by a nun hundreds of years prior to Code Geass. The Geass power originally allowed her to make anyone around her love her, before leading to her being immortal and immune to both age and conventional injury.[12] She has survived being burned at the stake, beheaded by a guillotine, and placed in an iron maiden.[13]  When she uses her power, a sigil glows on her body.[14] When left alone, she sometimes appears to talk to herself and have discussions with those who aren't there.[15] This is later revealed to be telepathic communication, Lelouch's deceased mother Marianne being among the recipients.[16][17] C.C. can also give people the power of Geass or can cancel their Geass,[18] and sense when other people have it. In close proximity, C.C. can give people hallucinations of dark or chaotic images, to lead people into a panic.
