Ironically, hillbilly singer Mississippi Slim, one of Presley's heroes, was one of the singer's fiercest critics.[25] Phillips felt Dewey Phillips—a white DJ who did play 'black' music—would promote the new material, but many of the hundreds of listeners who contacted the station when "That's All Right" was played were sure Presley must be black. The singer was interviewed several times on air by the DJ and was pointedly asked which school he had attended, to convince listeners that he was white.[26]
