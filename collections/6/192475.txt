The accuracy of a pregnancy test is most closely related to the day of ovulation, not of the act of intercourse or insemination that caused the pregnancy. It is normal for sperm to live up to five days in the fallopian tubes, waiting for ovulation to occur.[9][unreliable medical source?][10]  It could take up to 12 further days for implantation to occur,[1] meaning even the most sensitive pregnancy tests may give false negatives up to 17 days after the act that caused the pregnancy. Because some home pregnancy tests have high hCG detection thresholds (up to 100 mIU/mL),[4] it may take an additional three or four days for hCG to rise to levels detectable by these tests â€” meaning false negatives may occur up to three weeks after the act of intercourse or insemination that causes pregnancy.[citation needed]
