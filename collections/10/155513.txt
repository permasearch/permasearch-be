Barney is apparently quite wealthy, and is undeniably the richest out of the five. He lives in an upscale apartment and is rich enough to own two 300Â inch televisions shipped from Japan as well as expensive memorabilia, including an Imperial Stormtrooper costume from the Star Wars films.[13] Barney is also shown to be a fan of the rock groups AC/DC, Van Halen and Bon Jovi.
