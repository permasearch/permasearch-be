In the late 1950s, most mainframes had no explicitly interactive interface, but only accepted sets of punched cards, paper tape, or magnetic tape to transfer data and programs. They operated in batch mode to support back office functions such as payroll and customer billing, much of which was based on repeated tape-based sorting and merging operations followed by a print run to preprinted continuous stationery. In cases where interactive terminals were supported, these were used almost exclusively for applications (e.g. airline booking) rather than program development. Typewriter and Teletype devices were also common control consoles for system operators through the 1970s, although ultimately supplanted by keyboard/display devices.
