In his first season, Carroll almost completely overturned the Seahawks roster, totaling over 200 transactions in the course of only one season. However, these moves paved the way for a 4–2 start to the 2010 season.[72] Although Seattle faltered through the latter half of the season, the team beat their NFC West division rival Rams in the final week of the regular season for the division championship, becoming the first 7–9 team in NFL history to win a division title.[73] Carroll made even more history as the Seahawks later upset the then-Super Bowl Champions New Orleans Saints by a score of 41-36 during the Wild Card Round of the playoffs, behind running back Marshawn Lynch and the famed Beast Quake run.[74] However, the following week at Soldier Field in Chicago, Illinois, they then fell to the Chicago Bears, whom they had defeated earlier in the season, in the Divisional Round by a score of 35-24.[75]
