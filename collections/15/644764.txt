Organosulfur compounds are used in pharmaceuticals, dyestuffs, and agrochemicals. Many drugs contain sulfur, early examples being antibacterial sulfonamides, known as sulfa drugs. Sulfur is a part of many bacterial defense molecules. Most Î²-lactam antibiotics, including the penicillins, cephalosporins and monolactams contain sulfur.[33]
