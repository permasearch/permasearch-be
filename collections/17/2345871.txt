The band's name was taken from a character in Martin Lawrence's comedy series, Martin. "We all used to dress alike, really different to everyone else. We wore fur in the summer when everyone else was in t-shirts," Pleasure explained. "On the show was a character called 'Pretty Ricky.' He was slick and always dressed different to everyone else, so all the girls at school started calling us 'Pretty Ricky'."
