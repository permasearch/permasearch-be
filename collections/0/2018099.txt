The number was shot in three takes, which were edited to give the appearance of a single six-minute long take.[3] Moore spent between three and four months preparing for the shoot, which involved over 60 cars, 30 dancers, and 100 extras. The number was choreographed with a single dancer at its beginning, with other dancers joining in incrementally, to avoid having everyone abruptly start dancing at once.[1] The ensemble also included several stunt performers.[12] Initial rehearsals with ten dancers occurred in a studio parking lot using about 20 staff members' cars.[1]
