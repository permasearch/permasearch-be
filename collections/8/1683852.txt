Article 3 regulates other insulting behavior (förolämpning), not characterized under Article 1 or 2 and is punishable with a fine or, if it is gross, with up to six months of prison or a fine.[91] While an act of defamation involves a third person, it is not a requirement for insulting behavior.[92]
