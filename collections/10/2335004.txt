Grunge lit is an Australian literary genre of fictional or semi-autobiographical writing  in the early 1990s about young adults living in an "inner cit[y]" "...world of disintegrating futures where the only relief from...boredom was through a nihilistic pursuit of sex, violence, drugs and alcohol".[140] Often the central characters are disfranchised, alienated, and lacking drive and determination beyond the desire to satisfy their basic needs. It was typically written by "new, young authors"[140] who examined "gritty, dirty, real existences"[140] of everyday characters.  It has been described as both a sub-set of dirty realism and an offshoot of Generation X literature.[141] Stuart Glover states that the term "grunge lit" takes the term "grunge" from the "late 80’s and early 90’s—...Seattle [grunge] bands".[142] Glover states that the term "grunge lit" was mainly a marketing term used by publishing companies; he states that most of the authors who have been categorized as "grunge lit" writers reject the label.[142] The Australian fiction authors McGahan, McGregor and Tsiolkas criticized the "homogenizing effect" of conflating such a different group of writers.[140] Tsiolkas called the "grunge lit" term a "media creation".[140]
