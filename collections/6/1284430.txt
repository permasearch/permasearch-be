Estranged brothers Arjun (Sidharth Malhotra) and Rahul Kapoor (Fawad Khan) are compelled to return to their childhood home in Coonoor when their 90-year-old grandfather Amarjeet (Rishi Kapoor) suffers a heart attack. Rahul is a successful writer who appears to be the most mature in the family. Meanwhile, Arjun struggles to get his books published, resorting to working part-time as a bartender to make ends meet, while writing in his spare time. Their parents, Harsh (Rajat Kapoor) and Sunita Kapoor (Ratna Pathak Shah) favour Rahul for being successful, which upsets Arjun. While the brothers struggle to get along, their parents grapple with their troubled marriage. Harsh is discouraging of Sunita's wish to open a catering business and Harsh's past extra-marital affair is a sore spot in their relationship. Amarjeet reveals that his last wish is to take a family photo titled "Kapoor & Sons, since 1921".
