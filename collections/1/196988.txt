Draft beer in Canada, when advertised as a "pint", is legally required to be 568 ml (20 fluid ounces).[22] With the allowed margin of error of 0.5 fluid ounces, a "pint" that is less than 554 ml of beer is an offence, though—to the detriment of consumers—this regulation is often violated and rarely enforced.[23]
