As the decades pass, Claudia becomes increasingly dissatisfied and irritated with constantly being "dressed as a doll" by her two fathers. Her frustration leads her to kill an innocent mother and daughter and leave their corpses to rot in the kitchen of the townhouse. When her deed is discovered by Lestat and Louis, she snaps into a blind rage and informs the two that she isn't a little girl anymore, but is cursed and trapped in the body of a five year old child, thus forever damned to a body never able to develop. She desperately wants to physically mature into a full grown woman but will never have that chance, and that she never asked to become a vampire in the first place, therefore she hates her two fathers more than she ever thought possible.
