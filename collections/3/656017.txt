Ganymede's discovery is credited to Galileo Galilei, who was the first to observe it on January 7, 1610.[1] The satellite's name was soon suggested by astronomer Simon Marius, after the mythological Ganymede, cupbearer of the Greek gods and Zeus's lover.[22] Beginning with Pioneer 10, several spacecraft have explored Ganymede.[23] The Voyager probes refined measurements of its size, while Galileo discovered its underground ocean and magnetic field. The next planned mission to the Jovian system is the European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE), due to launch in 2022. After flybys of all three icy Galilean moons, the probe is planned to enter orbit around Ganymede.[24]
