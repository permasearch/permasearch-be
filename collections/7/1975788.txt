Gilmour was responsible for bringing Kate Bush to public attention.[citation needed] While she was still at school, her family produced a demo tape with over 50 of her compositions, which was turned down by record labels. Gilmour received a copy of the demo from Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of Gilmour and the Bush family. Impressed with what he heard, Gilmour helped the sixteen-year-old Bush get a more professional-sounding demo tape recorded that would be more saleable to the record companies.[43] Three tracks in total were recorded and paid for by Gilmour.[44] The tape was produced by Gilmour's friend Andrew Powell (who would go on to produce Bush's first two albums) and sound engineer Geoff Emerick.[45] Gilmour then arranged for EMI executive Terry Slater to hear the tape.[46] Slater was impressed by the tape and signed her.[47]
