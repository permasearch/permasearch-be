What follows next is a series of increasingly bizarre scenarios, in which Dash discovers his teacher and principal to be mind-controlling aliens called Sporlanx, his parents are brainwashed into being their slaves, and the Underminer, who was presumed dead after the events of the second video game, is allied with Earth to fend off the invaders. However, all these events are all revealed as being part of Dash's hyper-fast imagination, in which he is trapped by Mezmerella's paralyzing trance. Fighting her power, Dash is able to regain consciousness, and defeat Mezmerella. She is then seen in prison, angered over her defeat as a contact letter for the Unforgivables arrives and proceeds to bring the prison under their control to use it as a base. She then is used in the grand plot to take over Metroville by entering a Power Amplifier that allows her to bring the entire city under her control, but put her into a state of unconsciousness from the overload.
