DC Entertainment has released a clay stop motion animation web series called John Con Noir. The web series is developed by Cool Town Creations to support the petition for the television series to be renewed for a second season.[61][62] The first chapter was released on January 16, 2015 on the DC Comics official website and YouTube account, in addition to the mid-season premiere on NBC.[61] Ryan reprises the role of John Constantine as the character tries to find his own program's creators and showrunners, Goyer and Cerone, after they go missing. If Constantine does not succeed, then the NBC network will have no other choice but to cancel the program.[citation needed]
