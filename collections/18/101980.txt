Following the 2016 season, Australia's national governing body of Netball Australia broke away from the trans-Tasman championship[99] and launched its own national league, Suncorp Super Netball. The initial team salary cap in the new league was A$675,000, with minimum player salaries of A$27,375. This latter figure was more than double the minimum wage of A$13,250 in the final season of the ANZ Championship.[100] New Zealand rebranded its now-domestic league as the ANZ Premiership, presumably retaining its prior salary cap provisions.
