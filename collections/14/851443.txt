Hypoxia and eutrophication (low oxygen level resulting conditions) are direct impacts felt by the Sound and are fulled by the following conditions: higher temperatures, stratified water columns (when the water is not well mixed vertically) and excess nutrients (often nitrogen and phosphorus).  It is commonly associated with overgrowth of algae that dies in large numbers, sinks to the bottom, and decomposes by using available oxygen in the water and leaving little for other species, causing the system to suffer as a whole. [20] To date the primary target for water remediation tactics in Long Island Sound have been nutrients entering from waste water treatment facilities and watersheds such as the Connecticut River Watershed. The Connecticut River Water Shed extents though new England and into Canada and carries pollution from all of the communities it passes into the Sound at a rate of 18,400 cubic feet per second.  [21]
