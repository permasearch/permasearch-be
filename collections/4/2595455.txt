The Bee Gees covered "Every Day I Have to Cry" as teenage recording artists in Australia. This version was recorded at Festival Studios on February 1965 and marked two important firsts for the group - Robin Gibb's debut lead vocal and Maurice Gibb playing organ - the first of many times he would contribute keyboards to the group's recordings.[3] The record was backed with "You Wouldn't Know", a Barry Gibb original which was also featured later the same year on the group's first album, The Bee Gees Sing and Play 14 Barry Gibb Songs.
