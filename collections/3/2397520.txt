According to EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica the roots of fascism are either tied to the Jacobin movement or a 19th-century backlash against the Enlightenment.[70] Historians such as Irene Collins and Howard C Payne see Napoleon III, who ran a 'police state' and suppressed the media, as a forerunner of fascism.[71] According to David Thomson,[72] the Italian Risorgimento of 1871 led to the 'nemesis of fascism'. William L Shirer[73] sees a continuity from the views of Fichte and Hegel, through Bismarck, to Hitler; Robert Gerwarth speaks of a 'direct line' from Bismarck to Hitler.[74] Julian Dierkes sees fascism as a 'particularly violent form of Imperialism'.[75]
