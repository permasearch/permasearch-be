During production, there was criticism regarding the film's purported downplaying of Turing's homosexuality,[101] particularly condemning the portrayal of his relationship with close friend and one-time fiancÃ©e Joan Clarke. Hodges, author of the book upon which the film was based, described the script as having "built up the relationship with Joan much more than it actually was".[102] Turing's niece Payne thought that Knightley was inappropriately cast, as she described the real Clarke as "rather plain", and said: "I think they might be trying to romanticise it. It makes me a bit mad. You want the film to show it as it was, not a lot of nonsense."[103]
