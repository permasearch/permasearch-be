In season 5 of Major Crimes, Taylor is murdered in a courtroom shootout, leaving Pope to find a new Assistant Chief. A competition develops between Deputy Chief Winnie Davis, Commander Leo Mason and Captain Sharon Raydor for the position. After Davis' behavior nearly screws up a case in "Shockwave, Part 1," Pope is stated in "Shockwave, Part 2" to have sent her to a leadership conference and replaced her liaison role in the case with Fritz Howard. At the end of "Shockwave, Part 2," Pope promotes Leo Mason to the role of Assistant Chief and Mason promotes Sharon Raydor to the rank of Commander, the promotion that she had long ago been promised by Pope and Taylor but denied.
