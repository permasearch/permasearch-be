Originally applied to the whole Frankish Empire, the name "France" comes from the Latin "Francia", or "country of the Franks".[21] Modern France is still named today "Francia" in Italian and Spanish, "Frankreich" ("Frankish Empire") in German and "Frankrijk" in Dutch, all of which have more or less the same historical meaning.
