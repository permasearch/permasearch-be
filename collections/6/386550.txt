… We arrived at Ammayanayakanur at 11:30 am the train being  23 minutes late, and … had dinner at 6 pm and about 7’o clock started in the bullock transit – there  being four of these carts altogether – to do some 40 miles, to a village called Tayne(Theni). The bullock transits, and the carriage of all stores to Bodynaikanur , are managed by the United Carrying Company and one has to write the agent of this company at Ammayanayakanur for all that may be required.
