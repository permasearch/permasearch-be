Each year, the AAAS gives out a number of honorary awards, most of which focus on science communication, journalism, and outreach — sometimes in partnership with other organizations. The awards recognize "scientists, journalists, and public servants for significant contributions to science and to the public’s understanding of science.”[30] The awards are presented each year at the association’s annual meeting.
