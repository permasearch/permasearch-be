In November 1861 tensions escalated between Washington and London when an American warship stopped the British mail ship RMSÂ Trent on the high seas and seized two Confederate diplomats, James Mason and John Slidell. London demanded their return and an apology, and to signal its intention to defend its possessions sent 14,000 combat troops to Canada, while the colonials planned to raise 40,000 militia. President Abraham Lincoln diffused the crisis by releasing the diplomats; he did not issue an apology. He cautioned his Secretary of State William H. Seward, "One war at a time." The British decided that unification of the Canadian colonies was now a high priority--a new strong dominion would relieve London of the need to station large British forces to defend Canada.[3]
