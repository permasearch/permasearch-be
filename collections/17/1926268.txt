Olague testified that Castanon had agreed to give Fierro and Olague a ride to Juarez and Fierro shot and killed Castanon on the way there. Fierro was in an El Paso jail when police questioned him about the Castanon murder. He stated that local police told him that his parents were being held hostage in Mexico by Juarez detectives. Fierro said in a recent interview from Death Row in Livingston: "He told me if I signed, then they'd let them go, and if not, they were going to torture them." At Fierro's trial, Juarez and El Paso police denied wrongdoing.[4]
