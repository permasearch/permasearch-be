In the later 19th century there was an increasing appetite for large scale works that covered epic, biblical and mythical themes. This was reflected in the topics of operas, cantatas and oratorios, often utilising British poems and novels. These included choral works like William Sterndale Bennett's The May Queen (1858),[30] Ebenezer Prout's Hereward and King Alfred[31] and cantatas like Sullivan and Henry Fothergill Chorley's The Masque at Kenilworth (1864),[32] John Francis Barnett's Ancient Mariner (1867)[33] and Frederic Hymen Cowen's The Rose Maiden (1870) and Harold (1895).[34] Similar trends can be seen in operas such as George Alexander Macfarren's Robin Hood (1860), Sullivan's Ivanhoe (1891) and in the operas of Arthur Goring Thomas, which included Esmeralda (1883) and Nadeshda (1885).[35][36]
