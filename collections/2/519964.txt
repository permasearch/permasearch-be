Male tigers are generally more intolerant of other males within their territories than females are of other females. Territory disputes are usually solved by displays of intimidation rather than outright aggression. Several such incidents have been observed in which the subordinate tiger yielded defeat by rolling onto its back and showing its belly in a submissive posture.[94] Once dominance has been established, a male may tolerate a subordinate within his range, as long as they do not live in too close quarters.[89] The most aggressive disputes tend to occur between two males when a female is in oestrus, and may rarely result in the death of one of the males.[89][94]
