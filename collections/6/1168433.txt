In recognition of his performance in East of Eden, Dean was nominated posthumously for the 1956 Academy Awards as Best Actor in a Leading Role of 1955, the first official posthumous acting nomination in Academy Awards history.[38] (Jeanne Eagels was nominated for Best Actress in 1929,[39] when the rules for selection of the winner were different.) East of Eden was the only film starring Dean that he would see released in his lifetime.[40][41]
