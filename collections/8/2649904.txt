Following the Iranian Revolution of 1979 and the resulting hostage crisis, the United States imposed an asset freeze and trade embargo against Iran. While those sanctions were later lifted, the United States imposed new sanctions in 1987 after Iran's actions against shipping in the Persian Gulf and support of international terrorism,[1] in 1987 the United States imposed economic sanctions against Iran. The sanctions were expanded in 1995 to include firms dealing with the Iranian government.[2] In 2006, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1696[3] and imposed sanctions after Iran refused to suspend its uranium enrichment program. U.S. sanctions initially targeted investments in oil, gas, and petrochemicals, exports of refined petroleum products, and business dealings with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). This encompasses banking and insurance transactions (including with the Central Bank of Iran), shipping, web-hosting services for commercial endeavors, and domain name registration services.[4]
