Ahead of both the 2007 and 2010 federal elections, the Labor Party re-asserted its official opposition to amending the Act to legalise same-sex marriage, though by 2011 a clear majority of the party at the national conference succeeded in changing party policy in favour of the practice.[20] Prime Minister Julia Gillard (opposed to same-sex marriage at the time) successfully moved for a Labor Party MPs to be granted a conscience vote on same-sex marriage legislation.[21] This, along with the Coalition's uniform opposition to same-sex marriage whilst in opposition prevented two bills which would have legalised same-sex marriage in Australia from passing the House of Representatives and Senate in September 2012.[22][23]
