The hadith of Muhammad which states that "My ummah will never agree upon an error"[2] is often cited as a proof for the validity of ijmā'. (While this hadith has only a limited number of transmissions bringing it to hadith collectors, and so is less reliable than would be preferred,  Sunni scholars argue that they had come to a consensus that Muhammad had affirmed the Muslim communities infallibility so that the hadith was certain.)[3] Sunni Muslims regard ijmā' as the third fundamental source of Sharia law, just after the divine revelation of the Qur'an, and the prophetic practice known as Sunnah.
