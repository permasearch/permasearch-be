As the Diaz family prepares for their annual garage sale, Harley is not enthusiastic about it because she is always left to organize the event. She wants to call it off, but Ethan encourages her to hold the sale and deliberately make it a failure. After Tom tells Harley he and Suzy will double whatever money the family earns, she scraps Ethan's plan and wants everyone to make as much money as possible, so they can reach their goal to buy an above-ground swimming pool. Lewie and Beast become so wound up in the process that they end up selling Harley's invention bag. Seeing how much the bag means to Harley, her siblings work to get it back from the lady who bought it, and their effort cost them nearly all they made in the garage sale.
