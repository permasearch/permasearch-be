The primary treatment of anaphylaxis is epinephrine injection into a muscle, intravenous fluids, and positioning the person flat.[1][7] Additional doses of epinephrine may be required.[1] Other measures, such as antihistamines and steroids, are complementary.[1] Carrying an epinephrine autoinjector and identification regarding the condition is recommended in people with a history of anaphylaxis.[1]
