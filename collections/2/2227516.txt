The American Library Association's Best Fiction for Young Adults, previously known as Best Books for Young Adults (1966-2010), is a recommendation list of books presented yearly by the YALSA division (Young Adult Library Services Association). It is for "fiction titles published for young adults in the past 16 months that are recommended reading for ages 12 to 18. The purpose of the annual list it to provide librarians and library workers with a resource to use for collection development and readers advisory purposes."[1] In addition there is a "Best of the Best" list of the top 10 titles, made available since 1997.[2]
