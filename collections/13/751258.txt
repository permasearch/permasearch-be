As remarked in the section on the rule of succession, K. Pearson showed that after n successes in n trials the posterior probability (based on the Bayes Beta(1,1) distribution as the prior probability) that the next (n + 1) trials will all be successes is exactly 1/2, whatever the value of n. Based on the Haldane Beta(0,0) distribution as the prior probability, this posterior probability is 1 (absolute certainty that after n successes in n trials the next (n + 1) trials will all be successes). Perks[60] (p. 303) shows that, for what is now known as the Jeffreys prior, this probability is ((n + 1/2)/(n + 1))((n + 3/2)/(n + 2))...(2n − 1/2)/(2n), which for n = 1, 2, 3 gives 3/4, 35/48, 693/960; rapidly approaching a limiting value of        1  2    = 0.70710678 …    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}}=0.70710678\ldots }   as n tends to infinity. Perks remarks that what is now known as the Jeffreys prior: "is clearly more 'reasonable' than either the Bayes-Laplace result or the result on the (Haldane) alternative rule rejected by Jeffreys which gives certainty as the probability. It clearly provides a very much better correspondence with the process of induction. Whether it is 'absolutely' reasonable for the purpose, i.e. whether it is yet large enough, without the absurdity of reaching unity, is a matter for others to decide. But it must be realized that the result depends on the assumption of complete indifference and absence of knowledge prior to the sampling experiment."
