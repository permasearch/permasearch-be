If, due to a diagnosed medical condition, a soldier is temporarily unable to conduct one or more of the events in the record APFT, the soldier can be granted an extension to allow him or her to overcome his or her injury and return to an acceptable level of physical fitness. If a soldier has a permanent medical condition that keeps him or her from conducting the two mile run, an alternative aerobic event consisting of either a 2.5 mile walk, an 800-yard swim, or 6.2 mile cycle ride is taken. There are no alternate events for the push-up or sit-up.
