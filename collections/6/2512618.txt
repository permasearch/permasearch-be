Antonio Garcia is a fisherman and the tech wizard of the group. He happened to be a childhood friend of Jayden, training alongside him and receiving the Octozord from him and making a promise to aid him as a Samurai. He is considered to be Jayden's opposite, being hyperactive and expressive as Jayden is reserved and stoic. He is the only Ranger who is not of Samurai descent.
