Johannesburg (/dʒoʊˈhænɪsbɜːrɡ/; Afrikaans: [jʊəˈɦanəsbœrχ]; also known as Jozi, Joburg and Egoli) is the largest city in South Africa and one of the 50 largest urban areas in the world.[8] It is the provincial capital and largest city of Gauteng, which is the wealthiest province in South Africa.[9] While Johannesburg is not one of South Africa's three capital cities, it is the seat of the Constitutional Court. The city is located in the mineral-rich Witwatersrand range of hills and is the centre of large-scale gold and diamond trade.[citation needed]
