The following year the group saw a slight dip, although they did score a top 20 hit with an adaptation of "Pinball Wizard".[11] Member Peter Doyle left the group this year and was replaced by Peter Oliver. The New Seekers had enjoyed a number of hits in the US by this time and toured there with Liza Minnelli in 1973.[12] While there, they recorded the title track to the American Marlo Thomas television special, Free to Be... You and Me, a landmark programme designed to teach children how to express themselves and be independent through a series of vignettes.[13] Since the special was first broadcast in 1974 the song has become a cult classic.
