The colon is wrinkled and corrugated, somewhat like an accordion or a clothes-dryer exhaust tube, which gives it the large surface area needed for water absorption.  In order to inspect this surface thoroughly, the physician blows it up like a balloon, using an air compressor, in order to get the creases out.  The stomach, intestines, and colon have a so-called "second brain" wrapped around them, which autonomously runs the chemical factory of digestion.[44]  It uses complex hormone signals and nerve signals to communicate with the brain and the rest of the body.  Normally a colon's job is to digest food and regulate the intestinal flora.  The harmful bacteria in rancid food, for example, creates gas. The colon has distension sensors that can tell when there is unexpected gas pushing the colon walls outâ€”thus the "second brain" tells the person that he or she is having intestinal difficulties by way of the sensation of nausea.  Doctors typically recommend either total anesthesia or a partial twilight sedative to either preclude or to lessen the patient's awareness of pain or discomfort, or just the unusual sensations of the procedure.  Once the colon has been inflated, the doctor inspects it with the scope as it is slowly pulled backward.  If any polyps are found they are then cut out for later biopsy.
