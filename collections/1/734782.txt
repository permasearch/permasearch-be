In Goa, India, which was ruled by the Portuguese for 450 years and has a large percentage of Goan Catholics, chouriÃ§o is made from pork marinaded in a mixture of vinegar, red chilies, and spices such as garlic, ginger, cumin, turmeric, cloves, pepper, and cinnamon, which is stuffed into casings[13]. These are enjoyed either with the local Goan Portuguese-style crusty bread, or pearl onions, or both. They are also used, cut into chunks, as the meat ingredient in a rice pilaf. They can be raw (wet), smoked or cured through salting and air-drying.
