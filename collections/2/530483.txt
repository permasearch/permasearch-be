Most successful were the Rolling Stones, whose first eponymously titled album in 1964 largely consisted of rhythm and blues songs.[citation needed] They soon established themselves as the second most popular UK band (after the Beatles)[112] and led a second wave of the "British Invasion" of the US pop charts.[111] In addition to Chicago blues numbers, the Rolling Stones also covered songs by Chuck Berry and Bobby and Shirley Womack, with the latter's "It's All Over Now", giving them their first UK number one in 1964.[113] Blues songs and influences continued to surface in the Rolling Stones' music in later years. Other London-based bands included the Yardbirds, the Kinks, Manfred Mann and the Pretty Things, beside more jazz-influenced acts like the Graham Bond Organisation, Georgie Fame and Zoot Money.[111] Bands to emerge from other major British cities included the Animals from Newcastle upon Tyne,[114] and Spencer Davis Group from Birmingham, and Them from Belfast.[111] None of these bands played exclusively rhythm and blues, but it remained at the core of their early albums.[111]
