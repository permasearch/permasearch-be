Humans, as empirically-minded beings, tend to recognize a threat explicitly only once it has actually materialized. In World War I it was only after frontal attacks had met with carnage from machine guns, that alternative military tactics were devised. To be sure, conflict springs eternal: between communities; between individuals; within a given individual. What distinguishes history's contemporary period is that—with the exponential growth of population, science, technology, economic activity, weapons destructiveness, and environmental degradation—global threats, military and environmental, have been getting ever more comprehensive: now, willy-nilly, everyone on Earth is affected. However, if solutions to existential global threats can find consensus, then their enforcement may find precedents in verification procedures that have been used in connection with 20th- and 21st-century threatened-species-protection agreements, searches for weapons of mass destruction, and strategic-arms reductions.
