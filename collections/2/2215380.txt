At the end of some shows during the first season, to fill up the remaining time, the Chief would summon a member of the audience to her office to answer a single geography question. If they answered correctly, they would be given an official Carmen Sandiego sweatshirt. They would be given a world atlas if they got the question wrong. Either way, they would be invited to return to the show as a gumshoe contestant. In later seasons, the time-filler segment was replaced by Rockapella singing a song about geography.
