The United States Department of Veterans Affairs oversees the National Cemetery Administration's orders[86] for placement of inscriptions and faith emblems at no charge to the estate of the deceased, submitted with information provided by the next of kin[87] that is placed on upright marble headstones or columbarium niche covers. The Department of Veterans Affairs currently offers 63 authorized faith emblems for placement on markers to represent the deceased's faith.[88] This number has grown in recent years due to legal challenges to policy.[89]
