"The Look" was remixed in 1995 and re-released exclusively in the United Kingdom in conjunction with the release of their first greatest hits compilation, Don't Bore Us, Get to the Chorus! Roxette's Greatest Hits. This version of the song does not appear on the album, but two of the versions from this were eventually included on the European single "She Doesn't Live Here Anymore" (1996).
