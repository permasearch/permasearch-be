Lita manages to make it to Angela's office but is almost killed when Mose shoots through the door as she tries to open it. Angela warns Julian and Billy not to go looking for Cruz, but they ignore her warning and go in search of her anyway. They wander the streets and find Cruz's dead body; while trying to get the body to Angela's office, they encounter the cannibals, get captured, and are placed in a soccer field where Three Finger kills them with a snow blower. Angela sends Mose to search for the deputies, but he unknowingly runs over barbed wire in the road and crashes. He awakens to find himself captured by the cannibals, who burn him alive.
