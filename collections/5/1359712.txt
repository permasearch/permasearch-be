Celtic were formed in 1887, and in 1897 the club became a Private Limited Company with a nominal share capital of 5000 shares at £1 each.[9][172] The following year a further share issue of 5000 £1 shares was created to raise more capital for the club. The largest number of shares held at this time were by businessmen from the East End of Glasgow, notably James Grant, an Irish publican and engineer, James Kelly, one of the club's original players now turned publican, and John Glass, a builder and major driving force in the early years of the club.[172] His shares, upon his death in 1906, then passed on to Thomas White.[173] The Grant, Kelly and White shareholdings created the family "dynasties" that would dominate ownership of the club throughout the 20th century.[174][175][176]
