For the 2013 model year, Expedition received the TowCommand electronic trailer brake controller system, which is now equipped at the factory, included with the heavy-duty trailer towing package. The Expedition's trailer brake controller features +/â€“ gain brake adjustment with support for heavy-duty trailers with up to four axles (quad axle trailers) and is compatible with electrically actuated trailer drum brakes and electric-over-hydraulic (EOH) actuated trailer drum or disc brake systems. The trailer brake controller is fully integrated into the Expedition's four-wheel, four-sensor, four-channel anti-lock braking system (ABS), and trailer sway control (TSC).[102][103]
