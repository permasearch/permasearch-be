On 13 December 2012, Challenge announced that they had signed a deal for "unseen bits of Takeshi's Castle". The new series, named Takeshi's Castle Rebooted, which aired from 8 to 29 March 2013, featured games and episodes suggested by the Keshi Heads website in their campaign. Despite Craig Charles agreeing to return for the new series, Challenge brought in Richard McCourt and Dominic Wood (Dick and Dom) as the new voiceovers. Hayato Tani also filmed presentation links for the new series.
