In the Southern United States, piccalilli is not commonly served.[16] In its place, chow-chow, a relish with a base of chopped green (unripe) tomatoes is offered. This relish may also include onions, bell peppers, cabbage, green beans and other vegetables. While not exactly similar to other piccalillis, chow-chow is often called as such and the terms may be used interchangeably.[17][18] Piccalilli is uncommon in the Western United States.
