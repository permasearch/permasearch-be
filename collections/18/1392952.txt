‘Blue Baby’ syndrome has two main symptoms which are easy to pick up if you know what you are looking for. The most obvious is a blue tint to the skin especially around the fingertips, toes and lips. A lack of oxygenated blood cells means there is not enough oxygen to supply the needs of these areas. The other, more stressful symptom is breathlessness. The baby may gasp and wheeze, while slipping in and out of consciousness. It may be weary, have laboured breathing and convulsions may occur. The baby will likely be fatigued and unalert to its surroundings.
