In the present time, as part of the Colonial National Historical Park, the Jamestown Island area is home to two heritage tourism sites related to the original fort and town. Nearby, the Jamestown-Scotland Ferry[63] service provides a link across the navigable portion of the James River for vehicles and affords passengers a view of Jamestown Island from the river.
