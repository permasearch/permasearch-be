The Soviet Union initially denied knowledge of the incident,[3] but later admitted shooting down the aircraft, claiming that it was on a MASINT spy mission.[4] The Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union said it was a deliberate provocation by the United States[5] to probe the Soviet Union's military preparedness, or even to provoke a war. The White House accused the Soviet Union of obstructing search and rescue operations.[6] The Soviet Armed Forces suppressed evidence sought by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) investigation, such as the flight recorders,[7] which were released eight years later, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.[8]
