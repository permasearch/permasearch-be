Nicole Watterson (nÃ©e Senicourt) (voiced by Teresa Gallagher), is a blue cat and the mother of Gumball, Darwin, and Anais. A workaholic, she is often over-stressed and possesses a short temper. She acts as a guide to her sons, Gumball and Darwin when they get in a tough spot with their misadventures. Competitive by nature, Nicole is a master martial artist, and is very agile and flexible. Despite her overstressed and short-tempered personality, she is still sweet and kindhearted and shows much affection for her family, keeping them safe (and alive) as much as she can.
