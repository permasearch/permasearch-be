Tesfaye has helped broadened R&B's musical palette to incorporate indie and electronic styles; his work has been categorized with the alternative R&B tag.[119][112] Mistry writes that he "will be obsequiously praised as the future of R&B musicâ€”because [he] is a black singer, not because he's making quantifiable, canonical R&B".[9] AllMusic's Andy Kellman categorizes him as an "alternative R&B act".[32]
