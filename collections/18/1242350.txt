In 2009, Eminem planned to release a sequel of his sixth studio album Relapse titled Relapse 2, but cancelled the project and released a completely different studio release titled Recovery.[4] He said, "as I kept recording and working with new producers, the idea of a sequel to Relapse started to make less and less sense to me, and I wanted to make a completely new album."[4] "Not Afraid" was primarily produced by the Canadian hip hop musician Boi-1da.[5] According to Mike Strange, who recorded "Not Afraid", he wanted to work with Boi-1da after listening to his "Forever", which he had produced for the rapper Drake.[5] Boi-1da sent Strange many tracks, to some of which Eminem wrote lyrics. These tracks were opened in Pro Tools, as Strange proceeded to record Eminem's vocals.[5] Recording sessions took place at Effigy Studios, in Ferndale, Michigan but Boi-1da was absent during the sessions.[5][6]
