The number of goods wagons was 205,596 on 31 March 1951 and peaked at 405,183 on 31 March 1980, after which it declined to 239,321 on 31 March 2012.[citation needed] The number is far less than that required for demand and Indian Railways loses freight traffic to road carriers. The railway carried 93 million tonnes of goods in 1950–51, increasing to 1010 million tonnes in 2012–13.[42]
