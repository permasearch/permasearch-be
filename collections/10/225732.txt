Another version of the Master appears in The Infinity Doctors (also by Parkin), where he is known as the Magistrate and is, once again, the Doctor's friend, although when this takes place in continuity is unclear.[80] Parkin has stated[citation needed] that the novel can fit into continuity and that its incarnation of the Master is based on Richard E. Grant.
