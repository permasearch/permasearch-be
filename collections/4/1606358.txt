Chinese carved out a distinct role in the predominantly biracial society of Mississippi Delta. In a few communities, Chinese children were able to attend white schools, while others studied under tutors, or establish their own Chinese schools.[79] In 1924, a nine-year-old Chinese-American named Martha Lum, daughter of Gong Lum, was prohibited from attending the Rosedale Consolidated High School in Bolivar County, Mississippi, solely because she was of Chinese descent. The ensuing lawsuit eventually reached the Supreme Court of the United States. In Lum v. Rice (1927), the Supreme Court affirmed that the separate-but-equal doctrine articulated in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896), applied to a person of Chinese ancestry, born in and a citizen of the United States. The court held that Miss Lum was not denied equal protection of the law when she was given the opportunity to attend a school which "receive[d] only children of the brown, yellow or black races".
