On 16 September, Chelsea suffered their first defeat of the season at home, as Liverpool won 2â€“1 at Stamford Bridge. David Luiz made his second Chelsea debut following his deadline day move from PSG. Two Liverpool goals in the first half, from Dejan Lovren's close range finish and Jordan Henderson's thunderous 25-yard strike, put the game out of reach for the hosts, who managed to peg one goal back through Diego Costa.[70]
