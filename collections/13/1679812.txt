George Vernadsky theoretized about the association of Rus and Alans. He claimed that that Ruxs in Alanic means "radiant light", thus the ethnonym Roxolani could be understood as "bright Alans".[16] He theorized that the name Roxolani a combination of two separate tribal names: the Rus and the Alans.[16] Rus were closely associated with the Alans in the Sarmatian period.[16]
