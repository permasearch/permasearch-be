With lyrics written by Bernie Taupin, the song was first featured as the opening track to John’s 1971 album, Madman Across the Water. The song's lyrics were inspired by Taupin’s first visit to the US in 1970, and were intended to capture the spirit of California, where he found the women he met highly contrasted with those who he had known in his home country of England.[3][4] A common misconception is that the song’s lyrics were about Taupin's first wife, Maxine Feibelman. Taupin has stated that this was not true, and that the belief came about due to the song being dedicated to Feibelman on the original album.[3][5][2]
