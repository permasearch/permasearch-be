Written by frontman Rivers Cuomo, the song came to be after he had all the music finished and one line, "Say it ain't so".[3] Cuomo made a connection to an incident in high school where he came home and saw a bottle of beer in the fridge.  He believed his mother and father's marriage ended because his father was an alcoholic and this made him fear the marriage between his mother and step-father would end this way as well.[4]
