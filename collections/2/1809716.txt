Team challenge: The contestants had five minutes to select five ingredients for each of the six Oriental dishes that each team would make; the ingredients were chosen by opening oversized fortune cookies with chopsticks. Each team then had 40 minutes to create the dishes. Judging the challenge was Oriental chef Martin Yan. Thanks to Anthony's chow mein dish, the men won their first challenge. In addition, Ray and Dan earned their jackets back, as both had good-tasting dishes despite not earning a point for the team.
