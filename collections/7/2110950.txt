The 107th United States Congress resolution (HRes 269) of June 11, 2002, recognized the contributions of Antonio Meucci. This was interpreted by some as establishing priority for the invention of the telephone to Meucci.[1][2][3][4] The House of Representatives' resolution did not annul or modify any of Bell's patents for the telephone.
