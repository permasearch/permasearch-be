In the TV series, Babs is portrayed by Kerri Kenney-Silver.[8] She is actually seen in this version and is easily stressed, carrying a paper bag around to breathe into when she begins to hyperventilate. Babs is also obsessed with paperwork. Despite them not being on her list, she allows Count Olaf, disguised as Dr. Mattathias Medicalschool, and his troupe into the hospital. Later, they capture her and Count Olaf replaces her as the head of the Human Resources Department. When Violet is also captured, she attempts to escape with Babs, but Babs's nervous laughter and loud speech results in them being captured by Count Olaf again and separated. Despite Count Olaf threatening to kill her at this point, Babs survives and is later seen escaping Heimlich Hospital during the fire and mourning the loss of her clipboard and paperwork. Mr. Poe attempts to comfort her as he chases after the Baudelaires.
