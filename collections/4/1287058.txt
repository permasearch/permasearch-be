Appearing only in The Land Before Time, Littlefoot's Mother, voiced by Helen Shaver, lost her life in the first film to save Littlefoot and Cera from the Sharptooth pursuing them. Before her death, she is Littlefoot's teacher and caregiver, and introduces the story's principal themes; and after death, appears in spirit to reveal his destination. She is also shown in a flashback scene in The Land Before Time X: The Great Longneck Migration, wherein she is blue in color, whereas in the first film, she was brown.
