The song has been revived and rerecorded many times since, notably by Howard McGillin and Susan Powell in 1991. There are two verses and two rounds of the chorus. The song has been described as "a tender prequel" to "Let's Do It, Let's Fall In Love," Porter's first popular song. The song has been recorded by artists including Mario Lanza, Frank Sinatra, Marlene Dietrich, Doris Day, Sonny Rollins, Susannah McCorkle, Bryan Ferry, Sinéad O'Connor on Red Hot + Blue (1990), and Skunk Anansie. Ella Fitzgerald, the First Lady of Song, recorded this song on both her Cole Porter Songbook albums and on her Pablo classic, Ella à Nice. Bing Crosby recorded the song in 1955[1] for use on his radio show and it was subsequently included in the box set The Bing Crosby CBS Radio Recordings (1954-56) issued by Mosaic Records (catalog MD7-245) in 2009.[2] Bette Midler's version of the song plays over the final credits of the 1991 film Scenes From A Mall starring Midler and Woody Allen.
