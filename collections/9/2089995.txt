The A-10 is exceptionally tough, being able to survive direct hits from armor-piercing and high-explosive projectiles up to 23Â mm. It has double-redundant hydraulic flight systems, and a mechanical system as a back up if hydraulics are lost. Flight without hydraulic power uses the manual reversion control system; pitch and yaw control engages automatically, roll control is pilot-selected. In manual reversion mode, the A-10 is sufficiently controllable under favorable conditions to return to base, though control forces are greater than normal. The aircraft is designed to be able to fly with one engine, one half of tail, one elevator, and half of a wing missing.[60]
