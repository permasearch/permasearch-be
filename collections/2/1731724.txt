To increase the potential successful recovery of valuable records, a well-established and thoroughly tested plan must be developed. This plan should emphasize simplicity in order to aid in response and recovery: employees should perform similar tasks in the response and recovery phase that they perform under normal conditions. It should also include mitigation strategies such as the installation of sprinklers within the institution.[97] Professional associations hold regular workshops to keep individuals up to date with tools and resources in order to minimize risk and maximize recovery.[94]
