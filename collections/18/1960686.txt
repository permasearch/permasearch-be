Starr has said that his favourite drummer is Jim Keltner,[233] with whom he first played at the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971.[234] The pair subsequently played together as a double-drumming team on some of Harrison's recordings during the 1970s,[235] on Ringo and other albums by Starr, and on the early All-Starr Band tours.[236] For Ringo's Rotogravure in 1976, Starr coined a term to describe their percussive combination, crediting himself as "Thunder" and Keltner as "Lightnin'".[235]
