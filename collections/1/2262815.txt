In "Smith and Jones", the sonic screwdriver burns out after the Doctor uses it to amplify the radiation output of a hospital X-ray machine. In the "Series Three concept Artwork Gallery",[1] [2] when referring to the burnt out sonic screwdriver, Peter McKinstry says "the green crystal structure visible under the shattered dome refers back to the TARDIS console crystal. It's the same technology â€“ the TARDIS's little brother."[8] Though initially saddened at the loss of the screwdriver, the Doctor obtains a new one at the conclusion of the episode.
