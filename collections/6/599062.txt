Hines brought more computers to campus and established new programs in psychology and forestry. In 1995, despite a lack of support for a name change,[43] the institution, considering that its regional educational mission was not reflected in its name (some thought that it sounded like a private school[43]), adopted the name The University of West Alabama.[44] Ed Roach (1998â€“2002) assumed the presidency in 1998 and set about integrating technology into every aspect of UWA life. He established the Technology 2000 campaign and helped establish UWA as one of the first wireless institutions in the region.[45] Women's sports received a boost under his leadership. During this period, the UWA Softball Complex was completed. In February 2002, he stepped down from his position as president. The Board of Trustees met to choose a replacement on an interim basis from University employees David Taylor, Richard Holland, Roy Underwood, and Clemit Spruiell.[46]
