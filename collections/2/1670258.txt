In 2014, Pope Francis abolished the practice of granting priests the title of "monsignor", no longer accepting such requests from bishops. However, existing members of all three ranks established by Pope Paul VI retain their membership. Higher ranks are still attained by virtue of membership of certain chapters of canons or because of being a vicar general, and new appointments continue to be made for officials of the Roman Curia and the diplomatic service of the Holy See.[13][14][15]
