With the new ownership at JTG Daugherty Racing in 2008, the team attempted to qualify for the Allstate 400 at the Brickyard with Marcos Ambrose at the wheel and he qualified into the race in 24th position. Ambrose finished in the 22nd position. Ambrose finished 3rd in the No. 21 Ford Fusion of Wood Brothers Racing at the Centurion Boats at the Glen at Watkins Glen International. On October 1, JTG Daugherty signed a deal to enter into a technical alliance with Michael Waltrip Racing for the remainder of 2008 and the 2009 Sprint Cup season. During this technical alliance in 2008 and 2009, the No. 47 ran a Toyota Camry as the third car on the Michael Waltrip Racing team. For the rest of the 2008 season, the 47 switched to Toyota and leased the owner point's for MWR's No. 00 entry. Ambrose ran four races for the rest of the season and had a best finish of eighteenth. The 47 became a full-time entry in 2009, running with sponsorship mostly from Little Debbie and the Clorox Company. He had seven top-ten finishes, including a second at Watkins Glen, and finished eighteenth in points. The alliance continued for 2010, with Ambrose again running as the third car for MWR.
