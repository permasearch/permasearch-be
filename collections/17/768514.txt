During her time at Chanhassen, Adams acted in her first filmâ€”a black-and-white short satire named The Chromium Hook.[16] Soon after, while she was off work nursing a pulled muscle, she attended the locally held auditions for the Hollywood film Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999), a satire on beauty pageants starring Kirsten Dunst, Ellen Barkin, and Kirstie Alley.[2] Adams was cast in the supporting part of a promiscuous cheerleader.[3][7] She felt that her character's personality was far removed from her own and worried about how people would perceive her.[18] The production was filmed locally, which enabled Adams to shoot for her role while also performing Brigadoon on stage.[19] Encouragement from Alley prompted Adams to actively pursue a film career, and she moved to Los Angeles in January 1999.[12][16] She described her initial experience in the city as "dark" and "bleak", and she pined for her life back in Chanhassen.[15]
