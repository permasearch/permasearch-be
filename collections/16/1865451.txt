An analysis by the ATSB comparing the evidence available for Flight 370 with three categories of accidents—an in-flight upset (e.g., stall), a glide event (e.g., engine failure, fuel exhaustion), and an unresponsive crew or hypoxia event—concluded that an unresponsive crew or hypoxia event "best fit the available evidence"[54]:34 for the five-hour period of the flight as it travelled south over the Indian Ocean without communication or significant deviations in its track,[54]:34 likely on autopilot.[217][218] No consensus exists among investigators on the unresponsive crew or hypoxia theory.[219] If no control inputs were made following flameout and the disengagement of autopilot, the aircraft would likely have entered a spiral dive[54]:33 and entered the ocean within 20 nmi (37 km; 23 mi) of the flameout and disengagement of autopilot.[54]:35 The analysis of the flaperon showed that the landing flaps were not extended, supporting the spiral dive at high speed theory.[220] In May 2018, the ATSB again asserted that the flight was not in control when it crashed, its spokesperson adding that "We have quite a bit of data to tell us that the aircraft, if it was being controlled at the end, it wasn't very successfully being controlled." This was in reaction to speculation by former Canadian air crash investigator Larry Vance in his recent book that the cause was pilot suicide.[221]
