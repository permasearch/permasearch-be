Deborah Sampson was the only woman who fought in the Revolutionary War (1775â€“1783).[58] Women were not allowed to join the army, but in 1782 Deborah disguised herself as a man and joined the 4th Massachusetts Regiment, going by the name of Robert Shurtliff of Uxbridge and soon saw action in the front lines against the British.[58] When shot in the thigh she removed the musket ball herself, fearful of having her identity discovered.[58] However, her leg never healed properly, and her gender was finally revealed when she was hospitalized for a wound-related infection in 1783.[59] But despite her deception, she was given an honorable discharge in recognition of her fine service.[59] Furthermore, in the American Revolution women served on the battlefield as nurses and under many other jobs.[60] In 1776 at the battle of Fort Washington, Margaret Corbin fired her husband's cannon after he was killed, and was herself severely wounded in the battle, later receiving a pension from Congress in recognition of her service, making her the first American woman ever to receive a government pension.[61] Also, in 1778 at the battle of Monmouth, Mary Ludwig Hays McCauley fired her husband's cannon after he was wounded in battle.[62] Mary's deed, although a true story, is the source of the "Molly Pitcher" legend.[62]
