I have now added brief indications of the motivation and origins of the two sign conventions from Clausius and Planck (though I was careful not to say that Planck was the first to use dq + dw since I don't know that). As you said, the changes are relatively minor, but I think they may help some readers who wonder why some books use one convention and some the other. Thanks for the discussion and the references.
