The concept of the Internet of things became popular in 1999, through the Auto-ID Center at MIT and related market-analysis publications.[30] Radio-frequency identification (RFID) was seen by Kevin Ashton (one of the founders of the original Auto-ID Center) as a prerequisite for the Internet of things at that point.[31] Ashton prefers the phrase "Internet for things."[32] If all objects and people in daily life were equipped with identifiers, computers could manage and inventory them.[33][34][35] Besides using RFID, the tagging of things may be achieved through such technologies as near field communication, barcodes, QR codes and digital watermarking.[36][37]
