The National Patient Safety Goals require documentation of a checklist for CVC insertion and Disinfection of intravenous (IV) access ports before use (scrub the hub). Some literature has suggested the use of a safer vascular access route, like intraosseous (IO) vascular access, when central lines are not necessary (for example, when central lines are being placed only for vascular access). Infection risks were initially thought to be less in jugular lines, but the decreased rate of infection is only seen in obese people.[7]
