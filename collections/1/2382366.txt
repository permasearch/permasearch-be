The community was named after the nearby cave which is inhabited by several species of bats,[4] on Bluerock Mountain (sometimes referred to as Bat Cave Mountain). It is the largest known granite fissure cave in North America and is a protected area, not open to the public. It has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names.[5]
