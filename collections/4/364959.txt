If this is, in fact, the same song, then this implies that it was an American composition and already popular there. An article in the New York Times of August 1891 (p.Â 1) refers to the tune being played in a parade in Asbury Park, N.J.[9] and clearly by this date the song was well established in America. Newspapers of the period, however, credit its composition to two separate persons, both resident in Boston: one is Effie Canning (later referred to as Mrs. Effie D. Canning Carlton[10][11] and the other the composer Charles Dupee Blake.[12]
