This custom is said to be analogous to the ritual of bowing to someone in appreciation. The origin of this gesture is described anecdotally: The Qianlong Emperor went incognito to yum cha with his friends outside the palace.  While at yum cha, the Emperor poured his companion some tea, which was a great honor.  The companion, not wanting to give away the Emperor's identity in public by bowing, instead tapped his index and middle finger on the table as a sign of appreciation.
