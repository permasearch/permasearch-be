Thus the monopolistic firm chooses the quantity at which the demand price satisfies this rule. Since for a price setting firm     η < 0   {\displaystyle \eta <0}   this means that a firm with market power will charge a price above marginal cost and thus earn a monopoly rent. On the other hand, a competitive firm by definition faces a perfectly elastic demand, hence it believes     η = 0   {\displaystyle \eta =0}   which means that it sets price equal to marginal cost.
