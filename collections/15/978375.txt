Naturalness (Chinese: 自然; pinyin: zìrán; Wade–Giles: tzu-jan; lit. "self-such"，"self organisation"[64]) is regarded as a central value in Taoism.[65] It describes the "primordial state" of all things[66] as well as a basic character of the Tao,[67] and is usually associated with spontaneity and creativity.[68][67] To attain naturalness, one has to identify with the Tao;[67] this involves freeing oneself from selfishness and desire, and appreciating simplicity.[65]
