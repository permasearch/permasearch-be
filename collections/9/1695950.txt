In the early 1960s, few American series used cold opens, and half-hour situation comedies almost never made use of them prior to 1965. Many American series that ran from the early 1960s through the middle years of the decade (even sitcoms) adopted cold opens in later seasons; for example, Gilligan's Island did not use cold opens during its first two seasons, but did use them in its third and final year (1966â€“67). They were used on some seasons of Mission: Impossible, likewise with Hawaii Five-O. Many other long-running TV series used cold opens; similar patterns can be seen with sitcoms, including Bewitched and The Beverly Hillbillies.
