The Bhakti yoga tradition has been historically most associated with Vaishnavism. The personal god here is Vishnu or one of his avatars. In many regions, the loving devotion is either to Vishnu-Lakshmi (god-goddess) together, or through Lakshmi who is considered as the shakti of Vishnu.[48][49] The specific avatar varies by the devotee and region, but the most common are Krishna and Rama.[29][50][51]
