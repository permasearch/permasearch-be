Subjects are all taken on the same level - there is no higher or standard grade as in the past. There are three pass levels, each with different pass requirements.First is a pass with Higher certificate, one must obtain 40% in home language, 40% in two other subjects and must obtain 30% in three other subjects. A learner who passed matric with higher certificate level, cannot enroll for a University Degree nor a Diploma at an institute of higher learning. The mean mark in any subject is usually about 55. Only a small proportion of candidates score an 'A' in any subject (from as little as 2% to a maximum of about 10% in subjects taken by highly select groups.) A further 8 – 15% are likely to gain a 'B' and about 20 – 25% achieve a 'C' grade. The National Senior Certificate is a group certificate and records an aggregate mark.
