The success of the Tamil film Minnale led to producer Vashu Bhagnani signing Gautham Menon on to direct the Hindi language remake of the film with Rajshri Productions, Rehna Hai Tere Dil Mein, which also featured Madhavan.[2] Though Richa Pallod was initially considered for the leading female role, Diya Mirza and Saif Ali Khan were added to the film.[3] Menon was initially apprehensive but said it took "half an hour" to agree and against his intentions, the producer opted against retaining the technical crew of the original.[4] He changed a few elements, deleted certain scenes and added some more for the version. The team shot for the film in South Africa and shot scenes at Durban Beach and in Drakensberg, with production executive Raakesh Maharaj arranging the unit's stay in the country.[5][6]
