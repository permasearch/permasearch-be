KILITDJ3000 (voiced by Courtenay Taylor) is an evil supercomputer who controls the KILIT radio station. After being activated, it turns rogue and forces everyone out except Donny G, who is forced to work as a janitor. When Muscle Man tries to get the song he wrote for Starla on the radio, the computer wouldn't let him do so, as playing the tape will activate its self-destruct program. He, Mordecai, and Rigby are able to convince Donny G to help stop the computer, but it soon discovers what they are up to. Despite its attempts to stop them (wounding Donny G in the process), it is defeated when Donny G plays Muscle Man's tape and causing the radio station to explode while the trio escape (although Donny G had somehow survived it).
