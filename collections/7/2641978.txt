In rain rich states and countries, which are not drought prone, the water, as elsewhere, is managed by government consent, which assumes ownership and management of all free flowing rivers, lakes, and bodies of water in its parameters. The water being used for commercial purposes, such as NESTLE'S 72 brands of bottled water, is done so only as permitted and granted by governmental authorities. Lately, locales have been fighting back against the "stealing" of precious resources by opposing and not allowing huge water draw down facilities to be set up. [32] In some instances, water tables underground have dropped from 100 to 400â€“600 feet deep, basically shutting down most private well owners from their own water sources. [33] [34]
