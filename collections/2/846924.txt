Production began in November 1999 and was completed in May 2000, with a budget of $52.5 million.[2] Filming generally went smoothly, with the only major problem occurring when Kidman injured her ribs twice while filming one of the more complicated dance sequences and torn knee cartilage resulting from a fall during the "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend" production song;[9] she also stated in an interview with Graham Norton that she broke her rib while getting into a corset, by tightening it as much as possible to achieve an 18-inch waist.[10] The production also overran in its shooting schedule and had to be out of the Fox Studios in Sydney to make way for Star Wars: Episode II â€“ Attack of the Clones (in which McGregor also starred). This necessitated some pick-up shots being filmed in Madrid.
