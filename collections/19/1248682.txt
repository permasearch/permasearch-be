Laws governing rodeo vary widely. In the American west, some states incorporate the regulations of the PRCA into their statutes as a standard by which to evaluate if animal cruelty has occurred.[57] On the other hand, some events and practices are restricted or banned in other states, including California, Rhode Island, and Ohio.[58]:268–269 St. Petersburg, Florida is the only locality in the United States with a complete ban on rodeo.[58]:268–269 Canadian Humane Societies are careful in criticizing Canadian rodeo as the event has become so indigenous to Western Canada that criticism may jeopardize support for the organization's other humane goals. The Calgary Humane Society itself is wary of criticizing the famous Calgary Stampede.[28] Internationally rodeo itself is banned in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands,[2] and other European nations have placed restrictions on certain practices.
