The CDC recommends real-time PCR as the method of choice for diagnosing H1N1.[40] The oral or nasal fluid collection and RNA virus preserving filter paper card is commercially available.[41] This method allows a specific diagnosis of novel influenza (H1N1) as opposed to seasonal influenza. Near-patient point-of-care tests are in development.[42]
