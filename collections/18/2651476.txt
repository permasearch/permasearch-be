The code sought not only to determine what could be portrayed on screen, but also to promote traditional values.[31] Sexual relations outside marriage—which were forbidden to be portrayed as attractive or beautiful—were to be presented in a way that would not arouse passion or make them seem permissible.[32] All criminal action had to be punished, and neither the crime nor the criminal could elicit sympathy from the audience,[8] or the audience must at least be aware that such behavior is wrong, usually through "compensating moral value".[28][33] Authority figures had to be treated with respect, and the clergy could not be portrayed as comic characters or villains. Under some circumstances, politicians, police officers, and judges could be villains, as long as it was clear that those individuals portrayed as villains were the exceptions to the rule.[34]
