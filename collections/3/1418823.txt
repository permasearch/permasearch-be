Hydrogen bonding causes pure ethanol to be hygroscopic to the extent that it readily absorbs water from the air. The polar nature of the hydroxyl group causes ethanol to dissolve many ionic compounds, notably sodium and potassium hydroxides, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, ammonium chloride, ammonium bromide, and sodium bromide.[51] Sodium and potassium chlorides are slightly soluble in ethanol.[51] Because the ethanol molecule also has a nonpolar end, it will also dissolve nonpolar substances, including most essential oils[58] and numerous flavoring, coloring, and medicinal agents.
