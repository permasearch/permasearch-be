Though the Toronto Star describes it as "a lesbian-friendly tune",[25] whether homophobia fuels negative reactions to the song or the song itself appears to divide critics. Slant and other critics[26][27] suggest that Perry may be homophobic, especially given her single "Ur So Gay", which makes "I Kissed a Girl" seem like "a classic example of the 'Guys kissing is gross, girls kissing is hot' line of thought," which promotes hypersexualization of queer women and demonization of queer men.[28] MomLogic.com writer Vuv-A-Licious agrees, asking "What's the big deal?..... When this tune is playing and my son and daughter are dancing, I will be trying to dance along, or trying to acknowledge that they may one day dance to the beat of a different drummer than me."[29]
