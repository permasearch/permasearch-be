In Wilson's first year, the Hoosiers compiled a 1–11 record.[61] In his second year, Indiana improved to 4–8 on the year (4 losses were by seven points or fewer),[62][63] but surpassed Northwestern's record for most losses in Football Bowl Subdivision history.[64] Nevertheless, Wilson's team exhibited an explosive offense, going from 80th nationally in pass offense to 19th and leading the Big Ten with 311.2 yards per game, in spite of losing the starting quarterback Tre Roberson in the season's second game.[65][66] Additionally, Wilson was successful in luring five 4-star Rivals.com recruits from the 2013 class to Indiana, the most in school history.
