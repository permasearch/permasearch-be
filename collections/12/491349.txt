The main goals when treating children with autism are to lessen associated deficits and family distress, and to increase quality of life and functional independence. In general, higher IQs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes.[146][147] No single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child's needs.[6] Families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment.[12] Studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy,[148] however the development of evidence-based interventions has advanced in recent years.[146] Although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence, suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment, the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor, their clinical results are mostly tentative, and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options.[149] Intensive, sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self-care, social, and job skills,[6] and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors;[150] claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated.[151] Available approaches include applied behavior analysis (ABA), developmental models, structured teaching, speech and language therapy, social skills therapy, and occupational therapy.[6] Among these approaches, interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively, or focalize treatment on a specific area of deficit.[146] There is some evidence that early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI), an early intervention model based on ABA for 20 to 40Â hours a week for multiple years, is an effective treatment for some children with ASD.[152] Two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include applied behavioral analysis (ABA) and developmental social pragmatic models (DSP).[146] One interventional strategy utilizes a parent training model, which teaches parents how to implement various ABA and DSP techniques, allowing for parents to disseminate interventions themselves.[146] Various DSP programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at-home parent implementation. Despite the recent development of parent training models, these interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies, being evaluated as a probable efficacious mode of treatment.[146]
