The natural vegetation on most of the peninsula is xeric scrub, part of the Northwestern thorn scrub forests ecoregion. A range of low hills, known as the Gir Hills, occupies the south-central portion of the peninsula. The highest of these is Girnar. The hills are home to an enclave of tropical dry broadleaf forest, part of the Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests ecoregion. Gir National Park, which includes the forested hills around Girnar, and areas in the region that neighbor it, are home to the last remaining Asiatic lions in the wilderness of the Earth.[2][3][4][5] Other national parks on Kathiawar are Blackbuck National Park (Velavadar) on the Gulf of Cambay, and Marine National Park on the Gulf of Kutch, near Jamnagar.
