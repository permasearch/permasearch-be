The Brooklyn Museum also owns part of one of the station's Ionic columns as well as some plaques from the station. The largest piece of the station that was known to had been salvaged, a 35-foot (11Â m) Doric column, was transported upstate to Woodridge, New York, circa 1963. The Doric column had been intended for an unbuilt college in Woodridge, the Verrazano College. However, the column remained in Woodridge once plans for the college were canceled, since it was very unwieldy to bring the column back downstate.[82] In addition, eighteen of the station's 84 columns were supposed to be placed in Battery Park in Lower Manhattan.[92] However, the columns were dumped in a landfill in New Jersey instead.[93]
