The 11 ships of the First Fleet set sail on 13 May 1787. The leading ship, HMSÂ Supply reached Botany Bay setting up camp on the Kurnell Peninsula,[31] on 18 January 1788. Phillip soon decided that this site, chosen on the recommendation of Sir Joseph Banks, who had accompanied James Cook in 1770, was not suitable, since it had poor soil, no secure anchorage and no reliable water source. After some exploration Phillip decided to go on to Port Jackson, and on 26 January the marines and convicts landed at Sydney Cove, which Phillip named after Lord Sydney.
