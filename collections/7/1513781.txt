An elastic modulus (also known as modulus of elasticity) is a number that measures an object or substance's resistance to being deformed elastically (i.e.non-permanently) when a [Stress (mechanics)|stress] is applied to it. The elastic modulus of an object is defined as the slope of its stressâ€“strain curve in the elastic deformation region:[1] A stiffer material will have a higher elastic modulus. An elastic modulus has the form:
