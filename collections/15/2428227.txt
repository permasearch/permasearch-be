Grandpa Arnold suddenly arrives to attend the funeral of his cousin, Aunt Rose, a relative the Arnolds hardly knew. At the wake, Kevin and Wayne meet their extended family; and are glad when they see Jack's wealthy cousin Lloyd, who gives Kevin and Wayne twenty dollars to split. After they argue over holding the money, they accidentally drop it into Aunt Rose's open casket. By the time they think of a plan to get it back, it's too late and the casket is sealed shut and taken away for the funeral. On the way to the graveside service, Kevin and Wayne bicker over the money and a furious Grandpa stops the car and kicks them out, forcing them to walk the last two miles to the cemetery. When they finally get there, they realize why it was important to be respectful because even though they didn't know their aunt, she still represented a part of the Arnold family heritage.
