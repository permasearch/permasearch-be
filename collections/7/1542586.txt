The red-bellied piranha is distributed widely throughout the South American continent and is found in the Neotropical rivers of Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela.[6] They live in the warm freshwater drainages of several major rivers including the Amazon, Paraguay, Paraná and Essequibo, as well as numerous smaller systems.[7] They can live in waters that are between 15 and 35 °C (59–95 °F), but are able to survive temperatures as low as 10 °C (50 °F) for a period.[8] They are mainly found in whitewater,[9] but have also been recorded in blackwater and clearwater.[7] The red-bellied piranha live in major rivers, streams, lakes (such as oxbows and artificial lakes formed by dams), floodplains,[7] and flooded forests.[6]
