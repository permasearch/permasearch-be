The Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), as well as the nations of Barbados and Jamaica, appealed to the United States for assistance.[3] It was later announced that Grenada's governor-general, Paul Scoon, had actually requested the invasion through secret diplomatic channels and for his safety it had not been made public.[19] Scoon was well within his rights to take this action under the reserve powers vested in the Crown.[20] On Saturday 22 October 1983, the Deputy High Commissioner in Bridgetown, Barbados visited Grenada and reported that Sir Paul Scoon was well and "did not request military intervention, either directly or indirectly".[21] However, in his book, "Survival for Service," Scoon confirmed that he had invited the United States and Caribbean nations to intervene militarily, before the invasion.[22][23]
