Arbiter Thel 'Vadam, voiced by Keith David, narrates and appears in a trailer for Halo: The Master Chief Collection, first shown at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014. The trailer acts as a prelude to Halo 5: Guardians,[27] in which Thel 'Vadam and his forces (Swords of Sangheilios) are locked in a bloody civil war with rogue Sangheili-led splinter factions that reside on the home planet Sangheilios. During the game, the Arbiter meets with Spartan Jameson Locke who asks the Arbiter about whether the nickname "Demon" was an insult or a compliment. The Arbiter assures it was an insult, but with a certain standard of respect, which, after a chain of events, eventually lead the arbiter to call the Master Chief an ally and even his friend. Before the Spartans leave, the Arbiter asks Locke what the Spartans nicknamed the Master Chief, given that he was neither ally nor foe to them. The scene ends with Locke dodging the question and restating his duty.
