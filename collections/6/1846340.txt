Catalase is a tetramer of four polypeptide chains, each over 500 amino acids long.[7] It contains four iron-containing heme groups that allow the enzyme to react with the hydrogen peroxide. The optimum pH for human catalase is approximately 7,[8] and has a fairly broad maximum: the rate of reaction does not change appreciably between pH 6.8 and 7.5.[9] The pH optimum for other catalases varies between 4 and 11 depending on the species.[10] The optimum temperature also varies by species.[11]
