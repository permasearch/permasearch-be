Snapple Save: As in the previous week, America was allowed to vote for a contestant via Google, saving them from getting eliminated. The acts that could be saved are those who finished in fifth, sixth and seventh place. At the end of the show, Nick Cannon announced who was Snapple Saved for the chance to be in the Top 12. The other two acts that finished in fifth, sixth or seventh position faced the Judges, who chose one as the "Judges' Choice".[14]
