The vote was in favor of the new state of West Virginia, distinct from the Pierpont government, which persisted at Alexandria as the civil government for Virginia until the end of the war.[51] Congress and Lincoln approved, then after providing for gradual emancipation of slaves in the new state constitution, West Virginia became the 35th state on June 20, 1863. After statehood was achieved, the counties of Jefferson and Berkeley were annexed to the new state late in 1863.[52] Congress continued to seat the Restored Government's U.S. Senators, but it did not seat the three representatives presenting credentials from the truncated Union occupied Virginia for the 38th Congress. The entire Virginia state delegation went vacant at the end of the war.[53]
