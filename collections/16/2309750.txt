Just off this point is where the Mississippi River is at its deepest, approximately 60 meters (200 ft) deep.[4]  This depth varies from year to year as the river alternately scours and deposits silt.  A U.S. Coast Guard aid to navigation, Algiers Point Light "95," marks the point.[5]  Its geographic coordinates are 29°57′19″N 90°03′19″W﻿ / ﻿29.95528°N 90.05528°W﻿ / 29.95528; -90.05528
