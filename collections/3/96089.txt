In 2008, the Fringe faced the biggest crisis in its history when the computerised ticketing system failed. The events surrounding the failed box office software led to the resignation of Fringe Director Jon Morgan after only one full year in post.[23] The resultant financial loss suffered by the Fringe Society was estimated at £300,000,[24] which it was forced to meet from its reserves, although other sources report this at £900,000.[23] These events attracted much comment from the UK and world media. More debts emerged as the year went on, and an independent report criticised the Board and the current and previous Fringe Directors for a failure of management and an inability to provide the basic service.[24]
