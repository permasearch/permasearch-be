Cowan cites a handful of instances in which women were allowed to frequent English coffeehouses: When partaking in business ventures,[74] in Bath, where female sociability was more readily accepted,[74] in gambling/coffeehouses, and while auctions were held within coffeehouses, as a woman acted in the service of her household.[75] Historians have accounted for female involvement in the male public sphere of the coffeehouse by evaluating female news hawkers who enter temporarily within a male-dominated coffeehouse. Paula McDowell has argued that these women "were anything but the passive distributors of other people's political ideas."[76] In addition, as McDowell's study shows, female hawkers "shap[ed] the modes and forms of political discourse through their understanding of their customer's desires for news and print ephemera."[77] Nonetheless, McDowell and Cowan agree that although women workers may have been physically within the male public sphere of the coffeehouse, their rank and gender prevented them from fully participating within the sphere.[77] The presence of women within coffeehouses in general did not mean that they participated equally in the public sphere of coffeehouses.[78] Cowan points to female proprietors of coffeehouses, known as "coffee-women", as a pertinent example of women's presence in, while not necessarily participating in, the public realm of coffeehouses. They acted as proprietors of the establishment as well as coffee servers, while not necessarily taking part in coffeehouse conversation.[77] Famous female coffeehouse proprietors are Anne Rochford and Moll King, who subsequently became publicly satirised figures.[77]
