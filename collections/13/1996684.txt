At the new City station there were two platforms and either could be used by an arriving train, reversing in the platform. The track connections at the approach were a double slip, not a scissors, so a train could not leave while another was arriving.[11] The left hand platform line was extended by a train length and trains could be stabled in the extension.[5] A large diameter Greathead shield was used to bore the section of tunnel where the track connections would be installed.[12]
