In its most elementary form the number includes a year and a serial number.  The year has two digits for 1898 to 2000, and four digits beginning in 2001.  The three ambiguous years (1898, 1899, and 1900) are distinguished by the size of the serial number.  There are also some peculiarities in numbers beginning with a "7" because of an unsuccessful experiment applied between 1969 and 1972.[citation needed]
