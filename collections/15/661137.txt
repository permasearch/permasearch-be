The last units of the Clio II built in Mexico featured the headlights used on the Nissan Platina,[citation needed] thus becoming the third headlight design to be used in the car. This version lasted a month (January 2010) on sale, before both Clio and Platina being replaced by the Dacia Logan and Sandero. The second generation Clio was marketed until 2012 in France as the Clio Campus,[27] or in Slovenia as the Clio Storia.[28] It is still marketed in Colombia also as Clio Campus since 2012, with the same interior as the pre-facelifted model and a very basic equipment, without airbags or foglights.
