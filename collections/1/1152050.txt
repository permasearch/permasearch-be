Although women of other nationalities were sometimes present at canneries, Native women were the most prolific. There are reports of Japanese women working on the canning with their babies strapped to their backs,[21] and records suggest that white women sometimes worked as cooks or assistant shopkeepers.[20] Aside from actively participating in the canning process, women helped to make the canneries into more than just work sites. With the presence of women and children, canneries would become homes away from home for all of the workers on site.
