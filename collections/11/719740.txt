For first order initial value problems, the Peano existence theorem gives one set of circumstances in which a solution exists. Given any point     ( a , b )   {\displaystyle (a,b)}   in the xy-plane, define some rectangular region     Z   {\displaystyle Z}  , such that     Z = [ l , m ] × [ n , p ]   {\displaystyle Z=[l,m]\times [n,p]}   and     ( a , b )   {\displaystyle (a,b)}   is in the interior of     Z   {\displaystyle Z}  . If we are given a differential equation         d  y    d  x    = g ( x , y )   {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} y}{\mathrm {d} x}}=g(x,y)}   and the condition that     y = b   {\displaystyle y=b}   when     x = a   {\displaystyle x=a}  , then there is locally a solution to this problem if     g ( x , y )   {\displaystyle g(x,y)}   and        ∂ g   ∂ x      {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial g}{\partial x}}}   are both continuous on     Z   {\displaystyle Z}  . This solution exists on some interval with its center at     a   {\displaystyle a}  . The solution may not be unique. (See Ordinary differential equation for other results.)
