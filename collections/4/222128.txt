During Company rule in India and the British Raj, famines in India, due to the failed policies of British colonial government, were some of the worst ever recorded, including the Great Famine of 1876–78 in which 6.1 million to 10.3 million people died,[448] the Great Bengal famine of 1770 where up to 10 million people died,[449] the Indian famine of 1899–1900 in which 1.25 to 10 million people died,[450] and the Bengal famine of 1943 where up to 3.8 million people died.[451] The Third Plague Pandemic in the mid-19th century killed 10 million people in India.[452] Despite persistent diseases and famines, the population of the Indian subcontinent, which stood at up to 200 million in 1750,[453] had reached 389 million by 1941.[454]
