Flight Lieutenant (Flt Lt in the RAF and IAF; FLTLT in the RAAF and RNZAFâ€”formerly sometimes F/L in all services) is a junior commissioned air force rank that originated in the Royal Naval Air Service and is still used in the Royal Air Force[1] and many other countries, especially in the Commonwealth.  It is also sometimes used as the English translation of an equivalent rank in non-English-speaking countries, especially those with an air force-specific rank structure.
