In a simultaneous review with American Dad!, The Simpsons, Bob's Burgers, and The Cleveland Show, Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club called the episode "damn funny" saying that "[the] first half is a magical reminder of what made Family Guy work and a nice vacation from the experimental morality and anti-humor that's made up so much of the show over the past few months." The episode received a B+, the best rating of the night, tying with Bob's Burgers episode "Burger Wars" and scoring higher than American Dad! episode "License to Till", The Simpsons episode "The Great Simpsina", and The Cleveland Show episode "Ship'rect".[3]
