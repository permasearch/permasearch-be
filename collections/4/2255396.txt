In October 2010, the channel started to broadcast select shows in Romanian. On 12 October 2011, the Central and Eastern Europe feed (Poland, Hungary and Romania) was separated from the HQ feed; as a result, the former maintains its own schedule, as well as featuring promos and bumpers in Hungarian, Romanian, Polish and English, as well as the preschool-targeted block Cartoonito, which was added to both feeds around the same time.
