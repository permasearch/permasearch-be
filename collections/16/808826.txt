Tiruchirappalli experiences a tropical savanna climate—designated "Aw" under the Köppen climate classification—with no major change in temperature between summer and winter.[99][100] The climate is generally characterised by high temperature and low humidity.[101] With an annual mean temperature of 28.9 °C (84.0 °F) and monthly average temperatures ranging between 25 °C (77 °F) and 32 °C (90 °F),[99] the city is the hottest in the state.[102] The warmest months are from April to June,[103] when the city experiences frequent dust storms.[103] As of  November 2013[update], the highest temperature ever recorded in Tiruchirappalli was 43.9 °C (111.0 °F), which occurred on 2 May 1896;[104] the lowest was observed on 6 February 1884 at 13.9 °C (57.0 °F).[105][106] The high temperatures in the city have been attributed to the presence of two rivers—Kaveri and Kollidam—[d]and the absence of greenery around the city.[102] As Tiruchirappalli is on the Deccan Plateau the days are extremely warm and dry; evenings are cooler because of cold winds that blow from the south-east.[99] From June to September, the city experiences a moderate climate tempered by heavy rain and thundershowers. Rainfall is heaviest between October and December because of the north-east monsoon winds, and from December to February the climate is cool and moist.[99] The average annual rainfall is 841.9 mm (33.15 in),[107] slightly lower than the state's average of 945 mm (37.2 in).[108] Fog and dew are rare and occur only during the winter season.[103]
