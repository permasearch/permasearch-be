South Africa has an extreme and persistent high unemployment rate of over 25%, which interacts with other economic and social problems such as inadequate education, poor health outcomes and crime.[75] The poor have limited access to economic opportunities and basic services.[76] According to a 2013 Goldman Sachs report, that number increases to 35% when including people who have given up looking for work.[15] A quarter of South Africans live on less than US $1.25 a day.[77]
