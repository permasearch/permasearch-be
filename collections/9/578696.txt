In the meantime, Jason discovers through the local daily that his parents have brought a lawsuit against Coach Taylor for not properly training him how to tackle someone - an activity quarterbacks generally do not have to do. Many in the town do not like this, particularly Jason, who privately tells Coach Taylor that he never wanted it to happen this way.[15] But because of the financial burden on his parents over his medical expenses, Jason goes along with it. Things become awkward, albeit not tense, between him and Coach Taylor for a while as a result. At home, there is tension between his parents as they disagree over the decision to sue Taylor and the settlement amount. When the next settlement hearing is called, their attorney suggests wheeling Jason up to the stand to play on the jury's sympathies, to which Jason snaps that he does not want to be put on display "like some brain dead idiot" who is no longer capable of fending for himself. He puts an end to the lawsuit and writes out an undisclosed amount, which he says is enough to cover his parents' mortgage and debt incurred by his medical expenses, to which the school officials agree.[16]
