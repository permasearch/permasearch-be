Tweed was born April 3, 1823, at 1 Cherry Street,[4] on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Son of a third-generation Scots-Irish chair-maker, Tweed grew up on Cherry Street. Tweed's religious affiliation was not widely known in his lifetime, but at the time of his funeral the     New York Times, quoting a family friend, reported that his parents had been Quakers and "members of the old Rose Street Meeting house".[5] At the age of 11, he left school to learn his father's trade, and then became an apprentice to a saddler.[4] He also studied to be a bookkeeper and worked as a brushmaker for a company he had invested in, before eventually joining in the family business in 1852.[4] On September 29, 1844,[6] he married Mary Jane C. Skaden and lived with her family on Madison Street for two years.
