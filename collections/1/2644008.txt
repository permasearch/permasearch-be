Until recently, canned or frozen food was not widely available in India. Therefore, the vegetables used in a meal widely depended on the season. For example, spring (March–May) is the season of cabbages, onions, potatoes, okra, guar tondali,[15] shevgyachya shenga, dudhi, marrow and padwal. Monsoon season (June–September) for green leafy vegetables, such as aloo (marathi: आळू), or gourds such as karle, dodka and eggplant. Chili peppers, carrots, tomatoes, cauliflower, french beans and peas become available in the cooler climate of October to February.[16]
