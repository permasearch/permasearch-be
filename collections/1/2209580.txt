The plot device of the alien cookbook is parodied in the segment "Hungry Are the Damned" on The Simpsons episode "Treehouse of Horror" (1990). In the segment, the seemingly benevolent aliens Kang and Kodos are discovered to have a book titled "How to Cook Humans".[9] The humour is played up by a series of reversals in revealing the actual title of the book. What begins as "How to Cook Humans", through a series of repeated blowing of "space dust" from the book, becomes "How to Cook for Humans", "How to Cook Forty Humans", and finally "How to Cook for Forty Humans". Ultimately, the trope is subverted, as Lisa later comments on their suspicious attitude towards the aliens: "Truly there were monsters on that ship, and truly we were them."
