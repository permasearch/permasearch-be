In October 2012, A+E Networks and History, as well as cast members from the show, were sued in Clark County District Court in Las Vegas for interference with business practices by Wayne Jefferies, a Las Vegas promoter[164] and the Harrisons' manager, who represented them and Austin Lee "Chumlee" Russell in their television business dealings.[165] Jefferies, who was instrumental in helping to launch the series,[166][167] states that after the show premiered, his influence in the show was increasingly reduced, and he was ultimately fired and left without his promised share of fees and merchandising royalties from the series. Jefferies states that this occurred after a January 2012 leaked story on TMZ that indicated that the Pawn Stars cast was taken aback by History's launch of the spinoff Cajun Pawn Stars, of which the cast had been unaware.[164][168]
