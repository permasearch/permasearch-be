The Holy Knights (聖騎士, Seikishi) are the most powerful knights in Britannia who protect the kingdom, being terrifying individuals who are each able to match an entire country's army in strength. They are people that are killers. Sometime before the beginning of the series, the Holy Knights orchestrated a coup d'état and captured the king of Liones. The kingdom, now under the control of the Holy Knights, fell into a state of distress as citizens from towns and villages surrounding the kingdom were enslaved or forcefully recruited into joining a furtive war effort: the men trained as soldiers, while women and children forced to amass food for storage, as well as the elderly made to construct castle walls. Under the rule of the Holy Knights, death is the penalty for insubordination. After Hendrickson is defeated and Dreyfus disappears, King Baltra forgives most of them, since he preferred they atone for their actions since punishing them wouldn't reverse the damage they caused.
