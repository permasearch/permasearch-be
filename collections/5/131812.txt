In 1947, the King and his family toured Southern Africa.[89] The Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa, Jan Smuts, was facing an election and hoped to make political capital out of the visit.[90] George was appalled, however, when instructed by the South African government to shake hands only with whites,[91] and referred to his South African bodyguards as "the Gestapo".[92] Despite the tour, Smuts lost the election the following year, and the new government instituted a strict policy of racial segregation.
