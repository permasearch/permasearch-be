In 1959, the land occupied by the 40-room Victorian mansion, "Castle Stevens" or "Villa on the Hudson", was re-purposed for the 14-story administration building completed in 1962, later renamed the Wesley J. Howe building.[27] During its tenure as a campus building starting in 1911, it served as a dormitory, cafeteria and office space. The unsupported cantilevered staircase with its elegant hand-carved balustrade was one of only two such “floating staircases” in America.[28]
