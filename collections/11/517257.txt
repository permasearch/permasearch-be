The runoff and pollution have many components that help contribute to the algal bloom, which is mainly fed by phosphorus and nitrogen.[57]  This algae prevents sunlight from reaching the bottom of the Bay while alive and deoxygenates the Bay's water when it dies and rots.  The erosion and runoff of sediment into the Bay, exacerbated by devegetation, construction and the prevalence of pavement in urban and suburban areas, also blocks vital sunlight.  The resulting loss of aquatic vegetation has depleted the habitat for much of the Bay's animal life.  Beds of eelgrass, the dominant variety in the southern Chesapeake Bay, have shrunk by more than half there since the early 1970s. Overharvesting, pollution, sedimentation and disease have turned much of the Bay's bottom into a muddy wasteland.[58]
