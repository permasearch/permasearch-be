In order to locate the hostages, Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) suggests they use the crashed escape pod's instruments; Ishara recommends that she beam separately to a nearby location as a distraction, as her implanted proximity device will set off the Alliance's alarms. The crew executes the plan, but Ishara is wounded in the attempt. Riker rescues her, and is impressed by her bravery; later, Ishara informs Hayne "It's working."
