Red is the perpetually disgruntled, ill-tempered father of Eric and Laurie Forman and Kitty Forman's husband as well as the foster father to Steven Hyde. He is seemingly insensitive to other people, but admits frequently in the series that this is to maintain his self-identity of being a "man". In some episodes, his tough exterior crumbles when he encounters other people's needs and he eventually makes decisions that show an ethical regard for doing what is right.
