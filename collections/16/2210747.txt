Working in secret in the basement laboratory of Columbia's Philosophy Hall, Armstrong slowly developed what eventually resulted in wide-band FM, in the process discovering significant advantages over the earlier "narrow-band" FM transmissions. He was granted five U.S. patents covering the basic features of new system on December 26, 1933.[31] Initially, the primary claim was that his FM system was effective at filtering out the noise produced in receivers by vacuum tubes.[32]
