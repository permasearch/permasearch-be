Metal Gear (released in 1987) introduces Solid Snake (ソリッド・スネーク, Soriddo Sunēku), a rookie recruit of the elite special forces unit FOXHOUND. Snake is sent by FOXHOUND leader Big Boss into the rogue nation Outer Heaven to rescue missing teammate Gray Fox and discover who or what the "Metal Gear" is, mentioned in Gray Fox's last transmission.[17][18] As his mission progresses, Snake finds out that he has been set up; Outer Heaven's leader is Big Boss, intending to use the experimental, nuclear-armed TX-55 Metal Gear to establish Outer Heaven as a nuclear power.[19] After destroying the Metal Gear, Snake confronts and defeats Big Boss's phantom.[20]
