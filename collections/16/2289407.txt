Akbar defeats Sharifuddin, and spares his life for his half-sister, Bakshi Banu Begum's sake, but not before stripping him of his title of Viceroy of Ajmer and Nagaur.Eventually Akbar proclaims that Hindustan will be a peaceful and prosperous land if people respect and honour each other's religions. The film ends as the narrator accounts that Jodhaa and Akbar created history through their unconditional and eternal love for each other.
