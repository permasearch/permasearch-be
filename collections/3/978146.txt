The quartet was premiered at the camp, outdoors and in the rain, on 15 January 1941. The musicians had decrepit instruments and an audience of about 400 fellow prisoners and guards.[3] The cello was bought with donations from camp members.[4] Messiaen later recalled: "Never was I listened to with such rapt attention and comprehension."[5]
