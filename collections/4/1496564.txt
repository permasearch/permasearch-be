Each component has its own lifecycle (owner, version, approval, use) and can be tracked individually or as part of an assembly. Component content management is typically used for multi-channel customer-facing content (marketing, usage, learning, support). The solution can be a separate system or be a functionality of another content management system type (for example, enterprise content management or web content management).
