Stainless steel nanoparticles have been produced in the laboratory.[36] This synthesis uses oxidative Kirkendall Diffusion to build a thin protective barrier which prevent further oxidation.[37] These may have applications as additives for high performance applications. For examples, sulfurization, phosphorization and nitridation treatments to produce nanoscale stainless steel based catalysts could enhance the electrocatalytic performance of stainless steel for water splitting.[38]
