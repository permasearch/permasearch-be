He owns a private Boeing 767-33A/ER, registered in Aruba as P4-MES. It is known as The Bandit[113] due to its livery. Originally the aircraft was ordered by Hawaiian Airlines but the order was cancelled and Abramovich bought it from Boeing and refitted it to his own requirements by Andrew Winch, who designed the interior and exterior. The aircraft was estimated in 2016 to cost US$74Â million and its interior is reported to include a 30-seat dining room, a boardroom, master bedrooms, luxury bathrooms with showers, and a spacious living room. The aircraft has the same air missile avoidance system as the Air Force One.[113] Abramovich also owns a Gulfstream 650 with registration LX-GVI and a Dassault Falcon 7X with registration LX-MES named as "Mini Bandit"
