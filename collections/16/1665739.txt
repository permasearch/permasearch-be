The numbers or the objects to be added in general addition are collectively referred to as the terms,[4] the addends[5][6][7] or the summands;[8] this terminology carries over to the summation of multiple terms. This is to be distinguished from factors, which are multiplied. Some authors call the first addend the augend.[5][6][7] In fact, during the Renaissance, many authors did not consider the first addend an "addend" at all. Today, due to the commutative property of addition, "augend" is rarely used, and both terms are generally called addends.[9]
