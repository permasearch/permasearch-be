The Ford Crown Victoria is the only Panther vehicle which was produced for the 2012 model year, as the Mercury Grand Marquis, Lincoln Town Car, and Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor were discontinued during the 2011 model year. As 2012 production was illegal for sale in the United States (due to lack of stability control),[30] the entire 2012 production was exported to the Middle East.
