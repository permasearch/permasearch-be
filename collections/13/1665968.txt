The studio released Meet the Robinsons, its second all-CGI film, earning $169.3 million worldwide.[209] That same year, DisneyToon Studios was also restructured and began to operate as a separate unit under Lasseter and Catmull's control.[210] Lasseter's direct intervention with the studio's next film, American Dog, resulted in the departure of director Chris Sanders,[211] who went on to become a director at DreamWorks Animation.[212] The film was retooled by new directors Byron Howard and Chris Williams as Bolt, which was released in 2008 and had the best critical reception of any Disney animated feature since Lilo & Stitch,[213] and became a moderate financial success.[214]
