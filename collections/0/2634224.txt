In the 1990s, Caltrans began constructing extensions to the freeway from Glendora east to the former Interstate 215/State Route 30 interchange in San Bernardino. In 2003, a 20-mile (32 km) segment east from Glendora to Fontana was completed, with the portion proceeding south from Glendora renumbered SR 57. The remaining section east of Interstate 15 between Fontana and Interstate 215 was opened on July 24, 2007.
