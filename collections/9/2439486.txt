In 2011, Burke released her autobiography, Dancing Lessons.  Included in it is a description of how she, at age 5, was molested by a handyman helping her family, who repeatedly fondled her.  She believed it was wrong but wanted to gain the affection of the person.  The molester was sentenced to 22 years in prison and was released in 2008. Burke said that she is fearful of the person.[9] Burke has done numerous promotions outside of Dancing with the Stars which include Depend Silhouette briefs, Impress Nails and Sargento Cheese. Her partnership with these companies has raised a lot of money including 50 thousand dollars that Depend is donating to Dress for Success.[10] She opened her first dance studio in April 2008 and created her own line of activewear the next year.[11]
