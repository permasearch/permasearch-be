Due to the increase to 16 participating teams, the new qualification process was announced in July 2015 by the International Hockey Federation. Each of the continental champions from five confederations and the host nation received an automatic berth, and the 10/11 highest placed teams at the Semifinals of the 2016â€“17 FIH Hockey World League not already qualified would enter the tournament. The following sixteen teams, shown with final pre-tournament rankings, will compete in this tournament.[6]
