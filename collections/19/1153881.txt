On May 18, 1997 (a day after Flores' 35th wedding anniversary),[130] in a follow-up report on Televisa, a handful of women claimed to have been sexually abused by Flores approximately twenty years earlier.[131] In a third report on August 17, shortly after the church's most significant holiday, former member Moisés Padilla Íñiguez also accused Flores of sexually abusing him when he was a teenager.[131][125] These accusations were spearheaded by Erdely's anti-cult group, which demanded that La Luz del Mundo be stripped of its legal recognition as a religious organization.[132][133] Four people later filed formal complaints with the state prosecutor, but the statute of limitations for the alleged crimes had passed.[124]
