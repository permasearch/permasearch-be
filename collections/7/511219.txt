Canadian Paralympic athlete Rick Hansen, who had recruited Fox to play on his wheelchair basketball team in 1977, was similarly inspired by the Marathon of Hope.[135] Hansen, who first considered circumnavigating the globe in his wheelchair in 1974, began the Man in Motion World Tour in 1985 with the goal of raising $10 million towards research into spinal cord injuries.[136] As Fonyo had, Hansen paused at the spot Fox's run ended to honour the late runner.[106] Hansen completed his world tour in May 1987 after 792 days and 40,073 kilometres (24,900Â mi);[137] he travelled through 34 countries and raised over $26 million.[138]
