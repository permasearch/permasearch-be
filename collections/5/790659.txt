Jacques was first seen in The Vile Village where the villagers of the Village of Fowl Devotees mistook him for Count Olaf. He was to be burned at the stake only to be killed by the real Count Olaf (who was disguised as Detective Dupin at the time) who framed the Baudelaire siblings for his death. Before he died, he tried to mention to the Baudelaire children that he worked for the V.F.D.
