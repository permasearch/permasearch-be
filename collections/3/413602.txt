Another feud heading into No Way Out was between The Rock and Big Show over who should get the chance to face for the WWF Championship at WrestleMania 2000. The feud began at the Royal Rumble in the Royal Rumble match, The Rock and Big Show were the last two competitors in the match both trying to throw each other over the rope. Both wrestlers fell out of the ring hitting the floor, with The Rock hitting the floor first, but the officials thought Big Show hit the ground first, making The Rock the winner of the Royal Rumble. The next night on Raw Is War, Big Show complained that it was no fair that nobody saw what happened so he got evidence and sent it to Triple H, who would later make a match between The Rock and Big Show at No Way Out where the winner would get a WWF Championship title shot at WrestleMania.
