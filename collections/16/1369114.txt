The Elder Scrolls III: Tribunal, announced on September 2, 2002, and scheduled for a PC-only release,[90] went gold on November 1[91] and was released, with little fanfare,[92] on November 6.[93] Tribunal puts the player in the self-contained, walled city of Mournhold, the capital of the province of Morrowind; the new city is not connected to Morrowind's land mass, Vvardenfell, and the player must teleport to it. The storyline continues the story of the Tribunal deities.[90]
