Hepatitis C is caused by an RNA virus. In 80% of people infected, the disease is chronic, and without treatment, they are infected for the remainder of their lives. However, there is now an effective treatment that uses the nucleoside analogue drug ribavirin combined with interferon.[206] The treatment of chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus by using a similar strategy using lamivudine has been developed.[207]
