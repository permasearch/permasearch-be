Historians of the empire have recently paid close attention to 20th century native voices in many colonies who demanded independence.[207] The African colonies became independent mostly in peaceful fashion. Kenya saw severe violence on both sides.[208] Typically the leaders of independence had studied in England in the 1920s and 1930s. For example, the radical nationalist Kwame Nkrumah in 1957 led Ghana to become Britain's first African colony to gain independence, and others quickly followed.[209]
