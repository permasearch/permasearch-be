Critical reception for Grizzly in 1976 was extremely negative, with most critics panning the film for being too closely similar to Steven Spielberg's classic thriller Jaws. Vincent Canby from the New York Times panned the film, criticizing the film's poor plotting, cinematography, and editing. He wrote, "Grizzly, which opened yesterday at the Rivoli and other theaters, is such a blatant imitation of Jaws that one has to admire the depth of the flattery it represents, though not the lack of talent involved".[2] Donald Guarisco from Allmovie gave the film a negative review, criticizing the film's script, cheap gore, and overuse of clichÃ©s, and saying, "This energetic but clumsy horror effort is too contrived and poorly realized to be worthwhile for most viewers".[3] Film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film 2 out of 4 stars, calling it an "OK rip-off of Jaws".[4]
