During the 1940s, "fly-by-night" for-profit colleges sprang up to collect veterans' education grants, because the program provided limited oversight.[9] Similarly, for-profit colleges and their lead generators[10] have taken advantage of the post-9/11 G.I. Bill to target veterans for subpar products and services.[11] According to CBS News, about 40 percent of all G.I. Bill education funds go to for-profit colleges.[12] The Department of Veterans Affairs, however, does have a G.I. Bill feedback form for recipients to address their complaints against colleges.[13] In 2012, President Barack Obama also signed Executive Order 13607, which was to ensure that predatory colleges did not aggressively recruit military service members, veterans, and their families.[14] In 2017, President Donald Trump signed the Forever GI Bill extending the allowable time period for veterans to pursue educational opportunities.
