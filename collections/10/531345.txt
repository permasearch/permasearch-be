Following a period of adjustment, Selänne gained an appreciation for his new team; he quickly came to call the deal the best thing that ever happened to him.[26] He was paired with Paul Kariya, whom he met at the 1996 NHL All-Star Game, and the duo were counted on to lead the young franchise to a post-season berth for the first time.[10] Selänne scored 36 points in 28 games with the Ducks, and combined with his Jets totals, finished the 1995–96 season with 108 points. He followed it up with a third 100-point season in 1996–97, finishing with 109, including 51 goals.[16] He was named to the First All-Star Team for a second time,[7] while he and Kariya led the Mighty Ducks into the franchise's first playoff appearance in 1997.[27] Despite being criticized as being a "one-line team", Anaheim defeated the Phoenix Coyotes in the first round before being eliminated by the Detroit Red Wings.[28][29]
