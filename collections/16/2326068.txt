The most recognizable popping move is the moonwalk. In 1983, Michael Jackson performed the moonwalk—called the backslide in popping context[50]— on ABC's Motown 25 television special.[64] This performance popularized the moonwalk all over the world.[65] However, it was not the first time the backslide had been performed on television or on film. Cab Calloway performed the backslide in 1932,[66][67] and Bill Bailey performed it in the movies Cabin in the Sky (1943) and Rhythm and Blues Revue (1955).[68] In 1982, during a performance in London on Top of the Pops, street dancer Jeffrey Daniel performed the backslide during the song "A Night to Remember".[69][70]
