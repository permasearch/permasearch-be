Meanwhile, Jessie takes Lori for a similarly uplifting experience. He knows his former Blue Team member started off this journey held back by a lot of pain and suffering, which is why he has planned for her to swing from a rope high above the jungle floor. Despite her fears, Lori does let go of the rope and screams that she's letting go of the old Lori as she flies through the sky. As evidence of Lori's new lease on life, she and Sonya do something they used to dread: putting on bathing suits. The women celebrate all their hard work by enjoying themselves on the beach, feeling amazing and confident in their new bodies. For Lori, she finally feels like her old, beautiful self, but for Sonya, this is "uncharted waters." She has struggled with her weight her whole life and has never been able to put on a swimsuit without feeling ashamed of her body.
