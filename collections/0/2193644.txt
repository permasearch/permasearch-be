In New Zealand, the ten most common birthdays all fall within a thirteen-day period, between September 19 and October 1, corresponding to conception in December. The ten least common birthdays (other than February 29) are December 24–27, January 1–2, February 6, March 22, April 1 and April 25. This is based on all live births registered in New Zealand between 1980 and 2014.[14]
