In the 19th century, humanists such as English poet and essayist Matthew Arnold (1822â€“1888) used the word "culture" to refer to an ideal of individual human refinement, of "the best that has been thought and said in the world."[19] This concept of culture is also comparable to the German concept of bildung: "...culture being a pursuit of our total perfection by means of getting to know, on all the matters which most concern us, the best which has been thought and said in the world."[19]
