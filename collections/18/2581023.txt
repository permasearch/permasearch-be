Jackson enlisted designer Giuseppe Zanotti to create custom shoes for the tour. In an interview with Women's Wear Daily Zanotti stated that "Janet will be dancing a lot on stage as well as singing, so I wanted her to be very comfortable and able to move around easilyÂ ... The shoe has to be light but practical and provide support to her feet."[12] Zanotti also noted Unbreakable will be the first tour in which he makes custom designs for the entire cast.[12]
