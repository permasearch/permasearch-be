In the early 20th century, interest in dissociation and multiple personalities waned for a number of reasons. After Charcot's death in 1893, many of his so-called hysterical patients were exposed as frauds, and Janet's association with Charcot tarnished his theories of dissociation.[75] Sigmund Freud recanted his earlier emphasis on dissociation and childhood trauma.[75]
