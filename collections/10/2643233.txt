The problem with the methods described above is that errors will accumulate and the series will tend to diverge from the true function. A solution which guarantees a constant maximum error is to use curve fitting. A minimum of N values are calculated evenly spaced along the range of the desired calculations. Using a curve fitting technique like Gaussian reduction an Nâˆ’1th degree polynomial interpolation of the function is found.[40] With the optimized polynomial, the initial values can be calculated as above.
