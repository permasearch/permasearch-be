Methylene blue, also known as methylthioninium chloride, is a medication and dye.[1] As a medication, it is mainly used to treat methemoglobinemia.[1][3] Specifically, it is used to treat methemoglobin levels that are greater than 30% or in which there are symptoms despite oxygen therapy.[3] It has previously been used for cyanide poisoning and urinary tract infections, but this use is no longer recommended.[1] It is typically given by injection into a vein.[1]
