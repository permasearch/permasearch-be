Jane Morgan (portrayed by Ella Jonas Farlinger) is Ethan's younger, 9-year-old sister. She has her own strange view of the world around her. Jane knows about Ethan's, Benny's, Sarah's, Rory's and Erica's supernatural abilities and keeps the secret, often helping along when they are in dangerous situations. She usually gets her way by blackmailing Ethan, threatening to tell their parents about all of Ethan, Benny, and Sarah's secret adventures. Although she is manipulative, she cares for Ethan and shares a friendly and easy relationship with Benny. Jane seems to have certain limited abilities to cast spells; She once used one of Benny's spells to bring one of her dolls to life and gets her parents and others turned into little dolls after being touched by Jane's doll, prompting Ethan, Benny and Sarah to come to the rescue and turn everyone back to normal again.
