In 2002, the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) announced that it would acknowledge the site of Victoria Rink with "a commemorative plaque or other historical site marker to remind the passers-by of the existence of the Victoria Skating Rink, the birthplace of organized hockey."[14] The commemoration has been marked in two ways. On May 22, 2008, a commemorative plaque was dedicated at the nearby Centre Bell, along with a plaque honouring James Creighton.[8] Further, the IIHF created the Victoria Cup, a trophy named for the arena, for which—along with 1 million Swiss francs—one National Hockey League team and the champion of the European Champions Hockey League play off annually.[15] The first Cup match was held in Berne, Switzerland on October 1, 2008 between the New York Rangers and the Metallurg Magnitogorsk.[16] The next, and last, edition of the Victoria Cup was held in Zurich on September 29, 2009, between the ZSC Lions and the Chicago Blackhawks.
