When the random variable is normally distributed, a minor correction exists to eliminate the bias. To derive the correction, note that for normally distributed X, Cochran's theorem implies that     ( n − 1 )  s  2    /   σ  2     {\displaystyle (n-1)s^{2}/\sigma ^{2}}   has a chi square distribution with n − 1 degrees of freedom and thus its square root,       n − 1   s  /  σ   {\displaystyle {\sqrt {n-1}}s/\sigma }   has a chi distribution with n − 1 degrees of freedom. Consequently, calculating the expectation of this last expression and rearranging constants,
