Following the Flight of the Earls in 1607, the chief of the Dohertys, Sir Cahir O'Doherty, rose up in the following year against English domination in Ireland and the plantation of Protestant settlers in what is known as O'Doherty's Rebellion. Provoked by the English Governor George Paulet,[4] Cahir and his followers attacked and destroyed Derry and burned several castles before ultimately being defeated at the Battle of Kilmacrennan. After this loss the family lost much of its power and influence. By 1784, the leading branch of the family fled the country. The chiefs have been absent from Ireland ever since.
