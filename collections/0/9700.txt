The authors of the song have repeatedly rejected this interpretation and have strongly and consistently denied that they intended any references to drug use.[10] Leonard Lipton has stated "Puff the Magic Dragon is not about drugs."[11] Peter Yarrow has frequently explained that the song is about the hardships of growing older and has no relationship to drug-taking.[12][13] He has also said of the song that it "never had any meaning other than the obvious one" and is about the "loss of innocence in children",[14] and dismissed the suggestion of association with drugs as "sloppy research".[15]
