Kiel was born in Detroit, Michigan. His height and features were a result of the hormonal condition of acromegaly.[5] In his prime, Kiel was 7 ft 1 1⁄2 in (217 cm) tall. He noted in his 2002 autobiography Making It Big in the Movies that he used to state that he was 7 ft 2 in (218 cm), because it was easier to remember. He suffered from acrophobia (fear of heights), and during the cable car stunt scenes in Moonraker, a stunt double was used because Kiel refused to be filmed on the top of a cable car over 2,000 feet (610 m) above the ground.
