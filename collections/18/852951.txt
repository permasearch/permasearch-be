The 2012-13 season saw the network move into a new creative direction under new president Mark Pedowitz. The introduction of action-superhero series Arrow (based on DC Comics' Green Arrow franchise) received favorable reviews from critics and became a hit with audiences when it premiered. As evidence of the network's refocusing toward a more inclusive audience, Arrow not only premiered to some of the highest viewership totals in the network's history (the third highest overall as of 2015[update], behind the series premieres of The Vampire Diaries and The Flash), it also gave the network its strongest performance in the demographic of males 18-34 since Smallville ended its run in May 2011. The strength of Arrow, combined with the stability of The Vampire Diaries and a rejuvenated Supernatural gave The CW a much needed win for the season. However, the network's other creative swings in Emily Owens, M.D. and Cult were not successful and were canceled after one season. The remaining freshman lineup of Beauty & the Beast and The Carrie Diaries performed adequately enough for renewal. During this season, the network introduced an image campaign under the "TV Now" slogan, in part to emphasize the availability of CW content across television, computer and mobile platforms.[31]
