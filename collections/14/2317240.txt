In the first round of the 2010 spring general elections, the right-wing Fidesz received  2.704 million  votes, i.e. the votes of 33.69% of the 8.026 million eligible voters or 52.73% of the 5.128 million actual voters for party lists, which resulted in more than two-thirds of the seats in Parliament. Fidesz took 263 seats, the Socialists 59, radical, far right nationalist Jobbik 47, and the newly founded Lehet MÃ¡s a Politika (Politics Can Be Different) 16, with one seat taken by an independent. In the autumn municipal elections, Fidesz achieved a majority in almost all local and mayoral elections, winning the traditional strongholds of the liberal parties.
