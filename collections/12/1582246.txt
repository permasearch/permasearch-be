The song is well known for its controversial music video, which was directed by t.A.T.u's producer, writer and director Ivan Shapovalov, and was shot at the Khodynka Field in Moscow between 4â€“7 September 2000.[46] Preparation for the visual consisted of both Volkova and Katina covering themselves in dark-tanning lotion and getting haircuts. Over 90 people were present on set, including extra actors, whilst some members had designed a large brick wall by painting abstract patterns and colors to it. According to Shapovalov, the wall itself cost approximately $3000 USD.[47] After shooting the majority of the scenes in Khodynka Field, Shapovalov moved the wall and iron fence to Kutuzov Avenue, Moscow, in order to shot frames of traffic until the camera changed its focus on the girls again. Shapovalov stated that he wanted the viewers to know that there was a "world behind the crowd of people."[47] The video was broadcast in Russia and Europe in early December 2000 on MTV.[48]
