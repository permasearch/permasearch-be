MacGruber was shot on a tight schedule of 28 days in Albuquerque, New Mexico, during the summer of 2009.[18][21] It was written while simultaneously producing the weekly episode of SNL, and the show's production process left the trio deprived of sleep.[22] Forte was positive regarding the film, saying, "What you see with this movie is exactly what we wanted to do. It’s the three of us having a bunch of fun writing it, then having fun making it with a bunch of our friends—old friends and new friends. I think that fun comes across when you watch it. It’s rare that you get that kind of creative freedom."[17] The film was released in May 2010 and received mixed reviews.[23] It fared worse at the box office, where it failed to recoup its budget and was pulled from theaters after its third week.[24] Forte found the failure tolerable, commenting, "When you make something that you’re really proud of and it doesn’t do well, you can live with it."[12] The film has since seen more positive reception and has been dubbed a cult classic.[25][26]
