In 2005, Bajaj launched Pulsar 150. The bike was offered with 17-inch (430 mm) alloy wheels as standard option, and the stance was also lowered by about 12 mm. It was the first time any bike maker in India had offered 17-inch (430 mm) profile wheels at the rear. The fuel tank now had a capacity of only 18 litres.[19] The power output was now further increased to 13.5 hp (10.1 kW) @ 8500 rpm for the 150 while it increased to 16.5 hp (12.3 kW) @ 8500 rpm for the 180.[20] The rear shock absorbers were now gas-filled Nitrox absorbers.
