Sotomayor cast her first vote as an associate Supreme Court justice on August 17, 2009, in a stay of execution case.[208] She was given a warm welcome onto the Court[209] and was formally invested in a September 8 ceremony.[210] Sotomayor's inaugural case in which she heard arguments was on September 9 during a special session, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. It involved the controversial aspect of the First Amendment and the rights of corporations in campaign finance;[211] Sotomayor dissented.[212][213] In her vigorous examination of Floyd Abrams, representing the First Amendment issues in the case, Sotomayor challenged him, questioning 19th century rulings of the Court and saying, "What you are suggesting is that the courts, who created corporations as persons, gave birth to corporations as persons, and there could be an argument made that that was the Court's error to start with ... [imbuing] a creature of State law with human characteristics."[211][214]
