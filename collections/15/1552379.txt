Segment 2 would convert the single HOV-2 diamond lanes in each direction to HOT-2 lanes, and would also include the newly expanded High Rise Bridge and associated lanes of I-64 from the I-464/I-64 interchange. Both directions would have a primary entrance/exit near the Bowers Hill interchange, with a midpoint entrance/exit near the Greenbrier Parkway/Battlefield Boulevard interchanges and a terminal entrance/exit that ties in at the Twin Bridges. The current HOV lanes from be reduced from 16 feet to 12 feet (allowing the installation of the tubular road markers separating the general purpose lanes from the tolled express lanes), and new 12 foot lanes would be built extend across the I-64/I-464 interchange and be built into the new High Rise Bridge and all the way to the Bowers Hill interchange. These lanes would be operational 24 hours a day, 7 days a week once activated, and would be variably priced depending on the traffic in the general purpose lanes. This segment is scheduled to be completed as part of the High Rise Bridge project, which is scheduled for completion in 2021.[27]
