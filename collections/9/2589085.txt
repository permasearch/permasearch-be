Hillenburg's original idea for the pitch was that the writers would write a storyboard for a possible episode and pitch it to Nickelodeon.[6] One of the original ideas was to write an episode with SpongeBob and Squidward on a road trip, inspired by the 1989 film Powwow Highway.[6] Eventually, the idea developed while they were working on it but Hillenburg gave up on the storyboard idea for the initial pitch.[6] The crew resurrected the road trip idea during the first season and used a lot of the ideas for an episode called "Pizza Delivery".[6]
