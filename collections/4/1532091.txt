Joe Russo described the second film as "more of an epic adventure in the classic sense, with huge emotional stakes".[57] Hope van Dyne / Wasp and Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel both only appear in the sequel, in order to preserves their debuts in Ant-Man and the Wasp and Captain Marvel, respectively, which were released between Infinity War and its sequel.[58][59] Other characters, such as Hawkeye and Ant-Man, were excluded in Infinity War for "a very specific story choice". Joe Russo said "we have a really interesting story cooked up for both of those characters, and part of that story required that they be under house arrest [in Infinity War]."[60] The Russos also revealed that, despite not appearing in Infinity War, the events of the film killed Betty Ross and Sif, previously portrayed in the MCU by Liv Tyler and Jaimie Alexander, respectively.[61]
