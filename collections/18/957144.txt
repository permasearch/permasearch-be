By 2004, the owners were claiming that player salaries had grown far faster than revenues, and that the league as a whole lost over US$300 million in 2002–03.[137] As a result, on September 15, 2004 Gary Bettman announced that the owners again locked the players out before the start of the 2004–05 season.[138] On February 16, 2005, Bettman announced the cancellation of the entire season.[139] As with the 1994–95 lockout, the owners were again demanding a salary cap, which the players were unwilling to consider until the season was on the verge of being lost.[138] The season's cancellation led to a revolt within the union. NHLPA president Trevor Linden and senior director Ted Saskin took charge of negotiations from executive director Bob Goodenow.[140] By early July, the two sides had agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement.[138] The deal featured a hard salary cap, linked to a fixed percentage of league revenues and a 24% rollback on salaries.[141]
