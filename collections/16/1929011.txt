All Eritreans between the ages of 18–40 must complete a mandatory national service, which includes military service. This national service was implemented after Eritrea gained its independence from Ethiopia, as a precautionary means to be protected against any threats on Eritrea’s sovereignty, to instill national pride, and to create a disciplined populace.[18] Eritrea’s national service requires lengthy, indefinite conscription periods, which some Eritreans leave the country in order to avoid.[18][128][129]
