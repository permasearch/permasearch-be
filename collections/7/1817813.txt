The largest universities in the region are the University of Texas at El Paso and the Universidad Aut칩noma de Ciudad Ju치rez (Autonomous University of Ciudad Ju치rez). These universities have strong ties to each other (as well as to the Universidad Aut칩noma de Chihuahua) with formal programs of exchange for scholars and students.[29] Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso plays a major part in the region because it is one of the few stand alone Medical Schools, where they work closely with Doctors Without Borders. New Mexico State University in Las Cruces is an additional major university in the area.
