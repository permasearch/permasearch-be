When Alexander set out for Asia, he left his general Antipater, an experienced military and political leader and part of Philip II's "Old Guard", in charge of Macedon.[51] Alexander's sacking of Thebes ensured that Greece remained quiet during his absence.[51] The one exception was a call to arms by Spartan king Agis III in 331Â BC, whom Antipater defeated and killed in the battle of Megalopolis.[51] Antipater referred the Spartans' punishment to the League of Corinth, which then deferred to Alexander, who chose to pardon them.[93] There was also considerable friction between Antipater and Olympias, and each complained to Alexander about the other.[94]
