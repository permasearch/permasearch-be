Shevchenko, who had scored the decisive penalty against Juventus' Gianluigi Buffon in 2003, then had to score or Liverpool would win.[23] He hit his penalty straight down the middle of the goal. Dudek went down to his right, but blocked the shot with his left hand. Liverpool thus won the penalty shootout by a score of 3â€“2.[18][21]
