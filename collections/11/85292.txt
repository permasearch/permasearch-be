In this scenario, there may well come a time when the Lords twice reject a Bill from the Commons and it is forced through. This would in turn trigger questions about the amount of power the Lords should have and there would be pressure for it to increase. This hypothetical process is known as the "circumnavigation of power theory".[31] It implies that it would never be in any government's interest to legitimise the Lords, as they would be forfeiting their own power.
