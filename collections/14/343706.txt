Calling the character the "black sheep" of the Lannister family, TV Guide wrote as the show premiered in 2011 that "Tyrion sees through all the chicanery and decides the best option is to drink and bed his way through the Seven Kingdoms."[52] The Boston Globe added that he is "a hedonistic intellectual who can talk his way out of anything."[14] According to the Los Angeles Times, "brilliant but low-living" Tyrion is "so well acquainted with the workings of the world he can hardly bear it, the Imp is ... debauched, perhaps, but a truth-teller nonetheless, fighting for his own survival with as much mercy as he can spare."[53] The New York Times went as far as to name Tyrion "the closest thing to a hero" in the HBO series.[17]
