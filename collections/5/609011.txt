After Santa Anna learned a force of Texas rebels was heading toward Matamoros, he sent General Urrea to make his way north to Matamoros and then to march north along the coast of Texas to stop them.[1] Urrea arrived in Matamoros and worked to secure cooperation from the local inhabitants on January 31, 1836.[1] Meanwhile, Sam Houston had persuaded all but 70 to 100 men and their leaders, Frank W. Johnson and James Grant, to give up on the expedition and to defend locations in Texas, principally Goliad.[2] On February 12, 1836, Colonel James Fannin took most of the men to defend Presidio La Bah√≠a at Goliad, which he renamed "Fort Defiance".[3]
