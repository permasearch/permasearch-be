Antihistamines (both H1 and H2), while commonly used and assumed effective based on theoretical reasoning, are poorly supported by evidence.[41][42] A 2007 Cochrane review did not find any good-quality studies upon which to base recommendations[42] and they are not believed to have an effect on airway edema or spasm.[8] Corticosteroids are unlikely to make a difference in the current episode of anaphylaxis, but may be used in the hope of decreasing the risk of biphasic anaphylaxis. Their prophylactic effectiveness in these situations is uncertain.[33] Nebulized salbutamol may be effective for bronchospasm that does not resolve with epinephrine.[8] Methylene blue has been used in those not responsive to other measures due to its presumed effect of relaxing smooth muscle.[8]
