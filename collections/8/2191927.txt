Webster dedicated his Speller and Dictionary to providing an intellectual foundation for American nationalism.[22] From 1787 to 1789, Webster was an outspoken supporter of the new Constitution. In October 1787, he wrote a pamphlet entitled "An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution Proposed by the Late Convention Held at Philadelphia," published under the pen name "A Citizen of America."[23] The pamphlet was influential, particularly outside New York State.
