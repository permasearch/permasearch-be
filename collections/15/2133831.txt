Troika has become a cultural icon of Russia, especially after it was featured in a scene of Nikolay Gogol's novel Dead Souls,[citation needed] where a "troika-bird" rides through the vast expanses of Russia (Oh troika, winged troika, tell me who invented you?). Gogol's "troika-bird" became a literary symbol of Russia, despite the fact that Chichikov, the person carried by the troika and the protagonist of the novel, was actually a fraudster buying "dead souls", i.e. the documents on ownership of the dead serfs whose death was still not registered by population censuses, for his own personal profit. The irony of the "troika-bird" of Russia carrying the swindler Chichikov has been discussed in Vasily Shukshin's short story Started Skidding ("Забуксовал").[3]
