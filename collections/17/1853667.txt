This was short lived, and visual continuity was replaced with a narrator, voiced by Harry Hill, in late 2004, which meant that for the first time since the show began, there was no studio set nor on-screen personality. Hill provides humorous commentary on the clips via voice-over, which means more clips can be shown. This move has been seen by some as a cost-cutting exercise.
