Late in the war, American units ultimately fought in two other theaters at the request of the European powers. Pershing sent troops of the 332d Infantry Regiment to Italy, and President Wilson agreed to send some troops, the 27th and 339th Infantry Regiments, to Russia.[7] These latter two were known as the American Expeditionary Force Siberia,[8] and the American Expeditionary Force North Russia.[9]
