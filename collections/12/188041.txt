Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum,[5][6] it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy,[7][8] largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans.[9] In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2012, Athens was ranked the world's 39th richest city by purchasing power[10] and the 67th most expensive[11] in a UBS study.
