In the postwar era, Poland,[150] Spain,[148] and Germany developed or re-established many well-respected Arabian stud farms.[151] The studs of Poland in particular were decimated by both the Nazis and the Soviets, but were able to reclaim some of their breeding stock and became particularly world-renowned for their quality Arabian horses, tested rigorously by racing and other performance standards.[152] During the 1950s, the Russians also obtained additional horses from Egypt to augment their breeding programs.[153]
