Although its primary function is transport of sugars, phloem may also contain cells that have a mechanical support function.  These generally fall into two categories: fibres and sclereids.  Both cell types have a secondary cell wall and are therefore dead at maturity.  The secondary cell wall increases their rigidity and tensile strength.
