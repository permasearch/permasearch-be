If at any time during a meeting of a House there is no quorum which is minimum one-tenth of the total members of a House, it shall be the duty of the Chairman or Speaker, or person acting as such, either to adjourn the House or to suspend the meeting until there is a quorum.[9] The bills taken up under legislative power of parliament are treated as passed provided majority of members present at that time approved the bill either by voting or voice vote. It is also right of a member to demand voting instead of voice vote.[10] In case of passing a constitutional amendment bill, two-third of the total members present and voted in favour of the bill with more than 50% of the total members of a house, is required per Article 368.
