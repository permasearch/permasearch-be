In the period extending roughly from 50 to 150 AD, a number of documents began to circulate among the churches, including epistles, gospel accounts, memoirs, prophecies, homilies, and collections of teachings.[citation needed] While some of these documents were apostolic in origin, others drew upon the tradition the apostles and ministers of the word had utilized in their individual missions, and still others represented a summation of the teaching entrusted to a particular church center.[citation needed] Several of these writings sought to extend, interpret, and apply apostolic teaching to meet the needs of Christians in a given locality.[citation needed]
