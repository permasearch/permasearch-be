Another related concern is what precautions should firms take to prevent data breaches such as those at Target and Staples. Arora et al. (2010)[58] models the firm's effort in securing data from an economics perspective. They find that direct competition reduces the time that a firm takes to patch a vulnerability to its software. Other attempts at measuring the consequences of information security policy from an economics perspective are Miller and Tucker (2011),[59] who look at policies mandating encryption, and Romanosky et al. (2011),[60] who look at mandatory breach notification laws.
