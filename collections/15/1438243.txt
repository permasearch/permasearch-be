The official music video was released on May 22 and was uploaded to Del Rey's Vevo channel. The video was directed by Rich Lee who also directed the "Love" music video.[16] Billboard says that the video kicks off with Del Rey "in a turquoise TV studio wearing a red dress and performing simply choreographed moves with 2 dancers in the background, it all leads to an adventure on, of course, the Hollywood sign. As the track moves into the chorus, Del Rey climbs up a set of stairs that lead to the top of the "H" on the famed California sign, where Abel is there to pull her to the top. The duo make the sign their playground, sitting on the edge of the letters and running all the way across, until Del Rey slides down the "D" and lands in a field of orange flowers."[17] The camera zooms out, showing the Earth, with lights forming a peace sign, in space. The video is loosely inspired by actress Peg Entwistle who infamously jumped to her death in 1932.[18]
