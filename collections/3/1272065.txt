Nia Moseby (played by Giovonnie Samuels) â€“ Nia is Mr. Moseby's niece. She has a part-time job at the candy counter, filling in for Maddie during her absence.

One of Nia's aunts, named Aunt Lilly, was supposed to take on this task, but Nia frustrated her so much that she changed her name and moved to Alaska. Nia appeared in seven episodes in Season 3. According to Mr. Moseby, she was expelled from her last school for fighting with the cafeteria lady because she was out of matzo ball soup. In the episode "First Day of High School", she is seen defending Zack from a jerk. She is shown to be quite good at cheerleading in the episode "Benchwarmers".
