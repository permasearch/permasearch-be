In December 2014, Buhari pledged to enhance security in Nigeria, if he wins the general elections on 14 February 2015, which were later rescheduled for 28 March 2015.[154] Since this announcement, Buhari's approval ratings reportedly have skyrocketed amongst the Nigerian people (largely due to the incumbent Goodluck Jonathan's apparent inability to fight Boko Haram's brutal insurgency). Buhari  made internal security and wiping out the militant group one of the key pillars of his campaigning.
