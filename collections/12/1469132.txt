In 1990, Portland area voters approved funding for the Westside MAX line after the success of the Eastside MAX.[10] It was originally conceived as a line between downtown Portland and 185th Avenue in Hillsboro, but was later in the planning process extended to downtown Hillsboro.[11] Much of the right-of-way used in Beaverton and Hillsboro reused a route first constructed for the Oregon Electric Railway.
