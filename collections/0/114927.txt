Finally, at the end, a bus shows up outside the Krusty Krab, despite Squidward claiming that the buses do not run this late at night. The bus then drops off a mysterious dark silhouette matching the description of the Hash-Slinging Slasher. SpongeBob and Squidward immediately realize that they are experiencing genuine supernatural events and panic. When the strange, unidentified figure enters the building, it is revealed he is simply a kid applying for a job, stating that he had tried calling the Krusty Krab by telephone earlier, but had hung up out of nervousness (the bus that he arrived in remains unexplained). However, Squidward then questions who was flickering the lights earlier. It is then revealed that the flickering lights are caused by doctored footage of Count Orlok from the 1922 silent film Nosferatu, with whom the characters are inexplicably familiar, flicking the light switch on and off.
