McKuen was born on April 29, 1933, in a Salvation Army hostel in Oakland, California.[2] He never knew his biological father who had left his mother.[3] Sexually and physically abused by relatives,[4] raised by his mother and stepfather, who was a violent alcoholic, McKuen ran away from home at the age of 11. He drifted along the West Coast, supporting himself as a ranch hand, surveyor, railroad worker, lumberjack, rodeo cowboy, stuntman, and radio disk jockey, always sending money home to his mother.[5]
