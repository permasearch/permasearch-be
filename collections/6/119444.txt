Jeff Stone of IndieWire gave the episode a "B-" grade and summarized it saying, "The Season 7 finale is poorly paced, but has enough thrills to get by." Stone appreciated that Sasha "went out fighting in her own way" but was highly critical of Negan saying, "Negan proves he’s still the dumbest villain of all time, because even after all that, he refuses to kill Rick." He criticized Maggie's ending speech and called it "repetitive and sappy".[7] Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush gave the episode a positive review saying, "It’s a strong finish to an otherwise uneven season that already alienated many viewers with its premiere, and I appreciate the level of artistry on display in smaller moments like the callback to Sasha and Maggie watching the sunset, or that closing montage. The Walking Dead could use more episodes operating on this frequency, and I suspect there’s lessons to be learned here.[8] Blair Marnell of CraveOnline felt the episode "gave Sasha a memorable send off…and then it just kept on giving it to her. The intercutting between Sasha’s dream reunion with Abe, her time with Negan and Eugene, and her final moments in the coffin was an interesting way to chronicle the last hours of her life. But it went on for far too long." Overall, she noted the slow pacing and filler episodes of the season and felt "it robbed the series of its urgency". On the upcoming war, she assessed, "In theory, the “All Out War” storyline could and should be more intense, but this show’s recent history suggests that its approach isn’t going to change. Eventually, the audience’s willingness to put up with the sluggish pace will catch up with this series. Given the declining ratings, it’s possible that it’s already started to happen. The Walking Dead has pulled off some amazing feats over the last seven seasons, but even this show can’t last forever."[9]
