In Europe, badgers were traditionally used to predict the length of winter.[52] The badger is the state animal of the US state of Wisconsin[53] and Bucky Badger is the mascot of the athletic teams at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The badger is also the official mascot of Brock University in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada; The University of Sussex, England; and St Aidan's College at the University of Durham.
