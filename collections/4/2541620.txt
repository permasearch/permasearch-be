The temple contains an identical, 16-line Sanskrit inscription in two scripts: the South Indian Grantha alphabet on the south wall and the North Indian N훮gar카 script on the north wall. The inscriptions contain a dedication to Shiva, Parvati and Skanda,[83][84][85] and the temple and reliefs have been dated to the early 8th century.[83]
