Marr tells the story of Second World War, beginning with the defeat at Dunkirk that would become the model for the "national spirit"- everyone collaborating in whatever way they could in order to defeat Hitler. In 1940, only Britain, led by Churchill, stood against the German forces, and Churchill's rallying speeches typified "the Blitz spirit" while a Nazi invasion seemed unavoidable. The Home Guard was quickly formed, and the privations of wartime led to innovation and cooperation in novel ways.[6]
