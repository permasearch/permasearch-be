Honda marketed both cars and motorcycles with the Hondamatic transmission in the 1970s and early 1980s. This transmission is frequently referred to as the 'Bang-O-Matic' by mechanics.[citation needed] The design is noteworthy because it preserves engine braking by eliminating a sprag between first and second gears.[citation needed]
