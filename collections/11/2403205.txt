The Social Democratic Party of Germany (German: Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands, SPD) is a social-democratic[4][5][6] political party in Germany. The party, led by acting Chairman Olaf Scholz since 2018, has become one of the two major contemporary political parties in Germany, along with the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). The SPD has governed at the federal level in Germany as part of a grand coalition with the CDU and the Christian Social Union (CSU) since December 2013 following the results of the 2013 and 2017 federal election. The SPD participates in 14 state governments, seven of them governed by SPD Minister-Presidents, and as such holds the distinction of being the only political party in Germany represented in all sixteen Landtags.
