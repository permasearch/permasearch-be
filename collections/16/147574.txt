The Indian Institute of Science collaborates with various government organisations like the DRDO, the ISRO, Bharat Electronics Limited, Aeronautical Development Agency, National Aerospace Laboratories, CSIR, Department of IT (Government of India), etc. IISc also works in collaboration with private industry and research labs like the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing, Google Inc, General Motors, Microsoft Research, IBM Research, Boeing, Robert Bosch Foundation, Pratt & Whitney and more. A few organisations have been incubated by the Society for Innovation and Development (SID) on campus, including Morphing Machines and SandI, while Gamma Porite is currently under incubation. IISc actively promotes and supports ventures by the faculty, the students and alumni. Strand Life Sciences and Ittiam are some success stories of this initiative. In March 2016, a science start-up, incubated at the IISc, has built the world's first food-grade DNA/RNA stain. This might cut the time taken to diagnose conditions such as HIV to a day, from 45 days at present.[178]
