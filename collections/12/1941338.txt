Beaver is having trouble with dividing fractions in arithmetic, his worst subject, especially when there's "a lot of junk left over". When report cards are passed out Beaver has had to leave school early for the dentist. So, Gilbert delivers Beaver's report card to Lumpy and Eddie, who are visiting the Cleaver house, while Wally showers. Eddie changes Beaver's 'D minus' in math to 'B plus'. Later, Ward and June discover the card and are thrilled with the mark. Ward buys Beaver a new aircraft model he's wanted. June learns from Miss Landers Beaver actually received a 'D minus'. Beaver denies tampering with his report card, but his parents are disbelieving. Wally suspects what has happened and goes to see Eddie, who phones Ward with the truth. Ward promises to ban Eddie from the Cleaver house if he ever does something like that again. Beaver doesn't get to keep the model airplane, because of his poor grade.
