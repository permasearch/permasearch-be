TANF was scheduled for reauthorization again in 2010. However, Congress did not work on legislation to reauthorize the program and instead they extended the TANF block grant through September 30, 2011, as part of the Claims Resolution Act.[62] During this period Congress once again did not reauthorize the program but passed a three-month extension through December 31, 2011.
