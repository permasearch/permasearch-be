Bioactive GAs and abcisic acid levels have an inverse relationship and regulate seed development and germination.[44][45] Levels of FUS3, an Arabidopsis transcription factor, are upregulated by ABA and downregulated by GA, which suggests that there is a regulation loop that establishes the balance of GA and ABA.[46]
