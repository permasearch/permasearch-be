Explorers early realized that the waters around Newfoundland had the best fishing in the North Atlantic.[58][need quotation to verify] By 1620, 300 fishing boats worked the Grand Banks, employing some 10,000 sailors; many continuing to come from the Basque Country, Normandy, or Brittany. They dried and salted cod on the coast and sold it to Spain and Portugal. Heavy investment by Sir George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, in the 1620s in wharves, warehouses, and fishing stations failed to pay off. French raids hurt the business, and the weather was terrible, so he redirected his attention to his other colony in Maryland.[59] After Calvert left, small-scale entrepreneurs such as Sir David Kirke made good use of the facilities.[60] Kirke became the first governor of Newfoundland in 1638. A triangular trade with New England, the West Indies, and Europe gave Newfoundland an important economic role.[citation needed] By the 1670s there were 1700 permanent residents and another 4500 in the summer months.[61]
