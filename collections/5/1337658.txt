Hoult's ability to concentrate at the age of three when he attended to see his brother's play got him his first acting job in the play "The Caucasian Chalk Circle".[10] Hoult started attending auditions after that and got his first movie role at five in the drama Intimate Relations. After that he landed several guest appearances on TV shows such as Casualty, Silent Witness, The Bill and Doctors, among others. Hoult recalls he saw acting as a hobby rather than a possible profession at that age: "I wasn't in love with it, I just enjoyed it. It was like playing for a football team. When you got a part it was great. And meeting new people. It was an exciting new world."[10]
