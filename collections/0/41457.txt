The club was founded in 1993 by The Walt Disney Company as the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, a name based on the 1992 film The Mighty Ducks. Disney sold the franchise in 2005 to Henry and Susan Samueli, who along with General Manager Brian Burke, changed the name of the team to the Anaheim Ducks before the 2006–07 season. The Ducks have made the playoffs 13 times (and 10 times in the past 12 seasons) and won six Pacific Division titles (2006–07, 2012–13, 2013–14, 2014–15, 2015–16, and 2016–17), two Western Conference championships (2002–03 and 2006–07) and one Stanley Cup (2006–07).
