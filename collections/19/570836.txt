With the escape underway, Gretchen admits to Sara that she cannot continue on without help due to her injuries. Gretchen then asks her to choose, either to leave her behind or help her. Sara chooses to help Gretchen, however, as they run to the chapel, Gretchen is spotted by guards. She is asked if she's alone but Gretchen covers Sara's presence and stalls the guards. Though Sara is almost spotted by a guard, she manages to unlock the door and get into the chapel undetected. The guards are recalled and they take Gretchen. Sara picks up the necklace that Gretchen made for her daughter, Emily, presumably so she may pass it on to Emily later.
