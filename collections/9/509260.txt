Elizabeth City is home to the Museum of the Albemarle, the northeastern regional branch of the North Carolina Museum of History. The museum occupies a prominent location adjacent to the city's waterfront, and contains many permanent and revolving exhibits on the history and culture of the historic Albemarle region, of whose European colonization dates back to 1668, making the Albemarle the country's oldest inhabited area, second only to Jamestown and adjacent settlements in neighboring Virginia. Like all NC state-operated museums, admission is free.
