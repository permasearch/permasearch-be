Voters voted for up to 30% of the players on the ballot. If a player was named on less than 5% of the ballots for two consecutive years, they were dropped from the ballot. Players not elected could remain on the ballot indefinitely[9] (prior to 2007 the limit was 10 years, from 2007 to 2009 the limit was 15 years).[10]
