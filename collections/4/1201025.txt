During the disco era, men engaged in elaborate grooming rituals and spent time choosing fashion clothing, both activities that would have been considered "feminine" according to the gender stereotypes of the era.[75] Women dancers wore glitter makeup, sequins or gold lam√© clothing that would shimmer under the lights.[75] Bold colours were popular for both genders. Platform shoes and boots for both genders and high heels for women were popular footwear.[75] Necklaces and medallions were a common fashion accessory. Less commonly, some disco dancers wore outlandish costumes, dressed in drag, covered their bodies with gold or silver paint, or wore very skimpy outfits leaving them nearly nude; these uncommon get-ups were more likely to be seen at invitation-only New York City loft parties and disco clubs.[75]
