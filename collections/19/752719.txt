In both games, after a touchdown is scored, the scoring team may then attempt one play for additional points. In Canadian football, this play is called a convert, and in American football, it is formally called a try, although it is more commonly referred to as either a conversion, extra point, or point after touchdown (PAT).   The additional points may be earned through a kick or a play from scrimmage. If done via kick, the scoring team gains one point, and if done from a scrimmage, the scoring team gains two.[citation needed]
