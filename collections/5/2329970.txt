In "Aingavite Baa", Hightower gives Van Pelt and Rigsby an ultimatum: they can be in a relationship only if one of them leaves the unit. As they walk out of Hightower's office, Rigsby and Van Pelt say they love each other. Rigsby, after being in a shootout, tells Van Pelt he will get another job so they can be together. However, at the end of the episode, Grace breaks things off by saying she doesn't want the responsibility of making Rigsby leave the CBI. Rigsby pleads with her to talk it through, but Van Pelt simply says she knows herself and walks away, leaving him heartbroken. Van Pelt is later seen crying while walking into the office elevator.
