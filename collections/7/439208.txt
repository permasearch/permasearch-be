A vice-chairman or deputy chairman, subordinate to the chairman, is sometimes chosen to assist the chairman[30] and to serve as chairman in the absence of the chairman, or when a motion involving the chairman is being discussed.[31] In the absence of the chairman and vice chairman, groups sometimes elect a chairman pro tempore to fill the role for a single meeting.[32] In some organizations that have both titles, deputy chairman ranks higher than vice chairman, as there are often multiple vice chairs but only a single deputy chair.[33] This type of deputy chairman title on its own usually has only an advisory role and not an operational one (such as Ted Turner at Time Warner).[34]
