Westbrook has a younger brother, Byron Westbrook, who played defensive back at Salisbury University in Maryland and signed as an undrafted free agent with the Washington Redskins in 2007. Their cousin, Lawrence Westbrook, played basketball at the University of Minnesota.[9] His second cousin, Jamire Westbrook plays for the Miami University in Ohio football team as a runningback. Although it has been reported in various media biographies that Westbrook is the cousin of NBA player Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder, this is not the case. A July 2008 Daily Oklahoman article reported that Russell Westbrook said the two are not cousins.[10] On March 16, 2013, it was reported that Westbrook was experiencing memory loss.[11]
