Drew's character has been called intelligent, hardworking, thorough and determined by Grey's Anatomy executives.[13] But she is also considered vulnerable, insecure, sensitive and overly eager by her colleagues.[13] Of the character, Drew said: "April is a very, very good doctor. She really knows what she's doing, she's worked really hard, and she certainly wants to do her best and stick around."[2] but also described her as "annoying", "neurotic" and "really insecure".[14] In the eighth season, April's position as chief resident and her struggle to get a handle on her fellow residents formed the central arc of her storyline. Rhimes explained: "Watching April try to be in charge of Cristina and Alex and Jackson is a pretty impossible task, and it’s made for comedy, it’s one of the funniest things we’re working on this season."[15] One of Kepner's central characteristics is her religious belief, notably her chastity and her instance on saving herself for someone she truly loves.[16] In an interview, Drew assessed that: There certainly has never been a 28-year-old virgin on Grey’s. I don’t even think there’s been a 28-year-old virgin on television. Unless it’s someone who is sort of a recluse. A normal, smart, doctor….pretty, healthy…that in and of itself is really fascinating, and really interesting, and totally different. It’s neat to see someone who is just totally clueless in that area. Everyone else [On Grey' Anatomy] seems like they know exactly what they’re doing. April is totally, totally clueless. Shonda told one of the directors, there are virgins that have sort of done everything else. But not April. April’s really pretty much done nothing. She’s completely untouched."[17]
