The presidency was a largely ceremonial position.[13][25][26] There was no salary.[27] The primary role of the office was to preside over meetings of Congress, which entailed serving as an impartial moderator during debates.[28] When Congress would resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole to discuss important matters, the president would relinquish his chair to the chairman of the Committee of the Whole.[29]
