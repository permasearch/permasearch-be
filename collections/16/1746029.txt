During this year, GMC detached many options from packages in order for customers to save money. Additionally, the I6 engine received a small increase of 5 hp (3.7 kW). For the XL model, a new engine was introduced, a 5.3 Liter V8 with 290 hp (220 kW). Other notable changes included making front side-impact airbags previously standard on the 2002 model, optional, recreating the headlight switch to allow a Daytime Running Lamp (DRL) off switch, and also increasing the fuel tank to 22 US gallons (83 L). Articulating headrests are no longer available.
