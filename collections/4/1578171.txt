The band recorded several demo tapes, with Serletic as their producer.  Three radio stations in Orlando and Tampa added the songs to their rotations.  Executives at Atlantic Records noticed that the songs were being requested frequently.  Although the band sounded very green, executives thought the songs were good.[10]  The band was soon signed to Atlantic subsidiary Lava Records.[4]
