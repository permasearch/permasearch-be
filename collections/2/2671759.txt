The song's music video was directed by Jeffrey Doe and filmed live at the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. Lopez wears a silver party dress with white boots in the video.[22] On October 23, 2007, while pregnant, Lopez performed the song on the 5th season of the United States version of Dancing with the Stars. She performed the song at the San Remo Music Festival in 2010. Autistic young students at a Staten Island, New York school listened to "Let's Get Loud" every day, learning the dance moves and lyrics. The school wrote a letter to Lopez asking for an autograph or pictureâ€”instead Lopez showed up for the student's graduation for live performance of the song.[23]
