"I don't get it. Christ, I've known some of his crew for 20 fucking years and some of his crew used work for me. It's all good. No one would fuck with someone's show. It is ridiculous ... Well, of course, I felt the need to respond to the 'kick my ass remark.' Who wouldn't? Although I wish I had kept it backstage and kept the fans out of it. It is all 4th grade fight after school nonsense of which I have never dealt with on tour before. Co-headlining tours always go smooth because everything is cut 50/50 and I mean everything. No one fucks with anyone's show. It is even fucking Steven. I've done it co-headlining tours many times before and have had no troubles."[1]
