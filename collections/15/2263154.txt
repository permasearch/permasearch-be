A lifelong condition with periods of partial or full recovery in between recurrent episodes of relapse,[24][112] bipolar disorder is considered to be a major health problem worldwide because of the increased rates of disability and premature mortality.[112] It is also associated with co-occurring psychiatric and medical problems and high rates of initial under- or misdiagnosis, causing a delay in appropriate treatment interventions and contributing to poorer prognoses.[26] After a diagnosis is made, it remains difficult to achieve complete remission of all symptoms with the currently available psychiatric medications and symptoms often become progressively more severe over time.[78][113]
