Globally, symptomatic HAV infections are believed to occur in around 1.4 million people a year.[1] About 114 million infections (asymptomatic and symptomatic) occurred all together in 2015.[4] Acute hepatitis A resulted in 11,200 deaths in 2015.[5] Developed countries have low circulating levels of hepatovirus A, while developing countries have higher levels of circulation.[42] Most adolescents and adults in developing countries have already had the disease, thus are immune.[42] Adults in midlevel countries may be at risk of disease with the potential of being exposed.[42]
