After Independence in 1947, the functions of the Secretariat underwent major changes. A series of committees on economic, defence and intelligence matters were constituted under the Cabinet Secretariat. Most of the departments created after Independence functioned under the Cabinet Secretariat and were later on shifted to the respective ministries. The position holder is accountable for ensuring that the civil service is equipped with the skills and capability to meet the everyday challenges it faces and that civil servants work in a fair and decent environment. For nearly 25 years after independence of India, the post of the cabinet secretary was occupied by members of the erstwhile Indian Civil Service (ICS). All members of ICS were young since the upper age limit for joining was 24 years.
