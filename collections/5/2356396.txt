Some high-quality color printers and copiers steganographically embed their identification code into the printed pages, as fine and almost invisible patterns of yellow dots. Some sources identify Xerox and Canon as companies doing this.[9][10] The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has investigated this issue[11] and documented how the Xerox DocuColor printer's serial number, as well as the date and time of the printout, are encoded in a repeating 8Ã—15 dot pattern in the yellow channel. EFF is working to reverse engineer additional printers.[12] The EFF also reports that the US government has asked these companies to implement such a tracking scheme, so that counterfeiting can be traced. The EFF has filed a Freedom of Information Act request in order to look into privacy implications of this tracking.[13]
