This is a list of oil refineries. The Oil & Gas JournalÂ [1] also publishes a worldwide list of refineries annually in a country-by-country tabulation that includes for each refinery: location, crude oil daily processing capacity, and the size of each process unit in the refinery. For some countries, the refinery list is further categorized state-by-state. The list appears in one of their December issues. It is about 45 pages in length, and updated each year with additions, deletions, name changes, capacity changes and other refinements.
