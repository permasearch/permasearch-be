Grendel's body was eventually found by S.H.I.E.L.D. during the Vietnam War, who used its biomass to bond to a group of wounded soldiers and create a symbiote super-soldier program.[20] These symbiote-augmented super-soldiers were sent on black ops missions, unaware that they had also awakened Knull and reestablished his connection to the symbiote-dragon's offshoots. Slowly Knull began attempting to assert his influence over them. One member of the team, Rex Strickland, eventually left and became an Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. while others eventually fully succumbed to the primordial symbiote's control, going insane and ultimately being cryogenically frozen.[21]
