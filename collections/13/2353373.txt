In 2001, StarCraft: Ghost began development under Nihilistic Software,[61] with the aim of releasing the game for the Xbox, PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube during late 2003. Unlike previous real-time strategy StarCraft titles, Ghost was to be a tactical third-person action game. Although the press was positive about the video game console direction taken by Ghost,[62] the game was consistently delayed, and during the third quarter of 2004, Nihilistic Software discontinued their work with the project.[63] Blizzard stated that Nihilistic Software had completed the tasks it had been contracted for and that the game would be delivered on time.[64] The game was never released.
