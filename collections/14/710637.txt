The name of the promontory Spanish Head on the coast of the island is often thought to have arisen from the local tale of a ship of the Spanish Armada foundering in the area, though there is no evidence to suggest this actually occurred.[15] Folklore has further claimed that a tailless cat swam ashore from said shipwreck, and thus brought the trait to the island.[16] However, tailless cats are not commonly known in Spain, even if such a shipwreck were proven.
