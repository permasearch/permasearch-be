On August 10, 2015, Clinton filed her declaration, stating "I have directed that all my emails on clintonemail.com in my custody that were or potentially were federal records be provided to the Department of State", and that as a result of this directive, 55,000 pages of emails were produced to the Department on December 5, 2014.[242][243][244] She said in her statement that Abedin did have an email account through clintonemail.com that "was used at times for government business", but that Mills did not.[242][243][244] The statement was filed as Clinton faced questions over fifteen emails in exchanges with Blumenthal that were not among the emails she gave to the department the previous year. She did not address the matter of those emails in the statement.[243] On September 25, 2015, several additional emails from her private server[245] surfaced which she had not provided to the State Department.[245][246][247] These emails between Clinton and General David Petraeus, discussing personnel matters, were part of an email chain that started on a different email account before her tenure as Secretary of State,[245][246][247] but continued onto her private server in late January 2009 after she had taken office.[245][246][247] The existence of these emails also called into question Clinton's previous statement that she did not use the server before March 18, 2009.[248]
