The Sun is the Solar System's star and by far its most massive component. Its large mass (332,900 Earth masses)[47] produces temperatures and densities in its core high enough to sustain nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium, making it a main-sequence star.[48] This releases an enormous amount of energy, mostly radiated into space as electromagnetic radiation peaking in visible light.[49]
