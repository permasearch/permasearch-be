Gerard, out for revenge, abandons his team and takes Royce along while following up on a new lead. They track Sheridan to a loading dock, where he is stowing away on a freighter bound for Canada. Gerard confronts, fights and nearly kills Sheridan but lets his guard down, enabling Sheridan to get the upper hand. Royce unloads his Glock at Sheridan, hitting him in the shoulder, and the two men take him into custody.
