Kevin Tancharoen, the director of the short film, spent about $7,500 to produce it. Known for productions with a completely different appeal as dance film You Got Served and the musical Fame, Tancharoen took two months to produce everything. Filming took place in April 2010 over a period of two days, using borrowed cameras. Actor Matt Mullins already knew the director, but had not had an opportunity to work with him. A few months before filming Tancharoen called him, inviting him to participate in a short film he was planning to shoot. The script was sent to Mullins who, impressed with the text and the director's vision for the franchise, agreed to participate as Johnny Cage.[2][8][9]
