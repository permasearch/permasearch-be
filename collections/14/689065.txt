Skip Gaucher (who was well known locally for the psychedelic concerts he booked at Dania Hall on the West Bank) and his business partner/roommate, Tom Fineberg claim to have had the original inspiration for The Depot;[citation needed] however, this is heavily disputed by Danny Stevens.[2] Gaucher and Fineberg have made unsubstantiated claims that they were looking for a new venue for concerts when they spotted the abandoned bus depot. Danny Stevens has been cited as being the original developer of The Depot in numerous publications.[1][2] Stevens recognizes that Gaucher and Fineberg made several important bookings early at The Depot including the opening night act of Joe Cocker's Mad Dogs and the Englishmen as well as other acts like Poco.
