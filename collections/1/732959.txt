In a January 2010 speech, Marini supported calls in the church for a "reform of the reform" of liturgy. He said: "For some years now, several voices have been heard within church circles talking about the necessity of a new liturgical renewal," adding that a new renewal movement would be "capable of operating a reform of the reform, or rather, move one more step ahead in understanding the authentic spirit of the liturgy and its celebration."[5]
