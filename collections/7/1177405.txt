The winner of the men's singles event receives the Coupe des Mousquetaires, named after The Four Musketeers of French tennis: Jean Borotra, Jacques Brugnon, Henri Cochet, and Ren√© Lacoste.[3] The event was not held from 1915 to 1919 because of the First World War and was held unofficially under German occupation from 1941 to 1944, during the Second World War.[4]
