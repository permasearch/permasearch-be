The relationship between the New South Wales Government and Acciona Infrastructure â€“ the construction company delivering the line - has deteriorated. A media report from December 2016 claimed a dispute had arisen between the parties over costs incurred from modifications to the line's design.[33] Acciona commenced legal action against the government in April 2018. The company is seeking additional payments totalling $1.2 billion.[35] Later in the month ALTRAC told the government it was working towards a completion date of March 2020.[36]
