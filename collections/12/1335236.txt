Susan and Bilious travel to the land of the Tooth Fairy, which is created from children's beliefs. They discover that Mr. Teatime has 'killed' the Hogfather by placing the millions of collected teeth in a magic circle and using them to control the children, causing them to stop believing in the Hogfather. Mr. Teatime attacks Susan using Death's sword, but it is as powerless as its master in the Tooth Fairy's country, since children have no conception of Death. After throwing the Assassin off the tower, Susan clears the teeth away. She then rescues the Hogfather, who has returned to his former role as a pig-deity, from the Auditors, who have taken the form of hounds. Having experienced life and individuality, they cannot return to their original state and Death claims them by making them fall off a cliff.
