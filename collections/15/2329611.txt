The temple is located in Michael Nagar on Jessore Road, barely 2Â km away from the Kolkata Airport. Here, Bharat Mata (the Mother Land) is portrayed through the image of 'Jagattarini Durga'. This was inaugurated on October 19, 2015 (Mahashashti Day of Durga Puja that year)[18] by Shri Keshari Nath Tripathi, the Governor of West Bengal. The initiative to build the temple, which has been named 'Jatiya Shaktipeeth', was taken by the Spiritual Society of India in order to mark the 140th Anniversary of 'Vande Mataram', the hymn to the Mother Land.
