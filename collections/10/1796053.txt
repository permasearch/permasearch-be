The scope, extent and status of animals in ancient India is a subject of scholarly dispute. One group interprets ancient Hindu texts as supporting animal sacrifice. For example, according to Jha, cattle including cows were neither inviolable nor revered in the ancient times as they were later.[41] A Gryhasutra recommends that beef be eaten by the mourners, after a funeral ceremony as a ritual rite of passage.[42] According to Marvin Harris, the Vedic literature is contradictory, with some suggesting ritual slaughter and meat consumption, while others suggesting a taboo on meat eating.[43]
