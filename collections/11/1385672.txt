On December 14, 2010, Microsoft announced its intent to backport the Office File Validation feature to Office 2003 and Office 2007.[105][106] On April 12, 2011, Office File Validation was backported as an add-in for Office 2003 SP3 and Office 2007 SP2, and was later made available through Microsoft Update on June 28, 2011.[107] Office File Validation in Office 2003 and Office 2007 differs from the version in Office 2010 as these two releases do not include the Protected View feature. When users attempt to open a document that fails validation, they must first agree to a warning prompt before it can be opened.[107] Additionally, the configuration options in these two releases are only made available through the Windows Registry,[108] whereas Office 2010 also provides Group Policy options.[102]
