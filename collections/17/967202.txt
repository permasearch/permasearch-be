They've also set the world record for largest gathering of people with selfie sticks.[27] In 2009, the Angels were voted the number one franchise in professional sports in Fan Value by ESPN magazine.[28] In 2011, ESPN & Fan polls by ESPN ranked the Angels #4 in the best sports franchises, ahead of every Major League team in baseball at #1 and also making it the #1 sports franchise in Los Angeles. The rankings were determined through a combination of sports analysts and fan votes ranking all sports franchises by a combination of average fan attendance, fan relations, "Bang for your Buck" or winning percentage over the past 3Â years, ownership, affordability, stadium experience, players effort on the field and likability, coaching, and "Title Track".
