Worldwide, about 3,500 heart transplants are performed annually. The vast majority of these are performed in the United States (2,000â€“2,300 annually).[1] Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, currently is the largest heart transplant center in the world, having performed 132 adult transplants in 2015[25] alone. About 800,000 people have NYHA Class IV heart failure symptoms indicating advanced heart failure.[26] The great disparity between the number of patients needing transplants and the number of procedures being performed spurred research into the transplantation of non-human hearts into humans after 1993. Xenografts from other species and artificial hearts are two less successful alternatives to allografts.[2]
