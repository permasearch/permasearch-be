In some programming languages, it is possible to group the digits in the program's source code to make it easier to read; see Integer literal: Digit separators. Ada, D, Rust, Swift, Java, OCaml, Perl, Python (from version 3.6) C# (from version 7.0) and Ruby use the underscore (_) character for this purpose. All these languages allow seven hundred million to be entered as 700_000_000. Fixed-form Fortran ignores whitespace (in all contexts), so 700 000 000 is permissible. C++14 allows the use of an apostrophe for digit grouping, so 700'000'000 is permissible.
