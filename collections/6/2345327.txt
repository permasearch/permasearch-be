Although similar to the original, the version on Rhino's 1983 The Best of Louie, Louie compilation[10] is actually a note-for-note re-recording created because licensing could not be obtained for Berry's 1957 version.[11] The original version was not released on CD until the Ace Records Love That Louie compilation in 2002.
