When Mulan was released in China, Hong Kong actor Jackie Chan was hired to dub the voice of Shang and record "I'll Make a Man Out of You" in Mandarin and Cantonese.[52] The special edition DVD release of Mulan features a music video of Chan performing the song. The video also depicts Chan performing martial arts-inspired choreography. Positively received, Scott Chitwood of ComingSoon.net called Chan's rendition "a fun addition for Chan fans,"[43] while Nancy Churnin of The Dallas Morning News wrote that he performed the song "very ably."[53] Mexican singer Cristian Castro, who voiced Shang in the film's Latin American release,[54] recorded "I'll Make a Man Out of You" in Spanish, titled "Hombres de Acción serán hoy".[55][56]
