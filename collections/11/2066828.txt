Regarding the temporalis muscle: in English, this muscle’s name is the time muscle. The word temporalis comes from the Latin word tempus meaning “time.” The muscle covers the temporal bone, or time bone, which received its name because the hair of the head covering this bone is often the first hair to turn gray during the aging process. Therefore, this region is the first to show the effects of aging.[1]
