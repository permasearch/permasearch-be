As implemented on the mechanical typewriter, the keyboard contained a single dead key, with the acute accent ( ´ ) in the lower-case position, and the dieresis ( ¨ ) in the upper-case position. With these, one could write á, é, í, ó, ú, and ü. A separate key provided ñ/Ñ. (A dead key "~" is used on the Spanish and Portuguese keyboards, but on the Latin American keyboard the "~" is not a dead key). The inverted marks "¿" and "¡" completed the required minimum. When an additional key was added to electro-mechanical typewriters, this was used for "ª" and "º", though these are not required. (They are somewhat archaic ordinal abbreviations: "1º" for primero, "2ª" for segunda, etc.)
