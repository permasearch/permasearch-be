It was not until Sunday morning, the 31st of October, that a meeting occurred between the operators of the plants, and the town officials. Burgess Chambon requested the plants temporarily cease operations. The superintendent of the plants, L.J. Westhaver, said the plants had already begun shutting down operation at around 6 a.m. that morning. With the rain alleviating the smog, the plants resumed normal operation the following morning.
