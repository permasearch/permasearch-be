The anchoring effect has been demonstrated by a wide variety of experiments both in laboratories and in the real world.[32][34] It remains when the subjects are offered money as an incentive to be accurate, or when they are explicitly told not to base their judgment on the anchor.[34] The effect is stronger when people have to make their judgments quickly.[35] Subjects in these experiments lack introspective awareness of the heuristic, denying that the anchor affected their estimates.[35]
