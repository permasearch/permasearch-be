Not attaching Nathan to a specific love interest immediately allows for the writers to slowly integrate him into the canvas.[7] Soaps In Depth reported that Nathan's isn't just some "run-of-the-mill" cop, but "He's on a mission to stir things up for a few people!"[16] It is soon revealed that Nathan is in town investigating his estranged brother-in-law Silas Clay (Michael Easton) in the attempted murder of his comatose sister Nina. However, Silas's former mistress Ava Jerome (Maura West) is also at the top of the suspect list.[27] In 2014, legendary actress Donna Mills, known for her portrayal of Abby Cunningham on the prime time soap, Knots Landing was cast in the role of Madeline Reeves—Nathan's mother. It is revealed that Madeline raised Nathan to believe Silas was guilty and he is working on her behalf to lock Silas up for Nina's condition.[28] Despite acting to avenge his sister, Nathan tolerates Madeline's disdain for his career choice because she thinks it is "below them."[22] Nathan partners up with Silas and his girlfriend Sam McCall (Kelly Monaco) to set a trap for Ava believing she is guilty. However, the sting operation doesn't go as planned when Madeline is revealed to be the culprit—and Nathan is forced to arrest her.[2]
