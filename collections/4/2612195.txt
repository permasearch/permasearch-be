The ministries of the Sisters of Charity have been quite varied in nature from the beginning of their founding. From ministering in prisons to managing hospitals and acting to conserve environments, they have been quick to move to where they have been most needed, and to where they have been of the greatest service to the poor. One of their most prominent ministries has been the establishment of St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney in 1857, which they have administered ever since.
