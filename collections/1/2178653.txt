In the commercial system, customers purchase (or lease) a fraction of an aircraft, alongside numerous, anonymous other individuals. Depending on the company, the aircraft may be split into 16ths or even 32nds of a fractional share. These fractions translate to a number of hours per year, with a full 100% share typically equating to 800 annual hours of usage. Most shares are sold at the 1/16 (50 hours) or 1/8 (100 hours) level.
