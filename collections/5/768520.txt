After providing her voice for Walt Disney Pictures' animated comedy film Underdog (2007), Adams starred as a highly optimistic and joyous Disney Princess named Giselle in the musical romantic comedy Enchanted.[7][41] She was among 250 actresses who auditioned for the high-profile part; the studio favored the casting of a bigger star, but the director Kevin Lima insisted on Adams due to her commitment to the part and her ability to not be judgemental about her personality.[42] Patrick Dempsey and James Marsden featured as her romantic interests. A ballgown that she had to wear for the film weighed 45 pounds, and Adams fell several times under its weight.[43] She also sang three songs for the film's soundtrackâ€”"True Love's Kiss", "Happy Working Song", and "That's How You Know".[44] The critic Roger Ebert commended Adams for being "fresh and winning" in a role that "absolutely depends on effortless lovability", and Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe wrote that she "demonstrates a real performer's ingenuity for comic timing and physical eloquence".[45][46] Todd McCarthy considered the role to be Adams' breakthrough and compared her rise to stardom to that of Julie Andrews.[47] Enchanted was a commercial success, grossing over $340 million worldwide.[48] Adams received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical.[49]
