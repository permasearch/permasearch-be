Berghain night club in Berlin, famed for its no-holds-barred revelry and 24 hour opening policy, is considered by many to be the "world capital" of techno.[188] Other notable Berlin venues include Tresor and Watergate. In the United Kingdom Glasgow's Sub Club has been associated with techno since the early 1990s and clubs such as London's Fabric and Egg London have gained notoriety for supporting techno.[189][190]
