While unusual and somewhat ironic, a variety of football players have managed to injure themselves during celebration: examples include Paulo Diogo (who severed a finger after it got caught in a fence), Thierry Henry, Zlatan Ibrahimović, Fabián Espíndola,[133] (who celebrated a goal that was later disallowed due to offside) and Michy Batshuayi.[134] An Indian footballer, Peter Biaksangzuala, died from a spine injury in 2014 following a failed somersault celebration.[135]
