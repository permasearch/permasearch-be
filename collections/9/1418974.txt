DirecTV also offers local channels like CBS, ABC, NBC, Fox, PBS, The CW, Telemundo, Azteca, Univision, ION Television (in markets that carry that network), and some independent stations in markets covering over 99.2% of U.S. TV households.[97] In markets that lack an OTA CW affiliate, DirecTV offers WKBD-TV from Detroit or KTLA from Los Angeles. Because DirecTV does not carry local digital subchannels, however, broadcast networks such as MeTV and Antenna TV are not available on DirecTV in most markets.
