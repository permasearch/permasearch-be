In the early 1990s, Capcom produced a video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System titled The California Raisins: The Grape Escape,[9] in which the player controlled a California Raisin through five side-scrolling levels battling various evil fruit and vegetable characters that have stolen the Raisins' music. The game was completed and several video game critics reviewed it, but it was never released on the open market.
