In his last regular season game ever at Citi Field on May 28, Mariano Rivera was honored by Mets owner Jeff Wilpon and threw out the first pitch of the game to former Met closer John Franco. Young Mets phenom Matt Harvey, who grew up a Yankee fan, had an impressive line – 8IP 6H 1ER 0BB 10K – but left with a 1-0 deficit. Rivera would come into the game in the bottom of the 9th and promptly give up a double to Mets second baseman Daniel Murphy. David Wright would get another hit to drive in Murphy and contribute to Rivera's first blown save of the year. The next batter Lucas Duda would get the game-winning hit off Rivera to gave him the first blown save of his career where he did not record at least one out. The Mets swept the season series for the first time in 2013. That July, Robinson Canó of the Yankees and David Wright of the Mets are named captains for the All-Star Game home run derby at Citi Field. In December, the Mets agreed to terms with outfielder Curtis Granderson on a four-year contract worth $60 million on December 6, 2013.[36] Granderson played for the Yankees from 2010 to 2013. "A lot of the people I've met in New York have always said that, 'True New Yorkers are Mets fans,'" said Granderson during a press conference making the deal official. "So I'm excited to get a chance to see them all out there." Around the same time, the Yankees agreed to sign Carlos Beltrán, who was a Met from 2005 to 2011.
