When Shadow refuses to participate, Amy pleads for his help, reminding him of Maria's real request: for him to help mankind. Shadow catches up with Sonic and Knuckles in the core and they encounter the Biolizard, a prototype Ultimate Life Form. Shadow repels it, allowing Knuckles to deactivate the Chaos Emeralds with the Master Emerald. The Biolizard uses Chaos Control to fuse with the cannon, becoming the Finalhazard and continuing the ARK's collision course.
