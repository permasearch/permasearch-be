Young people in the U.S. are no more sexually active than individuals in other developed countries, but they are significantly less knowledgeable about contraception and safe sex practices.[58] As of 2006, only twenty states required sex education in schools - of these, only ten required information about contraception.[58] On the whole, less than 10% of American students receive sex education that includes topical coverage of abortion, homosexuality, relationships, pregnancy, and STI prevention.[58] Abstinence-only education was used throughout much of the United States in the 1990s and early 2000s.[58] Based upon the moral principle that sex outside of marriage is unacceptable, the programs often misled students about their rights to have sex, the consequences, and prevention of pregnancy and STIs.[58]
