As the Odyssey was discontinued Magnavox released the first successive dedicated consoles—consoles that could only play games built into the system—in the Magnavox Odyssey series, the Odyssey 100 and Odyssey 200, as part of the first generation of video game consoles; the Odyssey 100 was only capable of playing the ping pong and hockey games from the original Odyssey.[15] Eleven dedicated Odyssey consoles were produced before a true follow-up console in 1978, the Magnavox Odyssey².[2]
