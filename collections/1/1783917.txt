After a poor start to qualifying for Euro 2004, McCarthy was replaced by Brian Kerr, but he too struggled to guide the side to the tournament or the subsequent 2006 World Cup in Germany, and was ultimately sacked in October 2005.[27][28] Kerr was replaced by Steve Staunton (assisted by Bobby Robson in the position of "international football consultant") in January 2006.[29] Under Staunton, results varied widely but the team still failed to qualify for Euro 2008 and Staunton lost the position in October 2007.[30] His reign included a humiliating 5â€“2 defeat to Cyprus during the qualifiers' Group D, one of the worst defeats in the team's history.[31]
