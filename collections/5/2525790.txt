The Didache basically describes the same ritual as the one that took place in Corinth.[45] As with Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians, the Didache confirms that the Lord's supper was literally a meal, probably taking place in a "house church."[46] The order of cup and bread differs both from present-day Christian practice and from that in the New Testament accounts of the Last Supper,[47] of which, again unlike almost all present-day Eucharistic celebrations, the Didache makes no mention. Scholars once traced the Eucharistic prayers back to Jesus' words at the Last Supper, but contemporary scholars emphasize Jewish and gentile sources instead.[46]
