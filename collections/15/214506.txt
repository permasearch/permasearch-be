Hong Kong was under the jurisdiction of the British but came under the control of the Japanese after the gruelling Battle of Hong Kong drew to a close on Christmas Day of 1941. The Japanese turned many healthcare facilities into field hospitals to help injured soldiers returning from the Pacific theater[38]. Strict food rations were also enforced and to keep the rations low many citizens were deported to China. By the end of the war Hong Kong's population had fallen form 1,500,000 to a mere 600,000. The territory was liberated in 1945.
