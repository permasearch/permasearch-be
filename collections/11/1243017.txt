After the Six-Day War in 1967, in which Israel gained control of Hebron, the first Jew who entered the Cave of Machpelah for about 700 years, was the Chief Rabbi of the Israel Defense Forces, Major general Rabbi Shlomo Goren. "About 700 years ago, the Muslim Mamelukes conquered Hebron, declared the structure a mosque and forbade entry to Jews, who were not allowed past the seventh step on a staircase outside the building."[24] Other sources, including the Jerusalem Post, say that the first Jew to enter the Cave after the Six-Day War had been Michal Arbel, the 13-year old daughter of Yehuda Arbel, chief of Shin Bet operations in the West Bank, because she was slender enough to be lowered into the narrow, 28 centimetres (11Â in) wide hole on October 9, 1968, to gain access to the tomb site, after which she took photographs.[25] Following the 1929 Hebron massacre, this restricted access was even more restricted by British Mandate authorities.[citation needed] After Israeli statehood in 1948 and the  Jordanian annexation of the West Bank, no Jews were allowed anywhere in the territory. Following the Israeli occupation of Hebron in the Six-Day War, the area came under Jewish authority for the first time in 2,000 years and the 700-year-long restriction limiting Jews to the seventh step outside was lifted.[24] Jews immediately began re-settling in the city after the Six-Day War. The first subsequent Jewish wedding ceremony took place on August 7, 1968.[26]
