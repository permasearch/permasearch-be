The season began with two consecutive road losses. Despite taking a 31-24 lead late in the fourth quarter against the Rams, a defensive breakdown allowed a touchdown by the Rams in the final minute, and the Rams prevailed in overtime 34-31. The following week, the Seahawks traveled to Green Bay to face the Packers, and lost 27-17, their first loss by double digits in 59 regular season games (67 games including the postseason). However, the team would right the ship with two straight wins against the hapless Chicago Bears and the Detroit Lions on Monday Night - the latter win ending controversially when a last-second play by Lions received Calvin Johnson was fumbled at the 1-yard line and linebacker KJ Wright batted the ball out of the back of the end zone for a safety. Although this could have been ruled a penalty against the Seahawks which would have given possession to the Lions at the 1/2-yard line, no penalty was called.[25]
