NoClue is a Hip Hop artist influenced by West Coast Hip Hop. He has established himself as a multi-dimensional lyricist with sharp, upbeat energy expressed in each of his songs. Brown counts rapper Tupac Shakur as an early musical influence. He explains that his stage name NoClue is derived from “the fact that the world had no clue what kind of impact he was about to bring”.[2]
