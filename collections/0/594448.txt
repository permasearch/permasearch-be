In 2008, there were talks about incorporating the villages of Graniteville, Vaucluse, and Warrenville; as a result, the towns approved a referendum to vote on whether or not to incorporate.[3] If approved, the municipality would have had an area of around 20 square miles (52Â km2).[4] The referendum was defeated by a two-to-one margin in August 2008.
