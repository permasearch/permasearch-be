Classical texts have little to say about women and the Roman army. Emperor Augustus (reigned 27 BCâ€“AD 14) disallowed marriage by ordinary soldiers, a ban that lasted nearly two centuries. However it has been suggested since the 1980s, that wives and children of centurions lived with them at border and provincial forts.[129] In the early 1990s, shoes in women's and children's sizes were found at Vindolanda[130] (site of a Roman fort on Hadrian's wall in northern England), along with bronze plaques, awarded to provincial soldiers whose 25 years of service earned them Roman citizenship, that mention their wives and children. Likewise, in Germany, further evidence of this practice was discovered in the form of brooches and shoes. Trajan's Column depicts six women amongst the soldiers who are attendants holding sacrificial offerings at a military religious ceremony.[131]
