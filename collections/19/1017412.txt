Notable MLB draft busts include Steve Chilcott (1966) and Brien Taylor (1991), two 1st overall draft picks who never reached the majors, as well as Matt Bush (2004), another 1st overall pick as a position player who dealt with legal troubles culminating in incarceration and waited nearly 12 years to make the major leagues, as a middle relief pitcher in 2016. A player like outfielder Josh Hamilton (1999) can also be considered a draft bust before unexpectedly turning their career around.
