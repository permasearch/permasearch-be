The line that Luce said to Daniel in the Fallen book (First Fallen novel book) but now it is Daniel who says to Luce..."You justâ€”you look so familiar. I could have sworn we've met somewhere before." It's always that line that begins everything. And at that moment, Luce's and Daniel's angel friends (whom they don't remember now) Arriane, Roland, Annabelle, Miles and Shelby are watching them from above.
