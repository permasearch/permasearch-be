A "Perfect Day" (a phrase created by the school's football announcer Pete Arbogast) to any USC fan is a USC win coupled with losses by UCLA and Notre Dame.[46] There have been 62 â€œPerfect Days" since the first one occurred in 1921. Perfect days have been possible since 1919, when UCLA began playing football.
