In Israel, Christian Arabs are one of the most educated groups. Maariv has described the Christian Arab sectors as "the most successful in education system",[101] since Christian Arabs fared the best in terms of education in comparison to any other group receiving an education in Israel.[102] and they have attained a bachelor's degree and academic degree more than the median Israeli population.[102]
