In May 2005, Cadbury Schweppes (latterly Cadbury plc) bought Green & Black's for an undisclosed sum, estimated to be around Â£20m. Cadbury pledged to run the company as a separate business. Green & Black's Australia chocolate announced that it would convert 90% of its range to Fairtrade by the end of 2010, and its entire range by 2011.[4] In August 2017 the Company launched its first product line, the Velvet Edition, which is neither Fair Trade nor Organic.[5]
