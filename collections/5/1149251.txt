During the glacial maximum period, 68000 to 8000 BC, Eastern Arabia is thought to have been uninhabitable. Finds from the stone age Arabian Bifacial and Ubaid cultures (including stone arrow and axe heads as well as Ubaid pottery) show human habitation in the area from 5000 to 3100 BC. The Hafit era, producing distinctive burial sites as well as finds of Jamdat Nasr pottery, stretched from 3100 to 2500 BC.
