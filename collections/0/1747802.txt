"The Grateful Dead were beautiful. They did at top volume what Shankar had done softly. They played pure music, some of the best music of the concert. I have never heard anything in music that could be said to be qualitatively better than the performance of The Dead, Sunday night." â€“ Michael Lydon, author of Flashbacks (2003)
