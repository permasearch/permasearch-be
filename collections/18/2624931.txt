With the pregnancy storyline over, Lita returned to the women's division in November 2004. She began a feud with Trish Stratus, who had constantly degraded her during her pregnancy storyline. When Stratus referred to her as "chubby" because of her weight gain, she retaliated by attacking Stratus backstage due to no longer carrying a child. Lita challenged Stratus to a Women's Championship match at Survivor Series, however, due to the months of humiliation and being verbally berated by Stratus, Lita was more concerned with doing as much damage as possible, leading to her disqualification.[35] The feud continued, and on December 6, Lita defeated Stratus in the main event of Raw to win her second WWE Women's Championship.[35][36] During the course of the match, Lita botched a suicide dive to the outside when she over rotated by a fraction, barely escaping serious injury.[36] This move was later used in the buildup to the title rematch she was booked for at New Year's Revolution against Stratus, who claimed, "Lita had to practically kill herself, just to beat me". However, Lita's title reign that was supposed to gain more momentum and length came to a short end almost a month later when Stratus defeated Lita on January 9, 2005, at New Year's Revolution.[37] In the course of the match, Lita tore her left ACL after executing a Thesz press off the ring apron, which left her unable to properly continue the match and led to a rushed finish.[2][38]
