Pictland had previously been described by Roman writers and geographers as the home of the Caledonii.[11] These Romans also used other names to refer to tribes living in that area, including Verturiones, Taexali and Venicones.[12] But they may have heard these other names only second- or third-hand, from speakers of Brittonic or Gaulish languages, who may have used different names for the same group or groups.[13]
