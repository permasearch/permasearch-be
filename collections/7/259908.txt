Nani has been receiving a lot of bills for Stitch's destruction, so she gets Lilo to try and train him to be more civilized (otherwise he would be thrown out of the ʻohana). When Lilo's attempts prove to be unsuccessful Stitch decides to leave and ends up being kidnapped by Dr. Hämsterviel, who plans to turn him evil again. Lilo, Jumba and Pleakley must now rescue him before it's too late. No new experiments appear in this episode.
