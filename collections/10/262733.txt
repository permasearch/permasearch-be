Beginning with the first regular series episode "The Man Trap", the department colors were slightly altered from the pilot versions: command and helm personnel wear gold shirts; operations, engineering and security personnel wear red; and science and medical personnel wear blue, all with black collars and undershirts.[notes 1] The crew wore a triangular assignment patch that identified them as being with the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701) (with slight variations based on their department). Personnel from other Starfleet vessels or Starfleet Command wore different assignment patches. Certain operations and engineering personnel wore red jumpsuits with black undershirts. The frequent death of red-uniformed security officers led to the coining of the popular term "redshirt". The most commonly used Command Section shirts ("tunics") were actually olive-green in color, but they appeared to be a golden-yellow color called "tenne" both under the lights used on the set and in the post-development film stock. In later series, the gold color was "canonized" in dialog. However, some uniforms – the alternate tunics worn by Captain Kirk, and the Command Section dress uniforms – were made of a different material which, while the same color, showed up as olive-green even under the lights and when photographed.[3][4][notes 2] The "green" tunics (seen in TOS: "The Trouble with Tribbles", "Charlie X" and "The Immunity Syndrome") may have the rank stripes on the sleeves or on the collar (TOS: "The Enemy Within"), and always feature the Enterprise assignment patch near the waist as a belt fastener. The differently colored tunics were worn with dark gray trousers — which appeared black on camera[5] — for the men. Miniskirt length dresses (of the same materials and colors as the tunics) with dark tights were worn by the women. Black boots were worn by both sexes. Nichelle Nichols did not believe that the miniskirts were unusually short or revealing:
