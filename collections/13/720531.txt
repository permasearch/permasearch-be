Only palliative care can be offered,[8] as there are no medications which will modify the course of the disease.[12] No medications for DLB are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration as of  2017[update],[7] although donepezil is licensed in Japan for the treatment of DLB.[44] Management can be challenging because of the need to balance treatment of cognitive dysfunction, neuropsychiatric features, impairments related to the motor system,[4] and other nonmotor symptoms.[1] A multidisciplinary approach, going beyond early and accurate diagnosis to include educating and supporting the caregivers, is favored by the 2017Â DLB Consortium.[1]
