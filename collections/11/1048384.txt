Shooting also took place in Iceland, where Nolan had previously filmed scenes for Batman Begins (2005).[33] The location was chosen to represent two extraterrestrial planets: one covered in ice, and the other covered in water.[4] The crew transported mock spaceships weighing about 10,000 pounds (4,500 kg) to the country.[11] They spent two weeks shooting there,[26] during which a crew of approximately 350 people, including 130 locals, worked on the film. Locations included the Svínafellsjökull glacier and the town of Klaustur.[34][35] While filming a water scene in Iceland, Hathaway almost suffered hypothermia because the dry suit she was wearing had not been properly secured.[11]
