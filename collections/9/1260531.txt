In March 2015, the TRAI released a formal consultation paper on Regulatory Framework for Over-the-top (OTT) services, seeking comments from the public. The consultation paper was criticised for being one sided and having confusing statements. It was condemned by various politicians and internet users.[66][67][68] By 18 April 2015, over 800,000 emails had been sent to TRAI demanding net neutrality.[68][69][70]
