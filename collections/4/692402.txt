Set in Miami, the series details the surprising and unforeseen events that take place in the life of Jane Gloriana Villanueva, a hard-working, religious young Venezuelan American woman whose family tradition and a vow to save her virginity until her marriage to her detective boyfriend are complicated when a doctor mistakenly artificially inseminates her during a checkup. To make matters worse, the biological donor is a married man, a former playboy and cancer survivor who is not only the new owner of the hotel where Jane works, but was also her former teenage crush. In addition to adjusting to pregnancy and then motherhood, in the initial episodes Jane is faced with questions about her professional future and the daunting prospect of choosing between the father of her baby or her boyfriend. As the series evolves, in predictably unpredictable telenovela fashion, the issues shift as her child grows into a toddler, her writing career moves forward, and her family members likewise develop independent plotlines.
