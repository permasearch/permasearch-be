A high volcanic cone with a single central vent formed before the 1815 eruption, which follows a stratovolcano shape.[14] The diameter at the base is 60 km (37 mi).[6] The volcano frequently erupted lava, which descended over steep slopes.[14] Tambora has produced trachybasalt and trachyandesite rocks which are moderately rich in potassium. The volcanites contain phenocrysts of apatite, biotite,clinopyroxene, leucite, magnetite, olivine and plagioclase, although the exact composition of the phenocrysts varies between different rock types.[15] The magma involved in the 1815 eruption originated in the mantle and was further modified by melts derived from subducted sediments, fluids derived from the subducted crust and crystallization processes in magma chambers.[16]
