As the chronology of deglaciation in the interior and coastal regions of North America became better understood, the coastal migration hypothesis was advanced by Knute Fladmark as an alternative to the ice-free corridor hypothesis.[69] Debate on coastal versus interior migration for initial settlement has centered on evidence for chronology of initial settlement of Beringia,[16][31] interior North America,[8] the Pacific coast of the Americas,[29] and timing of the opening of coastal versus interior migration routes indicated by geological evidence.[8][10] Complicating the debate has been the absence of archaeological data from the coastal and interior migration routes from the periods when the initial migration is proposed to have occurred. A recent variation of the coastal migration hypothesis is the marine migration hypothesis, which proposes that migrants with boats settled in coastal refugia during deglaciation of the coast.[19][20] The proposed use of boats adds a measure of flexibility to the chronology of coastal migration, as a continuous ice-free coast (16k-15k cal years BP) would no longer be required. A coastal east Asian source population is integral to the marine migration hypothesis.[19][20]
