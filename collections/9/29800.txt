Capra had filmed a number of sequences that were subsequently cut, the only remnants remaining being rare stills that have been unearthed.[41] A number of alternative endings were considered, with Capra's first script having Bailey falling to his knees reciting "The Lord's Prayer" (the script also called for an opening scene with the townspeople in prayer). Feeling that an overly religious tone did not have the emotional impact of the family and friends rushing to rescue George Bailey, the closing scenes were rewritten.[42][43][44]
