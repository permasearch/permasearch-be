Saunders Lewis (1893 â€“ 1985), the noted Welsh language poet, novelist, dramatist, and nationalist, rejected the possibility of Anglo-Welsh literature, because of its use of English, the language of the British colonialists, affirming that '"the literature which people called Anglo-Welsh was indistinguishable from English literature".[63] Saunders Lewis was himself born in Wallasey in England to a Welsh-speaking family.
