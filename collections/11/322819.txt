Stanford Memorial Church, throughout its history, has been served by chaplains who have been influential amongst the Stanford University student body and community at large. R. Heber Newton, "distinguished writer"[37] and former rector at All Souls Church in New York, was handpicked by Jane Stanford to serve as the church's first pastor; he resigned after four months in 1903 "because he disagreed with Mrs. Stanford on some aspects of church management".[38] According to Stanford biographer Robert W. P. Cutler, "Newton's tenure had been a disappointment to Mrs. Stanford".[39] David Charles Gardner, who replaced Newton, served the church from 1902 to his retirement in 1936.[40] Stanford also handpicked Gardner as Newton's assistant because she was impressed with his "parish work" in Palo Alto.[37] Gardner went on to teach courses in Biblical history and literature at Stanford.[40] Influential English professor and Stanford historian Edith Mirrielees[41] called Gardner "a preacher of only indifferent ability", but considered him "a strength to the whole university". According to her he was the prime mover behind the creation of the Stanford Home for Convalescent Children,[42] established in 1919, which eventually became the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.
