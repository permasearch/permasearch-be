In terms of journalism in France, the regional press (see list of newspapers in France) has become more important than national dailies (such as Le Monde and Le Figaro) over the past century: in 1939, national dailies were 2/3 of the dailies market, while today they are less than 1/4.[43]  The magazine market is currently dominated by TV listings magazines[44] followed by news magazines such as L'Obs, L'Express and Le Point.
