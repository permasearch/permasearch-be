Brown was taken in the first round of the 1957 NFL draft by the Cleveland Browns, the sixth overall selection.[10] In the ninth game of his rookie season, against the Los Angeles Rams he rushed for 237 yards,[11] setting an NFL single-game record that stood unsurpassed for 14 years[a] and a rookie record that remained for 40 years. After only nine years in the NFL, he departed as the league's record holder for both single-season (1,863 in 1963) and career rushing (12,312 yards), as well as the all-time leader in rushing touchdowns (106), total touchdowns (126), and all-purpose yards (15,549). He was the first player ever to reach the 100-rushing-touchdowns milestone, and only a few others have done so since, despite the league's expansion to a 16-game season in 1978 (Brown's first four seasons were only 12 games, and his last five were 14 games).
