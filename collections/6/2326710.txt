The case study method is a key component of the academic program at IBS, which is one of the few institutions in India that has made case studies a critical component of its curriculum. Almost all the courses at IBS are taught 100% through case studies - the case studies being tailor-made to the requirements of different subject areas and topics. Student evaluation is based on class participation and written reports. Students are encouraged to analyse the issues in-depth by gathering supporting information - either through published sources or by directly interacting with the companies involved.IBS Hyderabad gives special emphasis on the case based pedagogy and teachers pitch in as facilitators of class-room discussion.
