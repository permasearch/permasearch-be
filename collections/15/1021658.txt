Reggae is played in 4 4 time because the symmetrical rhythmic pattern does not lend itself to other time signatures such as 3 4. One of the most easily recognizable elements is offbeat rhythms; staccato chords played by a guitar or piano (or both) on the offbeats of the measure, often referred to as the skank.[44]
