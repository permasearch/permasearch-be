After a 2–1 win over defending champions Spain, Croatia topped Group D and went on to face Portugal in the next round. Croatia, however, lost 1–0 after Portugal's Ricardo Quaresma scored an 117th-minute, extra time winner to send Croatia out of the tournament. Rakitić later insisted that Croatia did not deserve to go out and the best team were going home.[67] Rakitić appeared in all of Croatia's matches and ended the tournament by scoring one goal.
