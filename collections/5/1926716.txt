Deere lived in the house for six years until his death in 1886. His body lay in repose in the front parlor where thousands of mourners paid their respects.[3] His widow, Lucenia, lived in the house two more years before her death in 1888. The house remained in the Deere family until 1933, when it was sold to a banker.
