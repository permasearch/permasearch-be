Mitochondria are commonly between 0.75 and 3 μm in diameter[5] but vary considerably in size and structure. Unless specifically stained, they are not visible. In addition to supplying cellular energy, mitochondria are involved in other tasks, such as signaling, cellular differentiation, and cell death, as well as maintaining control of the cell cycle and cell growth.[6] Mitochondrial biogenesis is in turn temporally coordinated with these cellular processes.[7][8] Mitochondria have been implicated in several human diseases, including mitochondrial disorders,[9] cardiac dysfunction,[10] heart failure[11] and autism.[12]
