"France could fight its own battles and also send some immediate reinforcements to Belgium, but only if it was known for sure that a British Expeditionary Force was on the way.

Such action would mean conceding to Germany potential air bases, and facilities for air raids against England, to which we could scarcely be indifferent."[166]
