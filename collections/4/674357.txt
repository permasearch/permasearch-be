Demonstrations against the Shah commenced in October 1977, developing into a campaign of civil resistance that included both secular and religious elements[11][12][13] and which intensified in January 1978.[14] Between August and December 1978, strikes and demonstrations paralyzed the country. The Shah left Iran for exile on 16 January 1979, as the last Persian monarch, leaving his duties to a regency council and Shapour Bakhtiar who was an opposition-based prime minister. Ayatollah Khomeini was invited back to Iran by the government,[15][16] and returned to Tehran to a greeting by several million Iranians.[17] The royal reign collapsed shortly after on 11 February when guerrillas and rebel troops overwhelmed troops loyal to the Shah in armed street fighting, bringing Khomeini to official power.[18][19] Iran voted by national referendum to become an Islamic Republic on 1 April 1979,[20] and to approve a new theocratic-republican constitution[11][12][21][22] whereby Khomeini became Supreme Leader of the country in December 1979.
