Several critics noted the album's extensive exploration of sexuality.[37][40] Having been a singer since the age of nine, Beyoncé felt "stifled" by the perception she was a role model for young children, and now into her thirties, believed she had "earned the right to [...] express any and every side of [her]self".[41] Addressing the album's sexual content specifically, Beyoncé said: "I don't at all have any shame about being sexual and I'm not embarrassed about it and I don't feel like I have to protect that side of me."[17] Several critics described Beyoncé's sex songs as a celebration of monogamous love.[21][31][36] "Drunk in Love" is a duet with her husband Jay-Z, and features lyrics heavily laden with double entendres that explore lust within their sexual relationship.[37] It fuses intermittent trap beats with heavy bass,[39] skittering synthesizers and drums,[42] and Arabic-scale vocal arpeggios.[43] Beyoncé's vocals are diverse, including a melodramatic chorus sung in her upper register and a half-rapped second verse.[21] "Blow" veers from a thumping jazz beat[44] created with sparse piano chords[20] and guitars[45] to a "swinging electro-funk groove"[20] with elements of neo-disco.[36] Its erotic, tongue-in-cheek lyrics include a running cunnilingus metaphor of "licking Skittles" in its chorus.[30] The slow-jam "Rocket" is a homage to D'Angelo's soul-infused "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" (2000).[35][46] Described by Entertainment Weekly's Nick Catucci as a "slippery, six-and-a-half-minute funk excursion",[39] Beyoncé adopts a slow, harmonious vocal[35] as she instructs her love interest to watch her perform a striptease.[47]
