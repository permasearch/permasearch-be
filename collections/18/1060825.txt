London Jefferson is a character in the novel Jason X: Planet of the Beast. A 28-year-old geneticist from the province New Saskatchewan on Earth II, London is named after the city of the same name and is unofficial second-in-command of G7, a space station orbiting and studying Planet #666 (nicknamed "The Planet of the Beast"). When the head of G7, Professor Bardox, unintentionally brings Jason Voorhees aboard the space station after returning from an unauthorized trip to Planet #666 (where Jason had crash-landed, along with two ships, the crews of which he had slaughtered) London and her co-workers are forced to fight for their lives against Jason, who proves to be unstoppable. After all her co-workers and boyfriend Andre are killed by Jason, London narrowly escapes him, flying away from the crumbling G7 in a semi-functional space shuttle. It is only while traveling through space that London is informed by the shuttle computer that she is pregnant with Jason's child, Bardox having impregnated her with some of Jason's genetic material after tampering with the G7's life-support to knock the entire crew of it unconscious.[43]
