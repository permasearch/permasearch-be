The history of Canadian sports falls into five stages of development: early recreational activities before 1840; the start of organized competition, 1840-1880; the emergence of national organizations, 1882-1914; the rapid growth of both amateur and professional sports, 1914 to 1960; and developments of the last century [6]  Some sports, especially hockey, lacrosse and curling enjoy an international reputation as particularly Canadian.[7]
