In the presence of multicollinearity, the estimate of one variable's impact on the dependent variable     Y   {\displaystyle Y}   while controlling for the others tends to be less precise than if predictors were uncorrelated with one another. The usual interpretation of a regression coefficient is that it provides an estimate of the effect of a one unit change in an independent variable,      X  1     {\displaystyle X_{1}}  , holding the other variables constant. If      X  1     {\displaystyle X_{1}}   is highly correlated with another independent variable,      X  2     {\displaystyle X_{2}}  , in the given data set, then we have a set of observations for which      X  1     {\displaystyle X_{1}}   and      X  2     {\displaystyle X_{2}}   have a particular linear stochastic relationship. We don't have a set of observations for which all changes in      X  1     {\displaystyle X_{1}}   are independent of changes in      X  2     {\displaystyle X_{2}}  , so we have an imprecise estimate of the effect of independent changes in      X  1     {\displaystyle X_{1}}  .
