The field of behavioural genetics, as founded by Galton, was ultimately undermined by another of Galton's intellectual contributions, the founding of the eugenics movement in 20th century society.[3] The primary idea behind eugenics was to use selective breeding combined with knowledge about the inheritance of behaviour to improve the human species.[3] The eugenics movement was subsequently discredited by scientific corruption and genocidal actions in Nazi Germany. Behavioural genetics was thereby discredited through its association to eugenics.[3] The field once again gained status as a distinct scientific discipline through the publication of early texts on behavioural genetics, such as Calvin S. Hall's 1951 book chapter on behavioural genetics, in which he introduced the term "psychogenetics",[7] which enjoyed some limited popularity in the 1960s and 1970s.[8][9] However, it eventually disappeared from usage in favour of "behaviour genetics".
