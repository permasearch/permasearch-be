Nihit Bhave of The Times of India gave the film a rating of 1.5 out of 5 and said that, "Akshara and Vivaan deliver embarrassingly over-the-top performances. The film is structured so that you connect all the dots within half an hour and are then left with a whole lot nothing to look forward to."[9] Sreehari Nair of Rediff gave the film a rating of 1.5 out of 5 and said that, "Laali Ki Shaadi Mein Laaddoo Deewana is insipid, terribly made, and yet a Warm Enterprise".[10] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the film a rating of 1.5 out of 5 saying that, "Akshara Haasan's film is a tedious rom-com that fails to shrug off its loopy quality despite a few entertaining performances".[11] Mohar Basu of Mid-Day gave the film a rating of 1 out of 5 and said that, "Director Manish Ravishankar wanted to give us a Rajshri-styled dramedy with a Kya Kehna twist. But it's boring, unfunny and utterly ridiculous. If you survive the first hour, you might just get a gallantry award."[12]
