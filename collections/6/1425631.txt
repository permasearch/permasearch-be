End of season cliffhanger (Episode 868): The season comes to an end with more multiple cliffhangers and lives at risk as Alison is trapped in the study at the Hamilton House with a venomous snake on the loose . A sailing trip on a yacht ends in disaster when both Glen and Tick are wounded, and Wayne, swimming for help, is pursued by a shark. Craig is knocked out by a horse and Caroline is shocked to discover that Doug is already married. Sadly by this point ratings were in decline and the next season would prove to be the last.
