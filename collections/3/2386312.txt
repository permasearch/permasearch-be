Bulkhead accidentally becomes trapped on board the Nemesis while on a scouting mission, and tries to escape without being discovered. Meanwhile, Starscream and Airachnid send their newly-gained armies (Starscream's being five clones of himself, and Airachnid's being a hive of Insecticons) to the Nemesis, both intending to kill Megatron.
