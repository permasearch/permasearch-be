Tibbets died in his Columbus, Ohio, home on 1 November 2007, at the age of 92.[56][84] He had suffered small strokes and heart failure during his final years and had been in hospice care.[8][85] He was survived by his French-born wife, Andrea,[81] and two sons from his first marriage, Paul III and Gene as well as his son, James, from his second marriage.[8][85] Tibbets had asked for no funeral nor headstone as he feared opponents of the bombing might use it as a place of protest. In accordance with his wishes, his body was cremated,[86] and his ashes were scattered over the English Channel,[87] which he had flown over many times during the war.[85]
