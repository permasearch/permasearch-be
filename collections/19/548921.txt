Rapper-producer El-P said he was asked to compose music for the first Blade Runner 2049 trailer, but his score was "rejected or ignored".[57] J贸hann J贸hannsson, who had worked with Villeneuve on Prisoners, Sicario and Arrival, was initially announced as composer for the film.[58] However, Villeneuve and J贸hann decided to end the collaboration because Villeneuve thought the film "needed something different", and also that he "needed to go back to something closer to Vangelis's soundtrack".[59] Composers Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch joined the project in July 2017. In September, J贸hann's agent confirmed that he was no longer involved and was contractually forbidden from commenting.[60]
