Europeans began exploring the coast of North America in the 16th century, but few attempts were made at permanent settlement anywhere. Early European explorers of the New England coast included the Englishman Bartholomew Gosnold (who named Cape Cod in 1602), Frenchman Samuel de Champlain (who charted the northern coast as far as Cape Cod in 1605 and 1606), and the Englishmen John Smith and Henry Hudson. Fishing ships from Europe also worked in the fish-rich waters off the coast, and may have engaged in trade with some of the natives. The sailors and fishermen brought European diseases which led to the rapid decline of the Indian population before the first large-scale arrival of settlers in the 1630s. Large numbers of natives were decimated by virgin soil epidemics such as smallpox, measles, influenza, and perhaps leptospirosis,[4] against which they had no immunity. In 1617â€“1619, smallpox killed 90% of the Native Americans in the region.[5]
