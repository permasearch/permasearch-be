This property is often exploited in a wide variety of applications, including general problems of statistical estimation and machine learning, to estimate (probabilistic) quantities of interest via Monte Carlo methods, since most quantities of interest can be written in terms of expectation, e.g.     P ⁡ (  X ∈   A    ) = E ⁡ [    1     A    ]   {\displaystyle \operatorname {P} ({X\in {\mathcal {A}}})=\operatorname {E} [{\mathbf {1} }_{\mathcal {A}}]}  , where        1     A      {\displaystyle {\mathbf {1} }_{\mathcal {A}}}   is the indicator function of the set       A     {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}}  .
