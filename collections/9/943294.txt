The gravitational field at a neutron star's surface is about 7011200000000000000♠2×1011 times stronger than on Earth, at around 7012200000000000000♠2.0×1012 m/s2.[25] Such a strong gravitational field acts as a gravitational lens and bends the radiation emitted by the neutron star such that parts of the normally invisible rear surface become visible.[24] If the radius of the neutron star is 3GM/c2 or less, then the photons may be trapped in an orbit, thus making the whole surface of that neutron star visible from a single vantage point, along with destabilizing photon orbits at or below the 1 radius distance of the star.
