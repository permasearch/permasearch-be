"Right Here [Human Nature Remix]" appears on the soundtrack and in the film Free Willy. The first verse of the Human Nature remix varies slightly from the original version, and the rapped bridge is omitted. The remix also features a young Pharrell Williams chanting "S...The double...The U...The V!" during the song. This became a common "call" during the group's concerts.
