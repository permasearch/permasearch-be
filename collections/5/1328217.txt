"Down Down Baby" is a clapping game played by children in English-speaking countries.  In the game, two or more children stand in a circle, and clap hands in tune to a rhyming song.  As with most hand-clapping games, there are many variations. Modified versions of the song have appeared in Little Anthony and the Imperials's "Shimmy Shimmy Ko-Ko Bop",[1][2] Nelly's "Country Grammar",[3][4] Simian Mobile Disco's "Hotdog", The Damned's "New Rose", The Drums' "Let's Go Surfing", Usher's "OMG", Carter USM's "Turn On, Tune In, And Switch Off", Bella Thorne and Zendaya's "Contagious Love", the film Big and EXO's "Ko Ko Bop"[5].
