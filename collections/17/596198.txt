Prince released several hundred songs both under his own name and under pseudonyms and/or pen names, as well as writing songs which have been recorded by other artists. Estimates of the actual number of songs written by Prince (released and unreleased) range anywhere from 500 to well over 1,000. He has released 97 singles, 34 promotional singles, 21 internet singles, and eight internet downloads. After signing a contract with Warner Bros. Records in 1977 at age 18, he released his debut album For You the following year. Prince's first entry on the Billboard Hot 100 was "Soft and Wet" (1978), which peaked at number 92. The following year, he released "I Wanna Be Your Lover", which became a top-40 hit in several countries and peaked at number 11 in the United States; it topped the Billboard R&B chart in early 1980. The album Prince spawned a top-20 R&B hit single ("Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?") and a top-five dance hit ("Sexy Dancer"). His next two albums, Dirty Mind (1980) and Controversy (1981), furthered his success on the dance/R&B charts, spawning the top-five hits "Dirty Mind", "Uptown", "Head", "Controversy", and "Let's Work". In 1982, Prince released the album 1999, which spawned the Billboard Hot 100 hits "1999", "Little Red Corvette", and "Delirious" throughout 1983, during which time he earned distinction as one of the first black artists to be played on MTV alongside Michael Jackson. Purple Rain (1984) gave Prince two American number one singles ("When Doves Cry" and "Let's Go Crazy") while the three other singles, "Purple Rain", "I Would Die 4 U", and "Take Me with U" became worldwide top-10 hits and established him as one of the most popular performers of the decade.[1]
