Adidas Tricolore was the match ball of the final.[62] It was the sixteenth edition in the Adidas football series; the name "Tricolore" translates to "three-coloured" and contains a tricolour crest and a cockerel, along with French classic themes which were used as influences, for the ball's construction, to illustrate the nation's flag.[63] The Tricolore became the first ball available in different colours and was later introduced at that year's World Cup.[63] It was the last ball to carry the vintage Tango layout.[64]
