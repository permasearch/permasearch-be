In the wake of the fall of Fort St. Jean, Carleton abandoned Montreal and returned to Quebec City by ship, narrowly escaping capture.[45]  Upon his arrival on November 19, he immediately took command.  Three days later, he issued a proclamation that any able-bodied man in the town who did not take up arms would be assumed to be a rebel or a spy, and would be treated as such.  Men not taking up arms were given four days to leave.[46]  As a result, about 500 inhabitants (including 200 British and 300 Canadians) joined the defense.[47]
