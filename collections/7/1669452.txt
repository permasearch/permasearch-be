An offer in compromise will stop tax levies under section 301.7122(g)(1) of the US Federal Tax Regulations.[3] That regulation states that the IRS will not levy upon a taxpayer's property while a valid offer in compromise (an offer that has been accepted for processing) is pending and, if rejected, for thirty days after the rejection. If the taxpayer appeals the rejection, the IRS cannot levy while the appeals process is ongoing. If a levy is in place when the offer is submitted, it is not automatically released.
