The report proved highly controversial, as Zuma and his ANC government refused to act on it and questioned its legitimacy.[5] On three occasions during 2014, the Presidency wrote letters to the Public Protector taking a skeptical attitude to the report.[1] On 14 August 2014 Zuma said he would allow Parliament, and the Minister of Police, to determine what remedial steps, if any, he should take.[6] He later denied that the Public Protector's recommendations were legally binding.[7] Zuma's evasiveness led to severe and widespread criticism, including by opposition parties the Economic Freedom Fighters and Democratic Alliance. EFF MPs frequently interrupted parliamentary proceedings to demand that Zuma "pay back the money",[8][9] leading to confrontations between them and Speaker of the National Assembly Baleka Mbete, considered by some to be partial to Zuma in her management of parliamentary proceedings.[10][11][12] On one such occasion, at Zuma's 2015 State of the Nation address, these interruptions led to brawl between MPs and security personnel and a subsequent court action (which was decided against the government).[13][14] When Zuma appeared in Parliament he repeatedly ignored or laughed off questions about Nkandla.[15][16][17] Eventually the EFF announced, in May 2015, that it would file a court application to compel Zuma to act on the Public Protector's report.[18][19] The DA filed a similar application shortly thereafter.[20]
