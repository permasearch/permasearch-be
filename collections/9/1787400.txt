Traditionally Christian, Calvinism of Boers in South Africa developed in much the same way as the New England colonies in North America.[clarification needed] The original South African Boer republics were founded on the principles of the Dutch Reformed Church.[citation needed] In 1985, 92% of Afrikaners were members of Reformed churches. Various national Christian events are widely attended, the most recent was held by Angus Buchan in Bloemfontein with over a million people, mostly Afrikaners [91]
