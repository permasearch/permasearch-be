The road signs were commonly stolen as souvenirs[11]—the only crime which has been reported in the village.[8] It cost some 300 Euros to replace each stolen sign, and the costs were reflected in the taxes that local residents pay.[7] In 2004, owing mainly to the stolen signs, a vote was held on changing the village's name, but the residents voted against doing so.[9] Tarsdorf municipality's mayor Siegfried Höppl stated that it was decided to keep the name as it had existed for 800 years,[9] and further stated that "[e]veryone here knows what it means in English, but for us Fucking is Fucking—and it's going to stay Fucking."[14]
