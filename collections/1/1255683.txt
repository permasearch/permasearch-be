In 2000, the year Brooks won the award, the AMAs held a poll to elect the Artist of the Decade for each previous decade of the Rock & Roll era. According to some sources, the result of this poll is not counted in the total of AMAs won by these artists.[18][19][20] The results were Elvis Presley (1950s), The Beatles (60s), Stevie Wonder (70s) and Michael Jackson (80s).
