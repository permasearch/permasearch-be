Upon becoming FCC chairman in April 2017, Ajit Pai proposed to repeal the policies and issued a NPRM soliciting comments from the public on the issue.[14][15] The FCC received over 20 million comments this time around.[16] While this process was still underway, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman made public that he has been investigating a substantial amount of fraudulent activity relating to the comments on this rulemaking and that the FCC has been resistant to assisting him in his investigation.[17] It has since been revealed that there were millions of fraudulent comments submitted during this comment period.[18] Nevertheless, on December 14, 2017, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted in favor of repealing these policies, 3â€“2, along party lines, as the 2015 vote had occurred.[19][20][21] On January 4, 2018, the FCC published the official text for "Restoring Internet freedom".[22][23] Shortly thereafter, twenty two state Attorneys General filed suit against the FCC, alleging, inter alia, that the comment process was corrupted, making the rule changes invalid.[24]
