In 2009 he recorded the song "Give Me Some Sunshine" for the film 3 Idiots. The film's music director Shantanu Moitra composed the song with Suraj Jagan's voice in mind, and stated that if the movie's producers did not like Suraj Jagan's voice with the original composition, he would change the tune but would not compromise Suraj Jagan as the singer of the song.[5] Jagan said that "Iâ€™ll always be grateful to him for that."[5][6]
