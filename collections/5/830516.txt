To a considerable degree, in fact, the comedy is built upon a basis of class warfareâ€”a theme which was very familiar to British television audiences in the 1970s, a period of virtually continuous industrial strife in Britain. Whereas Bob, Thelma and Terry's sister Audrey have adapted to the various changes, Terry's five-year absence in the Army results in him being left behind, a relic of the attitudes of the mid-1960s.
