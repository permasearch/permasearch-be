In Rwanda, Kagame's RPF is seen as a Tutsi-dominated party, and in the years following the 1994 genocide, it was deeply unpopular with the Hutu, who constitute 7001850000000000000♠85% of the population.[114] Approximately two million Hutu lived as refugees in neighbouring countries until 1996, when Kagame forced them to return home.[114] Many Hutu also supported the late 1990s cross-border insurgency against Kagame by defeated forces of the former regime.[115] By 1999, when the RPF had weakened the insurgents and the north west became peaceful, the Hutu population became broadly supportive of Kagame.[118] Since becoming president in 2000, Kagame has won three disputed presidential elections with over 7001900000000000000♠90% of the vote each time. Despite criticisms over opposition repression during these elections, and accusations that the figures were inflated,[171] Kagame does receive genuine support from the population, who credit him with ensuring continued peace, stability, and economic growth.[307]
