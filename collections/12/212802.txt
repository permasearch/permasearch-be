After failing to win the Elimination Chamber match, Intercontinental Champion The Miz said he should main event WrestleMania as his title was more important than the Universal Championship. He demanded a challenger for WrestleMania, to which Seth Rollins came out and defeated him. After that, Finn Bálor also came out and defeated Miz. The following week, both Rollins and Bálor confronted Miz, leading to a 2-on-3 handicap match between Rollins and Bálor and The Miz and his Miztourage (Bo Dallas and Curtis Axel), in which Rollins pinned Miz. Afterwards, Raw General Manager Kurt Angle scheduled The Miz to defend the Intercontinental Championship against Bálor and Rollins in a triple threat match at WrestleMania.[39] On the March 12 episode, The Miz interviewed his WrestleMania opponents on Miz TV, which ended in Rollins and Bálor jointly taking out Miz and Rollins attacked Bálor, who later defeated Rollins.[35]
