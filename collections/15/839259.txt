As a result of the financial crisis in 2008, twenty-five U.S. banks became insolvent and were taken over by the FDIC.[384] As of August 14, 2009, an additional 77 banks became insolvent.[385] This seven-month tally surpasses the 50 banks that were seized in all of 1993, but is still much smaller than the number of failed banking institutions in 1992, 1991, and 1990.[386] The United States has lost over 6 million jobs since the recession began in December 2007.[387]
