Pathologists should not report an M category unless appropriate for the specimen evaluated. CAP Cancer Protocols require documentation of distant metastases as pM1 only if present in the specimen(s) provided to the pathologist. If the pathologist does not review and report on a metastatic specimen, or if a biopsy is performed of a possible distant metastasis and the biopsy does not show cancer, then there should be no mention of the M category in the pathology report, or the pathologist should designate the M category as “not applicable.” The term MX should not be used in the pathology report.
