At the House of Black and White, Jaqen H'ghar finds a bloodtrail and follows it to the Hall of Faces, where he finds the Waif's face. Arya then holds Jaqen at sword point. Jaqen congratulates Arya by telling her that she is finally No One. However, she rejects the title, asserting her identity as Arya Stark before turning and leaving, announcing that she is "going home." Jaqen proudly watches on as she leaves.
