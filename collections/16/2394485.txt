Islets are usually infused into the patient's liver.[1] If the cells are not from a genetically identical donor the patient's body will recognize them as foreign and the immune system will begin to attack them as with any transplant rejection. To prevent this immunosuppressant drugs are used. Recent studies have shown that islet transplantation has progressed to the point that 58% of the patients in one study were insulin independent one year after the operation.[2]
