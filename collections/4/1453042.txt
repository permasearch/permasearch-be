While none of the X-Files album songs are prominently featured in the movie itself, "Walking After You" is played during the end credit sequence, following Noel Gallagher's "Teotihuacan." The single's B-side is Ween's "Beacon Light". The Foo Fighters had previously contributed a cover of Gary Numan's "Down in the Park" to the compilation album, Songs in the Key of X: Music From and Inspired by the X-Files. Grohl is an avid "X-Files" fan.
