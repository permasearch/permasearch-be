Despite injuring his foot in the Eastern Conference Finals against the Miami Heat, Pippen helped the Bulls to an 84–82 victory over the Utah Jazz in Game 1 of the NBA Finals. One of the highlights of the game was when Karl Malone was fouled by Dennis Rodman with 9.2 seconds left and had a chance to give Utah the lead and Scottie famously psyched him out by saying: "Just remember, the mailman doesn't deliver on Sundays, Karl", before he stepped up to the line. He missed both free throws. Jordan got the rebound and quickly called a time-out with 7.5 seconds left. With the game on the line, the Bulls put the ball in Jordan's hands. He dribbled out most of the waning seconds, then launched a 20-footer that went in at the buzzer to give Chicago a 1–0 series lead.[43] In Game 3 of the series, Pippen tied a then finals record of seven 3-pointers, they still lost 104–93.[44] Perhaps the most iconic moment of the series happened in Game 5, which is also known as "The Flu Game". Jordan was battling illness but still managed to dominate the game as the Bulls won 90–88, and with only a few seconds remaining and the game's result safely in Chicago's favor, Jordan collapsed into Pippen's arms, creating an iconic image that has come to symbolize "The Flu Game".[45] During Game 6, Pippen made one of the greatest plays of his career. Trailing by two, the Jazz looked for a final shot to stay alive, but Pippen knocked away Bryon Russell's inbounds pass intended for Shandon Anderson and rolled the ball over to Toni Kukoč, who dunked the final 2 points of the game to give the Bulls a 90–86 lead, clinching their fifth championship. Afterwards, Jordan was named Finals MVP for the fifth time.[46]
