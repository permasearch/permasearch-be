Blood is supplied to the cervix by the descending branch of the uterine artery[8] and drains into the uterine vein.[9] The pelvic splanchnic nerves, emerging as S2â€“S3, transmit the sensation of pain from the cervix to the brain.[4] These nerves travel along the uterosacral ligaments, which pass from the uterus to the anterior sacrum.[8]
