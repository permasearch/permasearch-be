In 2003, webcomic Penny Arcade posted an "advertisement" for an imaginary computer game, American McGee's Strawberry Shortcakeâ€”a parody of the actual computer game American McGee's Alice, a twisted and violent take on Lewis Carroll's works. American Greetings took offense to the parody and issued a cease-and-desist letter, to which the authors begrudgingly complied[16] - but not without making their indignation very clear.[17] A follow-up strip by Penny Arcade themselves cite bad timing as a contributing factor to the lawsuit,[18] Holkins and Krahulik were not aware that American Greetings was about to relaunch the Strawberry Shortcake line at that time.
