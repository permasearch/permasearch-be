Informally, the probability that any number is divisible by a prime (or in fact any integer)     p   {\displaystyle p}   is     1  /  p   {\displaystyle 1/p}  ; for example, every 7th integer is divisible by 7. Hence the probability that two numbers are both divisible by p is     1  /   p  2     {\displaystyle 1/p^{2}}  , and the probability that at least one of them is not is     1 âˆ’ 1  /   p  2     {\displaystyle 1-1/p^{2}}  . Any finite collection of divisibility events associated to distinct primes is mutually independent. For example, in the case of two events, a number is divisible by primes p and q if and only if it is divisible by pq; the latter event has probability 1/pq. If one makes the heuristic assumption that such reasoning can be extended to infinitely many divisibility events, one is led to guess that the probability that two numbers are coprime is given by a product over all primes,
