Under Superior General Pedro Arrupe, social justice and the preferential option for the poor emerged as dominant themes of the work of the Jesuits. When Arrupe was paralyzed by a stroke in 1981, Pope John Paul II, not entirely pleased with the progressive turn of the Jesuits, took the unusual step of appointing the venerable and aged Paolo Dezza for an interim to oversee "the authentic renewal of the Church",[90] instead of the progressive American priest Vincent O'Keefe whom Arrupe had preferred.[91] In 1983 John Paul gave leave for the Jesuits to appoint a successor to Arrupe.
