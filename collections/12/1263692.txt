The extra genetic material present in DS results in overexpression of a portion of the 310 genes located on chromosome 21.[62] This overexpression has been estimated at around 50%.[60] Some research has suggested the Down syndrome critical region is located at bands 21q22.1â€“q22.3,[72] with this area including genes for amyloid, superoxide dismutase, and likely the ETS2 proto oncogene.[73] Other research, however, has not confirmed these findings.[62] microRNAs are also proposed to be involved.[74]
