It was rumored that the launch of Project Natal would be accompanied with the release of a new Xbox 360 console (as either a new retail configuration,[26][27] a significant design revision[28] and/or a modest hardware upgrade[29]). Microsoft dismissed the reports in public and repeatedly emphasized that Project Natal would be fully compatible with all Xbox 360 consoles. Microsoft indicated that the company considers it to be a significant initiative, as fundamental to Xbox brand as Xbox Live,[30] and with a launch akin to that of a new Xbox console platform.[31] Kinect was even referred to as a "new Xbox" by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer at a speech for Executives' Club of Chicago.[32][33] When asked if the introduction will extend the time before the next-generation console platform is launched (historically about 5 years between platforms),[34] Microsoft corporate vice president Shane Kim reaffirmed that the company believes that the life cycle of Xbox 360 will last through 2015 (10 years).[22]
