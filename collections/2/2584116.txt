The Usos are the current champions in their record third reign, both as a team and individually. They defeated The New Day's Big E and Xavier Woods on October 8, 2017, in a Hell in a Cell match at Hell in a Cell in Detroit, MI. This was also the first time that a WWE tag team championship was defended in a Hell in a Cell match.
