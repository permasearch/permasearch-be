The Sunshine Coast is a region of the southern mainland coast of British Columbia, Canada, on the eastern shore of the Strait of Georgia, and just northwest of Greater Vancouver. The region includes the coastal areas of the regional district of Sunshine Coast, where the name originated, and the regional district of Powell River up to and including the village of Lund and into Desolation Sound, much farther up the coast.[1]
