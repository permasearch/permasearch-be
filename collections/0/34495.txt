Initially, host nation Russia matched the Soviet Union's 1976 achievement of thirteen gold medals,[α] but 4 gold medals (13 overall) were stripped later due to doping. Norway achieved the leading position in the medal table on 24 November 2017, when Russia was stripped of two gold medals in bobsleigh.[β] However, at the end of January 2018, the Court of Arbitration for Sport cleared 28 Russian athletes and 9 out of 13 medals (including 3 gold) were reinstated, allowing Russia to return to the top position.[7]
