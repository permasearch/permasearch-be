In its early years, the city was known as a deliberate reminder of an expression in the Qur'an, when it refers to Paradise.[26] It took four years to build (764â€“768). Mansur assembled engineers, surveyors, and art constructionists from around the world to come together and draw up plans for the city. Over 100,000 construction workers came to survey the plans; many were distributed salaries to start the building of the city.[27] July was chosen as the starting time because two astrologers, Naubakht Ahvazi and Mashallah, believed that the city should be built under the sign of the lion, Leo.[28] Leo is associated with fire and symbolises productivity, pride, and expansion.
