Christian religious devotion had historically been accompanied by rejection of mundane affairs, including economic pursuit.[86] Weber showed that certain types of Protestantism—notably Calvinism—were supportive of rational pursuit of economic gain and worldly activities dedicated to it, seeing them as endowed with moral and spiritual significance.[73] Weber argued that there were many reasons to look for the origins of modern capitalism in the religious ideas of the Reformation.[87] In particular, the Protestant ethic (or more specifically, Calvinist ethic) motivated the believers to work hard, be successful in business and reinvest their profits in further development rather than frivolous pleasures.[84] The notion of calling meant that each individual had to take action as an indication of their salvation; just being a member of the Church was not enough.[74] Predestination also reduced agonising over economic inequality and further, it meant that a material wealth could be taken as a sign of salvation in the afterlife.[84][88] The believers thus justified pursuit of profit with religion, as instead of being fuelled by morally suspect greed or ambition, their actions were motivated by a highly moral and respected philosophy.[84] This Weber called the "spirit of capitalism": it was the Protestant religious ideology that was behind—and inevitably led to—the capitalist economic system.[84] This theory is often viewed as a reversal of Marx's thesis that the economic "base" of society determines all other aspects of it.[73]
