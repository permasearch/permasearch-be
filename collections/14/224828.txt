The memorial has had some unforeseen maintenance issues. In 1984 cracks were detected in the marble and, as a result, two of the panels were temporarily removed in 1986 for study. More cracks were discovered in 2010. There are many theories about the cause of the cracks, and one often forwarded is that thermal cycling is to blame. In 1990, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund purchased several blank panels to use in case any were ever destroyed. They placed them in storage at Quantico Marine Base.[7][8] Two of the blank panels were shattered by the 2011 Virginia earthquake.[9]
