Many of the details have changed over time; League is not a static game, with mechanics being both introduced and removed since launch in 2009.  For example, the Rift Herald was only added in 2016, and had its abilities reworked in 2017;[22][21] Dragons gave gold rather than buffs from 2009–2014, and the dragons only became elementally flavored drakes in 2016; jungle monsters have been added and retuned; the length of time it took for inhibitors to respawn was 4 minutes rather than 5 minutes for a time; Baron Nashor gave a stronger buff to the statistics of champions but no buff to minions from 2009–2014; and so on.
