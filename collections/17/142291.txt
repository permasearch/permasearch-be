After minor modifications,[9] the new redesigned rifle was renamed the Rifle, Caliber 5.56Â mm, M16.[7][10] Meanwhile, the Army relented and recommended the adoption of the M16 for jungle warfare operations. However, the Army insisted on the inclusion of a forward assist to help push the bolt into battery in the event that a cartridge failed to seat into the chamber. The Air Force, Colt and Eugene Stoner believed that the addition of a forward assist was an unjustified expense. As a result, the design was split into two variants: the Air Force's M16 without the forward assist, and the XM16E1 (AKA: M16A1) with the forward assist for the other service branches.
