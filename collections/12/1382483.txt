Some Australian Shepherds (as well as Collies, German Shepherds, and many other herding dogs) are susceptible to a genetic mutation of the MDR1 gene.[24] Dogs with the mutation can suffer toxicity from antiparasitics such as ivermectin in high doses, and other drugs.[25] A test is available to determine if a particular dog carries the mutated gene.[26]
