On 9 December, one of Albert's doctors, William Jenner, diagnosed typhoid fever. Albert died at 10:50Â p.m. on 14 December 1861 in the Blue Room at Windsor Castle, in the presence of the Queen and five of their nine children.[108] The contemporary diagnosis was typhoid fever, but modern writers have pointed out that Albert was ill for at least two years before his death, which may indicate that a chronic disease, such as Crohn's disease,[109] renal failure, or abdominal cancer, was the cause of death.[110]
