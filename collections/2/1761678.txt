Logan International Airport has four lettered passenger terminals, A, B, C, and E, and 102 gate positions total.[46] With the exception of flights from destinations with U.S. Customs and Border Protection preclearance, which includes all flights to Logan from Canada, U.S. Territories, and Ireland, all inbound international flights arrive at Terminal E for customs screening since the other terminals do not have customs screening facilities. All terminals are connected by pre-security shuttle buses and by the SL1 branch of the MBTA Silver Line BRT, as well as between Terminals A, B, and E via pre-security moving walkways.[47] Moving walkways also connect the terminals to a central parking garage designed for consolidated service between all four terminals and the garage itself.[48] Massport ultimately plans to connect all terminals and gates post-security, thereby allowing for seamless connections between flights from different terminals.[citation needed] The concession program at the airport is developed, leased and managed by AirMall USA (formerly BAA USA) in Terminals B and E and Westfield Concession Management Inc. in Terminals A and C.
