"Loveeeeeee Song" is a "druggy slab of sci-fi" R&B song[10] and is also the fifth track on the album. Co-producer Luney Tunez spoke about the process of working on it.[11] In an interview with Complex he stated, "that was one of the beats I really don't like. It wasn't one of my favorites. When I made it, I was in the mindset of being real, melodic, laid back, and sexy."[11] He further added that from the beginning he was aware that the song will be a "pop-female record" and that he also didn't want to put too many instruments in it. Luney Tunez labeled it as one of the favorite songs that he has ever produced.[11]
