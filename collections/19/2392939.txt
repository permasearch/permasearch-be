The old Koraput and Kalahandi districts and portions of Bolangir districts are mainly hilly.  Severe droughts and floods also often visit this region and some areas in quick succession. Therefore, backwardness of this region is multi-faceted: (i) tribal backwardness, (ii) hill area backwardness, (iii) backwardness due to severe natural calamities and (iv)apathy of state and central government towards this region.
