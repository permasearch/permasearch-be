The vessels used by SOE during the early part of the war were clandestine craft such as fishing boats or caiques. They could pass muster as innocent local craft and carry large quantities of stores. They also had the advantage of being largely outside Admiralty control. However, SOE's first small craft organisation, which was set up in the Helford estuary, suffered from obstruction from SIS, which had a similar private navy nearby. Eventually, in spring 1943, the Admiralty created a Deputy Director of Operations (Irregular), to superintend all such private navies. This officer turned out to be the former commander of SIS's craft in the Helford estuary, but his successor cooperated much better with SOE's flotilla.[93] Even so, while SIS and SOE (and MI9) landed and embarked several dozen agents, refugees and allied aircrew, it was impossible to transport large quantities of arms and equipment inland from beaches in heaviy patrolled coastal areas, until France was almost liberated.
