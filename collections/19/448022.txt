Corbin lives on the ranch with his daughter, Shannon Ross (born 1965) and grandchildren. Shannon had been adopted as an infant; her birth mother, who had an affair with Corbin, gave up the child through the Methodist Mission Home in San Antonio, without having told Corbin of the pregnancy. Corbin found Shannon in June 1991, when she was twenty-six. Corbin has three sons: Bernard Weiss (born 1970), Jim Corbin (born 1979), and Christopher Corbin (born 1982). Christopher goes on to follow in his father's footsteps as an actor. Bernard was adopted by the Weiss family and later in life got in touch with Corbin. He and his second wife, Susan Berger, divorced in 1992.[5]
