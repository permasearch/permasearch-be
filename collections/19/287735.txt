Chicken tikka (Urdu: مرغ تکہ‎; Hindi: मुर्ग़ टिक्का;  murgh tikka) is a dish from Mughlai cuisine[7][8] made by grilling small pieces of boneless chicken which have been marinated in spices and yogurt. It is traditionally cooked on skewers in a tandoor and is usually boneless. It is normally served and eaten with a green coriander chutney, or used in preparing the curry chicken tikka masala.
