To celebrate the 30th anniversary of Star Trek in 1996, producers of both Star Trek: Voyager and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine decided to incorporate elements of The Original Series into episodes. The Voyager episode "Flashback" showed events on board the Excelsior under Captain Hikaru Sulu during the period in which Kirk and McCoy were imprisoned in Rura Penthe in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country.[93] However, the Deep Space Nine homage used the original footage from nineteen scenes in "The Trouble with Tribbles" and other episodes in order to digitally insert the actors into the events of the episode, entitled "Trials and Tribble-ations".[77][94] The episode was nominated for three Emmy Awards and as with the original episode, the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.[95][96]
