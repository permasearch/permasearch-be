Etan Cohen created the role of Kirk Lazarus as a way of lampooning the great lengths that some method actors go to depict a role.[15][22] Downey was approached by Stiller about the part while on vacation in Hawaii.[23] Downey said on CBS' The Early Show that his first reaction was, "This is the stupidest idea I've ever heard!" and that Stiller responded, "Yeah, I know — isn't it great?"[24] In another interview, Downey said that he accepted the part but, having no idea where or even how to start building the character of Lazarus, eventually settled on a jive-esque speech pattern and a ragged bass voice; he then auditioned Lazarus' voice over the phone to Stiller, who approved the characterization immediately.[8] Downey revealed that he modeled the character on actors Russell Crowe, Colin Farrell, and Daniel Day-Lewis.[25] The initial script was written for Downey's character to be Irish, but was altered after Downey stated he could improvise better as an Australian (he had previously played a similar outlandish Australian character in the film Natural Born Killers).[26] Downey's practice of remaining in character between takes and even off the film set was also written into the script for his character to perform.[27] Downey required between one and a half to two hours of make-up application.[28][29] According to Downey, "One makeup artist would start on one side of my face and a second makeup artist would start on the other side, and then they'd meet in the middle."[29]
