In 1950, Columbia Pictures released the comedy/mystery The Good Humor Man with Jack Carson, Lola Albright, and George Reeves. The storyline has Carson as an ice cream vendor who also belongs to a home-grown Captain Marvel Club with some of the kids in the neighborhood.[152] Fawcett released a tie-in one-shot the same year the movie appeared, Captain Marvel and the Good Humor Man.[153]
