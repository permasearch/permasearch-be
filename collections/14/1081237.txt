The word pentagram comes from the Greek word πεντάγραμμον (pentagrammon),[3] from πέντε (pente), "five" + γραμμή (grammē), "line".[4] The word "pentacle" is sometimes used synonymously with "pentagram".[5] The word pentalpha is a learned modern (17th-century) revival of a post-classical Greek name of the shape.[6]
