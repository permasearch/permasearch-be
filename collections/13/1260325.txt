Construction of Chuo Shinkansen began in 2014. It was expected to begin operations by 2027.[100] The plan for the Chuo Shinkansen bullet train system was finalized based on the Law for Construction of Countrywide Shinkansen. The Linear Chuo Shinkansen Project aimed to operate the Superconductive Magnetically Levitated Train to connect Tokyo and Osaka by way of Nagoya, the capital city of Aichi, in approximately one hour at a speed of 500 km/h (310 mph).[101] The full track between Tokyo and Osaka was to be completed in 2045.[102][103]
