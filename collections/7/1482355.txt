Dinner service: The finalists' families along with Sean Kanan and Shanola Hampton were guests for the final service in addition to guests sitting at the chef's tables which includes singer Natasha Bedingfield in Scott's kitchen and actor Mark Boone Junior in Jason's kitchen. In the red kitchen, despite strong performances from Anton, Melanie, Gabriel and Bev, Sandra failed to provide times on garnish and old crab cakes for the chef's table, argued with Jason, and worked slowly. Gabriel overcooked fillets, but recovered. In the blue kitchen, Jessica struggled on garnish and Scott kicked her out after she served poor french fries, marking the second time a finalist threw a chef out of the kitchen, but Kashia, Ralph, Chris, and Rochelle put in strong performances. Ramsay praised Jason and Scott and announced the results were very close.
