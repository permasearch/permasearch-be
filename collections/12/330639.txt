Chetan Bhagat, an investment banker turned novelist, described the porn ban as "anti-freedom," "impractical" and "not enforceable." He satirically suggested that India next ban olive oil (as being too Western), comedic television, and pizza (due to not being Indian cuisine). "Anyone who has an opinion different from yours must be banned," Bhagat said on Twitter. "After all, you are always right."[83]
