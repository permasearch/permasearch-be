Both Matthew and Luke probably date from the period AD 80-100,[8] and both were originally anonymous (the attributions to Matthew and Luke were added in the 2nd century).[9] It is widely, though not universally, accepted that both are based on the Gospel of Mark,[10] but Mark has no birth story,[11] and the differences between Matthew and Luke are so great that it is highly unlikely either comes from the other or that they shared a common independent source.[5] Some scholars, notably Raymond E. Brown, have suggested that Joseph was the source of Matthew's account and Mary of Luke's,[12][13] but modern scholars consider this "highly unlikely", given that this so-called family tradition emerged only at a late stage in the Christian tradition.[14]
