The paralegal phenomenon is a legal-economics argument in all jurisdictions â€“ they exist precisely because they are not lawyers and thus can do the work much more cheaply.[7] Other than expertise, the main constraint on what work a paralegal can or cannot do tends to be local rules that reserve (i.e. give a monopoly to) particular activities to lawyers. Each jurisdiction tends to have its own "reserved activities list".
