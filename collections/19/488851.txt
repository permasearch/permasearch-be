In October 2018, the Syrian government announced an amnesty for draft evaders.  However, an officer with Syria's "Reconciliation Ministry" told the Los Angeles Times that, while punishment would be canceled, military service would still be required.  "Now the war is practically at its end, which means enlisting is no longer such a fearful situation", he said.  "We expect we'll have very large numbers taking advantage of the amnesty".[65]
