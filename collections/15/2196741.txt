After Radical Republicans gained control of the state government in 1868, they sought to integrate the University; the constitution of 1868 had stated that all universities of the state should be "free and open to all the children and youths of the State, without regard to race and color."[2]  Former Governor Orr urged the legislature to preserve the University as an institution for the whites and to convert the dormant campus of The Citadel into a college for the blacks.  Governor Robert Kingston Scott ignored this request and recommended that the legislature bring the University into compliance with the Morrill Act to make it qualify as a land grant college and accept federal aid; it had to remove race as an admissions criteria.
