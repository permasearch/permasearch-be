Beltr치n's defense was also recognized during the 2006 season, as he received his first Gold Glove award. He made only two errors in 372 chances to give him a .995 fielding percentage, and recorded 13 outfield assists and six double plays. He also won a Fielding Bible Award as the top fielding center fielder in MLB.[46] Beltr치n came fourth in the National League MVP award voting, behind winner Ryan Howard, Albert Pujols, and Lance Berkman.[47] Returning to the playoffs, Beltr치n hit three home runs in the NLCS, bringing his career playoff total to 11 home runs in 22 games.[11] However, with the bases loaded and two outs in the ninth inning of Game 7 of the NLCS against the Cardinals, Beltr치n struck out looking against Adam Wainwright, ending the New York Mets season.[48][49]
