The words "donkey" and "ass" (or translations thereof) have come to have derogatory or insulting meaning in several languages, and are generally used to mean someone who is obstinate, stupid or silly,[97][98][99][100] In football, especially in the United Kingdom, a player who is considered unskilful is often dubbed a "donkey",[97] and the term has a similar connotation in poker.[101] In the US, the slang terms "dumbass" and "jackass" are used to refer to someone considered stupid.[102][103]
