There are also cases, such as Mad About You (164 episodes) and Newsradio (97 episodes),[citation needed] where a series was expected to do well in syndication but ended up with disappointing ratings and revenue. Reasons include dated references in early seasons, or plotlines in later seasons that fall flat, causing the series to end up being defined by that one plot line or season rather than as a whole, changing the audience's perception.
