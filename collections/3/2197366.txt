Immediately east of the Lenawee County line, US 12 intersects US 127 in the Irish Hills region. South of Brooklyn in Cambridge Junction, it passes the Michigan International Speedway  and crosses the River Raisin next to a junction with M-50. East of the racetrack, the highway meanders through an area dotted by several smaller lakes until it intersects M-124 at Walter J. Hayes State Park. Continuing as Michigan Avenue, US 12 angles northeasterly from the park until it hits the  Lenawee–Washtenaw county line. The highway follows the line for several miles before reentering Lenawee County. It continues  through an intersection with M-52 and into Clinton before turning northeasterly and fully crossing into Washtenaw County.[3][4]
