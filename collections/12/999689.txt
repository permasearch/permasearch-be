Tsarnaev was described as "normal" and popular among fellow students. His friends said he sometimes smoked marijuana,[56] liked hip hop, and did not talk to them about politics.[57] Many friends and other acquaintances found it inconceivable that he could be one of the two bombers at first,[52] calling it "completely out of his character".[58] He was not perceived as foreign, spoke English without an accent,[57] was sociable, and was described by peers as "[not] 'them'. He was 'us.' He was Cambridge".[59]
