At the end of the Ordovician period, 443 Ma,[22] additional extinction events occurred, perhaps due to a concurrent ice age.[139] Around 380 to 375 Ma, the first tetrapods evolved from fish.[153] Fins evolved to become limbs that the first tetrapods used to lift their heads out of the water to breathe air. This would let them live in oxygen-poor water, or pursue small prey in shallow water.[153] They may have later ventured on land for brief periods. Eventually, some of them became so well adapted to terrestrial life that they spent their adult lives on land, although they hatched in the water and returned to lay their eggs. This was the origin of the amphibians. About 365 Ma, another period of extinction occurred, perhaps as a result of global cooling.[154] Plants evolved seeds, which dramatically accelerated their spread on land, around this time (by approximately 360 Ma).[155][156]
