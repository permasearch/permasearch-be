Tracy is the spoiled, rich, and often badly behaved daughter of the wealthy Edward Quartermaine and Lila Morgan Quartermaine. She has two sons, Ned Quartermaine and Dillon Quartermaine; two stepsons, Lucky Spencer and Ethan Lovett; and a stepdaughter, Lulu Spencer. Many of her storylines over the course of 30 years involved feuds with her sister-in-law, Monica Quartermaine,[2] Tracy's unsuccessful attempts to find love, her determination to gain power in ELQ, the family company, and her attempts to one-up family members who have tried to displace her or her sons in the family company or in her father's affections. Tracy was originally presented as a vivacious socialite who hid her scheming nature that her brother and parents saw through and warned sister-in-law Monica about. Quite friendly on the outside, Tracy could be snobbish on a whim, although that was more obvious when she was older rather than her early days in Port Charles. While Tracy wanted to get in good with her father, Edward, he still deemed his son Alan Quartermaine, Tracy's brother, his favorite. In recent years, Tracy has greatly mellowed, showing her maternal side with sons Ned and Dillon, as well as step-daughter Lulu, supporting her sister-in-law Monica through various ordeals, and befriending female characters after never really having women friendships while younger.
