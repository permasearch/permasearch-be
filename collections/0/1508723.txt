While collective bargaining was stalled by US Supreme Court preemption policy, a dysfunctional National Labor Relations Board, and falling union membership rate since the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, employees have sought voting rights for corporate boards of directors and in work councils.[311] Labor law has increasingly converged with corporate law,[312] and in 2018 the first federal proposal was made by three US senators to enable employees to vote for one third of the directors on boards of listed companies.[313] In 1919, under the Republican governor Calvin Coolidge, Massachusetts became the first state with a right for employees in manufacturing companies to have employee representatives on the board of directors, but only if corporate stockholders voluntarily agreed.[314] Also in 1919 both Procter & Gamble and the General Ice Delivery Company of Detroit had employee representation on boards.[315] Board representation for employees spread through the 1920s, many without requiring any employee stock ownership plan.[316] In the early 20th century, labor law theory split between those who advocated collective bargaining backed by strike action, those who advocated a greater role for binding arbitration,[317] and proponents of codetermination as "industrial democracy".[318] Today, these methods are seen as complements, not alternatives. A majority of countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have laws requiring direct participation rights.[319] In 1994, the Dunlop Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations: Final Report examined law reform to improve collective labor relations, and suggested minor amendments to encourage worker involvement.[320] Congressional division prevented federal reform, but labor unions and state legislatures have experimented.
