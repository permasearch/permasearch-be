Some of the sexual content and violence from the script and filming was deemed too extreme by the studio, and was removed from the film. Tunnicliffe commented, "I don't think people could stomach my original version. The studio certainly couldn't. I've been simulating killing people in movies for over twenty years. I could have easily made the film ten to fifteen minutes longer with a more intense cut, but it would probably be TOO much. In the end, wiser heads prevailed."[35] Among the deleted content was an extended sequence of Karl Watkins getting brutally skinned to death by the Inquisition's surgeon,[39] and various scenes involving the Cleaners. The original version of the sex scene between Sean and Alison Carter was more intense, with the camera cutting back and forth between Sean's point of view of his wife and visions of the Cenobites. Several false endings to the scene were conceived, including a hallucination from Sean where Alison performs fellatio on him, and then looks up after his orgasm to reveal David Carter's face smiling back at him. The nightmare scene where Sean enters an alleyway and begins seeing flashes of Hell was also filmed to be longer and more graphic; he at one point stumbled across Alison engaging in a threesome behind a dumpster with two unidentified men in pig masks. Tunnicliffe wanted to use surreal imagery to convey that "Sean's world was being torn apart, undone by his experiences at the house within the hellish dimension."[40] The original concept pitch for Judgment had the Jury eating the Assessor's regurgitated pages before passing their verdict on the Stygian Inquisition's captives, as opposed to merely sifting through them.[26] Various dialogue, and character and plot development scenes were additionally trimmed.[13]
