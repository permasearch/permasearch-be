"Against All Odds" was created explicitly for the movie,[10] although it was based on an earlier unreleased song Collins had written in 1981. Hackford, who previously used a song for the 1982 American drama film An Officer and a Gentleman, planned the same for the neo-noir 1984 film Against All Odds,[10] which is a remake of Out of the Past. When he signed with Atlantic Records, he was provided with a roster of artists, among whom Collins was chosen to render the film's theme song based on the quality of his voice.[10] Hackford said that it was a "textbook case of designing a song to reflect what the film is".[10] The song appears in the movie as background music during the closing credits.[11]
