The Kratt brothers find out that a scientist has discovered a new species of mantis in Peru and named it Liturgusa krattorum, after them. They decide to creature adventure with this unique insect. Meanwhile, villains Zach Varmitech, Donita Donata, and Chef Gourmand are upset that the mantis was named after the Kratt brothers instead of after them, so they decide to capture all of the Liturgusa krattorum. The Wild Kratts must rescue the mantises and get them back to "living free and in the wild".
