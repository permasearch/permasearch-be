Later, Ann tells Mark about the upcoming story and the negative quotes, which Mark thought was off the record. The two confront Shauna and ask her not to use the quotes. Shauna says that she will not use the quotes since the two are "romantically involved," but when Mark disputes the idea that they are romantically involved, Shauna appears visibly annoyed. Later, Mark apologizes to Leslie and asks to be reinstated to the committee, to which Leslie happily agrees. Later, Leslie reads the story, which is not entirely positive, but her enthusiasm remains strong. In a B story, Tom (Aziz Ansari) deliberately loses at online Scrabble against his boss Ron (Nick Offerman), and is horrified when intern April (Aubrey Plaza) plays on his account and beats Ron. Tom insists to Ron that he is the "Scrabble king." Ron later reveals he knows Tom loses on purpose, but doesn't mind because Tom is his idea of a model employee: unproductive, lacking initiative and a poor team player.
