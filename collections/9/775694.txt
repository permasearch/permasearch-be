The patella also serves an articular body, and its posterior surface is referred to as the trochlea of the knee.[11] It is inserted into the thin anterior wall of the joint capsule.[8] On its posterior surface is a lateral and a medial articular surface,[9] both of which communicate with the patellar surface which unites the two femoral condyles on the anterior side of the bone's distal end.[12]
