Hip-hop group Theodore Unit (which includes Wu-Tang Clan member Ghostface Killah) released an album entitled 718, an homage to their home of Staten Island, which is contained within the 718 area code. Rapper/actor Mos Def refers to the 718 area code in his song "Sunshine", and in M.O.P.'s song "Ante Up", they mention "repping 1â€“718 dangerously".
