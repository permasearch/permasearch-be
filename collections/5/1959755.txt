During this time, The Authority were also feuding with Big Show, who as well as Bryan, was voicing his displeasure of Triple H's regime. As punishment for this, Show was placed in a 3-on-1 tornado handicap match against The Shield, which Show lost. He was then forced to sit at ringside during his friends' matches and watch them being attacked by members of The Authority at the risk of being fired. The Authority later claimed that Show was broke (kayfabe) and forced him to knock out the likes of Bryan and The Miz, again at the risk of being "fired".[15] At Battleground, Show interfered in the WWE Championship match between Bryan and Orton and knocked out both of them, sending a message to The Authority and causing the match to end in a no contest.[16] The following night on Raw, Show was "fired" by The Authority after he announced he was ordered to only knock out Bryan the night before. Following this, Show knocked out Triple H before being escorted by officials out of the arena.[17] After Stephanie McMahon took possession of Show's house and Triple H banned him from WWE for life (kayfabe), Show began to run-in and attack various superstars over the next several weeks until the November 4 episode of Raw, when The Authority was forced by the Board of Directors to give Show whatever he wanted in return for not suing the company. Show asked for his job back and a WWE Championship match against Orton at Survivor Series, which he received. At the pay-per-view, Orton successfully retained his title.[18]
