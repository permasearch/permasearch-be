Scandium is distributed sparsely and occurs in trace amounts in many minerals.[67] Rare minerals from Scandinavia[68] and Madagascar[69] such as gadolinite, euxenite, and thortveitite are the only known concentrated sources of this element, the latter containing up to 45% of scandium in the form of scandium(III) oxide.[68] Yttrium has the same trend in occurrence places; it is found in lunar rock samples collected during the American Apollo Project in a relatively high content as well.[70]
