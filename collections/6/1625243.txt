The TKTS booth, theater development fund, and broadway show producers have come under fire in recent years around their claimed "50% Off" ticket prices.[6] The prevailing belief is that TKTS offers 50% off of the normal sale price of a ticket, when in fact, those tickets are often subject to markups through a practice called "Dynamic Pricing." [7] As Broadway Producer Ken Davenport states in multiple articles and seminars, Dynamic Pricing is applied in theaters to help a show get more money for a seat.[8][9][10] There have also been several documented case studies where a ticket found at the theater at full price for $89 to Kinky Boots, which is a Ken Davenport production, were sold at the TKTS booth at "50% off" for $75 plus the $5 TDF Fee.[11] The same case studies found similar incidents at Chicago, Phantom of the Opera, and Jersey Boys at the time.
