Whipping occurred during the French Revolution, though not as official punishment. On 31 May 1793, the Jacobin women seized a revolutionary leader, Anne Josephe Theroigne de Mericourt, stripped her naked, and flogged her on the bare bottom in the public garden of the Tuileries.  After this humiliation, she refused to wear any clothes, in memory of the outrage she had suffered.[5] She went mad and ended her days in an asylum after the public whipping.
