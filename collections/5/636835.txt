The Rascal Flatts version subsequently became a hit on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, where it peaked at number No. 7. Even though it was not officially released to country radio, many country stations played the song as an album cut, overlapping with their then-current country single "My Wish". The unsolicited country airplay brought "Life Is a Highway" to number No. 18 on the US Country Song chart. The song has sold 3.4 million copies in the US as of June 2016.[9]
