Android fat distribution describes the distribution of human adipose tissue mainly around the trunk and upper body, in areas such as the abdomen, chest, shoulder and nape of the neck.[1] This pattern may lead to an "apple-shaped" body or central obesity, and is more common in males than in females. Thus, the android fat distribution of men is about 48.6%, which is 10.3% higher than that of premenstrual women.[2] In other cases, an ovoid shape forms which does not differentiate between men and women.Generally during early adulthood, females tend to have a more peripheral fat distribution such that their fat is evenly distributed over their body. However, it has been found that as females age, bear children and approach menopause, this distribution shifts towards the android pattern of fat distribution [3] resulting in a 42.1% increase in android body fat distribution in postmenstrual women.[2] This is to help centre a woman's gravity making her more stable when carrying offspring.[1]
