The prognosis after myocardial infarction varies greatly depending on the extent and location of the affected heart muscle, and the development and management of complications.[15] Prognosis is worse with older age, and social isolation.[15] Anterior infarcts, persistent ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, development of heart blocks, and left ventricular impairment are all associated with poorer prognosis.[15] Without treatment, about a quarter of those affected by MI die within minutes, and about forty percent within the first month.[15] Morbidity and mortality from myocardial infarction has however improved over the years due to earlier and better treatment:[25] in those who have an STEMI in the United States, between 5 and 6 percent die before leaving the hospital and 7 to 18 percent die within a year.[18]
