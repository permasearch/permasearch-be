In July 2009, Pilot agreed to purchase Flying J's travel centers, as a part of Flying J's efforts to remove itself from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[7] The deal was finalized July 1, 2010, and the combined company took the d.b.a. name Pilot Flying J,[8] while Pilot Travel Centers LLC remained the company's legal name.[2]
