After its September 1961 premiere, the series struggled in the ratings. In an effort to improve viewership, NBC decided to "readjust" the series in the second season, beginning with several characters dropped (Joey's mother, sister Stella, brother Larry, brother-in-law Frank, and girlfriend Barbara Simpson. Several crew members were also dismissed), and a new context for the series in which Joey becomes a TV personality. The changes helped the series' ratings in the second season.[7]
