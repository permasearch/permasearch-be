Aeronautical voice communication is also conducted in other frequency bands, including satellite voice on Inmarsat or Iridium,[7] and high frequency voice. Usually these other frequency bands are only used in oceanic and remote areas, though they work over wider areas or even globally. Military aircraft also use a dedicated UHF-AM band from 225.0–399.95 MHz for air-to-air and air-to-ground, including air traffic control communication. This band has a designated emergency and guard channel of 243.0 MHz.[2][8]
