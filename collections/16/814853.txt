Jonathan Crompton started at quarterback for the first four games of the 2008 season and went 1â€“3, after which he was replaced by sophomore Nick Stephens. B. J. Coleman was the third quarterback on the roster. Clawson's appointment introduced problems with the Volunteer's offense, leading to one of the worst performing offenses under then-Head Coach Phillip Fulmer's career. Clawson's offense was focused primarily on the short game (strong running and short-range passing) which was in large contrast to UT's quarterbacks who spent their high school careers primarily throwing the ball deep. The Vols posted a dismal 5-7 record in the 2008 season, resulting in Fulmer's ouster at the end of the season. The athletic department had to come up with $6 million for Fulmer's total buyout, which would be paid over 48 months in equal installments.[22][23]
