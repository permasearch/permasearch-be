The Movement claims 6000 members with facilities located in San Diego, California, and Parksdale, New York, with a retreat center located in Cusco, Peru. Most practice Meyerism in everyday lives, while others have taken vows of service and dedicate themselves to counseling, recruitment and outreach programs. However, founder Stephen Meyer warned against media attention, that the movement should remain small and publicity should be kept to a minimum. Spiritual progress is evaluated on an ascending series of rungs from 1R to 10R, with many decisions made by the senior membership or Upper Rungs (U.R.). Meyerists practice meditation and use biofeedback devices and drugs—including ayahuasca and cannabis—to aid in reaching deeper levels of consciousness, and put considerable stock in visions and intuition which are believed to be The Light trying to communicate with them.
