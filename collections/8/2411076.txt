Originally, NBN Co planned for a more centralised model with only 14 POIs; however, it was overruled by the Federal Government on the advice from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). The ACCC considered the plan to be 'mission creep' and would have given NBN Co a monopoly over backhaul; however, NBN Co said centralised model would have allowed smaller RSPs to connect without going through a wholesale aggregator.[23] ACCC recommended 121 Pols after public consultation.[20]
