The regular season begins in December and ends in April. At the end of the regular season, the top three teams in each of the divisions make the playoffs to compete for the Champion's Cup. The two regular season division champions earn a first-round bye as top seeds. The 2nd seed hosts the 3rd seed in their division for a single-game elimination Division Semifinal. Starting in 2018, the Division Final is also a single-game elimination. The finals are best-of-three series.[5]
