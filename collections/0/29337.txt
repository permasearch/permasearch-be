Voting for most offices was open to all full Roman citizens, a group that excluded women, slaves and originally those living outside of Rome. In the early Republic the electorate would have been small, but as Rome grew it expanded. The Lex Julia of 90 BCE extending voting rights to citizens across Italy greatly expanded the franchise. By the final Republican census of 70 BCE there were 910,000 possible electors.[25]
