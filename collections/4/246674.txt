Silver has a brilliant white metallic luster that can take a high polish,[12] and which is so characteristic that the name of the metal itself has become a colour name.[9] Unlike copper and gold, the energy required to excite an electron from the filled d band to the s-p conduction band in silver is large enough (around 385 kJ/mol) that it no longer corresponds to absorption in the visible region of the spectrum, but rather in the ultraviolet; hence silver is not a coloured metal.[9] Protected silver has greater optical reflectivity than aluminium at all wavelengths longer than ~450 nm.[13] At wavelengths shorter than 450 nm, silver's reflectivity is inferior to that of aluminium and drops to zero near 310 nm.[14]
