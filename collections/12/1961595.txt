Marty has a photograph of herself with John, whom she feels a connection to, and when Marty asks about who the man in the picture is, Todd feeds Marty several lies, telling her that John is the man who left her to die. Todd begins to feed Marty a slanted, selective version of their shared history, claiming that they were friends in college, and colorfully embroidering the truth to claim that John stole his wife and family from him. When Marty pressures Todd for more information about the past, Todd tells Marty that she was gang raped in college, while not letting on that he was involved. Marty comes to rely on Todd as a caretaker during her slow rehabilitation, and finds herself growing close to the man he represents himself to be. Todd begins telling Marty that she is his only confidant during his estrangement from Blair and his daughter Starr. When Blair becomes suspicious of Todd "mystery woman" in his house, he claims that the unidentified woman is his new girlfriend and that their connection is "deeper than sex." Todd nonetheless allows himself to enjoy his and Marty's "friendship" while he deceives her. On August 18, 2008, Marty has a nightmare, in which she begins remembering her rape.[20] Later that night, she dreams of John, who warns her that Todd is lying to her.
