In December, however, Bangladesh bounced back from the previous lackluster performances by threatening to win the first Test match against Sri Lanka at home by chasing down the highest fourth innings total of 513. Though they fell 107 runs short, their performances were praised.[98] But in the second test match of this home series in January, Bangladesh succumbed to a 465 runs defeat, conceding the series 2-0 to Sri Lanka.[99] Then Zimbabwe joined the hosts and the Lankan team for a tri-series ODI tournament, which proved to be more evenly matched than was expected. In the first match, Zimbabwe defeated Bangladesh by an excellent performance, but then was defeated by Sri Lanka by a huge margin, leaving Bangladesh needing to win with a bonus point against the Lankans in the last group match to go through to the finals to join the Lankans. In a reduced match due to rain interruptions Bangladesh recorded their second ODI win over Sri Lanka to reach the finals. However at the Finals, they were beaten by the Lankans who claimed the Series.[100]
