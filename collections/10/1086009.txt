Setting aside time to give thanks for one's blessings, along with holding feasts to celebrate a harvest, are both practices that long predate the European settlement of North America. The first documented thanksgiving services in territory currently belonging to the United States were conducted by Spaniards[1] and the French[2] in the 16th century. Thanksgiving services were routine in what became the Commonwealth of Virginia as early as 1607,[3] with the first permanent settlement of Jamestown, Virginia holding a thanksgiving in 1610.[1] In 1619, the Berkeley Hundred colony held a service on December 4, 1619, to celebrate “the day of our ship’s arrival” and proclaimed the date would be “yearly and perpetually kept holy as a day of thanksgiving to the Almighty God.”[4] The colony was wiped out shortly after, in March 1722, with some inhabitants being massacred, and the rest fleeing.[5] The generally referenced 'First Thanksgiving' occurred on Plymouth Colony, shortly after the colonists first successful harvest in autumn of 1621. They celebrated for three straight days[6]with their Native American neighbors with whom they had signed a mutual protection treaty the Spring before.[1]
