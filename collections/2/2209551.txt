The PROC step consists of PROC statements that call upon named procedures. Procedures perform analysis and reporting on data sets to produce statistics, analyses and graphics. There are more than 300 procedures and each one contains a substantial body of programming and statistical work.[3] PROC statements can also display results, sort data or perform other operations.[4] SAS Macros are pieces of code or variables that are coded once and referenced to perform repetitive tasks.[7]
