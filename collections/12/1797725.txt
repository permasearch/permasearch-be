One of the largest draws for the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo is the 20 consecutive evenings of rodeo and concert, held in NRG Stadium.[37] Tickets are relatively inexpensive, averaging about $29 in 2016, and also grant admission to the livestock show and fairgrounds.[38] More than 43,000 season tickets are sold every year, with the remaining seats 30,000 seats available for individual-show sale.[38][39] Members of the HLSR are given an opportunity to buy individual tickets before the general public.[38]
