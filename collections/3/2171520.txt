In the U.S., the Final was split between NBC and NBCSN. NBCSN aired two games of the series while NBC aired the other five (if necessary).[12] On May 27, NBC Sports announced that if the series was tied at 1-1 entering game three, then it would have aired on NBC and game four televised on NBCSN. However, if one team led 2â€“0 (as this eventually happened), game three moved to NBCSN and then game four on NBC.[13] The games were broadcast nationally on radio via the NBC Sports Radio network.[14]
