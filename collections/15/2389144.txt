The dual-track system is cable driven and free for the public to use.  The eastern track has intermediate station stops. The western track only has stops at either end of the line â€“ Mandalay Bay and Excalibur. If only one train is running, it is the eastern track and it runs express to Mandalay Bay going south, but makes all stops returning north. During peak periods when both trains are running, they will both stop at all stations along its track.
