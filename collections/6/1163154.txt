Following the Soviet withdrawal, some of the foreign volunteers (including Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda)[251][252] and young Afghan refugees, went on to continue violent jihad in Afghanistan, Pakistan and abroad. Some of the thousands of Afghan Arabs who left Afghanistan went on to become "capable leaders, religious ideologues and military commanders," who played "vital roles" as insurgents or terrorists in places such as Algeria, Egypt, Bosnia and Chechnya.[253] Tens of thousands of Afghan refugee children in Pakistan were educated in madrasses "in a spirit of conservatism and religious rigor", and went on to fill the ranks and leadership of the Taliban in Afghanistan and Sipah-e-Sahaba in Pakistan.[254] The groups embodied new varieties of Political Islam â€“ "Salafi jihadism" among the foreign volunteers,[251][252] and a "hybrid" Deobandi jihadism among the madrassa-educated.[254]
