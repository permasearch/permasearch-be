The series is noted for its high quality of acting talent, and is one of the aspects of the films that is always praised.[128][129][130][131][132][133] The visual and practical effects are considered some of the best ever done on film,[132][133][134][135] so much so that audiences believed certain CGI elements of the films were real and done practically.[136][137][138][139] However, the plots of the four sequels have received mixed reviews, with the general consensus that they are too bloated and convoluted to follow.[140][141][142][143][144] Pirates of the Caribbean is noted for reinvigorating the pirate genre of film after decades of either no pirate films or failed pirate films.[145] The success of the series saw Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer try to replicate the franchise's success by launching films such as Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and The Lone Ranger, the latter of which directed by Gore Verbinski. Both movies failed critically and commercially.[146][147][148][149]
