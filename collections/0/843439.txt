Based on the success of American Top 40, Kasem and Don Bustany created a spinoff top 40 countdown for Watermark for Country Radio called American Country Countdown, patterned after Kasem's program. "ACC" premiered in 1973, and was hosted by Don Bowman until 1978, then by Bob Kingsley until 2005 when Kix Brooks of the late country music duo Brooks & Dunn took over, and has been doing so since. Kingsley now hosts a separate countdown, Country Top 40 (abbreviating, not coincidentally, as "CT40"), which follows the same format as AT40 and ACC.
