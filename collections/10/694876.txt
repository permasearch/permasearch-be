Away from its native area, it is also extensively used in forestry as a plantation tree for timber in Europe, New Zealand, Chile and elsewhere. It is also naturalised throughout Europe,[10] Argentina and Chile (called Pino OregÃ³n), and in New Zealand sometimes to the extent of becoming an invasive species (termed a wilding conifer) subject to control measures.
