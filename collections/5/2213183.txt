During the night of the election, OANN announced that Moore had swept the election "by a large margin" when in actuality, Moore ended up losing the race.[37] In its announcement, the network cited "unofficial polling" and the news anchor then extended the OAN CEO Robert Herring's congratulations to Moore on having run a "fine campaign."[37] OAN's website also published an erroneous article claiming that Moore had won, writing that he won "despite attacks from democrats about unverified allegations."[37] During election night, OAN also said that it had "reports that a number of people have been caught trying to sneak into voting booths and vote illegally"; however, Alabama Secretary of Stateâ€™s office said that it had no credible reports of voter fraud.[38]
