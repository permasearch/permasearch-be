Kerala has three international airports: Trivandrum International Airport, Cochin International Airport  and Calicut International Airport. All civilian airports operating in the state are international ones, a feature which is unique to Kerala, which is the only state in India without a purely domestic airport. Upon completion of the Kannur International Airport, Kerala will have the most international airports (4) along with Tamil Nadu. Unlike other states where the capital city has the highest air traffic, air traffic in Kerala is distributed evenly between Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram, and Kozhikode, which are among the top 15 busiest airports in India.
