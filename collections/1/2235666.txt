Early shunting locomotives often had a pilot with steps on it to allow yard workers to ride on the locomotive; these were called footboard pilots.  In some countries, footboard pilots are outlawed for safety reasons, and have been removed. Modern locomotives often have front and rear platforms with safety rails where workers can ride.
