Walid Muallem, the Syrian foreign minister told journalists at a press conference in Damascus their armed forces "did not and will not" use chemical weapons, even against "terror groups" fighting against the Syrian government. He also said "the first reports of the chemical attack appeared several hours before the government airstrike, indicating that the chemical attack may have been a cruel and cynical 'false flag' operation used by the jihadists in a bid for US support."[18] Muallem also promised to provide information to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and the United Nations regarding the transfer of chemical substances from Iraq to Syria, or from Turkey to Syria.[73]
