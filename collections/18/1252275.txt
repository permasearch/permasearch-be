FXX announced that this season would see a change in the time period once again, with this series taking place in 1938. Along with the change in time period, the network announced that although the same voice cast will return as in previous seasons, they will again play different versions of their characters. This means that Archer, who was found shot in actress Veronica Deane's pool at the conclusion of season seven, will remain in a coma, and the events of the season are of his imagination.
