The cause is typically unknown.[1] It is believed to be due to genetic susceptibility that is triggered by an environmental factor such that an autoimmune disease occurs.[1][2] This results in the destruction of skin pigment cells.[2] Risk factors include a family history of the condition or other autoimmune diseases, such as hyperthyroidism, alopecia areata, and pernicious anemia.[2] It is not contagious.[4] Vitiligo is classified into two main types: segmental and non-segmental.[1] Most cases are non-segmental, meaning they affect both sides; and in these cases, the affected area of the skin typically expands with time.[1] About 10% of cases are segmental, meaning they mostly involve one side of the body; and in these cases, the affected area of the skin typically does not expand with time.[1] Diagnosis can be confirmed by tissue biopsy.[2]
