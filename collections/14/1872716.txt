A storyline broadcast in 1985 revealed that, at some time in Port Charles' history, a large ghetto area known as the Asian Quarter was built to house the city's Asian population. Racial discrimination in the city has been a point of tension many times; minority residents were reportedly denied housing and bank loans in the mid-20th century, and one of Port Charles' first African-American council members, the character Bradley Ward II, faced racist opposition from his white counterparts in the 1970s (he was later murdered). Homosexuality became a topic after Bobbie Spencer's adopted son Lucas Jones was the victim of a gay basher. Other plots have dealt with issues such as the planned construction of a polluting incinerator near the city's ethnic neighborhoods.
