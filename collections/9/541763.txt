On August 26, 2014, at roughly 9:20Â p.m., a Cops crew was recording in Omaha, Nebraska, with the Omaha Police Department, during their final week working in Omaha since arriving in June. A police officer pulled up to a Wendy's restaurant during an armed robbery and called for backup. One of the other responding officers had a Cops crew (consisting of an unnamed cameraman and audio technician Bryce Dion) present in their cruiser. The crew began recording the robbery inside Wendy's.[21][22]
