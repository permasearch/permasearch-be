In Texas, a patron must be so obviously intoxicated that he presents a clear danger to himself and others. Dram shops are able to protect themselves from any claims of liability provided they are able to prove that they require all their employees to attend a TABC-approved “seller training program” and that the employee accused of over-serving an intoxicated individual actually attended the program.[17] If these criteria are met, then any plaintiff seeking to sue the dram shop must prove that the employer either directly or indirectly encouraged said employee to violate the Texas Dram Shop Act in order for there to be liability. This dram shop immunity is called "The Safe Harbor."[18]
