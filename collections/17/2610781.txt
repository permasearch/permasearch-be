On 20 December 2014, Chibnall revealed that a blue clapboard chalet is integral to the mystery presented in series two. Chibnall said the chalet is where "lots — if not all — of the secrets" of series two are hidden, and that the chalet (just 200 yards (180 m) from the site of Danny's murder in series one, according to the show's geography) will be seen in the first minute of episode one.[32]
