The Bronx (/brɒŋks/) is the northernmost of the five boroughs of New York City, in the U.S. state of New York. It is south of Westchester County; north and east of Manhattan, across the Harlem River; and north of Queens, across the East River. Since 1914, the borough has had the same boundaries as Bronx County, the third-most densely populated county in the United States.[2]
