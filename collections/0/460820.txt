In the DCnU revamp, Doomsday was revealed to grow and evolve in stages since its genesis. Growing as well as gaining in biomass and power over the course of its own development cycle, it was soon revealed that when it killed superman post reboot it was only in its larval stage.[33] While undergoing its adolescence phase the monster created a giant clump of its own biomass as a makeshift cocoon which steadily built up its physiological structure to its current state by feeding on the natural wildlife around it. Whence it hatched from its incubator, Doomsday became only that much greater an extinction level threat. Now able to move to and from the phantom zone at will using it as a hub for spontaneous teleportation.[34] This was made possible due to its physical strength being vastly augmented to the point it could breach the dimensional barrier through physical force alone.[35] He'd grown so powerful in such a short amount of time that the creature could overpower the demigoddess Diana of Themyscira in a straight forward battle with ease, going so far as to break both of her arms.[36]
