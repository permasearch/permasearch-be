Camp Meetings were a regular feature of Primitive Methodist life throughout the 19th century,[17] and still survive in other forms today. The annual late May Bank Holiday weekend meetings at Cliff College[5] are one example. A number of tents are set up around the site, each featuring a different preacher.
