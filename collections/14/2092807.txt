The Rhode Island Red was developed as dual-purpose breed, to provide both meat and eggs. Since about 1940, it has been selectively bred predominantly for egg-laying qualities, and the modern industrial Rhode Island Red is a layer breed. Rhode Island Reds have been used in the creation of many modern hybrid breeds, mainly due to the prolific egg laying abilities of the Rhode Island Red.[citation needed]
