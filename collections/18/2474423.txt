In Freemasonry, as practiced in North American lodges, top hats are often associated with the position of Worshipful Master as he is the only member allowed the privilege of wearing one, or another appropriate head covering to signify his leadership within the lodge. It is also common for a Worshipful Master to receive top-hat-related trinkets and gifts on either the day of his installation or as a going away present.[32] In other countries, especially in certain systems in Germany, top hats are worn by all members of the lodge.
