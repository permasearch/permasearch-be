Between 1890 and 2001, churchgoing in the United Kingdom declined steadily.[93] In the years 1968 to 1999, Anglican Sunday church attendances almost halved, from 3.5 per cent of the population to 1.9 per cent.[94] By the year 2014, Sunday church attendances had declined further to 1.4 per cent of the population.[95] One study published in 2008 suggested that if current trends were to continue, Sunday attendances could fall to 350,000 in 2030 and just 87,800 in 2050.[96]
