Andhra Pradesh was created in 1956 by the merger of the Telangana region of Hyderabad State into Andhra State. Two chief ministers each from the Indian National Congress party had served these predecessor states. The first Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh was Neelam Sanjiva Reddy, later the sixth President of India. Including him, 13 out of 16 chief ministers belonged to the Congress party. Among these is P. V. Narasimha Rao, who went on to become the ninth Prime Minister of India. The remaining three chief ministers were from the Telugu Desam Party, including N. Chandrababu Naidu, the longest-serving Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh (over eleven years). Naidu is also the current incumbent, serving since 8 June 2014, a few days after Telangana was officially carved out of Andhra Pradesh into a separate state.
