After a years-long restoration process by Gabellini Sheppard Associates, it reopened to the public on October 5, 2014, with Tishman Speyer as the new owner and operator.[73] The renovation included the landmarked dance floor and a new cocktail lounge called Bar SixtyFive.[73][74] However, the Rainbow Grill was not included in the reopened restaurant's floor plan; that space was instead taken up by SixtyFive.[75] According to the new operating schedule, the Rainbow Room's only public operating hours were on Sunday mornings and afternoons, and on Monday nights; the rest of the time, the restaurant is used for private celebrations.[76] In 2017, the Rainbow Room won an award for interior architecture from the American Institute of Architects.[77][78]
