The Rockers redebuted at a WWF live event on July 7, 1988.[19] Due to WWF chairman Vince McMahon's desire to have his performers carry WWF-exclusive ring names, Michaels and Jannetty were renamed, as simply The Rockers.[3] The team proved popular with both children and women[6] and was a mid-card stalwart of television and pay-per-view shows for the next two years.[20] During this time, Michaels headlined his first pay-per-view for the WWF when The Rockers were involved in the 4-on-4 Survivor Series match main event of the 1989 Survivor Series.[21]
