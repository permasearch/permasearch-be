Saudi Arabia was a subsistence economy until the 1930s. During the 1973 oil crisis Saudi began to grow rapidly and peaked around 1980.[26] In the mid 1980s the oil price dropped from a high of US$40 per barrel to around US$5, and the country built up a massive overseas debt.[22] From 2002 to mid-2008 oil prices recovered,[22] allowing the government to post budget surpluses, and boost spending.[citation needed]
