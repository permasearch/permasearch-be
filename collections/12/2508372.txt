Kierkegaard provides an example in one of his works, Fear and Trembling. In the story of Abraham in the Book of Genesis, Abraham is told by God to kill his son Isaac. Just as Abraham is about to kill Isaac, an angel stops Abraham from doing so. Kierkegaard believes that through virtue of the absurd, Abraham, defying all reason and ethical duties ("you cannot act"), got back his son and reaffirmed his faith ("where I have to act").[15] However, it should be noted that in this particular case, the work was signed with the pseudonym Johannes de Silentio.
