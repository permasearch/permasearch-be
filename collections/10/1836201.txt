Punch historian M. H. Spielmann, who knew Tenniel, wrote that the political clout contained in his Punch cartoons was capable of "swaying parties and people, too... (the cartoons) exercised great influence" on the ideas of popular reform skirting throughout the British public.[citation needed] Two days after his death, the Daily Graphic recalled Tenniel: "He had an influence on the political feeling of this time which is hardly measurable...While Tenniel was drawing them (his subjects), we always looked to the Punch cartoon to crystallize the national and international situation, and the popular feeling about it—and never looked in vain."[35][page needed] This condition of social influence resulted from the weekly publishing over a fifty-year span of his political cartoons, whereby Tenniel's fame allowed for a want and need for his particular illustrative work, away from the newspaper. Tenniel became not only one of Victorian Britain's most published illustrators, but as a Punch cartoonist he became one of the "supreme social observers" of British society, and an integral component of a powerful journalistic force.[citation needed] Also in 1914, the New York Tribune journalist George W. Smalley referred to John Tenniel as "one of the greatest intellectual forces of his time, (who) understood social laws and political energies."[citation needed]
