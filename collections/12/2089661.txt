Soon after his bout of illness subsided, Augustus gave up his consulship.[135] The only other times Augustus would serve as consul would be in the years 5 and 2Â BC,[135][139] both times to introduce his grandsons into public life.[131] This was a clever ploy by Augustus; ceasing to serve as one of two annually elected consuls allowed aspiring senators a better chance to attain the consular position, while allowing Augustus to exercise wider patronage within the senatorial class.[140] Although Augustus had resigned as consul, he desired to retain his consular imperium not just in his provinces but throughout the empire. This desire, as well as the Marcus Primus Affair, led to a second compromise between him and the Senate known as the Second Settlement.[141]
