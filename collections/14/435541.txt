Flying Rhino is a Kung Fu Master who is the father and trainer of Thundering Rhino. He once used an armor in a bloody fight against the warriors of the Guangdong Province. Although he triumphed in that battle, his armor still bears the battle scars caused by the butterfly knives used by the lizard assassins that managed to get close to him. There was also a reference that Flying Rhino has also trained Vachir and had recommended him to Oogway to be in charge of Tai Lung's incarceration at Chorh-Gom Prison as Flying Rhino stated that Vachir was brave enough, strong enough, and ruthless enough for the job.
