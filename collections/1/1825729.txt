The last oil producer allied to Taiwan was Chad. But in April 2006, a PRC-Sudan backed coup d'Ã©tat attempt came close to overthrowing the pro-Taiwanese leader, Idriss Deby. The effort was eventually stopped by French military intervention. Deby first looked for Taiwanese loans to enhance its military strength. Taiwan was unable to provide the $2 billion which had been requested, and Deby switched to recognising the PRC, thus weakening the coup and strengthening himself.[104] Today, four countries in Africa recognize ROC-Taiwan.
