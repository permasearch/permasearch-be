The height of each storey is based on the ceiling height of the rooms plus the thickness of the floors between each pane. Generally this is around 10 feet (3.0 m) total; however, it varies widely from just under this figure to well over it. Storeys within a building need not be all the same height—often the lobby is taller, for example. Additionally, higher levels may have less floor area than the ones beneath them (e.g., the Willis Tower).
