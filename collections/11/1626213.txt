The name Australia was specifically applied to the continent for the first time in 1794 [5] with the botanists George Shaw and Sir James Smith writing of "the vast island, or rather continent, of Australia, Australasia or New Holland" in their 1793 Zoology and Botany of New Holland,[14] and James Wilson including it on a 1799 chart.[15]
