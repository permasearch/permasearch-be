This period is characterised by finely made pounamu weapons and ornaments, elaborately carved canoes – a tradition that was later extended to and continued in elaborately carved meeting houses (wharenui)[40] – and a fierce warrior culture. They developed fortified hillforts known as pā, practiced cannibalism[41][42][43] and built some of the largest war canoes ever.
