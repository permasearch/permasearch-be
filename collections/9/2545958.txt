David Stronach has suggested that there were originally four such figures, set against doorways to the Palace of Cyrus in Pasargadae.[15] That this bas-relief has such an eclectic styling with elements of Egyptian, Elamite, and Assyrian, reflects "..'the oecumenical attitude of the Achaemenian kings, who from the time of Cyrus, onward adopted a liberal policy of tolerance and conciliation toward the various religions embraced within their empire'..."[15] It would therefore depict the eclectic nature of Achaemenid life from policies of the kings to their choice of architecture.
