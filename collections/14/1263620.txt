The health risks posed by the ingestion of Tide Pods—particularly by children—have been noted by several media outlets.[3][4][5] In March 2013, Consumer Reports reported that "since early 2012, poison-control centers nationwide have received reports of nearly 7,700 pod-related exposures to children age 5 years and younger."[6] In 2012 and 2013, one child was admitted to the hospital every day as a result of eating Tide Pods. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tagged them as a health risk in 2012.[7][8] Consumer Reports noted that "swallowing conventional detergent might result in mild stomach upset, but with highly concentrated detergent pods the ingestion can cause excessive vomiting, lethargy, and gasping, and in some reported cases, victims stopped breathing and required ventilation support."[6] Individuals suffering from dementia have been reported to face health risks related to Tide Pods.[9][10] Consumer Reports reported that between the Tide pods' introduction in 2012 through early 2017, eight deaths had been reported due to the ingestion of laundry detergent pods, with six of the eight deaths resulting from a pod manufactured by P&G.[1]
