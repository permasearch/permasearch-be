Tom Burlinson has confirmed that it was definitely him who rode the horse over the side of the mountain for the "terrible descent" during the dangerous rideâ€”commenting that he had been asked about this numerous times, and that he became known as "The Man from Snowy River" because of his ride.[6] Remarkably, Burlinson had never ridden a horse before being cast in the film and the "terrible descent" was a one-take shot at full gallop down the cliff face. Burlinson performed all of his own stunts in the film.
