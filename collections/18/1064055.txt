Fan response to the character has also been positive.[31][42][43] Collins believed that the character would end up being just another role for him, and never expected such a reaction from the fans.[44] According to him, "The enthusiasm that I've been met with is something new and not something I'm really prepared for."[42] The character was originally intended for only a six-episode story arc,[43] but his role was rewritten to continue throughout the rest of the season.[30] Upon Supernatural's renewal for a fifth season, Collins was promoted to a series regular, something he believes to be mainly due to fan support.[44]
