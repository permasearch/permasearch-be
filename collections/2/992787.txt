Pervasive levels of ethnic labour market discrimination are found in Belgium, Greece, Ireland, Sweden and the UK.[48][49][50][51][52] Job candidates with foreign names are found to get 24% to 52% less job interview invitations compared to equal candidates with native names. Interestingly, ethnic discrimination is lower among the high-educated and in larger firms.[52][53] In addition, unequal treatment is found to be heterogeneous by the labour market tightness in the occupation: compared to natives, candidates with a foreign-sounding name are equally often invited to a job interview if they apply for occupations for which vacancies are difficult to fill, but they have to send twice as many applications for occupations for which labor market tightness is low.[48] Recent research shows that ethnic discrimination is nowadays driven by employers' concern that co-workers and customers prefer collaborating with natives.[54] In addition, volunteering has found to be a way out of ethnic discrimination in the labour market.[55]
