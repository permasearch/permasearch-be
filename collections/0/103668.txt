Guadagnino shot the film in chronological order,[18][70] which allowed the filmmakers to "witness the onscreen maturity of both protagonist and actor".[71] The scene where Mr. Perlman delivered an educational speech to Elio was filmed the day before shooting wrapped.[23][18] Stuhlbarg spent months to prepare for the scene,[23][45] one that Guadagnino wanted to make "as simple as possible" by taking less setups and "let the actors be."[72] According to Fasano, the scene took three takes, where Stuhlbarg was "on three different levels of getting emotional."[71] During the dancing sequence, Hammer had to perform in front of "50 extras off camera," with the music being turned down to record the dialogue. "That was not fun, I don't really enjoy dancing," Hammer said.[40] The filmmakers laid a long camera dolly track and shot the scene where Elio confronts his feelings for Oliver in one take, to provide the flexibility and the "flow of emotion" that a cut scene could not.[73] Chalamet was listening to "Visions of Gideon", one of the original songs written for the film, in an earpiece, while filming the final sequence,[74][75] in which the director asked him to perform for three variations, one per take.[76]
