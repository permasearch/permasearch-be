Often, no symptoms are seen with an A. lumbricoides infection. However, in the case of a particularly bad infection, symptoms may include bloody sputum, cough, fever, abdominal discomfort, intestinal ulcer, and passing worms.[11][12] Ascariasis is also the most common cause of LÃ¶ffler's syndrome worldwide. Accompanying symptoms include pulmonary infiltration, eosinophilia, and radiographic opacities.[13] Significant increases in fertility are observed in infected women.[14]
