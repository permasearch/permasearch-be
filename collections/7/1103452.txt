Paul Harvey ran a similar article in the column "A Point of View" for the Gadsden Times on August 26, 1975.[9] Entitled "What it is to be a farmer", the article did not contain the concept of God creating the farmer seen in his 1978 speech, but he still described the characteristics of a farmer.[9] Many of the same phrases made their way into his 1978 speech. The 1975 column was largely similar to a definition of a dirt farmer given by Boston B. Blackwood from Hartshorne, Oklahoma in a 1940 copy of The Farmer-Stockman.[10] This was copied verbatim in a September 10, 1949 letter to the editor of the Ellensburg Daily Record written by Tex Smith from Ellensburg, Washington.[11] Both the 1940 and 1975 columns share elements not included in the speech such as the statement that a farmer's wife won't let him starve.[9][10] In the "So God Made a Farmer" speech and Harvey's 1986 column, only two phrases and a few words remain from Blackwood's 1940 piece including the phrase, "can shape an axe handle from a persimmon sprout".[2][9][10]
