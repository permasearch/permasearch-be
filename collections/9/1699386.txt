The degree "Doctor of Naturopathy" ND may be awarded by any school granted authority to do so by the state. Representing the designation may only be granted by CNME Schools is false and misleading! None of the US schools accredited by the CNME are authorized by the state to grant the degree Doctor of Naturopathy (N.D.) they grant the degree "Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (NMD). As result sources notwithstanding the the sentence is saying nothing! The statement infers the claim to be universal, yet the designation only has legal standing in 4 states is also misleading.
