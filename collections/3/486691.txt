In October 2013, Wright revealed that he was in Los Angeles to work on Ant-Man by tweeting a photograph from the production of the June 2012 test reel.[94] Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Paul Rudd were soon being considered for the lead role,[95] though Gordon-Levitt dismissed his consideration as a rumor.[96] Feige stated that Ant-Man would be a "heist movie", and that a casting announcement for Hank Pym would come before the end of 2013.[97] The next month, Feige stated that Eric O'Grady's Ant-Man would not be featured in the film,[98] while Rudd became the front-runner to play Hank Pym, and casting for the character's girlfriend had begun.[99] Around that time, the filmmakers' intentions to shoot in the United Kingdom were dashed because of a lack of studio space, which Wright believed was due to the plan by Pinewood Shepperton to add fifteen studios to their facility, which was rejected in part by the local council in May 2013 because the project was eyeing protected land.[100][101] By the end of the month, the film was scheduled to be shot in the U.S. instead.[102]
