A centaur-like half-human half-equine creature called Polkan appeared in Russian folk art, and lubok prints of the 17thâ€“19th centuries. Polkan is originally based on Pulicane, a half-dog from Andrea da Barberino's poem I Reali di Francia, which was once popular in the Slavonic world in prosaic translations.
