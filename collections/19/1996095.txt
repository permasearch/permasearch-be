For most of the Japanese colonial period, the Taiwanese were banned from service in the military of Imperial Japan.  However, starting in 1937, Taiwanese were permitted to enlist, for support duties.  In 1942 the Imperial Army's and in 1943 the Imperial Navy's respective: Special Volunteers Acts allowed Taiwanese to volunteer for those services' combat arms.  In 1944 and 1945 respectively those programs were replaced in Taiwan with systematic conscription.  207,183 Taiwanese served in the military of Imperial Japan.  In addition, thousands of aboriginal men volunteered from 1937 onwards, eventually being taken out of support and placed in special commando type units due to their skills in jungle warfare.
