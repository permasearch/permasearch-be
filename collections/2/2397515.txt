Following the defeat of the Axis Powers in World War II, the term "fascist" has been used as a pejorative,[62] often referring to widely varying movements across the political spectrum.[63] George Orwell wrote in 1944 that "the word 'Fascism' is almost entirely meaninglessÂ ... almost any English person would accept 'bully' as a synonym for 'Fascist'".[63]
