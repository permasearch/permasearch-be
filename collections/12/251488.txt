The slightly narrower cards are more suitable for games such as bridge and some types of poker, where a number of cards must be held or concealed in a player's hand. In most USA casino poker games, plastic bridge (narrow) sized cards are used; this is for both ease of use and dealing, and the plastic cards last much longer than paper decks. Casino shuffling machines have traditionally been designed for "bridge" (narrow) size cards for these reasons. In other table games, such as 21 (blackjack), a modern casino may use hundreds or even thousands of decks per day, so paper cards are used for those, for economic reasons. "Poker" (wide) size paper decks are used for 21 and other similar games. Other sizes are also available, such as a smaller 'patience' size (usually 1 3⁄4 × 2 3⁄8 inches (44 × 60 mm)) and larger 'jumbo' ones for card tricks.
