A popular belief in Japan is that a person's ABO blood type is predictive of their personality, character, and compatibility with others. This belief is also widespread in South Korea[40] and Taiwan. The theory reached Japan in a 1927 psychologist's report, and the government of the time commissioned a study aimed at breeding better soldiers.[40] Interest in the theory faded in the 1930s. Ultimately, the discovery of DNA in the following decades indicated that DNA instead had an important role in both heredity generally and personality specifically. Interest in the theory was revived in the 1970s by Masahiko Nomi, a broadcaster with a background in law rather than science.[40] The theory is widely accepted in Japanese and South Korean popular culture.[41]
