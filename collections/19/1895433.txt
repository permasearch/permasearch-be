Four species found in the Challenger Deep are unknown from any other place in the oceans, one of which is representative of an endemic genus unique to the region. They are Resigella laevis and R. bilocularis, Nodellum aculeata, and Conicotheca nigrans (the unique genus).  All have tests that are mainly of transparent organic material which have small (about 100 nm) plates that appear to be clay.[29]
