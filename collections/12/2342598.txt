Although Parliament has approved the first two phases of construction, precise details of the plan and route have not been formalised, and are still open to negotiation and change. For example, the spur to Heathrow airport was dropped in 2015,[7] as was the HS1 to HS2 link, while the Crewe Hub has been added to the scheme.[8] In July 2017, the government introduced the Bill for Phase 2a, Birmingham to Crewe, to Parliament.[9] The sections either side of the Pennines are open to amended design to accommodate HS3 using sections of HS2 track.[10]
