Brown's verse begins with the lyric "Girl, I wanna fuck you right now,"[41] which is the antithesis of how Rihanna concludes the original interlude, sing "Ooh, I wanna fuck you right now."[4] Brown's verse continues with "Been a long time I've been missing your body/ Turn the lights down/ When I go down it's a private party."[41] Brown delivers his vocals in an aggressive and manipulative manner as he sings "Give it to her in the worst way, can't wait to blow her candles out."[46][47] At the end of the song, Rihanna performs new lyrics which were not included on the original 1 minute and 18 second interlude; "Remember how you did it/ If you still wanna kiss it/ Then come and get it."[46] According to Ben Rayner of the Toronto Sun, the instrumentation of "Birthday Cake" consists of "snaky, slurpy, bass-droppin' beats."[47] The song's lyrics revolve around sadomasochistic sexuality and dominance over men,[48] and consists mainly of oral sex metaphors, including the lyric "Doggy want the kitty."[47]
