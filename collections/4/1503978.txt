Founded in 1961, the Notre Dame rugby club was one of the oldest college rugby clubs in the Midwest, before the club was disbanded in 1995.[12] Notre Dame reinstated rugby in 2007, however, due in part to the "explosive growth of rugby in the nation's Catholic high schools" and Notre Dame's desire to offer a program to attract rugby-playing students.[13] Notre Dame began the 2007â€“08 season in Division 2, but their 8-1-1 record merited a promotion to Division 1 in the spring of 2008.[14]
