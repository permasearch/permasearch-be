Thedude35 from Bitch Stole my Remote gave a good review to the episode stating: "After a season that has been surprisingly mediocre so far, ‘The Cell’ reminds me why I fell in love with this show in the first place. There’s suspense, torture, some sexual tension and surprises at every turn. What more could we ask for?"[5]
