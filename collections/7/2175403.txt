On April 12, Chiang carried out a purge of thousands of suspected Communists and dissidents in Shanghai, and began large-scale massacres across the country collectively known as the "White Terror". Throughout April 1927, more than 12,000 people were killed in Shanghai. The killings drove most Communists from urban cities and into the rural countryside, where the KMT was less powerful.[31] In the year after April 1927, over 300,000 people died across China in anti-Communist suppression campaigns, executed by the KMT. One of the most famous quotes from Chiang (during that time) was that he would rather mistakenly kill 1,000 innocent people rather than allow one Communist to escape.[32] Some estimates claim the White Terror in China took millions of lives, most of them in the rural areas.  No concrete number can be verified.[33]  Chiang allowed Soviet agent and advisor Mikhail Borodin and Soviet general Vasily Bl√ºcher (Galens) "escape"  to safety after the purge.[34]
