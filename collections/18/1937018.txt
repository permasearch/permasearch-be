Baker claims that she only learned of his being unfaithful after they split, and talks of a turbulent and passionate love life.[134] Schwarzenegger has made it clear that their respective recollection of events can differ.[134] The couple first met six to eight months after his arrival in the U.S. Their first date was watching the first Apollo Moon landing on television.[20] They shared an apartment in Santa Monica, California for three and a half years, and having little money, they would visit the beach all day or have barbecues in the back yard.[20] Although Baker claims that when she first met Schwarzenegger, he had "little understanding of polite society" and she found him a turn-off, she says, "He's as much a self-made man as it's possible to beâ€”he never got encouragement from his parents, his family, his brother. He just had this huge determination to prove himself, and that was very attractive ... I'll go to my grave knowing Arnold loved me."[20]
