When Sal selects Richard to accompany her on a supply run to Ko Pha Ngan, Bugs warns him to keep his hands off her. While there they encounter the Americans Richard met in Ko Samui, who are preparing to search for the island and mention Richard's map. Richard lies to Sal that he did not give them a copy, and she readily talks him into having sex with her. On their return to the island, Richard lies to Françoise about having had sex with Sal. Things return to normal until a shark attack kills one of the community's fishermen and leaves another, Christo, severely injured. Sal refuses to compromise the community's secrecy by bringing medical help, and Christo is unable to travel to the mainland. His worsening condition affects the group's morale, so they isolate him in a tent despite Étienne's objections.
