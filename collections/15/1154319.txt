MÃ©ndez is also a hopeless womanizer, unable to remain faithful to just one woman (which mostly explains why his relationship with Vico ended in failure). He gets into a relationship with Augustina, a rich girl who gives Giovanni expensive gifts at the drop of a dime, wooing Giovanni to her feet. Although he is good at heart, some rich classmates consider him a sellout, which splits Giovanni between his devotion to one woman and his fixation for expensive gifts. But in spite of all that he continues going to school, and he is doing good with his personal life, family, friends, girls, fun activities, and as a member of RBD. He was also a member of "La Logia" (a secret society within the school hell-bent on getting scholarship students kicked out), until he betrays them to save Teo.
