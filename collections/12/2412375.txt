Carmen has been the subject of many recordings, beginning with early wax cylinder recordings of excerpts in the 1890s, a nearly complete performance in German from 1908 with Emmy Destinn in the title role,[92][93]  and a complete 1911 OpÃ©ra-Comique recording in French. Since then, many of the leading opera houses and artistes have recorded the work, in both studio and live performances.[94] Over the years many versions have been commended and reissued.[95][96] From the mid-1990s numerous video recordings have become available. These include David McVicar's Glyndebourne production of 2002, and the Royal Opera productions of 2007 and 2010, each designed by Francesca Zambello.[94]
