Throughout The Faerie Queene, Spenser creates "a network of allusions to events, issues, and particular persons in England and Ireland" including Mary, Queen of Scots, the Spanish Armada, the English Reformation, and even the Queen herself.[12] It is also known that James VI of Scotland read the poem, and was very insulted by Duessa â€“ a very negative depiction of his mother, Mary, Queen of Scots.[13] The Faerie Queene was then banned in Scotland. This led to a significant decrease in Elizabeth's support for the poem.[13] Within the text, both the Faerie Queene and Belphoebe serve as two of the many personifications of Queen Elizabeth, some of which are "far from complimentary".[12]
