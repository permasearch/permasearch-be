The agreement would have given the English the chance to pass through Orléans and strike into Bourges, the administrative capital of the Dauphin, which had been the primary motivator for the siege itself. Burgundy hurried to Paris in early April to persuade the English regent John of Bedford to take the offer. But Bedford, certain Orléans was on the verge of falling, refused to surrender his prize.  The disappointed Philip withdrew his Burgundian auxiliaries from the English siege in a huff.[24] The Burgundian contingent left on 17 April 1429,[25] which left the English with an extremely small army to prosecute the siege. The decision proved a lost opportunity, and a terrible mistake in the long run for the English.[26]
