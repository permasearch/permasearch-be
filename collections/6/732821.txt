The 10 year old Maxwell, having been raised in isolation on his father's countryside estate, did not fit in well at school.[26] The first year had been full, obliging him to join the second year with classmates a year his senior.[26] His mannerisms and Galloway accent struck the other boys as rustic. Having arrived on his first day of school wearing a pair of homemade shoes and a tunic, he earned the unkind nickname of "Daftie".[27] He never seemed to resent the epithet, bearing it without complaint for many years.[28] Social isolation at the Academy ended when he met Lewis Campbell and Peter Guthrie Tait, two boys of a similar age who were to become notable scholars later in life. They remained lifelong friends.[11]
