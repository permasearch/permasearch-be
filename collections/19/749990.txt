The first season focuses on Oliver rekindling his relationships and spending his nights hunting down and sometimes killing wealthy criminals as a hooded vigilante, following a list of names he discovered in a notebook belonging to his father. He uncovers Malcolm Merlyn's conspiracy to destroy "The Glades", a poorer section of the city that has become overridden with crime. John Diggle and Felicity Smoak assist Oliver in his crusade. Oliver also reconnects with ex-girlfriend, Laurel Lance, who is still angry over his role in her sister's presumed death. The first season features flashbacks to Oliver's time on the island, and how it changed him; flashbacks in subsequent seasons continue to show how Oliver spent his time and gains the skill-set that shapes him into a vigilante.[11]
