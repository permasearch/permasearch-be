When the Storm Comes Down is the third studio album by Flotsam and Jetsam, released in 1990. It was the last album with Troy Gregory on bass guitar, as he left the left in 1991 to join Prong. It was also the first Flotsam and Jetsam album not to include songwriting contributions by former bassist Jason Newsted, who at the time was in Metallica and co-wrote the band's first two albums.
