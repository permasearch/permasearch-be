The term "electrocution," coined about the time of the first use of the electric chair in 1890,[citation needed] originally referred only to electrical execution and not to accidental or suicidal electrical deaths.[citation needed] However, since no English word was available for non-judicial deaths due to electric shock, the word "electrocution" eventually took over as a description of all circumstances of electrical death judicial punishment or not.[citation needed]
