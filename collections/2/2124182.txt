The Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research or AcSIR is an Indian institute of national importance, headquartered at the CSIR Campus, Taramani, Chennai. The institute was established for the purpose of granting doctoral and post-doctoral degrees.[1][1] The establishment of the AcSIR allows for a centralised institution to manage this research. Creation of the AcSIR was enabled by legislation of the Lok Sabha in 2010.[1] This same legislation labelled the Academy as an "Institute of National Importance".[1]
