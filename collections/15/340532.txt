After meeting Emma during her brief time in the Wish Realm, Hook believes that she is his true love and spends the following years traveling the realms in search of her. One day, he finds himself in the Magical Forest, after Henry's call for help ends up bringing over both living versions of "Captain Hook." As he also heard Emma's name through the bottle, he assumes that she is also currently in the same realm and knocks out the original Hook, with plans to assume his identity and be the one who gets to go back with her. He finds Lady Tremaine, who he is revealed to have some sort of history with, and she agrees to transform him into the original Hook's physically younger form.
