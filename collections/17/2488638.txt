Rocked by the death of Jimmy during the school shooting, Mouth refused to allow people to think of Jimmy as a monster. Mouth is commonly seen as a friend or "little brother" by girls whom he likes, such as Brooke Davis, Rachel Gatina, and Shelley Simon. After graduating college, however, he found love with Millie, Brooke's assistant from the New York branch of Clothes Over Bros. Although their relationship has been strained at times, Mouth and Millie currently live together in Tree Hill and host a morning show.
