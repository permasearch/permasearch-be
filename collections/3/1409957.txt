With the German invasion of Poland in September 1939, although still following a policy of neutrality, the Belgian government began general mobilization.[13] By 1940, the army numbered between 600,000[14] and 650,000[15] men (nearly 20 percent of the male population of Belgium) making it approximately four times larger than the British Expeditionary Force and twice as large as the Dutch army at the time.[16]
