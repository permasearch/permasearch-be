The Yoga Yajnavalkya is a classical treatise on yoga attributed to the Vedic sage Yajnavalkya. It takes the form of a dialogue between Yajnavalkya and Gargi, a renowned philosopher.[185] The text contains 12 chapters and its origin has been traced to the period between the second century BCE and fourth century CE.[186]  Many yoga texts like the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, the Yoga Kundalini and the Yoga Tattva Upanishads have borrowed verses from or make frequent references to the Yoga Yajnavalkya.[187] The Yoga Yajnavalkya discusses eight yoga Asanas â€“ Swastika, Gomukha, Padma, Vira, Simha, Bhadra, Mukta and Mayura,[188] numerous breathing exercises for body cleansing,[189] and meditation.[190]
