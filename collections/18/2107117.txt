The cosmic dance of Lord Shiva represents five activities â€“ Creation, Protection, Destruction, Embodiment and Release. In essence, it represents the continuous cycle of creation and destruction. This cosmic dance[16] takes place in every particle and is the source of all energy. Arudra Darshan[17] celebrates this ecstatic dance of Lord Shiva.[18]
