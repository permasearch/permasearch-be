Roth wanted the style of his film to make a departure from many modern horror films that had been released at the time.[2] One modern horror film, The Blair Witch Project, did inspire Roth to use the Internet to help promote the film during its production and help gain interest towards its distribution.[3] The film itself, however, draws from many of Roth's favorite horror films, such as The Evil Dead, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, and The Last House on the Left.
