Tyrannosaurus may have had infectious saliva used to kill its prey. This theory was first proposed by William Abler.[182] Abler examined the teeth of tyrannosaurids between each tooth serration; the serrations may have held pieces of carcass with bacteria, giving Tyrannosaurus a deadly, infectious bite much like the Komodo dragon was thought to have. Jack Horner regards Tyrannosaurus tooth serrations as more like cubes in shape than the serrations on a Komodo monitor's teeth, which are rounded.[183] All forms of saliva contain possibly hazardous bacteria, so the prospect of it being used as a method of predation is disputable.
