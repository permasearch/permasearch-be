During the late 19th century, Coca-Cola was one of many popular coca-based drinks with purported medicinal properties and benefits to health; early marketing materials claimed that Coca-Cola alleviated headaches and acted as a "brain and nerve tonic".[4][5]  Coca leaves were used in Coca-Cola's preparation; the small amount of cocaine they contained—along with caffeine—provided the drink's "tonic" quality.[5] In 1903, cocaine was removed, leaving caffeine as the sole stimulant ingredient, and all medicinal claims were dropped.[4][5][6]  According to some sources, coca leaf extract, with the cocaine chemically removed, remained part of the formula.[7][8] By one account, the FDA still screens random samples of Coca-Cola syrup for the presence of cocaine.[9]  The company will neither confirm nor deny that the current version of Coca-Cola contains coca leaf extract, deferring to the secret nature of the formula.[10][11]
