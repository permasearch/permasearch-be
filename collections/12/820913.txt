The final chapter snaps back to Six and the rest of the crew on the loric ship with Lexa. Marina is out from the beating she took at the hands of Setrakus, Ella sits crying while Six puts pressure on Sarah's wound who is rapidly bleeding out. She phones Johns and tell him she loves him and urges him to carry on fighting before her words fade. Six checks for her pulse already aware that she is gone.
