Vihara or vihara hall has a more specific meaning in the architecture of India, especially ancient Indian rock-cut architecture.  Here it means a central hall, with small cells connected to it sometimes with beds carved from the stone. Some have a shrine cell set back at the centre of the back wall, containing a stupa in early examples, or a Buddha statue later. Typical large sites such as the Ajanta Caves, Aurangabad Caves, Karli Caves, and Kanheri Caves contain several viharas. Some included a chaitya or worship hall nearby.[6] The vihara was originated to be a shelter for Monks when it rains.
