In 1964, Warner Bros. successfully negotiated with French label Disques Vogue and Warner Bros.' British distributor Pye Records for the rights to distribute Petula Clark's recordings in the US (said rights were previously held by Laurie Records).[9] Clark soon scored a #1 US hit with "Downtown" and she enjoyed consistent chart success in the US over the next four years with hits such as "My Love", "I Know A Place", "I Couldn't Live Without Your Love", "This Is My Song" and "Don't Sleep In The Subway". Warner also released other Pye artists in the US market such as the Kinks.
