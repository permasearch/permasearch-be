The group entered the studio to remake "Who's That Lady?" after being inspired by rock acts such as Carlos Santana (who himself covered it on his 1990 album Spirits Dancing in the Flesh) bringing in a Latin percussive rock feel to it including congas and an organ solo by assorted other musicians while the other Isleys played various instrumentation. The two youngest Isley brothers and in-law Jasper re-wrote the instrumental while the older brothers revamped their harmonies, with Ronald's vocal smoother than the original version. Brother Ernie Isley's Jimi Hendrix/Santana-inspired guitar solo was one of the elements that defined the 3 + 3 era of the Isleys, and the song became their first Top 10 pop single since 1969's "It's Your Thing" peaked at number two on the pop singles chart, reaching number six on the pop chart and number two on the US R&B Singles chart. It was also a cross-Atlantic hit for the group, reaching number fourteen in the UK.
