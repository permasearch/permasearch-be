In order to induce a stronger immune response, some versions of human chorionic gonadotropin-based anti-fertility vaccines were designed as conjugates of the β subunit of HCG covalently linked to tetanus toxoid.[31][51] It has been alleged that a non-conjugated tetanus vaccine used in developing countries is laced with a human chorionic gonadotropin based anti-fertility drug[52] and is distributed as a means of mass sterilization.[53]  This charge has been vigorously denied by the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF.[54]  Others have argued that a hCG laced vaccine could not be used for sterilization since the effects of the anti-fertility vaccines are reversible (requiring booster doses to maintain immunity) and a non-conjugated vaccine is likely to be ineffective.[55][56]  Finally, independent testing of the tetanus vaccine by Kenya’s health authorities has revealed no traces of the human chorionic gonadotropin hormone.[57]
