With influences by the German ruler Otto III, the Sibyls, and Abbot Adso of Montier-en-Dier, many of the people under these influential figures felt that their rule was a sign of spiritual preparation for the apocalypse itself. It is suggested that because of the influence and reputation of these people, many wanted to follow suit and believe that the apocalypse would occur simply because their leaders felt it to be true.
