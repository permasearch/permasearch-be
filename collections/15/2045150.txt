GTANet was founded in 2001. At the time it served as news portal for the upcoming Grand Theft Auto III. Following the announcement of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City its founder, going by the pseudonym "Tank", re-purposed the website, turning it into a fan site with both a forum and a mod hosting site. With years GTANet gained the status of being one of the most notable unofficial GTA-centric websites. Its forums, GTAForums, are regarded as the biggest fan community with more than seven hundred thousand registered members. Its sister site GTAGarage is most known for the Hot Coffee mod, Google Street View for GTA,[14] Design Your Own Mission and GTA Garage Mod Manager. Rockstar staff members would also occasionally post on the forums, usually on title updates and other support information.[15][16]
