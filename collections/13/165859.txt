The word Mārs (genitive Mārtis),[81] which in Old Latin and poetic usage also appears as Māvors (Māvortis),[82] is cognate with Oscan Māmers (Māmertos).[83] The Old Latin form was believed to derive from an Italic *Māworts, but can also be explained as deriving from Maris, the name of an Etruscan child-god;[84] scholars have varying views on whether the two gods are related, and if so how.[85] Latin adjectives from the name of Mars are martius and martialis, from which derive English "martial" (as in "martial arts" or "martial law") and personal names such as "Martin".[citation needed]
