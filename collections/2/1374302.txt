The most commonly used air quality index in the UK is the  Daily Air Quality Index recommended by the Committee on Medical Effects of Air Pollutants (COMEAP).[30] This index has ten points, which are further grouped into 4 bands: low, moderate, high and very high. Each of the bands comes with advice for  at-risk groups and the general population.[31]
