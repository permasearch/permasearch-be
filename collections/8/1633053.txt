This righteousness is active, that is, “the righteousness of works is a righteousness that we achieve by human ability.”[3] Thus, this righteousness is informed by the Law (i.e. the good will of God). Unlike the first dimension where the Law only accuses, in the second dimension the Law acts as a guide. The Law shows man how God designed the world to work and warns that there are often temporal consequences to sin. Ultimately, “the purpose of a righteousness of works is the welfare of this world,” and not man’s relationship with God.[3]
