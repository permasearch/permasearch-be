Section 213 of the USA PATRIOT Act was modified. Previously it stated that delayed notifications would be made to recipients of "sneak and peek" searches in a "reasonable period". This was seen as unreasonable, as it was undefined and could potentially be used indefinitely. Thus, the reauthorization act changed this to a period not exceeding 30 days after the date of the execution of the search warrant. Courts were given the opportunity to extend this period if they were provided good cause to do so. Section 213 states that delayed notifications could be issued if there is "reasonable cause to believe that providing immediate notification of the execution of the warrant may have an adverse result". This was criticized, particularly by the ACLU, for allowing potential abuse by law enforcement agencies[230] and was later amended to prevent a delayed notification "if the adverse results consist only of unduly delaying a trial.".[231] In September 2007 an Oregon US District Court struck down the Sneak and Peak provisions of the USA PATRIOT ACT,[232] but in December 2009 the Ninth Circuit overturned this decision.[233]
