Jackson's vision of Middle-earth was described as being "Ray Harryhausen meets David Lean" by Randy Cook.[23] Jackson wanted a gritty realism and historical regard for the fantasy, and attempted to make the world rational and believable. For example, the New Zealand Army helped build Hobbiton months before filming began so the plants could really grow.[24] Creatures were designed to be biologically believable, such as the enormous wings of the fell beast to help it fly.[25] In total, 48,000 pieces of armour, 500 bows, and 10,000 arrows were created by Weta Workshop.[26] They also created many prosthetics, such as 1,800 pairs of Hobbit feet for the lead actors,[14] as well as many ears, noses, and heads for the cast, and around 19,000 costumes were woven and aged.[14] Every prop was specially designed by the Art Department, taking the different scales into account.[14]
