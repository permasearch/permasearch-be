The Royal Ranger opens to a chilling contrast of the established Will. Years after the other books, he has become bitter and depressed after the loss of Alyss who died saving a girl from a burning inn lit by Jory Ruhl. Because of this, Will becomes obsessed with hunting the man down. Worried about Will's state, his friends attempt to help him. After multiple failed attempts, Halt suggests the bestowing upon Will of an apprentice. He also suggests Princess Madelyn (Maddie) for this role as her parents, Horace and Cassandra, are desperate to keep her under control. She is overwhelmed when she reaches the cabin as she was expecting a holiday of sorts rather than the cruel Ranger training. To enforce the gravity of the situation Will reveals to her that she has been disinherited by her parents until such a time as she can prove herself. As Maddie adjusts to life as a Ranger, she slowly helps to remedy Will's bitterness and soften his heart. It is not long before the pair are set on their first mission, to investigate the suspicious death of Ranger Liam. They soon discover the cause was a group of slavers kidnapping children, led by Jory Ruhl, using the story of the stealer in the night to frighten them into keeping quiet. When they confront the group, Maddie succeeds in freeing the children but Will is captured and condemned to be burnt at the stake. Once the children are safe, Maddie pulls off a daring rescue but is injured in the process. Will then manages to treat her wounds and kill Ruhl. When they return, Maddie is presented with her bronze oakleaf, officiating her apprenticeship. Her mother also offers to reinstate her as princess but, much to the Queen's surprise, she declines, instead wanting to continue her training.
