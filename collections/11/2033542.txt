"Cast Your Fate to the Wind" is an American jazz instrumental selection whose music was composed, and which was originally recorded, by Vince Guaraldi; later, lyrics for it were written by Carel Werber. It won a Grammy Award for Best Original Jazz Composition in 1963.[1] It was included on the album Jazz Impressions of Black Orpheus, which the Vince Guaraldi Trio released on the Fantasy Records label on April 18, 1962.[2] On at least some copies of the album, the title on the label contained a printing error; it read "Cast Your Faith To The Wind," an unintentionally comic twist to the sentiment of the song. Fantasy also released Guaraldi's recording of the song as a single in the U.S., where it reached #22 on the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart and #9 on the Easy Listening chart.
