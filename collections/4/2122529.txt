Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, and Fascist Italy were all highly concerned over low fertility rates.[14] Reproductive policies in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were administered through their health care systemsâ€”both regimes saw health care as a key pillar to their designs to develop a new society.[15] While the Soviet Union had to design a public health care system from scratch, Nazi Germany built upon the pre-existing public health care system in Germany that had been developed since 1883 by Otto von Bismarck's legislation that had developed the world's first national public health care program.[15] The Nazis centralized the German health care system in order to enforce Nazi ideological components upon it, and replaced existing voluntary and government welfare agencies with new ones that were devoted to racial hygiene and other components of Nazi ideology.[16]
