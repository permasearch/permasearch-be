Maynard was Marcie's cousin, who appeared in the strip July 21, 1986, when Peppermint Patty's father hired him as her tutor to help her in school. His condescending attitude was apparent from the start when he asked her, "Hi, are you the dumb one?" upon first meeting her, and when he said, "Well, there were these numbers on the houses, see..." when she asked him how he had found her house. In turn, Maynard couldn't stand Peppermint Patty's own condescending attitude, when she kept calling him "Captain Tutor" and he kept having to remind her that his name was Maynard.
