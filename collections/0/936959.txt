The government of the People's Republic of China have used numerous names for the event since 1989, gradually reducing the intensity of terminology applied.[11] As the events were unfolding, it was labelled a "counterrevolutionary riot", which was later changed to simply "riot", followed by "political storm", and finally the leadership settled on the more neutralized phrase "political turmoil between the Spring and Summer of 1989", which it uses to this day.[11][16]
