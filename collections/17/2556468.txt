Occasionally, The Rush Limbaugh Show will air political parodies from voice humorist Paul Shanklin, in conjunction with a variety of political news examined on the show. These satires range from parodies of well known songs to audio skits in which the voices of politicians are imitated by Shanklin. Such contributions from Paul Shanklin have been aired on the show since 1993. Some of these, such as "Barack the Magic Negro",[17] referring to the titled Los Angeles Times article written by David Ehrenstein, gained considerable notoriety. From 1993 through 1997 a series of parodies written and performed by the similarly named Paul Silhan,[citation needed] including take-offs on Bob Dylan tunes referred to by Limbaugh as the "Bob Zimmerman" songs, were also played on his show. (Bob Zimmerman is the birth name of Bob Dylan.) Silhan created his parodies by writing and then recording all the voices and instruments himself using simul-synch recording techniques. The six albums of Silhan's Limbaugh parodies are available on the Web.
