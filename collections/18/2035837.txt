Shelley is perhaps best known for Ode to the West Wind, To a Skylark, and Adona√Øs, an elegy written on the death of Keats. His close circle of admirers included the most progressive thinkers of the day. A work like Queen Mab (1813) reveals Shelley, "as the direct heir to the French and British revolutionary intellectuals of the 1790s.[89] Shelley became an idol of the next three or four generations of poets, including important Victorian and Pre-Raphaelite poets such as Robert Browning, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, as well as later W. B. Yeats.[90]
