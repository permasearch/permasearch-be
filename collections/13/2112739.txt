Iron supplements, also known as iron salts and iron pills, are a number of iron formulations used to treat and prevent iron deficiency including iron deficiency anemia.[1][2] For prevention they are only recommended in those with poor absorption, heavy menstrual periods, pregnancy, hemodialysis, or a diet low in iron.[2][3] Prevention may also be used in low birth weight babies.[2] They are taken by mouth, injection into a vein, or injection into a muscle.[2] While benefits may be seen in days up to two months may be required until iron levels return to normal.[4]
