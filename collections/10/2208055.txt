German casualty figures are less complete than those of the Allies, and official figures have never been released.[209] A signal possibly sent by II SS Panzer Corps on 27 September listed 3,300 casualties (1,300 killed and 2,000 injured) around Arnhem and Oosterbeek.[210][211] Robert Kershaw's assessment of the incomplete records identified at least 2,500 casualties.[212] In the Roll of Honour: Battle of Arnhem 17â€“26 September 1944, J.A. Hey of the Society of Friends of the Airborne Museum, Oosterbeek identified 1,725 German dead from the Arnhem area relating to the time of the battle.[213] All of these figures are significantly higher than Model's conservative estimate of 3,300 casualties for the entire Market Garden area of battle (which included Eindhoven and Nijmegen).[212]
