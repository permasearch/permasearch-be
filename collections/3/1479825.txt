Destiney knows that she's the next target and she cries in her room. The Entertainer and her plan to pretend they're in a fight to hopefully throw off the target on Destiney's back, but to no avail, as all the other contestants were partying and getting drunk, so they did not even notice. In the vault, Destiney is voted into the box along with Brandi C., for not being able to cry. Real volunteers to put his check in the strongbox for his poor performance at the challenge. On the power outing, Toastee and the bottom three go scuba-diving and Real injures himself when he thought he saw sharks in the water. Brandi C. thinks Real is faking the injury to look weak. Destiney reminds Toastee that she saved her awhile back and that Pumkin and her promised they'd have her back the next time. Real gets the one-on-one time and promises Toastee that he and the rest of the Stallionare alliance would protect her in future eliminations if she saves him. Before elimination, Real goes over to Pumkin and says if he goes home, he will cry. Meanwhile, The Entertainer vows if Toastee gets rid of Destiney, he'll "make her life a living hell." At elimination, Brandi C. is saved first. Toastee calls up Destiney, only to tell her that her check will be voided, because Real was Toastee's "boy". Destiney gets her check voided and says she's going home because "she doesn't play dirty." Destiney gives a kiss to The Entertainer and leaves The Entertainer upset and heartbroken.
