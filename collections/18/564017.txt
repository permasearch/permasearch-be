China has occupied the prominent, central role in East Asia for most of recorded history, as it "deeply influenced the culture of the peripheral countries and also drew them into a China-centered [...] international order", that virtually remained in effect until the early 20th century. Highly ritualized, the Imperial Chinese Tributary System, based on the religious and philosophical idea of submission to celestial harmony[14] was also recognized by nations beyond, in Southeast Asia in particular. Ceremonies were presided over by the Emperor of China as the Son of Heaven and curator of the Mandate of Heaven.[15][16] In elaborate ceremonies both, the tributary state and the various Chinese dynasties agreed to mutually favorable economic co-operation and beneficial security policies.[17][18]
