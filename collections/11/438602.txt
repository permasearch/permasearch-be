The producers hired BMI as music consultants to find a theme song. With less than three weeks until the show first aired, BMI sent out a mass e-mail to a slew of composers, giving them just five days to submit an entry. According to the terms of the submission request, the only compensated composer would be the winner, who would receive $7,500 in exchange for release of all rights to NBC.[143] The winning entry was written by Gaby Moreno and Vincent Jones.[47] Michael Schur said this theme song was chosen because producers wanted something that would immediately make the viewer associate the music with the series and the characters.[144] He said Moreno and Jones' song "does a really good job of explaining what the town is like. (The) credits do a really good job of establishing it's just sort of a normal, every-day town in the middle of the country."[44] Due to its realistic mockumentary-style cinematography technique, Parks and Recreation does not use composed background music.[47]
