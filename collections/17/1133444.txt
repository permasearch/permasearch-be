Even if an organization has adopted Robert's Rules of Order, it can still adopt its own rules which supersede any rules in this book.[60] The only limitations might come from the rules in a parent organization or from national, state, or local law. An example of a rule that organizations sometimes adopt is one that allows the use of proxy voting. Such a rule is not allowed unless the organization specifically provides for it in its bylaws.[61]
