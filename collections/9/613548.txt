Ricky (J.B. Gaynor) is Max' closest friend. Both George and Angie see him as a delinquent; he once stuck a grilled cheese sandwich in George's VCR, he burns down George's garage after letting Max light off a bottle rocket and drives George's car into the backyard after he and Max skip school and wrecks it. But, George and Angie learn that he is enduring a childhood similar to and even somewhat worse than George's: a missing father and a drunken mother. Ernie agrees to foster Ricky, who is capable of managing multiple household tasks out of necessity—his mother is usually too drunk to do anything. In a later episode, Ernie becomes engaged to Ricky's mother, after she informs Ernie she is pregnant with his child. It is later revealed that the child belongs to someone else, and Ernie's fiancée makes a swift and permanent exit.
