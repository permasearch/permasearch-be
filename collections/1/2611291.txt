Jesus’ methods receive the most attention because, to Basevorn, Jesus "included all praiseworthy methods in His own, as the fount and origin of good" (p. 128). Basevorn highlights six styles that trace specifically to Jesus: promising salvation (it is effective to use when people need little convincing), threats of damnation (it is effective to use on the stubborn), preaching by example (citing examples of a good Christian life), preaching by reason or logic, speaking clearly, and speaking obscurely. Basevorn provides little explanation for the latter two styles. He cites the passage “Behold, now thou speakest plainly, and speakest no proverb” from John 16:29 for the style of speaking clearly; for the style of speaking obscurely, he writes "it is frequently said about His hearers that they did not understand the Word". (p. 129)
