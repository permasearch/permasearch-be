The first definitive outbreak of yellow fever in the New World was in 1647 on the island of Barbados.[63] An outbreak was recorded by Spanish colonists in 1648 in the Yucat√°n Peninsula, where the indigenous Mayan people called the illness xekik ("blood vomit"). In 1685, Brazil suffered its first epidemic, in Recife. The first mention of the disease by the name "yellow fever" occurred in 1744.[64] McNeill argues that the environmental and ecological disruption caused by the introduction of sugar plantations created the conditions for mosquito and viral reproduction, and subsequent outbreaks of yellow fever.[65] Deforestation reduced populations of insectivorous birds and other creatures that fed on mosquitoes and their eggs.
