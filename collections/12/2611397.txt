A music video for the song was released in January 2000, directed by Chris Hafner. In it, the band performs on a metal platform high in a sunset-filled sky. Intercepted in the sky scenes are scenes of the band eating in a dimly-lit Chinese restaurant with several girls. At one point, lead singer Stephan Jenkins hangs from the bottom the platform while his fellow bandmembers and several girls hang onto him, looking down apprehensively.
