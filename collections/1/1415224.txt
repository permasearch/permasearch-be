Next, the Intercontinental Championship was up for grabs between champion Cody Rhodes and Big Show. Rhodes attempted to avoid his opponent until Show caught him and tossed back inside. Show dominated from there with vicious attacks. Rhodes managed to deliver a disaster kick. As he went for another one, he took a spear mid-air to the groin from Show. Show knocked out Rhodes with a Knockout Punch and pinned him to win his first Intercontinental Championship.[50]
