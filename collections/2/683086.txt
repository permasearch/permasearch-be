Much like Freddie, he is often a victim of Sam's pranks, but she has shown to have more respect for him. In "iSpeed Date", his last name is revealed as Gibson on his house's postbox, which read "The Gibsons". The episode also reveals he has a girlfriend named Tasha. A very attractive girl, she only has a small part in the episode. This surprised Carly, Sam, and Freddie, because they feel that Tasha is somewhat out of Gibby's league. In "iEnrage Gibby", Tasha returns and has a larger role, showing much affection towards Gibby. In this episode, Gibby is shown to be ruthless and jealous, but in a comedic way. He is also shown to be a skilled kickboxer. Gibby is portrayed to be a very capable fighter, almost to the level of Sam, as shown in "iPsycho", where he succeeds in smashing down a barricaded door. In the episode "iCan't Take It", Gibby is shown to be a strong singer when he serenades Sam and Freddie after he has a change of heart about trying to break them up. He also reveals in "iMeet the First Lady" that he thought Spencer was Carly's father. He says this again in "iGoodbye".
