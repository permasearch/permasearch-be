The Society of the Cincinnati was established by Henry Knox in 1783 to assist the officers of the Continental Army and Navy and their families; to preserve the ideals of the American Revolution; and to maintain the union of the former colonies. A French Society of the Cincinnati was founded soon afterwards by King Louis XVI. Cincinnati, Ohio, in the United States, was named in its honor.[24]
