Later in 1990, Slim acted in concert with France Télécom and Southwestern Bell Corporation in order to buy the landline telephone company Telmex from the Mexican government, when Mexico began privatizing its national industries.[19] Slim was one of the initial investors of Telmex, the revenues of the company eventually formed the bulk of Slim's wealth.[30][32] By 2006, 90 percent of the telephone lines in Mexico were operated by Telmex, and his mobile telephone company, Telcel, which was created out of the Radiomóvil Dipsa company,[19] operated almost 80 percent of all the country's cellphones.[33] By 2012, América Movil, Slim's mobile telephone company, had taken over Telmex and made it into a privately held subsidiary.[30]
