Singkil originated from the Maranao people who inhabit the shores of Lake Lanao[1]. It is a re-telling of an episode from the Maranao epic legend Darangen involving the rescue of Princess Gandingan (abducted by the diwatas) by the legendary Prince Bantugan[2]. It is a popular dance performed during celebrations and other festive entertainment. Originally only women, particularly royalty, danced the Singkil, which serves as either a conscious or unconscious advertisement to potential suitors. The dance takes its name from the heavy rings worn on the ankles of the Muslim princess[2].  A kulintang and agung ensemble always accompanies the dance.
