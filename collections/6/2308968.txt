The SCHR agencies implement most of international humanitarian assistance either directly or as operational partners with intergovernmental humanitarian agencies such as the UNHCR or the WFP. An important role of the SCHR is to introduce the field experience of its members into humanitarian decision making process of the United Nations, particularly through the UNâ€™s Inter-agency Standing Committee (IASC) which is made up of the heads of the principle UN agencies involved in humanitarian assistance.
