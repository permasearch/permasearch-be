While baiting has slowed the decline of the red crab, its effects on the crazy ant populations are only temporary, as escaping colonies invade the treated areas again, and it is expensive, requiring much man power. In an effort to find a better control, after research, Australian Parks in December 2016 imported Tachardiaephagus somervillei, a small (2 mm) wasp and began breeding them for release. The wasp, which only attacks scale insects, is a voracious predator of what is believed to be one of the crazy ant's largest source of honey dew on Christmas Island, the yellow lac scale insect.[27]
