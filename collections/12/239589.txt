In the movie Ocean's Thirteen, the lead character, Danny Ocean, is describing a new ultra-luxurious casino opening on the Strip. He states that the big casinos on the Strip take in $3 million a day just from the casino floor, and this new resort is aiming for $5 million. In reality, the two largest corporate operations in Las Vegas, MGM Mirage and Harrah's Entertainment, in the first quarter of 2009, brought in $5.9 million and $4.1 million per day, respectively, in gaming revenue alone, but this was from all their Las Vegas Strip resorts combined. MGM Mirage currently owns nine Strip resorts, and Harrah's owns eight with one being a minor property originally intended to be a tear-down. No single casino operation has ever brought in close to $3 million a day from the casino floor alone, and the NVGC uses the qualification of greater than $200,000 per day ($72 million per year) as a grouping for reporting purposes.
