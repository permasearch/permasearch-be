Part of the city of Takoma Park was formerly in Prince George's County, but since 1997 the city has been entirely in Montgomery County.[60] The part of Takoma Park that changed counties comprises two residential neighborhoods, Carole Highlands (an unincorporated portion of which is still in Prince George's County) and New Hampshire Gardens.
