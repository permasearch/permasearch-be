Starting in 2011, top ten players/pairs of each discipline in the World Ranking will be required to play in all Super Series Premier tournaments and a minimum of four Super Series tournaments occurring in the full calendar year. Players who qualify for Super Series Masters Finals are obliged to play. A fine and above the normal withdrawal fees will be imposed upon players/pairs who fail to play. Exemption from penalty will be considered by BWF on receipt of a valid medical certificate or strong evidence that prove players unfit to participate. However, retired or suspended players are not subject to these regulations.[13][14]
