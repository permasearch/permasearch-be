"I Can't Dance" was played live during The Way We Walk,[5] Calling All Stations[6] (with Ray Wilson on vocals), and Turn It On Again[7] tours. On the band's Turn It On Again Tour, it was included as an encore. During live performances, the song was transposed to a lower key to accommodate Collins' deepening voice.
