Compared to follow-up iBook and PowerBook notebook computers, the Clamshell iBook proved to be the more reliable model.[9] The original iBook is on exhibition at the London Design Museum and the Yale University Art Gallery.[10][11] Vestiges of design ideas first adopted in the iBook G3 can still be seen today: moving interface ports from the back to the sides and leaving them uncovered, omitting a latch for the computer's lid and providing color options and an eye-catching design intended to be seen with the computer open.
