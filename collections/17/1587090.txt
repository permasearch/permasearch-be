Calls for reform of Social Security emerged within a few years of the 1935 Act. Even as early as 1936, some believed that women were not getting enough support. Worried that a lack of assistance might push women back into the work force, these individuals wanted Social Security changes that would prevent this. In an effort to protect the family, therefore, some called for reform which tied women's aid more concretely to their dependency on their husbands.[42] Others expressed apprehension about the complicated administrative practices of Social Security.[43] Concerns about the size of the reserve fund of the retirement program, emphasized by a recession in 1937, led to further calls for change.[44]
