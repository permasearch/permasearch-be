Leptin (from Greek λεπτός leptos, "thin"), "the hormone of energy expenditure",[a] is a hormone predominantly made by adipose cells that helps to regulate energy balance by inhibiting hunger.  Leptin is opposed by the actions of the hormone ghrelin, the "hunger hormone".  Both hormones act on receptors in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus.[6]  In obesity, a decreased sensitivity to leptin occurs (similar to insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes), resulting in an inability to detect satiety despite high energy stores and high levels of leptin.[7]
