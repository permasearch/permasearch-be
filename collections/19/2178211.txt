The Irish Rebellion of 1798 (Irish: Éirí Amach 1798), also known as the United Irishmen Rebellion (Irish: Éirí Amach na nÉireannach Aontaithe), was an uprising against British rule in Ireland lasting from May to September 1798. The United Irishmen, a republican revolutionary group influenced by the ideas of the American and French revolutions, were the main organising force behind the rebellion.  It was led by  Presbyterians angry at being shut out of power by the Anglican establishment; Catholics were increasingly involved. Plans called for significant French support, which never happened. The uprising was very poorly organized, and quickly suppressed by much more powerful British forces. The total death toll was in the range of 10,000 to 30,000.
