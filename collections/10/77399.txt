Google Analytics allows website owners to track where and how people use their website, for example by examining click rates for all the links on a page.[162] Google advertisements can be placed on third-party websites in a two-part program. Google's AdWords allows advertisers to display their advertisements in the Google content network, through a cost-per-click scheme.[163] The sister service, Google AdSense, allows website owners to display these advertisements on their website and earn money every time ads are clicked.[164]
