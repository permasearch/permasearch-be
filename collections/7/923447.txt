Steve Belfer, one of Hillenburg's friends from CalArts, wrote and performed the music that is played over the end credits.[29] This theme includes ukulele music, per Hillenburg's request.[29] Drymon said, "It's so long ago, it's hard to be sure, but I remember Hillenburg having the Belfer music early on, maybe before the pilot".[29]
