Egypt is the most populated country in the Middle East, and the third most populous on the African continent, with about 95 million inhabitants as of 2017[update].[6] Its population grew rapidly from 1970 to 2010 due to medical advances and increases in agricultural productivity [216] enabled by the Green Revolution.[217] Egypt's population was estimated at 3 million when Napoleon invaded the country in 1798.[218]
