Malwa was earlier an independent sultanate. Its last ruler Baz Bahadur was defeated and its capital Mandu was conquered in 1562 by the Mughal Emperor Akbarâ€™s army led by Abdullah Khan, the Uzbeg.[1] He was appointed its first governor. In 1564 he was replaced by Qara Bahadur Khan. In 1568 it became a subah of Mughal empire. One of its last governors was Sawai Jai Singh, who was the governor of the Subah for three times, from 1714-17, from 1729-30 and from 28 September 1732 to 4 August 1737.[2] The Mughal hold on Malwa ended in 1743, when Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao obtained the formal grant of Naib-subahdari (deputy governorship) of Malwa.
