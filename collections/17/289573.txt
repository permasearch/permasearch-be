Prior to the rise of Muhammad and the unification of the Arab tribes of the Arabian Peninsula under Islam, the tribes of Arabia followed a pre-Islamic Arab polytheism, lived as self-governing sedentary and nomadic communities and often raided their neighbouring tribes.[3][4] Following the conquests under Muhammad of the Arabian Peninsula, the region became unified and most of the tribes adopted Islam.[4]
