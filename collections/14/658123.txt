During the 1975 Tour of the Americas, arena shows became an industry for the band and the Stones hired a new lighting director, Jules Fisher.[355] The props used on stage by the band increased in both size and sophistication, similar to things done on Broadway.[351] The band started to use multiple stages, from which they would select for a particular show. On this tour they had two versions what Jagger referred to as the "lotus stage" â€“ one version of the stage that had a large Venetian (cylindrical) curtain and the other has leaves that would start in the folded up position and lower during the beginning of the concert.[351] This period also included a variety of props, including inflatables and other gimmicks ranging from inflatable penises "and things."[351] The tour also incorporated a number of circus tricks.[351]
