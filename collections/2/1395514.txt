The family goes to Nifty Fifties Diner, a 1950s-themed restaurant, and they see waiters dressed up as celebrities from the 1950s, including James Dean, Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley. Peter obtains a record of his favorite song, The Trashmen's "Surfin' Bird" from the restaurant (which was about to be thrown away because it was released in 1963). Peter repeats the song over and over on the way home in bed and even when waking up Lois, annoying his family. However, the final straw of the family's hatred of Surfin' Bird is when Peter spends over $6,000 of the family fortune to buy himself a two-minute clip on TV saying that "I dream of an America where everybody knows that the bird is the word" and singing the song again.
