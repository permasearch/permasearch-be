In 2005, Hutcherson appeared in several Hollywood films while trying to establish himself in the industry. He portrayed the minor role of Bucky Weston in the comedy Kicking & Screaming.[26] In 2005's Little Manhattan, he had a lead role alongside his younger brother, Connor.[6][27] Stella Papamichael of the BBC approved of his performance, saying that "Hutcherson's delivery is spot-on, showing a keen instinct for self-effacing humor that would make even Woody Allen feel that bit more inadequate",[28] but Variety columnist Brian Lowry felt that Hutcherson "might have looked cute on the page, but even with his Linus voice the language and tone [didn't] feel natural."[29] He next appeared in a lead role in Jon Favreau's Zathura, which he enjoyed filming owing to the number of special effects and stunts he was involved with.[30][31] Hutcherson received the Young Artist Award for "Best Performance in a Feature Film by a Leading Young Actor" for the film.[32]
