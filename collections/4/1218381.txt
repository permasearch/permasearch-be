The children at South Park Elementary are presenting science projects. Token gets a "check plus" for presenting a computer model of predicted weather conditions, while Cartman is angry for receiving a "check minus" on his hastily constructed project and points out to the class Token's wealth in his rage, notably his clothes. Token, the token black child of South Park, happens to be the richest kid in town, and becomes upset when he can find no other kids in the school he can relate to. He tries to get himself and his family to act poor. They shop at J-Mart, where the rest of the families buy their clothes, but when he comes to Stan's house with the other boys and brings a DVD of The Lion King instead of a video tape–Token's family being the only people in town with a DVD player–the boys realize that he has not changed.
