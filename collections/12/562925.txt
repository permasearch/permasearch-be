In China, because a large number of players do not own the computer on which they play games (e.g. if they play in Internet caf√©s), the CD keys required to create an account can be purchased independently of the software package. To play the game, players must also purchase prepaid game cards that can be played for 66 hours and 40 minutes.[64] A monthly fee model is not available to players of this region. The Chinese government and NetEase, the licensee for World of Warcraft in China, have imposed a modification on Chinese versions of the game which places flesh on bare-boned skeletons and transforms dead character corpses into tidy graves. These changes were imposed by the Chinese government in an attempt to "promote a healthy and harmonious online game environment" in World of Warcraft.[65][66] The Chinese government has delayed the release of the Wrath of the Lich King expansion, due to what it feels is objectionable content.[67] NetEase took over licensing of World of Warcraft from The9 in June 2009 following the expiration of The9's contract,[68] and were able to secure a launch for Wrath of the Lich King on August 31, 2010, nearly two years after its Western release.
