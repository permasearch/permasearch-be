Canadians refer to both the European and North American conflicts as the Seven Years' War (Guerre de Sept Ans).[11][12] French Canadians also use the term "War of Conquest" (Guerre de la ConquÃªte), since it is the war in which Canada was conquered by the British and became part of the British Empire.
