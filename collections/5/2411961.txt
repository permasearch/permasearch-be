In 1985, Paul Kelly, on acoustic guitar and lead vocals, was backed by the Coloured Girls: Michael Armiger on bass guitar, Michael Barclay on drums, Steve Connolly on guitar and keyboardist Peter Bull.[1][2] Because of possible racist connotations the band changed its name, for international releases, to Paul Kelly and the Messengers.[2] In 1986 they undertook an American tour, initially supporting Crowded House and then head-lining, travelling across the United States by bus.[2] Jon Schofield replaced Armiger on bass guitar, while Chris Coyne on tenor saxophone and Chris Wilson on harmonica joined the line-up.[1][2]
