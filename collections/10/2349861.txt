If we let      ε  A     {\displaystyle \varepsilon _{A}}   represent the error (i.e., inaccuracy) of a measurement of an observable A and      η  B     {\displaystyle \eta _{B}}   the disturbance produced on a subsequent measurement of the conjugate variable B by the former measurement of A, then the inequality proposed by Ozawa[6] — encompassing both systematic and statistical errors — holds:
