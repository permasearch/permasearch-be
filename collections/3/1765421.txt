The UNEP has been handicapped by its location in Nairobi, Kenya. The first UN body headquartered in the Global South, the move was meant to ease tensions between the developed and developing world. However, its location in Kenya has led to an isolation from other international environmental power structures, as well as a “physical fragmentation of the governance structure” due to its removal from other UN bodies headquartered in Geneva and New York City.[4] UNEP's headquarters in Nairobi also make it difficult to attract the top-notch staff which are needed to effectively run the Programme. This is due to an uncertain security situation in Kenya and quality of life issues.[5]
