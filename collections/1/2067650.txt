In May 1940, the Nazis invaded the Netherlands. Among their restrictions was banning the youth club.[3][pageÂ needed] In May 1942, a well-dressed woman came to the ten Booms' with a suitcase in hand and told them that she was a Jew, her husband had been arrested several months before, her son had gone into hiding, and Occupation authorities had recently visited her, so she was afraid to go back. She had heard that the ten Booms had helped their Jewish neighbors, the Weils, and asked if they might help her too. Casper ten Boom, Corrie's father, readily agreed that she could stay with them, despite the police headquarters being only half a block away.[4] A devoted reader of the Old Testament, he believed that the Jews were the 'chosen people', and he told the woman, "In this household, God's people are always welcome."[5] The family then became very active in the Dutch underground hiding refugees; they honored the Jewish Sabbath.[6] The family never sought to convert any of the Jews who stayed with them.[7]
