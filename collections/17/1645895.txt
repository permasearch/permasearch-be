Structural coloration due to thin-film layers is common in the natural world. The wings of many insects act as thin films because of their minimal thickness. This is clearly visible in the wings of many flies and wasps. In butterflies, the thin-film optics are visible when the wing itself is not covered by pigmented wing scales, which is the case in the blue wing spots of the Aglais io butterfly.[1] The glossy appearance of buttercup flowers is also due to a thin film[2] as well as the shiny breast feathers of the bird of paradise.[3]
