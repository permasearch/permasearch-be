In order to maintain temperatures above −77 °C, a solvent with a freezing point above −77 °C must be used.  When dry ice is added to acetonitrile then the bath will begin cooling.  Once the temperature reaches −41 °C, the acetonitrile will freeze.  Therefore, dry ice must be added slowly to avoid freezing the entire mixture.  In these cases, a bath temperature of −55 °C can be achieved by choosing a solvent with a similar freezing point (n-octane freezes at −56 °C).
