Fluoride therapy has been proven to have a beneficial effect on the prevention of dental caries.[9] Robust evidence supports the use of fluoride toothpaste (with concentrations of 1000 ppm and above) and fluoride supplements, in the form of drops and tablets, to reduce the risk of dental caries in school-aged children and adolescents.[9] The ingestion of fluoride as primary teeth are being developed has shown that the teeth have formed stronger and more resistant for caries.[9][10] Water and milk fluoridation are two forms of systemic fluoride therapy that have been demonstrated to be effective at preventing dental caries.[11]
