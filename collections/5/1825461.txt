Honduras won the 1981 CONCACAF Championship and qualified for the World Cup for the first time in 1982. They finished second in the 1985 CONCACAF Championship losing their final match 2 to 1 against Canada, who would eventually qualify to the 1986 FIFA World Cup. Their next major accomplishment was being runners-up at the 1991 CONCACAF Gold Cup losing against host nation, United States. For the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Jamaica's merits left Honduras out of the final round of qualification. Despite Honduras' overwhelming victory 11 to 3 against St.Vincent & the Grenadines, Jamaica defeated Mexico in Kingston. The scoreless draw from Jamaica's visit to Honduras ultimately allowed the Reggae Boys to advance to the next round. Hopes changed for 2002 as Honduras advanced to the hexagonal round. Despite Honduras' effort, they were left at the edge of the 2002 FIFA World Cup losing at home against Trinidad & Tobago, and at the Azteca against Mexico, in their final two games of the qualifiers. The match against Trinidad saw Honduras hit the goal post seven times, but despite their effort they lost by the minimum amount. The second World Cup appearance was in the 2010 FIFA World Cup when Honduras strikingly qualified by their victory away at El Salvador and Costa Rica's tie against the USA. Their third and most recent World Cup appearance was the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Honduras has won the UNCAF Nations Cup four times: in 1993, 1995, 2011 and 2017.
