Drexel joined Division I in 1973 and makes up the City 6 in extramurals with the Big 5, and has its own basketball rivalry with Penn, known as the Battle of 33rd Street. The Drexelâ€“Penn rivalry is geographically the closest in NCAA Division I; the two schools' campuses adjoin one another, and their basketball arenas are three blocks apart. Drexel has never made the Final Four, but did reach the second round of the 1996 tournament. Delaware has made five NCAA tournament appearances, reaching the second round in 2014. Delaware State has reached the NCAA tournament once, losing in the first round in 2005. Delaware and Drexel both play in the CAA, while Delaware State plays in the MEAC. Four Philadelphia schools field Division II teams: Chestnut Hill College, Holy Family University, Thomas Jefferson University (Jefferson), and the University of the Sciences.
