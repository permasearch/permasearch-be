Jaina traditions believe that there exist Abhavya (incapable), or a class of souls that can never attain moksha (liberation).[119][117] The Abhavya state of soul is entered after an intentional and shockingly evil act,[120] but Jaina texts also polemically applied Abhavya condition to those who belonged to a competing ancient Indian tradition called Ājīvika.[117] A male human being is considered closest to the apex of moksha, with the potential to achieve liberation, particularly through asceticism. The ability of women to attain moksha has been historically debated, and the subtraditions with Jainism have disagreed. In the Digambara tradition of Jainism, women must live an ethical life and gain karmic merit to be reborn as a man, because only males can achieve spiritual liberation.[121][122] In contrast, the Śvētāmbara tradition has believed that women too can attain moksha just like men.[122][123][124]
