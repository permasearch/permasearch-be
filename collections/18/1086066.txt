During the summer campaign of 1673, Turenne had the thankless task of trying to contain Leopold's troops under the command of Raimondo Montecuccoli.[16] Montecuccoli finally joined with the Dutch troops of William III to besiege and take the city of Bonn from the French.[23] In August 1673, The Habsburg monarchies of Spain and the Holy Roman Empire signed a formal alliance with the Republic that required that France be returned to her boundaries of 1659. This alliance was strengthened in October by Charles IV of Lorraine.[23] Imperial and Dutch troops conquered the town of Naarden from the French on 13 September.[24] The Spanish, who had yet to formally enter the war, declared war on the French on 16 October.[25] At about the same time Frederick William re-entered the war against France.[13] The position of Louis at this stage was bad enough, but it worsened when England made a separate peace, the Treaty of Westminster, with all of the nations arrayed against France on 19 February 1674.[24] Charles II had been forced into making peace with the Republic by the Parliament which returned to session in October 1673.[26]
