The vast majority of cities have a central area containing buildings with special economic, political, and religious significance. Archaeologists refer to this area by the Greek term temenos or if fortified as a citadel.[30] These spaces historically reflect and amplify the city's centrality and importance to its wider sphere of influence.[29] Today cities have a city center or downtown, sometimes coincident with a central business district.
