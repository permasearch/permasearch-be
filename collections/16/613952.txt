As winners of the 1979 FA Cup Final, Arsenal entered the European Cup Winners' Cup in the 1979–80 season. The club defeated Fenerbahçe, 1. FC Magdeburg and IFK Göteborg, before facing Juventus in the semi-finals. After conceding an early penalty scored by Antonio Cabrini, Arsenal defender David O'Leary was injured and substituted in the 20th minute, when Juventus striker Roberto Bettega tackled him.[27] Marco Tardelli was later sent off for a foul on Liam Brady and in the 85th minute, Arsenal managed to score an equaliser through a mix-up between Frank Stapleton and Bettega; the Italian put the ball into his goal net.[27] Neill in his post-match comments expressed his anger over Bettega's tackle after the game: "I was shocked by a most vicious foul. I was shocked because I have always had the greatest admiration for him."[27] A headed goal by substitute Paul Vaessen two minutes from the end, in the second leg was enough to take Arsenal into the 1980 European Cup Winners' Cup Final, where they faced Valencia in Brussels.[28] A goalless draw after normal and extra time meant the final was to be decided on a penalty shootout, with Valencia winning 5–4.[29]
