Decla producer Rudolf Meinert introduced Hermann Warm to Wiene and provided Warm the Caligari script, asking him to come up with proposals for the design.[52] Warm believed "films must be drawings brought to life",[53] and felt a naturalistic set was wrong for the subject of the film, instead recommending a fantastic, graphic style,[21][52] in which the images would be visionary, nightmarish and out of the ordinary.[54] Warm brought to the project his two friends, painters and stage designers Walter Reimann and Walter Röhrig,[21][55][56] both of whom were associated with the Berlin art and literary magazine Der Sturm.[21][53][57] The trio spent a full day and part of the night reading the script,[55] after which Reimann suggested an Expressionist style,[21][55][58] a style often used in his own paintings.[52][55][58] They also conceived the idea of painting forms and shadows directly onto the sets to ensure a dark and unreal look.[21] (See Visual Style for more.) According to Warm, the three approached Wiene with the idea and he immediately agreed,[21][55][59] although Wiene has made claims that he conceived the film's Expressionist style.[55] Meinert agreed to the idea after one day's consideration, telling Warm, Reimann and Röhrig to make the sets as "crazy" and "eccentrically" as possible.[31][55] He embraced the idea for commercial, not aesthetic reasons: Expressionism was fashionable at the time, so he concluded even if film received bad reviews, the artistic style would garner attention and make it profitable.[31]
