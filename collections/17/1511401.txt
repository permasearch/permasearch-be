In the classic books on phase-locked loops,[1][2] published in 1966, such concepts as hold-in, pull-in, lock-in, and other frequency ranges for which PLL can achieve lock, were introduced. They are widely used nowadays (see, e.g. contemporary engineering literature [3][4] and other publications). Usually in engineering literature only non-strict definitions are given for these concepts. F. Gardner in 1979 in the 2nd edition of his well-known work, Phaselock Techniques, formulated the following problem [5][p. 70] (see also the 3rd edition[3] [p. 187-188]): "There is no natural way to define exactly any unique lock-in frequency". The lack of rigorous explanations led to the paradox: "despite its vague reality, lock-in range is a useful concept" [5][p. 70]. Many years of using definitions based on the above concepts has led to the advice given in a handbook on synchronization and communications, namely to check the definitions carefully before using them.[6] First rigorous mathematical definitions were given in.[7] [8]
