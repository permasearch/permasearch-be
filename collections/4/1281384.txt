In 1992, eight years after their last official series,[b] South Africa hosted New Zealand in a one-off test match. The resumption of international rugby in South Africa came after the dismantling of the apartheid system, and was only done with permission of the African National Congress.[19][20] With their return to test rugby, South Africa were selected to host the 1995 Rugby World Cup.[21] After upsetting Australia in the opening match, South Africa continued to advance through the tournament until they met New Zealand in the final.[22][23] After a tense final that went into extra time, South Africa emerged 15â€“12 winners,[24] with then President Nelson Mandela, wearing a Springbok jersey,[23] presenting the trophy to South Africa's captain, Francois Pienaar.[25]
