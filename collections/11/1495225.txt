A 2001 meta-analysis commissioned by the Australian government said that there was "overwhelming evidence in support of helmets for preventing head injury and fatal injury".[31][32] A 2012 re-analysis, by Elvik, concluded that the 2001 meta-analysis "was influenced by publication bias and time-trend bias that was not controlled for. As a result, the analysis reported inflated estimates of the effects of bicycle helmets". Elvik writes "When the risk of injury to head, face or neck is viewed as a whole, bicycle helmets do provide a small protective effect. This effect is statistically significant in older studies. New studies, summarised by a random-effects model of analysis, indicate only a statistically non-significant protective effect".[33]
