A bullied boy named Norman (Bobby Coleman) discovers that he has god-like power over insects and uses them to get revenge on his tormentors only to discover (the hard way) that absolute power corrupts absolutely. Norman accidentally squashed an insect and now all of the insects are rebelling against Norman. He tries to keep the insects out of his room, but forgets one hole in the wall that the insects take advantage of. They all swarm into his room and completely cover his body. The episode ends with a quote about how insects outnumber humans by a factor of billions, courtesy of Norman's science teacher Mr. Dunwood (Vincent Gale). This ending suggests that the insects have started an uprising against all humans.
