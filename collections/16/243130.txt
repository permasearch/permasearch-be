After the arrival of the Europeans, some Iroquois became Christians, among them the first Native American Saint, Kateri Tekakwitha, a young woman of Mohawk-Algonquin parents. The Seneca sachem Handsome Lake, also known as Ganeodiyo,[209] introduced a new religious system to the Iroquois in the late 18th century,[210] which incorporated Quaker beliefs along with traditional Iroquoian culture.[202] Handsome Lake's teachings include a focus on parenting, appreciation of life, and peace.[209] A key aspect of Handsome Lake's teachings is the principle of equilibrium, wherein each person's talents combined into a functional community. By the 1960s, at least 50% of Iroquois followed this religion.[202]
