During the Roman Republic the citizens would elect almost all officeholders annually. Popular elections for high office were largely undermined and then brought to an end by Augustus (r. 27 BC - 14 AD), the first Roman emperor (earlier known as Octavian). However, Roman elections continued at the local, municipal level.
