In non-GTK applications, however, there usually is no escape sequence to input arbitrary input characters. For example, Qt and KDE rely on the standard X Input Method (XIM) framework, and do not implement their own solutions.[9] In xterm, these input methods are not supported, but using escape sequences is an alternative. rxvt-unicode implements optional ISO/IEC 14755, enabled by default.
