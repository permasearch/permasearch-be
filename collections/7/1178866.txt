Much of the early research was conducted at Rocky Mountain Laboratories[19][20] a part of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The schoolhouse laboratory of 1922-1924, filled with ticks in various phases of the life cycle, is identifiable in retrospect as a biohazard, although the team did not fully appreciate it at first. The deaths of Gettinger and Cowan, and the near death of the janitor's son, were the results of inadequate biocontainment, but in the 1920s, the elaborate biocontainment systems of today had not been invented yet.
