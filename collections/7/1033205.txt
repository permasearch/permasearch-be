An Avox is a person who has been punished for being a rebel against the Capitol; a traitor or a deserter. Most Avoxes will have been hunted and caught by the Peacekeepers of their respective Districts. Avoxes have had their tongues cut out, rendering them mute. They are used as domestic servants and waiters upon tributes and Capitol citizens. It is also suggested that Avoxes are charged with the day-to-day maintenance of the Capitol and work shifts in the Transfer network under the city.
