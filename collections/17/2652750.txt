Historically and presently every game begins with a jump ball thrown into the middle of the field, groups of players from each team scramble and fight to get the ball and launch it towards their goal with their sticks. The beginning of the game has been described as “rolling and tumbling over each other in the dust, straining and tugging for possession of the ball”[7]
