In each episode, Dolly Singh, the character of the older sister, creates a video diary containing advice for Nikki about their family and life as a teenager. Dolly tries to show Nikki what she might go through in the video diary so she will always know how to figure things out. In the third season of the show, Nikki's younger sibling Bobby is born. The show went on hiatus on 8 November 2015 to give airtime to Vicky & Vetaal season two, which began airing on 15 November.
