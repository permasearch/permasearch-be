X inactivation plays a key role in dosage compensation mechanisms that allow for equal expression of the X and autosomal chromosomes.[24] Different species have different dosage compensation methods, with all of the methods involving the regulation of an X chromosome from one of the either sexes.[24] Some methods involved in dosage compensation to inactivate one of the X chromosomes from one of the sexes are Tsix antisense gene, DNA methylation and DNA acetylation;[25] however, the definite mechanism of X inactivation is still poorly understood. If one of the X chromosomes is not inactivated or is partially expressed, it could lead to over expression of the X chromosome and it could be lethal in some cases.
