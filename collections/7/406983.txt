In the wake of the fatal police shooting of unarmed African-American Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, "Operation Ferguson"—a hacktivist organization that claimed to be associated with Anonymous—organized cyberprotests against police, setting up a website and a Twitter account to do so.[116] The group promised that if any protesters were harassed or harmed, they would attack the city's servers and computers, taking them offline.[116] City officials said that e-mail systems were targeted and phones died, while the Internet crashed at the City Hall.[116][117] Prior to August 15, members of Anonymous corresponding with Mother Jones said that they were working on confirming the identity of the undisclosed police officer who shot Brown and would release his name as soon as they did.[118] On August 14, Anonymous posted on its Twitter feed what it claimed was the name of the officer involved in the shooting.[119][120] However, police said the identity released by Anonymous was incorrect.[121] Twitter subsequently suspended the Anonymous account from its service.[122]
