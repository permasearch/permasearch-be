The Nanny maintained an ensemble cast, keeping the same set of characters for its entire six-season run. RenÃ©e Taylor, Ann Morgan Guilbert, and Rachel Chagall were only given starring credit for their roles in the final season, even though they appeared in most episodes of the series, particularly in seasons where the role of the Sheffield children was somewhat reduced.
