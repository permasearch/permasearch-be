During the hardline Taliban regime, Kabul was a deserted city with many residents having long left, most infrastructure destroyed and little to no education or public services. The regime's lack of interest in development meant that the city remained barren during their rule. On a positive note the Taliban's rule, which would last for five years, gave relative calm to Kabul after years of violence between warlords.
