Britain's war against the Americans, French, and Spanish cost about Â£100 million. The Treasury borrowed 40% of the money that it needed.[84] Heavy spending brought France to the verge of bankruptcy and revolution, while the British had relatively little difficulty financing their war, keeping their suppliers and soldiers paid, and hiring tens of thousands of German soldiers.[85]
