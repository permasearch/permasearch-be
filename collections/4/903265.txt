("0-0", "0-1" "1–0", "0–2", "1–1", "2–0", "1–2", "2–1", "3–0", "2–2", "3–1", "3–2") The possible instances of the "count", the number of balls and strikes currently tallied against a batter. Traditionally, the first number in the count corresponds to balls, and the second, strikes; however, Japanese and Korean baseball leagues use the opposite order (strikes followed by balls). The latter practice, however, has given way to the more traditional ball/strike counts in both broadcast and stadium references, as events such as the Asia Series now feature countries (Taiwan, Australia, Europe) where the ball count is announced before strike count.
