Several strains of modern art anticipated and influenced punk.  The relationship between punk rock and popular music has a clear parallel with the irreverence Dadaism held for the project of high art.  If not a direct influence, futurism, with its interests in speed, conflict, and raw power foreshadowed punk culture in a number of ways. Minimalism furnished punk with its simple, stripped-down, and straightforward style.  Another source of punk's inception was pop art. Andy Warhol and his Factory studio played a major role in setting up what would become the New York City punk scene.  Pop art also influenced the look of punk visual art.  In more recent times, postmodernism has made headway into the punk scene.
