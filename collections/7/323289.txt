On January 13, 2013, the President of The CW Mark Pedowitz stated that though 90210 doesn't have a season 6 renewal in place, the show would most likely be back next year (possibly for the final season if it were to be canceled) due to him being a "big believer in giving fans a very satisfactory conclusion" for a long-running show. However, on February 28, 2013 The CW Entertainment President, Mark Pedowitz, announced that 90210 would end its run after five seasons and 114 episodes.
