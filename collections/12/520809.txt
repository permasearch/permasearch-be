Congregational a cappella music from hymnals (perhaps pitched from a pitch pipe), but directed by any capable song-leader motioning the time signature, is notably characteristic of the Churches of Christ.[14]:240[55]:417[56] Few congregations clap hands and/or use musical instruments during "formal" weekly convocations. Dancing is discouraged on all of life's occasions.
