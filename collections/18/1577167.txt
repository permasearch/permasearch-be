Due to large support, the South African government decided on a set of rules and regulations regarding the country's Minors. This was introduced to the public eye in June 2006. Because of the division of powers between the national and Provincial governments, the statute was enacted in two parts. The original act, which was promulgated on 19 June 2006, contained only the provisions dealing with matters falling within the exclusive responsibility of the national government.[2] The Children's Amendment Act, 2007, promulgated on 18 March 2008, amended the act to insert provisions dealing with matters for which the national and provincial governments share joint responsibility. Some provisions of the act, including the reduction of the age of majority from 21 to 18, came into force on 11 July 2007,[3] while the rest came into force on 1 April 2010. Currently, all revisions have been made and are fully in force.[4]
