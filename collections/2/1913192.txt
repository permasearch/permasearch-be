In Washington, one particular family of Sinixt have figured prominently among recent-day "urban Indians". Bernie Whitebear (1937–2000), a Seattle Indian rights activist and founder of several "urban Indian" organizations, was declared Washington state's "First Citizen of the Decade" in November 1997;[54] his sister Luana Reyes (1933—2001) was, at the time of her death, deputy director of the U.S.'s 14,000-person Indian Health Services;[55] and their brother Lawney Reyes (b. c.1931) is a Seattle-based sculptor, designer, curator and author.[3] Lawney Luana and Bernie are descendants of Alex Christian, whose family lived at Kp'itl'els (Brilliant, B.C., near present-day Castlegar), a Sinixt village, for generations, until the Canadian Government sold their land to settlers.[56]
