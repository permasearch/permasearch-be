In 1996, the Royal College adopted CanMEDS, a medical education framework it developed that emphasizes the essential competencies of a physician.[56][57] Revised in 2005, the CanMEDS competencies have now been integrated into the Royal College's accreditation standards, objectives of training, final in-training evaluations, exam blueprints, and the Maintenance of Certification program. All 17 medical schools in Canada also use the framework to assess the abilities of their residents.[58][59][60] The Royal College is now updating the framework to further align it with a competency-based approach to medical education.[61] The newly revised CanMEDS will launch in 2015.[62]
