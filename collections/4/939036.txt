In 2003, MCTC acquired adjacent land that previously belonged to the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association's Minneapolis headquarters. In fall 2008, MCTC opened a new Management Education Center and Science building on this property. In 2004, Metropolitan State University (Metro State) and MCTC started sharing programs and Metro State's Minneapolis campus moved to the newly expanded MCTC campus from its original location a few blocks away. In 2010, the only Metro State programs still operating on the MCTC campus were theatre arts and business.
