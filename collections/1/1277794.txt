In 2006, the college was given planning permission to build a new campus at Peterlee because the buildings at the two campuses there did not meet the requirements for access for disabled people. In September 2008 a brand new Â£36m college building was opened on the Howletch site; the old college building at Howletch has also been demolished to make way for further college buildings and the old college building at Burnhope Way will be demolished to make way for a Tesco Extra. The college's new 220 seat theatre was named after Berthold Lubetkin.
