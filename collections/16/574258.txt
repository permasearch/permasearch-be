Brian Epstein, who had been unofficially managing the Beatles for less than a month, arranged a recording audition at Decca Records in London on New Year's Day, 1962.[51] The group recorded 15 songs, mostly cover versions with three Lennonâ€“McCartney songs.[52] John Lennon later admitted they were "terrified and nervous". A month later, Decca informed Epstein the group had been rejected.[53] The band members were informed of the rejection except for Best.[54] Epstein officially became the manager of the Beatles on 24 January 1962 with the contract signed in Pete's house.[55]
