Prophet Muhammad referred to the six articles of faith in the Hadith of Gabriel: "Iman is that you believe in God and His Angels and His Books and His Messengers and the Hereafter and the good and evil fate [ordained by your God]."[57] The first five are mentioned together in the Qur'an [58] The Quran states that faith can grow with remembrance of God.[59] The Qur'an also states that nothing in this world should be dearer to a true believer than faith.[60]
