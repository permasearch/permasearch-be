Richard Thomas France notes that the negative form of the Golden Rule, don't do to others what you donâ€™t want them to do to you, appears in several works of Greek philosophy and also in earlier Jewish writings. It also appears in other traditions such as Buddhism and Confucianism. However, Jesus might have been the first to formulate this positive version of the rule. There are some works with a positive version that claim to have been written before Jesus, but their authenticity is doubtful.[3] Luz notes that some scholars see the positive version as being very important because it instructs all disciples to work actively for the good of others, not simply to desist passively from doing harm. However, Luz notes that in actual implementation there is not a great deal of difference between the two formulations. He ascribes much of the efforts to divide the two ideas to anti-Judaic prejudices of many Biblical scholars. Early Christian writers saw little difference between the two versions, and several paraphrased this verse with the negative form.[4]
