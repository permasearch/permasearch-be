Alpha men were pioneers and at the forefront of the Civil Rights Movement during the 1950s.[40] In Montgomery, Martin Luther King Jr. led the people in the Montgomery Bus Boycott as a minister, and later as head of the SCLC. Birmingham saw Arthur Shores organize for civil rights in Lucy v. Adams. Thurgood Marshall managed the landmark US Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education, in which the Court decided against segregation in public schools. Marshall employed mentor and fraternity brother Charles Houston's plan to use the de facto inequality of "separate but equal" education in the United States to attack and defeat the Jim Crow laws.[64] The actions by Alpha activists provoked death threats to them and their families, and exposed their homes as targets for firebombing.[65]
