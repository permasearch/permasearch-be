An Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the present airport was completed in August 2006. The study concluded the impact on the environment and noise pollution would be minimal. Plans for the airport included a single runway suitable for regional jets and larger mainline aircraft. SkyWest Airlines operating as the Delta Connection announced that on January 13, 2011 the airline would begin nonstop Canadair CRJ regional jet service to Salt Lake City from the airport. SkyWest subsequently initiated nonstop Canadair CRJ regional jet service to Denver operating as United Express.[3] The runway was initially planned to be oriented at about 010/190 degrees. It was also initially planned to be 9,300 by 150 feet (2,835 by 46 m) with subsequent plans for the runway to be extended to 11,500 by 150 feet (3,505 by 46 m) feet. Pilots use Los Angeles Air Route Traffic Control Center for approach services and use a common traffic advisory service frequency because of the lack of an operating control tower.
