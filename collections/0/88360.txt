In an October 2016 interview, Feig told Bustle that a sequel was not in the works, but could be possible if the film performed well on its home release.[163] By November, Feig confirmed that a direct sequel would not be made due to the film's mediocre box office performance.[164] The same month, Reitman stated in an interview that other Ghostbusters projects were in development.[165] Prior to Reitman's announcement, an animated series, Ghostbusters: Ecto Force, was stated to be targeting an early 2018 debut.[166] Reitman further clarified plans for future animated films within the Ghostbusters franchise during the July 2017 San Diego Comic Con, including having one set from the viewpoint of the ghosts rather than the Ghostbusters, as well as a work to potentially tie in to the 35th anniversary of the original film in 2019.[167]
