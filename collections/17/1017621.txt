Bacteria respond to osmotic stress by rapidly accumulating electrolytes or small organic solutes via transporters whose activities are stimulated by increases in osmolarity. The bacteria may also turn on genes encoding transporters of osmolytes and enzymes that synthesize osmoprotectants.[1] The EnvZ/OmpR two-component system, which regulates the expression of porins, is well characterized in the model organism E. coli.[2]
