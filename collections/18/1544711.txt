On June 16, 2013, a $1.2 billion widening project by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development was completed and opened to motorists. The bridge now consists of three 3.3-meter (11-foot) lanes in each direction, with inside and outside shoulders. Prior to the expansion, there were two 2.7-meter (9-foot) lanes in each direction with no shoulders.
