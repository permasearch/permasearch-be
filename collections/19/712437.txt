From 1873 to 1887, at least nominally, Austria and Russia were again allies with the German Empire in the League of Three Emperors. However, in order to counter Russia's support for independence movements in the Balkans, Austria occupied Bosnia in 1878. This brought Austria into conflict with the Principality of Serbia, an autonomous (de facto independent) state within the Ottoman Empire under Russian influence and protection.
