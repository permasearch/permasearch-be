Marna - A Khemirite woman. She suggested that her people should try farming for themselves, only to be vetoed because her ideas went against the Khemirites' culture. She went along with Darkstorm's plan to enslave the Spectral Knights but did not order them about to the extent of her fellow Khemirites; instead, on learning that Galadria was no good at sewing, she apologised, saying she had never had to handle human workers before. Later, when Arzon turned himself in rather than see his friends sent to the Vanadium Mines, she realised that freedom at the expense of others was wrong and freed the Spectral Knights.
