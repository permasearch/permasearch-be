The Kaliningrad Philharmonic Orchestra is accommodated in the former Catholic Church of the Holy Family of KÃ¶nigsberg, built in 1907. The church escaped major damage in World War II and was refurbished afterwards. The building, which has noted acoustics, functions as an organ hall since re-opening in 1980.
