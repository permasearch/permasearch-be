Maharashtra has 52% reservation in educational institutions and government jobs. The government of Maharashtra added Marathas (16%) and some Muslim subcastes (5%) to the reservation in 2014 but the move was rejected by the Mumbai High Court later.[40][41] If this reservation to Maratha implemented, it will leave the remaining 23% to General/Open category.[42][43]
