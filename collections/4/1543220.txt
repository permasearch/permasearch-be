British anti-imperialism emerged in the 1890s, especially in the Liberal Party. For over a century, back to the days of Adam Smith, a few intellectuals had been hostile to imperialism on the grounds that it is a violation of the principles of free trade; they never formed a popular movement, and indeed imperialism seems to have been generally popular before the 1890s.[17] The key impetus around 1900 came from public disgust with the British failures and atrocities connected with the Second Boer War (1899-1902). The War was fought against the Afrikaners, who were Dutch immigrants who had built new nations in South Africa. Opposition to the Second Boer War was modest when the war began, and was always less widespread than support for it, let alone the prevailing indifference. However, influential groups formed immediately and ineffectually against the war, including the South African Conciliation Committee and W. T. Stead's Stop the War Committee. Much of the opposition in Britain came from the Liberal party. Intellectuals and activists Britain based in the Socialist, labour, and Fabian movements generally oppose imperialism, and John A. Hobson, a Liberal, took many of his ideas from their writings.[18] After the Boer war, opponents of imperialism turn their attention to the British colonies in Africa and Asia.[19] By the 1920s, the government was sponsoring large-scale exhibits promoting imperialism, notably the 1924 British Empire Exhibition in London and the 1938 Glasgow Empire Exhibition. Some intellectuals use the opportunity to criticize imperialism as a policy.[20]
