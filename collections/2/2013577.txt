After the 1989 season, Fielder signed a two-year, $3 million contract with the Detroit Tigers.[6] Fielder hit 51 home runs with 132 RBIs in 1990. On the last day of the Tigers' season at Yankee Stadium, Fielder hit his 50th and 51st home runs to become the 11th player in MLB history – and only the second in the previous 25 years – to reach the 50-HR plateau.[7] No Detroit Tigers player had turned the mark since Hank Greenberg slugged 58 in 1938, and no Tiger player has reached 50 HR since. Fielder, whose previous high mark was 14 with Toronto in 1987, provided a sudden and unexpected emergence as a legitimate slugger. In addition to his 51 homers, Fielder also led the American League in RBI and total bases (339) that season. In 1990, Fielder also became the fourth American League player to ever have two three-home run games in a season.
