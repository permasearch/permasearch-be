The government is not permitted to fire an employee based on the employee's speech if either the speech is on a matter of public concern, the speech is not said as part of that employee's job duties,[51] or the damage caused by the speech is outweighed by the value of the speech to the employee and public.[52][53] Specifically, speech is "treated as a matter of public concern" by reference to the "content, form, and context of a given statement".[54] The exception with regards to balancing the harm of a statement and the value of the statement (the Pickering test) is done by considering the degree to which the speech either interferes with close working relationships, disrupts the office, or even has the potential to do either.[55]
