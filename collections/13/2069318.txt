In the wake of the war, Valentine informs him that he would never be allowed to return to Earth due to her own actions in an effort to protect him from Peter, who was becoming a major political force on Earth. He journeys with her to one of the colonies being established on the now-abandoned Bugger worlds. Once there, he discovers a fertilized pupa of a Queen Bugger, hidden in a place that the Buggers designed for him to discover by modelling it to resemble part of an interactive computer game he played during his years in the Battle School. The buggers find out about it during his tormented dreams of them in Command School. The pupal Queen is capable of continuing the Bugger race. Through rudimentary telepathic communication with the Queen, he learns what he had begun to suspect before the war's end: The entire conflict had been a mistake, the result of the inability of two alien species to communicate. He also learns from the Queen that the Buggers had regretted having mistakenly fought humans, and that they had forgiven Ender for destroying their world. Empathizing with the Queen, Ender promises to find her a home to grow where the Buggers would not be annihilated by the humans.
