The Place of No Stars, also known as the Dark Forest, is where the spirits of cats who have caused great pain and suffering in the lives of others go or are banished to. In this place, although there is no sun, moon, nor any stars, the entire forest is bathed in a sickly glow. There is no prey and cats feel no hunger either. Cats known to walk the Dark Forest include Thistleclaw, Tigerstar, Hawkfrost, Brokenstar, Darkstripe, Clawface and Mapleshade.[64] Victoria Holmes revealed on the website concerning fantasy authors Wands and Worlds that StarClan and The Dark Forest exist on different planes; however, there is a clear border between the territories, marked by a wall of mist. Many Clan cats in the Omen of the Stars series visit there for training for a battle against the Clans. However, many of them are oblivious to the fact that the warriors of the Dark Forest are actually training them to destroy the Clans, including StarClan, in their upcoming battle. Instead, they tell the Clan cats that they are doing this to become better warriors. In The Place of No Stars, cats who wish to leave are killed. The cats in training are ordered to fight with their claws unsheathed, which causes wounds in the waking world. Some of the Dark Forest warriors demonstrate what they will be training by using other Dark Forest warriors as dummies. During many of the demonstrations the 'dummies' are maimed or killed. In Omen of the Stars, Ivypool trains there, but when she realizes that it is not right, Jayfeather, Lionblaze, and Dovewing ask her to spy on the Dark Forest, because there is a battle between them, StarClan, and the Clans yet to come. In the Great Battle, the Dark Forest spirits attack.
