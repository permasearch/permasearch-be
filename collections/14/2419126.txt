This titre has a significance only if it is greatly elevated (>200), or if a rise in titre can be demonstrated in paired blood samples taken days apart. The antibody levels begin to rise after 1 to 3 weeks of strep infection, peaks in 3 to 5 weeks and falls back to insignificant levels in 6 months. Values need to be correlated with a clinical diagnosis.
