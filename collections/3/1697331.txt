When Thornton Burgess began making up bedtime stories with named animals for his 4-year-old son, the boy was already familiar with Beatrix Potter's Peter Rabbit character, and would not allow his father to give his stories' rabbit character any other name. Later when the boy stayed with grandparents for a month while widower Burgess (his wife had died in childbirth) worked, he wrote stories down and mailed them to be read to the boy. Later still, the magazine where Burgess worked published a few of those stories. Then a representative of publisher Little, Brown came by asking the magazine editor about children's stories, and the editor pointed him to Burgess. Little, Brown then published some of Burgess' stories as the book Old Mother West Wind. The name of Burgess' rabbit character was never changed along the way.
