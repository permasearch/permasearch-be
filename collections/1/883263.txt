Riot Games officially opened its office in September 2006, and, as of 2013, has over 1,000 people working on League of Legends.[54] According to Marc Merrill, when creating the various champions in the game, instead of leaving the champion creation to just a few people, they decided to open up the champion creation process to everyone in the company based upon a template where they could vote on which champions made it into the game.[citation needed]
