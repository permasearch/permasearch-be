The Diahot River is the longest river of New Caledonia, flowing for some 100 kilometres (62 mi).[37] It has a catchment area of 620 km2 (240 sq mi) and opens north-westward into the Baie d'Harcourt, flowing towards the northern point of the island along the western escarpment of the Mount Panié.[37][38] Most of the island is covered by wet evergreen forests, while savannahs dominate the lower elevations.[39] The New Caledonian lagoon, with a total area of 24,000 square kilometres (9,300 sq mi) is one of the largest lagoons in the world. It is surrounded by the New Caledonia Barrier Reef.[36]
