Doc and Marty return to 1986 where all is normal. In this timeline, there was no estate sale because Doc had been able to reconcile with his father, thus giving him and his family reason to stay part-time in Hill Valley. They find that Edna and Kid had fallen in love while in jail, and afterwards married and both became much happier and friendlier since. Doc reveals his previous absence to Marty, that he had been traveling in time to compile a history of the McFly family to present to Marty as a graduation gift. Suddenly, three separate DeLoreans appear, each with a different future version of Marty driving them. They approach Marty and Doc and insist they come to help assure that their respective futures occur as they are supposed to. Doc and his Marty leave the Marties arguing with each other, saying the future can wait until after they have enjoyed the present for a while; they then depart to an unknown time.
