Believers in the lunar theory suggest several different mechanisms by which the behaviour of the Moon could influence the behaviour of human beings. A common suggestion is that, since the Moon affects large bodies of water such as the ocean (a phenomenon known as "tidal force"), the Moon should be expected to have an analogous effect on human beings, whose bodies contain a great deal of water.[5][57] However, this is a misconception that fails to take into account differences in scale. The tidal force is in fact very weak and should be expected to exercise no more gravitational pull on the human body than a mosquito.[5] Besides this, the "suggestion" failed to account for the dependence of tides from both the phase of the Moon and the time of day.
