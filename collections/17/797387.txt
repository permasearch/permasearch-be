Erik Erikson saw the destiny neurosis—the way 'that some people make the same mistakes over and over'—in the same light: 'the individual unconsciously arranges for variations of an original theme which he has not learned either to overcome or to live with'.[24] Ego psychology would subsequently take for granted 'how rigidly determined our lives are—how predictable and repetitive...the same mistake over and over again'.[25]
