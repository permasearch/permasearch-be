Southern public schools in the past ranked in the lower half of some national surveys.[87]  When allowance for race is considered, a 2007 US Government list of test scores often shows white fourth and eighth graders performing better than average for reading and math; while black fourth and eighth graders also performed better than average.[88] This comparison does not hold across the board. Mississippi scores lower than average no matter how the statistics are compared.  Newer data suggests that education in the South is on par with the nation, with 72% of high schoolers graduating compared to 73% nationwide.[89]
