Female farm workers may often face social challenges and adverse mental health effects while working, with one of the biggest challenges being social inequality. The number of women working in agriculture has risen and the 2002 census of agriculture recorded a 40% increase in the number of female farm workers.[77] Inequality and respect are common issues for these workers, as many have reported that they are not being respected, listened to, or taken seriously due to traditional views of women as housewives and caretakers.[78]
