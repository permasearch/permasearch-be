Muriel Bagge is the series' damsel in distress, the kind owner of Courage and the hard-working wife of Eustace. She is an overweight, elderly Scottish woman who took Courage in when he was an abandoned puppy.[2] Muriel often carries a rolling pin that she hits Eustace with whenever he harasses Courage. She also likes tea and usually tends to her garden, as well as being an accomplished sitar player. Muriel even has a great fondness for cooking; however, her recipes tend to include an excessive amount of vinegar (which she swears by), much to the distaste of both her dog and husband. Most of all, she loves sitting in her rocking chair with Courage on her lap and watching television. Due to her kindness and sweet, naive nature, Muriel is an easy (and often attractive) target for villains.
