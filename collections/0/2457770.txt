The Endless Mountains are a chain of mountains in northeastern Pennsylvania which are part of the Appalachian Mountains chain. The "mountains" are not true mountains, geologically speaking, but are a dissected plateau and are part of the Allegheny Plateau, along with the higher Catskill Mountains to the east of the Endless Mountains in New York.
