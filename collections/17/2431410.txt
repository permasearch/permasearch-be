I was going to add the {{Very Long}} tag to this article, but noticed the smaller tag already there suggesting that this article may be a good candidate for breaking up into multiple smaller articles. I personally would vote "yea" to doing this; as it stands, the article is simply too long with too much content in one space; one cannot easily get a "rundown" of what the fed is about without surfing through tons of detail you might notbe looking for or interested in.
