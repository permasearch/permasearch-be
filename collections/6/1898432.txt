But, going a little further than mere civility is not a bad idea. We all like to be respected, and we all deserve respect. Most of us respect other Wikipedia editors, even if we have never met them, simply because they are Wikipedia editors, and we are all working on to improve the encyclopedia together. As well, we all agree Wikipedia is a noble causeâ€“even if we disagree about the wording of the last sentence of the lead.
