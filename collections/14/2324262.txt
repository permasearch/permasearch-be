Population geography is a division of human geography. It is the study of the ways in which spatial variations in the distribution, composition, migration, and growth of populations are related to the nature of places. Population geography involves demography in a geographical perspective. It focuses on the characteristics of population distributions that change in a spatial context. This often involves factors such as where populations are found, how the size and composition of these populations is regulated by the demographic processes of fertility, mortality and migration.[1] Contributions to population geography are cross-disciplinary because ‘geographical’ epistemologies related to environment, place and space have been developed during varying times.[2] Some of these related disciplines include geography and demography, sociology, or economics.
