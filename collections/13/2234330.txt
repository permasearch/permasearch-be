Healthy to begin the 1975 season, Ellis continued to perform well at the beginning of the season.[75] In August, the Pirates asked Ellis to pitch in the bullpen; he refused on consecutive nights.[76] On August 15, 1975, Ellis refused assignment to the bullpen again; as a result, the Pirates suspended him for one day.[6] Ellis called for a team meeting the next day, where he was expected to apologize. Instead, he berated Murtaugh, who responded by cursing at Ellis, ordering the pitcher out of the clubhouse[77] and attempting to fight him.[6] Coach Don Leppert reportedly also tried to fight Ellis.[6] The Pirates suspended Ellis for thirty days[6] and fined him $2,000.[77] The suspension was lifted on August 30 when Ellis apologized to Murtaugh.[6]
