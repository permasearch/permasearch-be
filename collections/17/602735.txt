In the third season, he aligns himself with the new Chancellor after a grounder clan bombed Mount Weather, killing 49 people, including his girlfriend. In the process he betrays Marcus Kane and put the whole of The Ark at risk of death. The bombing was made possible because Bellamy trusted Echo, the grounder he saved in the previous season in Mount Weather, and listened to the false information she delivered. He helps to put in prison his sister's boyfriend Lincoln, which leads to Lincoln's execution. After Pike's election, Bellamy is one of the nine guards (along with Pike himself) that carry out the chancellor's orders to kill the 299 grounder warriors sent by Lexa.
