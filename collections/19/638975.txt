There is some uncertainty over who produced the song as Spector took the credit as the producer on many tracks and 'B' sides that were produced by Medley.[34] However, Medley, who had produced the duo before they signed with Spector and Philles, consistently stated that he produced this recording.[35] Spector was primarily interested in producing singles and "Unchained Melody" was originally intended to be an album cut. Medley said: "Phil came to me and asked me to produce the Righteous Brothers albums because he would have taken too long and it would have cost too much money."[36] By Medley's account, Spector only claimed production credit after it supplanted "Hung On You" as the hit.[37] Early copies of the single did not credit a producer for "Unchained Melody" and only credited Spector as producer of the original single "Hung On You". Later pressings of the single credited Spector as the producer.
