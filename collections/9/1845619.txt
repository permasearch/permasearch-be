In colonial history context, the construction and implementation of Hindu law and Islamic law was an attempt at "legal pluralism" during the British colonial era, where people in the same region were subjected to different civil and criminal laws based on the religion of the plaintiff and defendant.[15][16] Legal scholars state that this divided the Indian society, and that Indian law and politics have ever since vacillated between "legal pluralism - the notion that religion is the basic unit of society and different religions must have different legal rights and obligations" and "legal universalism â€“ the notion that individuals are the basic unit of society and all citizens must have uniform legal rights and obligations".[15] In modern India, Hindus and other non-Muslims in India favor legal universalism that is based not on any Hindu text but on parliamentary laws, however Muslims favor legal pluralism with sharia as the source of marriage, divorce and inheritance laws for Muslims in India.[15][17][18]
