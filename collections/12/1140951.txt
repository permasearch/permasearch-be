Upon her reintroduction, the writers pair Lani with JJ — another one of her colleagues. Stowers liked the pairing "because they're fun" she stated. "They have this very playful chemistry but they also really get each other." However, Lani feels the rookie JJ will let their relationship interfere with their work, so she tries to cut him out of things. This backfires when Lani is abducted by a drug dealer and forced to take drugs. She experiences withdrawal and at same time questions the future of her relationship with JJ. "She wonders if this is what he really wants or if it's just something to get him by."[22] Stowers relished in the opportunity to show her acting chops as Lani suffered from withdrawals after ingesting halo. "I spent a lot of time researching what addicts go through during withdrawal — I didn't know there was fear, loneliness, and hot and cold sensations, feeling like your skin is on fire." Stowers admitted that she had to go a "dark place" but she was up for the challenge.[22] "I'm a very positive, happy person, so to put myself in a dark place was scary." Lani is adamant about keeping JJ out of her struggles because "she had something to prove to herself" and JJ. "She wanted to show JJ that she could hold it together."[11] Stowers said it was easy work with Casey Moss and credited her costar with making her feel comfortable.[19]
