The centre circle is marked at 9.15 metres (10Â yd) from the centre mark. Similar to the penalty arc, this indicates the minimum distance that opposing players must keep at kick-off; the ball itself is placed on the centre mark.[14] During penalty shootouts all players other than the two goalkeepers and the current kicker are required to remain within this circle.
