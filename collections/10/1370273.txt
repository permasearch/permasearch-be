POWER6 was the fruit of the ambitions eCLipz Project, joining the I (AS/400), P (RS/6000) and Z (Mainframe) instruction sets under one common platform. I and P was already joined with the POWER4, but the eCLipz effort failed to include the CISC based z/Architecture and where the z10 processor became POWER6's eCLipz sibling. z/Architecture remains a separate design track to this day not related to Power Architecture instruction set in any way.
