Each main cast member auditioned for Friends having had some degree of prior sitcom experience.[58] Before finally being cast in Friends, Cox's burgeoning success as an actress had heavily relied on her physical appearance.[59] Unlike her previous roles in projects such as Family Ties and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, the Los Angeles Times Steve Weinstein believes that Monica was the first major role in which Cox was cast based on her abilities as a comedic actress as opposed to her beauty.[59] Cox believes that she owes winning the role to her brief stint as Gabriella Easden on the short-lived sitcom The Trouble With Larry, which she considers to be the first time she played a character who "was the funny one", which in turn earned the actress a recommendation for Friends following its cancellation.[59] When Friends premiered, Cox was the show's most famous main cast member among a cast of young, relatively unknown actors, and was thus initially perceived by critics and audiences as the show's star,[54] despite Crane and Kauffman's efforts to promote Friends as an ensemble comedy.[11] According to actress Lisa Kudrow, who portrays Phoebe, Cox is responsible for suggesting that the entire cast work together as a team.[57] As the most experienced cast member at the time, Cox advised her co-stars to remain open to each other's ideas, notes and suggestions, while giving them permission to tell her "If I could do anything funnier".[57] Cox was originally the highest-paid cast member.[60] Preferring to be treated as equals, the entire cast negotiated for universal salaries, demanding that Warner Bros. accommodate their request of $100,000 per episode in season three, increased from their original inaugural season salary of $22,000 per episode.[11] At one point, the actors went as far as threatening to boycott their own show should their demands be denied,[61] temporarily refusing to renew their expired contracts.[62] The studio eventually complied, and by season 10 each actor was being paid $1 million per episode,[28] making Cox and her female co-stars the highest-paid television actresses of all time.[63]
