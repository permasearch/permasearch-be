Character history Neil Fenmore was the father of two daughters: Jill and Lauren. Neil Fenmore came from a wealthy family. He went to high school with Gary Reynolds, Katherine Chancellor, John Abbott, Dina Mergeron, Joanna Manning, Stuart Brooks and Suzanne Lynch. Most of those early friendships lasted throughout the years. When Neil was a teenager, his girlfriend had a baby girl, gave her up for adoption and then committed suicide. That baby turned out to be Jill Foster Abbott. He ran the department store chain Fenmore's Boutiques and had raised another daughter, Lauren Fenmore, on his own after his wife, Joanna Manning, left town. Neil and Lauren were fairly close. However, he tragically died of a stroke in 1986. Lauren was the sole heir to the department store chain.
