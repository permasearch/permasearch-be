A stalled mining industry in late 2012 led to new lows in early 2013.[6] In late January 2014, the Rand slid to R11.25 to the dollar, with analysts attributing the shift to "word from the US Federal Reserve that it would trim back stimulus spending, which led to a massive sell-off in emerging economies."[7] In 2014 South Africa experienced its worst year against the US dollar since 2009,[8] and in March 2015, the Rand traded at its worst since 2002.[8] At the time, Trading Economics released data that the Rand "averaged R4.97 to the dollar between 1972 and 2015, reaching an all time high of R12.45 in December of 2001 and a record low of R0.67 in June of 1973."[8] By the end of 2014, the Rand had weakened to RÂ 15.05 per dollar, partly due to South Africa's consistent trade account deficit with the rest of the world.
