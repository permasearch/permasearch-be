The specific microRNA, miR-506 has been found to work as a tumor antagonist in several studies.[154] In a 2014 study, a significant number of cervical cancer samples were found to have down-regulated expression of miR-506. Additionally, studies found that miR-506 works to promote apoptosis of cervical cancer cells, through its direct target hedgehog pathway transcription factor, Gli3.[155]
