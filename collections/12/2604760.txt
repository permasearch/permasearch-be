At the Congress of Berlin in 1878, the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Andr√°ssy obtained the occupation and administration of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and he also obtained the right to station garrisons in the Sanjak of Novi Pazar, which remained under Ottoman administration until 1908, when the Austro-Hungarian troops withdrew from the Sanjak.
