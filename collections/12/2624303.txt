Hayek believed that after World War II, "wisdom in the management of our economic affairs will be even more important than before and that the fate of our civilization will ultimately depend on how we solve the economic problems we shall then face".[25] The only chance to build a decent world is "to improve the general level of wealth" via the activities of free markets.[26] He saw international organization as involving a further threat to individual freedom.[27] He concluded: "The guiding principle that a policy of freedom for the individual is the only truly progressive policy remains as true today as it was in the nineteenth century."[28]
