Milk's fat content can be determined by experimental means, such as the Babcock test or Gerber Method.  Before the Babcock test was created, dishonest milk dealers could adulterate milk to falsely indicate a higher fat content.  In 1911, the American Dairy Science Association's Committee on Official Methods of Testing Milk and Cream for Butterfat met in Washington DC with the U.S. Bureau of Dairying, the U.S. Bureau of Standards and manufacturers of glassware.[6]  Standard specifications for the Babcock methodology and equipment were published as a result of this meeting.[7]  Improvements to the Babcock test have continued.[8][9]
