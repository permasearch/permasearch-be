Cracks were appearing along clan lines among the ruling Dinka. Kiir's Dinka of Warrap were in a feud with the Dinka of Paul Malong Awan's Aweil, who contributed the bulk of the government's fighting force in the war.[244] In May 2017, Kiir reduced the power of the chief of staff position[247] and fired the powerful Dinka nationalist army chief of staff Malong Awan and replaced him with General James Ajonga Mawut, who is not a Dinka but a Luo.[248] Awan left Juba with most of his Mathiang Anyoor militia.[249] Awan was accused of plotting a rebellion and was detained but then released following pressure from the Dinka lobbying group, the Dinka Council of Elders,[250] In late May, Kiir declared a unilateral ceasefire, which was taken with suspicion by others as it came after the late April government offensive that retook much territory and before the rainy season that would have anyway reduced fighting.[251] Three days after the fall of the second headquarters, Lasu in the South of the country, the government signed another ceasefire with the rebels in December 2017.[252]
