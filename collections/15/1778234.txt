For 1995, a driver's-side air bag was added as well as day time running lights. In 1996 the 4.3 L engine was refreshed, and a third (rear) door was added for extended cab models, along with the sportside bed option. In 1998, the exterior, interior, brakes, and 2.2 L I4 engine were refreshed, along with a "next-generation" supplemental restraint system that added a passenger-side air bag. "Auto-Trac" all-wheel drive also became an option starting in 1999 for the 4WD Blazers. The SS package was replaced by the "Xtreme" package. In 2001 a crew cab option was added and was available in 4WD and automatic transmission only. For the 2004 model year, the regular and extended cab models were discontinued; only the crew cab model was retained.
