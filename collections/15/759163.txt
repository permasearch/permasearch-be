Two seasons have been played without a captain. Nobody was assigned to the position for the 1996–97 season after previous captain Patrick Flatley was released from his contract.[157] The 2000–01 season also went by without a captain after Kenny Jonsson stepped down from the position on November 18, 2000.[158]
