In order to curb Pietism several royal decrees and parliament acts were issued in the 18th century; they forbade Swedish citizens to practice any religion besides mandatory Lutheran Sunday mass and daily family devotions. Without the presence of a Lutheran clergyman public religious gatherings were forbidden. It remained illegal until 1860 for Lutheran Swedes to convert to another confession or religion.
