The quest structure unfolds to accommodate the exploration of tribes, while the main story covers the entire world.[31] Side quests involve Aloy completing tasks, like gathering materials, coming to the aid of individuals in danger of being killed, solving mysteries, assuming control of bandit camps, eliminating criminals and more difficult machines, accomplishing various challenges at any of the five Hunting Grounds,[32][6] and obtaining an ancient armour that makes Aloy almost impervious to damage.[12] A dialogue wheel is used to communicate with non-player characters.[13] Collectibles include vantages that offer visual information of the Old World, metal flowers, which when acquired contain poetry, and old relics, such as ancient mugs and tribal artefacts.[33]
