The second season was originally set to move to a Thursday timeslot, to anchor a new Must See TV lineup, alongside Will & Grace, Great News and Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders, with NBC chairman Bob Greenblatt explaining, "While this is a bit risky, there is a bigger case to be made about redoing Thursday night. If there is one show we could move, it would be this one."[30] However, on May 30, 2017, NBC decided to keep the series on Tuesdays at 9Â pm EST,[31] allowing it a run of 10 uninterrupted original episodes in the fall.[32]
