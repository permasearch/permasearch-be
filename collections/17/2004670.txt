Beginning with the 2006 game, the Chick-fil-A Bowl purchased the right to select the highest-ranked Atlantic Coast Conference team after representatives from the Bowl Championship Series made their selection. The contract was renewed in 2009, extending that right through 2013.[1] According to the official selection rules used in the 2009â€“10 season, the team chosen to represent the ACC in the Chick-fil-A Bowl had to be within one conference victory of the remaining highest-ranked conference team or ranked more than five spaces ahead of the ACC team with the best conference record available in the final BCS standings.[2] Following the conclusion of the 2009 college football regular season, the Chick-fil-A Bowl selection committee bypassed the ACC Championship Game loser, Clemson, in order to pick Virginia Tech, which had the same conference record.[3] The committee believed a game featuring Virginia Tech would draw more television viewers and in-person attendance than Clemson,[4][5] even though the Chick-fil-A Bowl was the third time that season Virginia Tech played a game in Atlanta.[6]
