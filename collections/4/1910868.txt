Eridan is shown as an aristocrat with a genocidal superiority complex.[25] He has a strong desire to kill all land-dwelling Trolls and had commissioned a doomsday device from Vriska to that effect.[26] He is a violet blood, making him part of the two castes that make up the sea-dwellers, a sub-race of trolls "distinct from the commoners by mutation and habitat", as it is put in his introductory page[25], which relates to his star sign Aquarius.
