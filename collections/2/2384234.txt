Most people peel a banana by cutting or snapping the stem and divide the peel into sections while pulling them away from the bared fruit. Another way of peeling a banana is done in the opposite direction, from the end with the brownish floral residue. A way usually perceived as "upside down". This way is also known as the "monkey method", since it is how monkeys are said to peel bananas.[21][22]
