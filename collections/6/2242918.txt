Like in Germany and the USA, the medical profession in Canada is not regulated at the federal level. The Canadian medical profession is regulated, instead, at the provincial or territorial level (e.g. the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario). Nonetheless, the Canadian Medical Association serves a similar function, in that country, as its German and American counterparts do in those two respective countries.
