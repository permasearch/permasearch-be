Approximately 3 million cell clusters called pancreatic islets are present in the pancreas.[2] Within these islets are four main types of cells which are involved in the regulation of blood glucose levels.[2] Each type of cell secretes a different type of hormone: α alpha cells secrete glucagon (increase glucose in blood), β beta cells secrete insulin (decrease glucose in blood), δ delta cells secrete somatostatin (regulates/stops α and β cells) and PP cells, or γ (gamma) cells, secrete pancreatic polypeptide.[2][12] These act to control blood glucose through secreting glucagon to increase the levels of glucose, and insulin to decrease it.
