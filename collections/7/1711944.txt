George Mathews, a former governor of Georgia, was then appointed the governorship, though the appointment was revoked before he took office.[13] Third governor was Robert Williams, from May 1805 to March 1809. David Holmes was the last governor of the Mississippi Territory, 1809â€“17. Holmes was generally successful in dealing with a variety of matters, including expansion, land policy, Indians, the War of 1812, and the constitutional convention of 1817 (of which he was elected president). Often concerned with problems regarding West Florida, he had a major role in 1810 in negotiations which led to the peaceful occupation of part of that territory. McCain (1967) concludes that Holmes' success was not based on brilliance, but upon kindness, unselfishness, persuasiveness, courage, honesty, diplomacy, and intelligence.[14]
