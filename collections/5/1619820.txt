The Fire Emblem games take place across multiple unrelated settings within a Medieval or Renaissance-themed time period, with the story generally focused on the main protagonist, usually a member of royalty, caught in the conflict of two or more countries across a continent and fighting for their cause before having to defeat the game's final boss. [47][48][49] The continents of Archanea and Valentia are the settings of Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light, Gaiden, Mystery of the Emblem and Awakening, with Awakening taking place several millennia after the other games.[6][50] It was also the planned setting for Fire Emblem 64.[51] Genealogy of the Holy War and Thracia 776 are set in the land of Jugdral, while Fire Emblem and Binding Blade take place in Elibe. The Sacred Stones is set in the land of Magvel. Path of Radiance and Radiant Dawn are set on the continent of Tellius.[6]
