Commercialization of SPD is accelerating in the automotive industry for reasons including safety, comfort, fuel economy, and design.[5] SPD automotive side and rear windows and sunroofs offer many benefits to passengers in the vehicle. Because of their fast-switching and ability to be tuned, they reduce unwanted light and glare, which allows users to maintain their views of the outside while reducing glare on displays and video screens, or tint the windows for additional privacy. SPD automotive glass also minimizes heat build-up inside the vehicle because of their ability to block solar heat gain. Many SPD window systems automatically switch to their maximum heat-blocking state when the vehicle is not in use.
