Following the decommissioning of the siren network in 1993, some sirens networks were repurposed and used as flood warning sirens to warn people living, particularly in coastal areas, of an emergency. However, with the advent of digital services and mobile technology, many local authorities are now retiring them in favour of contacting people by telephone instead. In January 2007, proposals to retire a network of sirens in Norfolk were made by the Norfolk Resilience Forum. In November 2007, residents were angered after the sirens had not sounded following a tidal surge in Walcott. In 2008, a review of the current role of and future of flood warning sirens was undertaken by Norfolk County Council, after plans to retire them were halted following concerns from nearby residents.[30] Although some of the sirens were initially withdrawn, 40 out of the 57 were eventually temporarily reinstated.[31] Despite this, in July 2010 the flood warning sirens were finally retired in favour of alerting people by telephone, SMS or e-mail. After three years of consultations, the council had failed to demonstrate that refurbishing the sirens would be a worthwhile investment.[32]
