Goldfinger's $3 million budget was recouped in two weeks, and it broke box office records in multiple countries around the world.[4] The Guinness Book of World Records went on to list Goldfinger as the fastest grossing film of all time.[4] Demand for the film was so high that the DeMille cinema in New York City had to stay open twenty-four hours a day.[75] The film closed its original box office run having grossed $23 million in the United States[60] and $46 million worldwide.[76] After reissues, the first being as a double feature with Dr. No in 1966,[77] Goldfinger grossed a total of $51,081,062 in the United States[78] and $73,800,000 elsewhere, for a total worldwide gross of $124,900,000.[79]
