In 1896 the Tabulating Machine Company leased some machines to a railway company[14] but quickly focused on the challenges of the largest statistical endeavor of its day â€“ the 1900 US Census. After winning the government contract and completing the project, Hollerith was faced with the challenge of sustaining the company in non-Census years. He returned to targeting private businesses both in the United States and abroad, attempting to identify industry applications for his semiautomatic punching, tabulating and sorting machines.[15] Flint bought the business for $2.3 million (of which Hollerith got $1.2 million) in 1911.
