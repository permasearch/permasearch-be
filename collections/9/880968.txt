Literacy in India is a key for socio-economic progress,[2] and the Indian literacy rate has grown to 74% (2011 Census figure), with recent reports of 80% literacy approaching the world average  rate of 84%.[3] The literacy rate at the end of British rule in 1947 was around 12%[4][5][6].   Despite government programmes, India's literacy rate increased only "sluggishly".[7] The 2011 census, indicated a 2001â€“2011 decadal literacy growth of 9.2%, which is slower than the growth seen during the previous decade. An old 1990 study estimated that it would take until 2060 for India to achieve universal literacy at then-current rate of progress.[8]
