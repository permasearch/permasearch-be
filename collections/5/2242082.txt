Ayesha Antoine plays Rachel Baptiste, who appears from series eleven, episode six[20] as a staff nurse on the general surgery ward, Keller.[21] Antoine had formerly appeared in Holby City series seven, episode five, as Mel Allen, the relative of a patient.[22] She described her character upon her introduction as "quite nervous, but very excited",[23] expanding that: "She loves her job, caring for people and being helpful. She is at the beginning of a new stage in her life, and it's quite an upturn for her, and she's just very interested in getting to know everyone and is excited at being part of a group."[23] The BBC describe Rachel as: "warm and kind but perhaps a little too trusting. She's anxious to please. She loves nursing but her real passion is her boyfriend, Patrick."[24] Antoine received just a thumbnail sketch of Rachel's background, but commented that: "I love it. Give me a bit of spare time and I'll tell you what my character did age four and a half - whether it's a lot or a little, it's all good."[25] During Holby City's eleventh series, Rachel uncovers Daisha Anderson's post-natal depression and helps to support her, before being transferred to the hospital's geriatric ward. Executive producer Tony McHale commented on Rachel's transfer: "Although she is still working in the hospital, we are not likely to see her on our regular wards for some time."[26] Rachel is of Afrocaribbean heritage.
