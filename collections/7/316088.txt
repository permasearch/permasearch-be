Both the Escape and Tribute were refreshed in 2004 for the 2005 model year. The base engine became the Mazda 2.3 L MZR 4 with 153 PS (114 kW)/206 N·m (152 lb·ft), and the top remained the 3.0 L Duratec V6, now with torque down to 261 N·m (193 lb·ft). In North American-built models, a floor-mounted automatic transmission shifter replaced the column shifter. However, Japanese-built models continued with a column shifter. Mazda decided to halt production after the 2006 model year
