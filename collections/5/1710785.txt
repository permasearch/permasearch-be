For the US version, three tracks were dropped: "Naggin' Woman" would be held over for the US only Kinkdom LP, and both sides of their recent hit single, "Tired of Waiting for You" and "Come On Now", were already placed on the previous US album Kinks-Size.  These were replaced with the recent single "Set Me Free" and "Ev'rybody's Gonna Be Happy" (recently issued as a B-side in the US but originally a single in the UK).
