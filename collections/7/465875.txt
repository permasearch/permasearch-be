The dry season—November through April—is warm and mostly dry, with 80 °F (27 °C) temperatures remaining fairly commonplace even from December through February. However, the area experiences occasional cold fronts during this period, with daytime temperatures below 65 °F (18 °C) and lows dropping to 45 °F (7 °C) or further. These fronts last only a few days before high temperatures return to the 70s to 80s and low temperatures to the mid-60s.[39] During a severe and prolonged cold snap in January 2010, the city recorded 12 consecutive days of low temperatures at or below 45 °F (7 °C). Nine of the twelve days were below 40 °F (4 °C), with several mornings at or near freezing.[40]
