Rhimes entitled the episode "Losing My Religion" because she felt "that is what happens to each intern in this episode. Each intern lets go of the things they've held onto all season. George lets go of loving Meredith. Cristina lets go of her well-checked emotions. Izzie is forced to let go of her idealism. And that leads to her letting go of medicine. Alex lets go of his rage against Izzie. And Meredith... well, Meredith just lets go."[1] The costumes were designed by Mimi Melgaard; Rhimes noted that everyone was dressed in dark funeral colors to the prom, except Stevens who was dressed in pink.[1] Stevens' dress was an Amsale creation.[6] Monologues done by the five main characters were used in this episode. Rhimes commented: "this was something we'd never done and I wasn't sure would work. But you place those pages into the hands of the actors and each and every one of them layered their characters' souls right into the dialogue."[7] The episode's theme was the prom; Rhimes said she wanted to do it since the beginning of the season.[1]
