Marriott's Great America, built by hotel and restaurant operator Marriott Corporation, opened to the public on March 21, 1976.[1] Less than two weeks later on May 29, the company opened a second Marriott's Great America – later known as Six Flags Great America – north of Chicago in Gurnee, Illinois.[2] A third park was initially planned for the Baltimore–Washington Metropolitan Area, but the idea was later abandoned after several failed attempts to sway local opposition.[3]
