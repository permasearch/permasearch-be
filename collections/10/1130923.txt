The performance lineup is announced in the month of December each year, and a more complete schedule known as the "cubes" or "grids" is released in early April. Tickets can be purchased online or from the New Orleans Arena Box Office or New Orleans Zephyr Field. Ticket prices have increased dramatically since a rainy 2004 Festival; in 1997, tickets were $12 and, by 2007, they cost $45 at the gate or $35 in advance.[9] In 2014, they cost $55 in advance and $70 at the gate. There are also kids' tickets (ages 2â€“10) available for $5. In addition, there are various VIP packages available.
