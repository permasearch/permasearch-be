In 1998, activists on campus (including Professor Patrick Slattery) suggested the statue of former university president Lawrence Sullivan Ross should be removed on the basis that he was a member of the Ku Klux Klan.[38] Instead, Slattery and others wanted to create a "diversity plaza", with a statue of Matthew Gaines, an African-American politician.[38] The project was abandoned in the wake of the Aggie Bonfire tragedy, in 1999.[38]
