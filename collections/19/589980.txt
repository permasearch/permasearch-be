Two years later, at the 1956 Convention the Gentlemen's Agreement was also dropped leaving no race restrictions. Immediately following the 1956 Convention, Phi Chapter at Swarthmore, in Pennsylvania, pledged a black man from the Gold Coast. The Grand President simply took the stance that he would not suspend the chapter, since neither the Bedford Resolution, nor any other agreement was in place. At the 1958 Convention there was little discussion of the matter.
