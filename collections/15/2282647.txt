In early days of photography, available shutter speeds were not standardized, though a typical sequence might have been ​1⁄10 s, ​1⁄25 s, ​1⁄50 s, ​1⁄100 s, ​1⁄200 s and ​1⁄500 s; neither were apertures or film sensitivity (at least 3 different national standards existed). Soon this problem resulted in a solution consisting in the adoption of a standardized way of choosing aperture so that each major step exactly doubled or halved the amount of light entering the camera (f/2.8, f/4, f/5.6, f/8, f/11, f/16, etc.), a standardized 2:1 scale was adopted for shutter speed so that opening one aperture stop and reducing the amount of time of the shutter speed by one step resulted in the identical exposure. The agreed standards for shutter speeds are:[3]
