The Brewers added Davis to their 40-man roster during the 2012â€“13 offseason.[4] After a productive spring training,[5] Davis made the final roster cut and made his major league debut on opening day, grounding out in a pinch-hit appearance. Five days later, Davis made his first major league start in left field and recorded his first major league hit, a double off Patrick Corbin of the Arizona Diamondbacks. After a poor start that saw him bat just .188, Davis was optioned to Nashville.
