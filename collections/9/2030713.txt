In 1963 the Harley Davidson Motor Company began producing golf cars. Over the years they manufactured and distributed thousands of three- and four-wheeled fuel-powered and electric vehicles that are still highly sought after. The iconic three-wheeled cart, with either a steering wheel or a tiller-based steering control, boasted a reversible two-stroke engine similar to one used today in some high-end snowmobiles. (The engine runs clockwise in forward mode.) In 1982 Harley Davidson sold the production of golf cars to the Columbia Car Company. Many of these gems survive today and are the prized possessions of proud owners, restorers, and collectors worldwide.
