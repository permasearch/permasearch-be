The Western Han capital at Chang'an was divided into one hundred and sixty walled residential wards.[128] Affairs of each ward were overseen by a low-ranking official.[128] Influential families within the wards usually maintained social order.[128] Historians are still unsure as to how many government-controlled marketplaces existed in Chang'an.[128] Although there are claims of nine markets, it is possible that seven of them were actually divisible parts of two main markets: the East Market and West Market.[128] Both the East Market and West Market had a two-story government office with a flag and drum placed on the roof.[70] A market chief and deputy were headquartered in each of these buildings, yet not much is known about their involvement in the marketplace.[70] In the Eastern Han capital of Luoyang, the market chief's office employed thirty-six sub-officers who ventured into the marketplace daily to maintain law and order.[70] They also collected taxes on commercial goods, assigned standard prices for specific commodities on the basis of monthly reviews, and authorized contracts between merchants and their customers or clients.[70] Besides merchants engaging in marketplace violations, other crimes were committed by adolescent street gangs who often wore clothes distinguishing their gang.[129] The maintenance of law and order outside the market and in slum areas was conducted by constables; Han officials sometimes argued for increasing their salaries which they assumed would encourage them to reject bribes from criminals.[129]
