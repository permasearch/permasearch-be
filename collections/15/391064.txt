John & Edward, now known as Jedward, are identical twin brothers John and Edward Grimes (born 16 October 1991),[72] from Dublin, Republic of Ireland. They both attended the Dublin Institute of Education[73] and are known for their distinctive blonde quiffs. The twins started singing at the age of five.[74] There was controversy surrounding the two of them when they sang over the other people in their section during the bootcamp auditions. Cowell said that they had put the people in their group at a disadvantage, but the other contestants were eliminated after Louis Walsh championed the twins.
