At 7.25%, California has the highest minimum statewide sales tax rate in the United States,[5] which can total up to 10.25% with local sales taxes included.[6] As of January 1, 2017, the statewide sales tax rate decreased from 7.50% to 7.25% as a result of the expiration of the temporary statewide sales tax increase under Proposition 30 that California voters approved in November 2012.[7]
