The total number of questions available in the game changed. As the number of questions changed, so did the total prize money available. In 2017, KBC introduced a jackpot question. If the contestant reaches question 10 and answers it correctly, the "Jio Jackpot" (named after one of the shows sponsors) gets unlocked. For the Jackpot Question, the contestants are not allowed to use any of the remaining lifelines.
