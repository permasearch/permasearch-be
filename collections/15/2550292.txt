The Commission was the governing board of the IPCC, holding collective responsibility for governance of the Commission including oversight of the Executive. As public office holders, Commissioners oversaw IPCC investigations and the promotion of public confidence in the complaints system (known as Guardianship). Each Commissioner also had responsibility for a particular portfolio such as firearms, deaths in custody, road policing and youth engagement.[citation needed]
