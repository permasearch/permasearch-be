During the fourth series, there were accusations of favouritism towards female contestants after the last man Glenn Cosby was eliminated from the show;[74] however, similar claims were not made the previous year over the all-male final, or even the year before, when there was also an all-female quarter-final. The fourth series also suffered allegations of Paul Hollywood's favouritism towards Ruby Tandoh,[75][76] and personal attacks on Tandoh by various people including the chef Raymond Blanc.[77][78][79] Both Paul Hollywood and Ruby Tandoh denied the accusation.[80][81]
