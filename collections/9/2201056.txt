Unlike dedicated texting systems like the Simple Network Paging Protocol and Motorola's ReFLEX protocol,[60] SMS message delivery is not guaranteed, and many implementations provide no mechanism through which a sender can determine whether an SMS message has been delivered in a timely manner.[61] SMS messages are generally treated as lower-priority traffic than voice, and various studies have shown that around 1% to 5% of messages are lost entirely, even during normal operation conditions,[62] and others may not be delivered until long after their relevance has passed.[63] The use of SMS as an emergency notification service in particular has been questioned.[64]
