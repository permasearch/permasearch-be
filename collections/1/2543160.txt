Ali was able to provide support for the development of ornithology in India by identifying important areas where funding could be obtained. He helped in the establishment of an economic ornithology unit within the Indian Council for Agricultural Research.[45][46] He was also able to obtain funding for migration studies through a project to study the Kyasanur forest disease, an arthropod-borne virus that appeared to have similarities to a Siberian tick-borne disease.[39] This project partly funded by the PL 480 grants of the USA however ran into political difficulties with allegations made on CIA involvement.[47] In the late 1980s, he also guided a BNHS project that aimed to reduce bird hits at Indian airfields. He also attempted a citizen science project to study house sparrows in 1963 through Indian birdwatchers who subscribed to the Newsletter for Birdwatchers.[48][49]
