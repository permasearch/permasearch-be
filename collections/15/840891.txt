The artificial lift irrigation based diversion of the river from its natural delta area into Nalgonda district caused erosion of the Florine rich volcanic rocks in Nalgonda and contaminated its ground water supply. It also caused uncertain flows of water into the Krishna river delta area and a shrinkage of the natural wonder "The Kolleru Lake".[13] The use of erosion resistant canals interfered with the natural silting process of a river to the deltas and created long term ecological issues to the health of the delta lands. Reduced flows into the sea resulted in land salination and sea encroachment of coastal lands in Diviseema. The diversion of Krishna water for 200 km to Hyderabad resulted in massive evaporation losses especially in summer and reduced the size of Krishna river. The river water needs to be lifted 1600 ft above its natural flow for it to reach Hyderabad, power consumption that is unjustifiable given that there are cheaper ways to get water to Hyderabad. Nagarjuna sagar, Srisailam, Almati and Ujjani dams together successfully halted the flow of Krishna River before it reaches the delta and is good case study of how to kill a mighty river with poor environmental oversight - the fourth largest in the country. Hamsaladeevi the point where Krishna used to meet the ocean does not have Hamsalu (swan) and the Deevi (island) will merge into the ocean in the next decade. Desertification of various flood plains is already recorded. Many forest preserves along the natural Krishna flow are now categorized as "completely degraded" forest areas. Krishna river once home to an ecological wonderland of fresh water fish and aquatic population is now completely depopulated. The river stopped being navigable since the year of Nagarjuna sagar construction. The death of river Krishna is now a matter of time.
