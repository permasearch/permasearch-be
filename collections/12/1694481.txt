Following his appointment in 1835 as principal conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra,[6] Mendelssohn named his childhood friend Ferdinand David as the orchestra's concertmaster.[7] The work's origins derive from this professional collaboration. In a letter dated 30 July 1838, Mendelssohn wrote to David: "I should like to write a violin concerto for you next winter. One in E minor runs through my head, the beginning of which gives me no peace."[8]
