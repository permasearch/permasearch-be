Without warning American officials, the British government used the Royal Navy to capture nearly 250 neutral American merchant ships carrying goods from French colonies in the West Indies. Americans were outraged and Republicans in Jefferson's coalition demanded a declaration of war, but Madison instead called for an embargo on trade with Britain.[8] British officials told First Nations near the Canadaâ€“U.S. border that the border no longer existed and sold weapons to them. Congress voted for a trade embargo against Britain in March 1794.[9]
