Saint Dominic established a religious community in Toulouse in 1214, to be governed by the rule of Saint Augustine[19] and statutes to govern the life of the friars, including the Primitive Constitution.[20] (The statutes borrowed somewhat from the Constitutions of Prémontré).[21] The founding documents establish that the order was founded for two purposes: preaching and the salvation of souls.
