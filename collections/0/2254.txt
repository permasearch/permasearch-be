The music to "Man Gave Names to All the Animals" is reggae-inspired.[2][4] The lyrics were inspired by the biblical Book of Genesis, verses 2:19â€“20 in which Adam named the animals and birds.[2][4] The lyrics have an appeal to children, rhyming the name of the animal with one of its characteristics. So after describing an animal's "muddy trail" and "curly tail," Dylan sings that "he wasn't too small and he wasn't too big" and so that animal was named a pig.[4] Similarly, the cow got its name because Adam "saw milk comin' out but he didn't know how" and the bear got its name because it has a "great big furry back and furry hair."[4]
