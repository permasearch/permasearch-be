Sand in the Vaseline: Popular Favorites is a two-disc compilation album released by Talking Heads in 1992. It contains two previously unreleased demos ("Sugar on My Tongue", "I Want to Live"), one track new to compact disc ("I Wish You Wouldn't Say That") and three newly finished songs ("Gangster of Love", "Lifetime Piling Up" and "Popsicle"). The latter three tracks were all based on outtakes from previous sessions and had been polished and finished exclusively for release on this compilation.
