Manchester United could only manage a 1–1 draw at Wimbledon on 3 April as Beckham’s well-drilled shot cancelled out Jason Euell's opener in the fifth minute.[54] Despite several of the first-team members being rested for the Juventus tie, United won 3–0 at Old Trafford against Sheffield Wednesday[55] and battled well to earn a point against Leeds at Elland Road after the midweek tie at Juventus.[56] But the result allowed Arsenal to move to the top of the Premiership for the first time this season, albeit having played one game more, after scoring six against Middlesbrough at the Riverside.[57]
