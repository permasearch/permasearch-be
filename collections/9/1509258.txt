Additional dates for the tour were announced on 6 June 2017, halfway through the opening leg; a second North American leg was added to the itinerary for September 2017, initially consisting of seven dates, while a Latin American leg initially consisting of five dates was added for October. Tickets for these legs were offered to U2.com subscribers in a pre-sale starting June 8, while public sales began on 12 June for North America and 14 June for Latin America.[16] A show in New Orleans scheduled for 14 September,[17] a show in Glendale scheduled for 19 September,[18] and extra shows in Mexico City, La Plata, and SÃ£o Paulo were added in the weeks after the tour's extension was announced.[19][20][21][22][23] Tour production director Jake Berry said the second North American leg was not originally planned and that the group were scheduled to have a two-month break between the first North American leg and the Latin American leg. However, since the tour was a "success... beyond everybody's wildest dreams", the group added North American dates in September and shortened their break to four weeks.[24]
