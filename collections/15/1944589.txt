In 1971, Neruda was awarded the Nobel Prize,[37] a decision that did not come easily because some of the committee members had not forgotten Neruda's past praise of Stalinist dictatorship. But his Swedish translator, Artur Lundkvist, did his best to ensure the Chilean received the prize.[44] "A poet," Neruda stated in his Stockholm speech of acceptance of the Nobel Prize, "is at the same time a force for solidarity and for solitude."[45] The following year Neruda was awarded the prestigious Golden Wreath Award at the Struga Poetry Evenings.[46]
