Without previous promotion, Cyrus announced that Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz was available for free online streaming when she hosted the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards, released independently. Critics were divided in their opinions of the album; some applauded Cyrus' ambition and experimentation, and others considered its production and overall finish lacking. Cyrus has promoted the album with music videos for "Dooo It!", "Lighter" and "BB Talk", performances of "Karen Don't Be Sad" and "Twinkle Song" when she hosted Saturday Night Live, and the Milky Milky Milk Tour in November and December 2015.
