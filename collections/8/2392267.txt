On 1 November, 1966 Haryana was constituted as a separate state with seven districts, according to the partition plan of the then East Punjab. The seven districts were Rohtak, Jind, Hisar, Mahendragarh, Gurgaon, Karnal, Ambala. The partition was based on the linguistic demographics and was held after the recommendation of Sardar Hukam Singh—the then Speaker of the Lok Sabha—Parliamentary Committee.[3] A further 15 districts were added later by re-organizing the erstwhile districts.First Chief minister of Haryana is Pt. Bhagwat Dayal Sharma.
