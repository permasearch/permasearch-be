A crank in the form of an eccentrically-mounted handle of the rotary handmill appeared in 5th century BC Celtiberian Spain and ultimately spread across the Roman Empire.[8][1][2] A Roman iron crank dating to the 2nd century AD was excavated in Augusta Raurica, Switzerland.[7][9] The crank-operated Roman mill is dated to the late 2nd century.[10]
