Cristina Vespucci (voiced by Amber Goldfarb)[35] (1459–1498) was a well-known Florentine beauty, and a favorite of painters; most notably Sandro Botticelli, who used her as a model for several of his paintings. She was introduced in Assassin's Creed II, though most of her story is told during the "Repressed Memory Sequences" from Brotherhood. She was the cousin of the Italian explorer, financier, navigator and cartographer Amerigo Vespucci. She was a first love interest of Ezio Auditore da Firenze. When Ezio had to leave for Monteriggioni, he asked Cristina to come with him. She refused though, as she didn't want to leave her family behind. Accepting her decision, Ezio gave her a pendant to remember him. In 1478, Cristina married Manfredo Soderini, but more because of her father's will than her own. Just one day before their wedding, Ezio returned to Florence and visited Cristina, unaware of the direction her life had taken. Cristina told Ezio she didn't expect him to return and reveals her engagement. Even though he is heartbroken, it is Ezio who appeals to Manfredo's conscience, telling him to stop gambling and start being a good husband. After Lorenzo de' Medici's death in 1494, Girolamo Savonarola takes control of Florence and starts the Falò delle vanità (Bonfire of the Vanities). Because of their rich fineries, the home of Cristina and Manfredo was attacked by the fanatics following Savonarola. Ezio came to her aid, but she was already mortally wounded. Cristina showed him the pendant he had given her twenty-two years ago, and said she wished for another chance with him. She died in his arms.
