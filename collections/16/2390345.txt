Chile legalized divorce in 2004, overturning an 1884 legal code.[17] The law that legalized divorce is called the Nueva Ley de Matrimonio Civil ("New Civil Marriage Law"), and was first introduced as a bill in 1995; there had been previous divorce bills before, but this one managed to secure enough conservative and liberal support to pass.[18] Under the new law, couples must be separated for a year before divorcing if the split is mutual, and three years if the split is not mutual.[19]
