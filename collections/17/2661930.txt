In France, the general rule is that one cannot remain in police custody for more than 24 hours from the time of the arrest.[1] However, police custody can last another 24 hours in specific circumstances, especially if the offence is punishable by at least one year's imprisonment, or if the investigation is deemed to require the extra time, and can last up to 96 hours in certain cases involving terrorism, drug trafficking or organised crime.[1] The police needs to have the consent of the prosecutor (in the vast majority of cases, the prosecutor will consent).[1]
