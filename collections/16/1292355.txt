Within the Islamic world, Bhutto was often regarded as "a genuine Muslim political leader" and recognised as the leader of Pakistan's most popular political party.[373] At the same time there were many Pakistanis who despised her, disliking her popularity, her ties to Western nations, and her modernising agenda.[372] Extremist Sunni Islamist elements opposed her leadership because they believed it wrong for a woman to lead an Islamic society, and because they believed that she was in reality a Shia.[365] She gained popularity in Western nations in part because she could present herself as being "part of their world", speaking a high standard of English and having been educated at Harvard and Oxford.[373] In the West, her supporters sometimes had doubts about her ability to govern, but they generally viewed her as a progressive figure who could advance democracy and counter-terrorism in Pakistan.[372]
