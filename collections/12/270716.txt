The toxicity of concentrated TEL was recognized early on, as lead had been recognized since the 19th century as a dangerous substance that could cause lead poisoning. In 1924, a public controversy arose over the "loony gas," after at least 17 workers died, and many others were severely injured, in Standard and DuPont refineries in New Jersey.[62] There had also been a private controversy for two years prior to this controversy; several public health experts, including Alice Hamilton and Yandell Henderson, engaged Midgley and Kettering with letters warning of the dangers to public health.[10] After the death of the workers, dozens of newspapers reported on the issue.[63] The New York Times editorialized in 1924 that the deaths should not interfere with the production of more powerful fuel.[10]
