The seven-day week is named in many languages by a word derived from "seven". The archaism sennight ("seven-night") preserves the old Germanic practice of reckoning time by nights, as in the more common fortnight.[1] Hebdomad and hebdomadal week both derive from the Greek hebdomás (ἑβδομάς, "a seven"). The obsolete septimane is cognate with the Romance terms derived from Latin septimana ("a seven").
