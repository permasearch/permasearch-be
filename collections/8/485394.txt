There is a large crossover between the lifestyle and activity recommendations to prevent a myocardial infarction, and those that may be adopted as secondary prevention after an initial myocardial infarct.[58] Recommendations include stopping smoking, a gradual return to exercise, eating a healthy diet, low in saturated fat and low in cholesterol, and drinking alcohol within recommended limits, exercising, and trying to achieve a healthy weight.[58][96] Exercise is both safe and effective even if people have had stents or heart failure,[107] and is recommended to start gradually after 1â€“2 weeks.[58] Counselling should be provided relating to medications used, and for warning signs of depression.[58] Previous studies suggested a benefit from omega-3 fatty acid supplementation but this has not been confirmed.[96]
