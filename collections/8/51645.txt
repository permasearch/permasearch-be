As Mary and Joseph leave Nazareth in order to head to Bethlehem, Bo and Dave try another escape, but are confronted by Thaddeus and Rufus, who knew of the home by interrogating Abby. After learning that Mary and Joseph are not home, the soldier and his dogs leave to look for them. Feeling guilty, Bo decides to warn them with Dave joining him. Along the way they meet a friendly sheep named Ruth who left her flock when she saw the star but the others refused to follow her. They catch up to Mary and Joseph in time to warn them, and hide them in a market place where the soldier ties up his dogs. Bo releases the cart Mary and Joseph were using to roll down and cause a chain reaction that knocks the soldier down a well. However, he creates severe damage to the market in the process, and Joseph instead berates Bo as he was unaware of the danger.
