Country superstar Kenny Chesney included a live version of You and Tequila, a duet with Grace Potter, on his latest album Welcome to the Fishbowl. The recording has a segment with audience participation singing the chorus "You and Tequila make me crazy, run like poison in my blood, one more night could kill me baby, one is one too many, one more is never enough".
