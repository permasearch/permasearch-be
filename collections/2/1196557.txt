The dynamo was the first electrical generator capable of delivering power for industry.  The Woolrich Electrical Generator of 1844, now in Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum, is the earliest electrical generator used in an industrial process.[4] It was used by the firm of Elkingtons for commercial electroplating.[5][6][7]
