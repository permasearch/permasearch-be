After a few days in Valparaíso, Chase, Lawrence, and Nickerson were transferred to the frigate USS Constellation and placed under the care of the ship’s doctor, who oversaw their recovery. After officials were informed that three Essex survivors were stranded on Henderson Island, the authorities asked the merchant vessel Surrey, which was already intending to sail across the Pacific, to look for the men. As mentioned above, the rescue succeeded.[13]
