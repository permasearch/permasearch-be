A major visual feature of Pandora is the Valley of Mo'ara and its floating mountain ranges. The 156 foot (48Â m)-tall mountains employ forced perspective to appear larger than they physically are, and are held aloft by steel beams concealed with rockwork and vinery.[35] Designers were sent to Zhangjiajie National Forest Park to study the jagged pillar peaks of the Wulingyuan region for inspiration, as well as foliage studies in Hawaii.[19] The steel foundations for the floating mountains required a year to complete.[19] Pandora's bioluminescent species of flora are also found throughout the area.[7][8][9] Imagineers created twenty species of Pandoran flora exclusively for the land.[36] The landscaping consists of real Earth plant species mixed with sculpted Pandora flora, with each alien plant requiring its own concealed control box to create the necessary amount of illumination in bioluminesce during the evening hours.[37][19] New motion sensor technology developed by Disney Research, allows the plant life to respond to tactile interaction from guests.[38] Audio recordings of Pandoran animals create ambient noise throughout the land.[30]
