The miners had a 50 square meters (540 sq ft) emergency shelter with two long benches,[12] but ventilation problems had led them to move out to a tunnel.[13] In addition to the shelter, they had some 2 kilometers (1.2 mi) of galleries in which to move around.[14] The miners used backhoes to dig for underground water sources.[15] Some water was obtained from the radiators of vehicles inside the mineshaft.[14] Food supplies were limited and the men had lost an average of 8 kilograms (18 lb) each.[13] Although the emergency supplies were intended for only two or three days, the miners rationed them and were able to make them last for two weeks, running out just before they were discovered.[16] They consumed “two little spoonfuls of tuna, a sip of milk and a biscuit every 48 hours” and a morsel of peach.[14][15] The men used truck batteries to power their hard hat lamps for illumination.[13]
