In May 2013, Boeing's board of directors gave formal permission for its Commercial Airplanes division to start offering the 777X to customers.[127] The 777X program includes two models: the 777-9, which is stretched beyond the length of the 777-300ER, and the 777-8, which is sized close to the 777-300ER but with ultra-long range capability.[128] On September 19, 2013, Lufthansa's supervisory board gave approval to order 34 Boeing 777-9 aircraft to replace its 747-400s, in advance of the program's official launch.[129][130][131] In October 2013, Boeing announced that its U.S. facilities in Charleston, Huntsville, Long Beach, Philadelphia, and St. Louis as well as Russian facilities in Moscow would support the 777X design effort.[132]
