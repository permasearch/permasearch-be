The effects of drug-related dysgeusia can often be reversed by stopping the patient's regimen of the taste altering medication.[41] In one case, a forty-eight-year-old woman who was suffering from hypertension was being treated with valsartan.[42] Due to this drug's inability to treat her condition, she began taking a regimen of eprosartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist.[42] Within three weeks, she began experiencing a metallic taste and a burning sensation in her mouth that ceased when she stopped taking the medication.[42] When she began taking eprosartan on a second occasion, her dysgeusia returned.[42] In a second case, a fifty-nine-year-old man was prescribed amlodipine in order to treat his hypertension.[43] After eight years of taking the drug, he developed a loss of taste sensation and numbness in his tongue.[43] When he ran out of his medication, he decided not to obtain a refill and stopped taking amlodipine.[43] Following this self-removal, he reported experiencing a return of his taste sensation.[43] Once he refilled his prescription and began taking amlodipine a second time, his taste disturbance reoccurred.[43] These two cases suggest that there is an association between these drugs and taste disorders. This link is supported by the "de-challenge" and "re-challenge" that took place in both instances.[43] It appears that drug-induced dysgeusia can be alleviated by reducing the drug's dose or by substituting a second drug from the same class.[34]
