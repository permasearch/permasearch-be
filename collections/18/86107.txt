Hess describes the film as being "so autobiographical."[5] "I grew up in a family of six boys in Preston, Idaho and the character of Napoleon was a hybrid of all the most nerdy and awkward parts of me and my brothers growing up. Jerusha really was like Deb growing up. Her mom made her a dress when she was going to a middle school dance and she said, 'I hadn't really developed yet, so my mom overcompensated and made some very large, fluffy shoulders." Some guy dancing with her patted the sleeves and actually said, 'I like your sleeves…they’re real big,"' Hess said in an interview with Rolling Stone.[5]
