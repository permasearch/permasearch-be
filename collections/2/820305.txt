Medicare and Medicaid are the two government sponsored medical insurance schemes in the United States. Medicare is further divided into parts A and B - Medicare Part A covers hospital and hospice services; Part B covers outpatient services. Part D covers self-administered prescription drugs. Part C is an alternative to the other parts intended to allow experimentation with differently structured plans in an effort to reduce costs to the government and allow patients to choose plans with more benefits.[4]
