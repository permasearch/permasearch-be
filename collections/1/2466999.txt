History Blade was introduced as a Jabot Cosmetics photographer in 1992. After engaging in an affair with Jill Abbott, Blade began dating Ashley Abbott but Blade would not open up to her about his past beyond telling her that Blade was a stage name, he was escaping his past and he had a brother. They fell in love and married. They took up residence at the Abbott mansion awaiting the building of their new home. In 1994, Blade helps Malcolm Winters become Genoa City's most prominent photographer. Blade's former lover Mari Jo Mason comes to town telling him she read about his upcoming marriage to Ashley Abbott. Mari Jo said she wanted to see him, but Blade refused. Later, Blade couldn't identify the “Mari-Lyn” who sent him a painting as a wedding gift. As head of Jabot's art department, Mari Jo was working with Ashley. Afterward, Blade told Marilyn not to call him again. They both agreed to keep their shared past a secret. Blade never forgave Mari Jo for sleeping with his twin brother, Rick. Mari Jo knew that Blade heard Rick's cries for help while he supposedly drowned. She used that knowledge to her advantage.
