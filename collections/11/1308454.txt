In the Nintendo DS, PSP, and iOS versions, several changes were made from the versions of the other formats. There is only one hub, the Room of Requirement, but the explorable Hogwarts and Diagon Alley hubs of the other versions were removed and both boss battles and spellcasting were simplified. Also, unlike all previous Travelers Tales Lego video games, the Nintendo DS, PSP and iOS versions have written sentences. In other Lego video games before 2012, the Lego figures only grunted to each other.[16] The DS version uses touchscreen controls to perform spells, and is a downscaled port of the PSP version.[17]
