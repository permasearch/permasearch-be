The Black Hawk War resulted in the deaths of 77 white settlers, militiamen, and regular soldiers.[2] This figure does not include the deaths from cholera suffered by the relief force under General Winfield Scott. Estimates of how many members of the British Band died during the conflict range from about 450 to 600, or about half of the 1,100 people who entered Illinois with Black Hawk in 1832.[159]
