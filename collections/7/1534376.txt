Maria Thorpe (voiced by Eleanor Noble) (1160–1227) was an English noblewoman who became a Templar steward, and later the wife of Altaïr. As a child, Maria rejected the gender norms of her time, ultimately being disowned by her parents after annulling her arranged marriage. Seeking to fight in the Third Crusade, she disguised herself as a man and attempted to join the Templar order. The Templar master, Robert De Sable, quickly saw through her ruse, but was impressed by her deterimination and hired her as his steward. Eventually, Robert deduced that Altaïr would be coming for him, so he had Maria serve as a decoy to buy him time. Though she expected Altaïr to kill her, he instead spared her, but warned her not to follow him. After Robert was assassinated, Maria becomes obsessed with revenge. She tracked Altaïr to Acre, but he bested her again, and this time took her prisoner. She escapes in an attempt to join the Templar's new leader, Armand Bouchart, but because of her failure to kill Altaïr, and her "miraculous" escape from him, Bouchart perceives her to be either incompetent, or worse, a traitor to the Order. He places a bounty on the heads of both her and Altaïr, forcing them to work together. They fall in love after Bouchart's defeat. Maria renounces the Templars and becomes Altaïr's wife, bearing them two sons, Darim and Sef. Maria joins Altaïr and Darim to Mongolia in a bid to halt the advance of Genghis Khan. While they are away, Abbas murders Sef. Maria and Altaïr confront Abbas, and Maria is killed in the ensuing fight. Her last words to her husband were "Strength, Altaïr..."
