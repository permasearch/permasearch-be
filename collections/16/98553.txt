Pocahontas became the first Native American Disney Princess[148] and the first woman of color to be the lead character in a Disney film.[133] A video game entitled Disney's Pocahontas based on the film was released on the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive on January 1, 1996.[149] Pocahontas was followed by a direct-to-video sequel entitled Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World (1998). Bedard and Kuhn reprised their roles as Pochantas' speaking and singing voices, respectively, while John Smith was played by Mel Gibson's brother Donal Gibson.[150] Pocahontas, alongside other Disney Princesses, is set to cameo in the film Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2 (2018), with Bedard returning to the role.[151]
