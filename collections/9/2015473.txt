Efforts to control the pine processionary have included biological control using Bacillus thuringiensis, which is effective on eggs and first or second stage caterpillars (in September or October),[13] or insecticides such as diflubenzuron, an insect growth regulator, which can be sprayed from aircraft.[14] Monitoring can include the use of pheromone traps.[13] Older methods used insecticides in oil, inserted directly into nests, or mechanical removal of nests.[13]
