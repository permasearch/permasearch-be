In the UK the term "department store" still refers to the traditional, classic department store, which has a wide range of independent departments with their own staff and their own tills. Large discount shops with the tills located by the entrance are not regarded as department stores in the UK, although the owners may call them that. Shops such as Marks & Spencer, Britain's largest clothes retailer, would therefore not be included in the British definition of a department store.
