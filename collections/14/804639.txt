Rice attended Mississippi Valley State University from 1981 to 1984. He became a standout receiver and acquired the nickname "World" due to "his ability to catch anything near him."[9] In 1982, Rice played his first season with redshirt freshman quarterback Willie Totten.[9] Rice caught 66 passes for 1,133 yards and seven touchdowns as a sophomore that year.[10] Together, Totten and Rice became known as "The Satellite Express" and set numerous NCAA records in the spread offense of coach Archie Cooley, nicknamed "The Gunslinger".[9]
