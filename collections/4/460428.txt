Mt. Juliet was formed in 1835 and incorporated as a city in 1972.[1][2] According to the Mt. Juliet Chamber of Commerce, the name of the town has two possible explanations.  One theory is that the town was named for Julia Gleaves, a person who was renowned for taking care of those in need within the community.  The most widely accepted story is that Mt. Juliet is named for the Mount Juliet Estate, a manor house in County Kilkenny, Ireland. It is the only U.S. city with this name. [8]
