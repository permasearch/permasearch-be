Deacons among Jehovah's Witnesses are referred to as ministerial servants, claiming it preferable to translate the descriptive Greek term used in the Bible rather than merely transliterate it as though it were a title.[36] Appointed ministerial servants aid elders in congregational duties. Like the elders, they are adult baptized males[37] and serve voluntarily.[38]
