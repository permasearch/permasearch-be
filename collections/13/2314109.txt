Three quarters There are four three quarter positions, the inside centre, outside centre and left and right wings. The centres will attempt to tackle attacking players; whilst in attack they should employ speed and strength to breach opposition defences.[51] The wings are generally positioned on the outside of the backline. Their primary function is to finish off moves and score tries.[54] Wings are usually the fastest players in the team and are elusive runners who use their speed to avoid tackles.[55]
