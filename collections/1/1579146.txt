While still in college, Bones went to work as a station hand at KLAZ in Hot Springs, Arkansas, but was put on the air within a few days of being hired. A manager there gave him the choice of going on the air as Bobby Z or Bobby Bones.[3] In 2002, Bones was hired by Q100/KQAR in Little Rock, Arkansas. While there, he broke into another radio station (ALICE 107.7), which led to his next job in Austin, Texas, to begin hosting The Bobby Bones Show on KHFI-FM.
