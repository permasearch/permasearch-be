When Pickett sent Mayo off the field, he called for Corse's brigade to come from the front and deploy on the west side of Gilliam's field at a right angle to White Oak Road.[232][233][234] The Union forces would need to cross this open field to advance.[233] Pickett's objective was to gain time for the survivors of the shattered brigades of Ransom, Steuart and Wallace to escape.[233] Corse's men threw up light field works and Barringer's and Beale's brigades of Rooney Lee's cavalry division supported them to the south and west.[232][233]
