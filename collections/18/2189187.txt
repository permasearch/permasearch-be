Note that the s orbital is normalized and so the inner product     ⟨ s ∣ s ⟩ = 1   {\displaystyle \langle s\mid s\rangle =1}  . Also, the s orbital is orthogonal to the pi and pj orbitals, which leads to two terms in the above equaling zero. Finally, the last term is the inner product of two normalized functions that are at an angle of ωij to each other, which gives cos ωij by definition. However, the orthogonality of bonding orbitals demands that     1 +    λ  i    λ  j     cos ⁡  ω  i j   = 0   {\displaystyle 1+{\sqrt {\lambda _{i}\lambda _{j}}}\cos \omega _{ij}=0}  , so we get Coulson's theorem as a result:[15]
