At the onset of the operation, the Israeli government canceled all programs within 40Â km (24 miles) of Gaza, and requested all people stay at home or near shelter. All summer camps were closed and universities canceled their final exams.[270] Additionally, all gatherings of 300 or more people were banned.[271] Due to the trajectory of rocket fire from Gaza, many flights in and out of Ben-Gurion Airport were delayed or rerouted.[272] and flights to Ben-Gurion airport were interrupted for some days after a Hamas rocket struck an area in its vicinity.[273] Hamas called the FAA flight ban a "great victory".[274] Michael Ross wrote that the decision was driven by anxiety and caused considerably more damage than the potential danger it prevented.[275]
