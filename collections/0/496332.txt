In response to the UK government white paper The Future of Air Transport, the airport operators have produced a master plan outlining their vision for growth up to 2030. The plan was subject to public consultation during spring 2006, and has been republished incorporating comments from this consultation. The master plan shows a phased expansion of the airport, giving the capability of handling 8Â million passengers per annum by 2030. It does not propose the addition of a second runway, or significant expansion of the airport boundaries.[16]
