After prep school, Rees-Mogg entered Eton College, where he was described by a former teacher as a dogmatic Thatcherite with high opinions but never rebellious. Upon leaving Eton, he had his portrait painted by Paul Branson RP for the Eton College Collections, which was later put in display during the Faces of 1993 Royal Society of Portrait Painters exhibit.[21]
