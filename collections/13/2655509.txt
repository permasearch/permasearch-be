A splitter is a stationary blade of similar thickness to the rotating saw blade mounted behind it to prevent a board from pinching inward into the saw kerf and binding on the saw blade, potentially causing a dangerous kickback.[7] Like a riving knife, its thickness should be greater than the body of the saw blade but thinner than its kerf.[7] Blades with a narrow kerf relative to their body are more susceptible to grabbing and kickback.
