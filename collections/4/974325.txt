The Spanish Armed Forces are represented by the Head of the Military Chamber, who does not advise the king on matters of national defense, which is the portfolio of the Minister of Defence and President of the Government to advise the king. Rather, the Head of the Military Chamber coordinates royal military operations and ceremonies, and prepares the royal family for any military activities.[114] The Military Chamber is directed by a commander who must be an active lieutenant-general or a general within the Spanish military, and is under the direct orders of the king.[114] The commander maintains an office with a military legal advisor, an auditor, and section heads for staffing, protocol, operations and logistics.[114] The king is assigned personal aides-de-camp for his assistance, and by extension to his wife the queen and to Princess SofÃ­a.[114] Aides-de-camp are drawn from all of the services, from the Army, from the Navy, from the Air Force, and from the Civil Guard.[114] The Princess of Asturias is entitled to, in future, personal aides-de-camp, drawn from the army, the navy and the air force.[114]
