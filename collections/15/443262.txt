The Brazilian War of Independence, which had already begun along this process, spread through northern, northeastern regions and in Cisplatina province.[76] When the last Portuguese soldiers surrendered on 8 March 1824,[77] Portugal officially recognized Brazil on 29 August 1825.[78] On 7 April 1831, worn down by years of administrative turmoil and political dissent with both liberal and conservative sides of politics, including an attempt of republican secession,[79] and unreconciled to the way that absolutists in Portugal had given in the succession of King John VI, Pedro I went to Portugal to reclaim his daughter's crown, abdicating the Brazilian throne in favor of his five-year-old son and heir (who thus became the Empire's second monarch, with the royal title of Dom Pedro II).[80]
