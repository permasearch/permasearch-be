Perhaps the peak of the 1980s wrestling boom was WrestleMania III at the Pontiac Silverdome,[citation needed] which set an attendance record of 93,173. In the main event Hulk Hogan retained the WWF Championship against Andr√© the Giant.[10] McMahon used the success of WrestleMania to create more pay-per-views and traditions such as SummerSlam, Survivor Series and the Royal Rumble, the latter two both receiving their names from unique stipulation matches featured at the event.
