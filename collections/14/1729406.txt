Lacrosse started out as a tribal ritual for native Americans to play before going to war. Differences between groups may have been settled through large, multi-day games covering expansive fields and many players.[13] The game was originally known as stickball. Ever since its creation, it has been considered a collision sport like football and hockey, not a contact sport like basketball and soccer. For a short amount of time, lacrosse was a full-fledged Olympic sport. After westward expansion, Europeans modified the game to make it much more alike the college and high school level game played today. When natives played lacrosse, dodging defenders was considered cowardly and was looked down upon.[citation needed] Since they were preparing for war, they were taught to embrace the pains involved with playing the game and fight through them.[citation needed] Throwing the ball from stick to stick was seen as a trick in the game, not a commonly utilized skill. Nowadays, these two trends have changed in a great way. Being able to skillfully pass from between teammates and dodge defenders to create open shots have become a pinnacle of todayâ€™s current game.
