With the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, lead poisoning became common in the work setting.[92] The introduction of lead paint for residential use in the 19th century increased childhood exposure to lead; for millennia before this, most lead exposure had been occupational.[29] An important step in the understanding of childhood lead poisoning occurred when toxicity in children from lead paint was recognized in Australia in 1897.[92] France, Belgium, and Austria banned white lead interior paints in 1909; the League of Nations followed suit in 1922.[93] However, in the United States, laws banning lead house paint were not passed until 1971, and it was phased out and not fully banned until 1978.[93]
