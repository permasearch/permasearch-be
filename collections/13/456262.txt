And Then There Were None is set in 1939, taking place at "a beautiful mansion on the deserted Shipwreck Island." A quote by one of the characters, Emily Brent, in the first chapter sets the month as August ("This same week of August 4 years ago.") The player can explore the two-story Art Deco-style mansion, which includes a secret room behind a bookcase in the library. The exterior of Shipwreck Island, including a beach, a forest, and an apiary, may also be explored.
