Damon (Ian Somerhalder) gets to Elena's to check up on her since Bonnie has to work on the moonstone and Caroline has to be with Tyler. He gets a call from Alaric who informs him that Jules is in town and that the authorities are now searching for Mason. Damon has to leave for the Grill, leaving Jeremy with Elena. He meets Alaric at the Grill and they wonder if Jules is also a werewolf and decide to find out. Alaric puts some wolfsbane in her drink while Damon is distracting her. Alaric leaves and Damon tries to chat with Jules about Mason and get information. When he insists that she should drink her drink, Jules calls him out for trying to fool her and tells him that she smelled him and the wolfsbane since the beginning. She threatens Damon and leaves. Damon tries to follow her but Alaric stops him and asks him to go home, lock the doors, and wait to deal with it until the morning when the full moon is gone.
