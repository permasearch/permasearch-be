The Smith & Wesson 5946 was initially issued to new recruits;[34] however, the manufacturer stopped producing the weapon[35] and the agency is phasing it out.[36] After the switch in 1994 to semiautomatic pistols, officers who privately purchased revolvers before January 1, 1994, will be allowed to use them for duty use until August 31, 2018. They will then be grandfathered in as approved off-duty guns.[37]
