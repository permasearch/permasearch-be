The Premier League was formed in 1992, when the members of the First Division resigned from the Football League.[3] These clubs set up a new commercially independent league that negotiated its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements.[4] The Premier League introduced new Manager of the Month and Manager of the Season awards for the 1993–94 season,[2] supplementing the existing Football Writers' Association and Professional Footballers' Association Player of the Year awards. The first Manager of the Month was awarded to Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson for his achievements in August 1993.[5] For the 1994–95 season, the Premier League introduced the Player of the Month award, which is presented alongside the Manager of the Month award.[1]
