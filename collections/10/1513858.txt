His early academic career veered between high promise and irresistible distraction. He did not always work hard but was exceptionally gifted and achievement came easily to him. In 1852, he obtained first-class honours in Mathematics Moderations and was shortly thereafter nominated to a Studentship by his father's old friend Canon Edward Pusey.[17][18] In 1854, he obtained first-class honours in the Final Honours School of Mathematics, standing first on the list, graduating Bachelor of Arts.[19][20] He remained at Christ Church studying and teaching, but the next year he failed an important scholarship through his self-confessed inability to apply himself to study.[21][22] Even so, his talent as a mathematician won him the Christ Church Mathematical Lectureship in 1855,[23] which he continued to hold for the next 26 years.[24] Despite early unhappiness, Dodgson was to remain at Christ Church, in various capacities, until his death.[25]
