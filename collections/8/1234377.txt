As of  2016[update], the WHO has 194 member states: all of them Member States of the United Nations except for the Cook Islands and Niue.[80] (A state becomes a full member of WHO by ratifying the treaty known as the Constitution of the World Health Organization.) As of  2013[update], it also had two associate members, Puerto Rico and Tokelau.[81] Several other countries have been granted observer status. Palestine is an observer as a "national liberation movement" recognized by the League of Arab States under United Nations Resolution 3118. The Holy See also attends as an observer, as does the Order of Malta.[82] In 2010, Taiwan was invited under the name of "Chinese Taipei".[83]
