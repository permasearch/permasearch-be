Fans commonly considered the films to follow a "curse" that even-numbered films were better than the odd-numbered installments.[21][22] The tenth film, Nemesis, was considered the even film that defied the curse.[21][23][24] Its failure and the subsequent success of Star Trek (2009) were considered to have broken the trend.[25][26] The curse has been mentioned often in popular culture. One of the best known examples[27][28] occurred in a 1999 episode of the Channel 4 sitcom Spaced, where it was referenced by Tim Bisley, played by Simon Pegg; Pegg, quite conscious of the irony,[29] played Scotty in the eleventh and subsequent films.
