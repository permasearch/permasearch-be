Reason for reinstating. Many American textbooks on this subject are clearly erroneous and this needs to be balanced out. The issue of the Bill of Rights creating a right for Protestants and not for Catholics (i.e. another piece of Anti-Catholic discrimination), which I have seen in many American texts, is a case in point. You only have to read the Bill properly in its full context (as the text in the Wikipedia article now does) which clearly shows that Catholics were left armed and it was Protestants who had complained about being disarmed and who were winning back a lost "right" (more properly a "freedom") to have arms. The Bill simply puts Protestants back in the same position as Catholics and took the right to disarm away from the monarch and left it with the Parliament. I was intrigued that American writers repeated the erroneous claim of a discriminatory law by Parliament whereas no British authors seem to do so. The Bill of Rights is certainly discriminatory against Catholics in many respects, but the issue of arms is NOT one of them. Clearly there is a habit of certain American authors putting too much faith in some of their secondary sources and not checking the primary source (or doing so scantily). Lastly on the game laws. The American settlers would have known about the English game laws which were relevant to English law on weaponry but New World settlers could safely forget about them.
