In 1950 Kodak announced the first Eastman color 35Â mm negative film (along with a complementary positive film) that could record all three primary colors on the same strip of film.[36] An improved version in 1952 was quickly adopted by Hollywood, making the use of three-strip Technicolor cameras and bipack cameras (used in two-color systems such as Cinecolor) obsolete in color cinematography. This "monopack" structure is made up of three separate emulsion layers, one sensitive to red light, one to green and one to blue.
