A harsh, barren, rocky, and windy land inhabited by the Adem people, famous for the fighting force called the "Adem mercenaries". It has many schools which teach different styles of fighting, and a fundamental philosophy known as the Lethani; similar to eastern martial arts and their supporting philosophy. The people of Ademre communicate emotion with little or no facial expression (other than laughter and tears), and use gestural language to communicate emotions, believing that showing emotion is a natural thing, and thus barbaric, while controlling emotion, and displaying it through a constructed sign-language is civilised, as civilisation is a constructed concept.
