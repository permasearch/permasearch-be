New York City, 150,000 years later: humanity has reached the early 21st century, and the development of robotics and computerization continues unabated. Inner Baltar and Inner Six (no longer tied to the long-deceased Gaius Baltar and Caprica Six)[7] comment on the recent discovery of what is believed to be "mitochondrial Eve" in Tanzania... the remains of Hera Agathon, progenitor of modern-day humanity. Inner Six disagrees with her counterpart about humanity's next future: when a complex system repeats, something new is bound to happen, and this Earth—descendants of devastated planets Kobol, the Twelve Colonies, and the original Earth—may escape the vicious cycle of technology, surmising it to be a part of God's plan. Inner Baltar reminds her "It doesn't like that name," as the two stroll away. The episode and series end with a montage showing the progress of robotics in modern society indicating that it all had happened before... and still might happen again.
