However, the rivalry between MCRDs Parris Island and San Diego is much more pronounced. Marines trained at San Diego are often referred to as "Hollywood Marines",[11] because of the base's location in Southern California. Marines trained at Parris Island are sometimes referred to as "Swamp Dogs" because of the large amount of marshland surrounding the base, and more derisively known as "PIGs", an acronym for Parris Island Graduates, and "Hump Waivers" because the terrain there is significantly less hilly than that of the West Coast. Marches with a pack are often called "hump"s.[citation needed]
