The amendment provided a major legal limitation against slavery and involuntary servitude, and compelled emancipation in Kentucky and Delaware. However, state and local Black Codes, white supremacist terrorism, systemic institutional racism, and narrow interpretations by the Supreme Court have all hindered the power of the Thirteenth Amendment to eliminate coercive labor practices in the United States. The Thirteenth Amendment is invoked less frequently than the other Reconstruction Amendments. However, while the other two amendments govern only state action, the Thirteenth Amendment can be invoked for direct intervention against involuntary servitude and the "badges and incidents" of slavery. It has been used to prosecute debt peonage, racially motivated hate crimes, and some other forms of discrimination. The amendment also enables Congress to pass laws against sex trafficking and other modern forms of slavery.
