Some of the river's rapids are class IV or even V, making this one of the roughest rivers in the area, which attracts many whitewater rafters. Until 1971 the West Branch was the main thoroughfare for the Great Northern Paper Company to sluice its logs to its mill in Millinocket, Maine. In 1971 Great Northern opened the Golden Road (Maine) for transporting the logs. The road parallels the river. The paper industry has been greatly diminished and the Millinocket mill is in the process of being torn down. The road now is extensively used by sportsmen on the river.
