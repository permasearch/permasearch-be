In 1869 Benjamin Franklin Goodrich purchased the Hudson River Rubber Company, a small business in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York. The following year Goodrich accepted an offer of $13,600 from the citizens of Akron,Â Ohio, to relocate his business there. Goodrich ranked 67th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.[1]
