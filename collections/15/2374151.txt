Captain Kirk, his Security Chief Commander Giotto, and his team begin to search for the creature. Spock, suspecting the creature may be a silicon-based lifeform, modifies their phasers to be effective against it. They encounter the creature, which has the appearance of molten rock, and fire upon it, breaking a part of it off; the creature flees by burrowing through the rock wall at a rapid pace. Spock analyzes the fragment, and confirms the creature is made of silicon. He deduces that it is able to burrow through solid rock by secreting the same corrosive substance that has killed the miners. They adjust their tricorders to scan for silicon-based life, and confirm that the creature is the only such lifeform for miles. Spock advises the captain that killing what appears to be the only one of its kind would be a crime against science, though Kirk believes that the creature has proven too dangerous to keep alive.
