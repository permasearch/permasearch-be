The above factors support efforts by the Port of New Orleans to expand container terminal capacity and indicate opportunities to capitalize on projected growth in container traffic.  The grand total for all fifteen short and long term projects included in the plan is $1.04 billion.  These investments will go towards the expansion of the Napoleon container terminal, converting a wharf into a new cruise ship terminal, and relocation of cold storage facilities among other projects.[20]
