The front-wheel drive DTS was manufactured at GM's Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly factory from July 2005 through May 2011.[4] Base price of the entry DTS at time of introduction was US$41,195 ($51,618 in current dollars) which was over 10% lower than the DeVille model it had replaced. One major feature change from the DeVille to the DTS was the elimination of standard 6-passenger seating configuration for non-limousine models. However, such capability remains an optional feature for fleet clients.[5] Even though priced less than the rear-wheel drive STS, the DTS is longer than the STS.
