The series finale garnered media attention after it depicted the final scene being filmed in a studio backlot, responding to longtime speculation that the series was scripted. Upon the conclusion of their month-long morning marathon of The Hills, titled "RetroMTV Brunch", MTV aired an alternate ending to the series on August 9, 2013. The scene replaced the original backlot clip with footage of Jenner and Conrad talking in his apartment.
