As China underwent turbulent times in the 19th and 20th century, Portugal maintained its colony in Macau by stationing its troops, refusing to pay rent and opposing the ruling Qing Empire. With the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, formal diplomatic relations were not officially instated until 1979 and after the Carnation Revolution in Portugal which began the period of decolonization.[4]  The Chinese government viewed Macau as Chinese territory under Portuguese administration.
