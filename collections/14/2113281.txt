On Jimmy Page's website, he lists this song as one on which he plays.[14] Engineer Eddie Kramer also cites Jimmy Page as playing on the track, but says that John Bonham did not.[15] Donovan said that Page was the guitarist in Hannes Rossacher's 2008 documentary Sunshine Superman: The Journey of Donovan, where he also asserted that the song ushered in the Celtic rock sound which would lead to Page, Jones, and Bonham forming Led Zeppelin soon afterwards. In Donovan's autobiography, he credited both Page and "Allen Hollsworth" as the "guitar wizards" for the song.[6] However, he also says that "Hollsworth" had played with Blue Mink, which was a band that Alan Parker had played in.[6] In the autobiography, Donovan said that perhaps this session inspired the creation of Led Zeppelin.[6]
