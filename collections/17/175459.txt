Isolated first-degree heart block has no direct clinical consequences. There are no symptoms or signs associated with it. It was originally thought of as having a benign prognosis. In the Framingham Heart Study, however, the presence of a prolonged PR interval or first degree AV block doubled the risk of developing atrial fibrillation (irregular heart beat), tripled the risk of requiring an artificial pacemaker, and was associated with a small increase in mortality. This risk was proportional to the degree of PR prolongation.[2]
