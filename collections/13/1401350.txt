The Vienna Convention on Succession of States in respect of Treaties is an international treaty opened for signature in 1978 to set rules on succession of states. It was adopted partly in response to the "profound transformation of the international community brought about by the decolonization process".  It entered into force on 6 November 1996, which was triggered by the succession of the Republic of Macedonia to the treaty giving it the requisite 15 parties.[1]
