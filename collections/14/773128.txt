According to the New England-based environmental organization Clean Air-Cool Planet, Nike ranked among the top three companies (out of 56) in a survey of climate-friendly companies in 2007.[97] Nike has also been praised for its Nike Grind program (which closes the product lifecycle) by groups like Climate Counts.[98] One campaign that Nike began for Earth Day 2008 was a commercial that featured basketball star Steve Nash wearing Nike's Trash Talk Shoe, which had been constructed in February 2008 from pieces of leather and synthetic leather waste from factory floors. The Trash Talk Shoe also featured a sole composed of ground-up rubber from a shoe recycling program. Nike claims this is the first performance basketball shoe that has been created from manufacturing waste, but it only produced 5,000 pairs for sale.[99]
