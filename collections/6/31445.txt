During the 1940s, the discipline of marketing was in transition. Interest in the functional school of thought, which was primarily concerned with mapping the functions of marketing was waning while the managerial school of thought, which focussed on the problems and challenges confronting marketers was gaining ground. [31] The concept of marketers as "mixers of ingredients," was first introduced by James Culliton, a Professor at Harvard Business School. [32] At this time theorists began to develop checklists of the elements that made up the marketing mix, however, there was little agreement as to what should be included in the list. Many scholars and practitioners relied on lengthy classifications of factors that needed to be considered to understand consumer responses.[33] Neil Borden developed a complicated model in the late 1940s, based upon at least twelve different factors.[34]
