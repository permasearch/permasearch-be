Critic Rowan Savage compared the album to Mark Z. Danielewski's novel House of Leaves (2000) due to its "endless and fearfully cavernous space (the ballroom) existing concealed by the deceptive limitations of familiar domesticity" represented with a deep resonant sound.[1] Some tracks on An Empty Bliss Beyond This World have another slightly-different version of it that appears later in the album and have the same name, such as the title track and “Mental Caverns Without Sunshine.”[11][5][12] Kirby explained this was done to give it a déjà vu vibe: "Immediately upon first listen, you’re already questioning where you have heard this song before."[5] The second version of "Mental Caverns Without Sunshine" is only half as long as the first version of the track on the LP.[11] As Savage analyzed, the repeating of samples and loops on the LP questions the listener if "[their] sense of familiarity spring[s] from the loop[s] [themselves] or from the very patina that inheres in the scratchy turntable record as such," as well as "if samples are being looped or whether the pieces chosen, in their role as background to an always already arriving vocal line or dance step, are repetitive in and of themselves."[1] While most of the tracks on the album suddenly end, the album's closer fades out which, according to Savage, is a "memento mori that must go hand-in-hand with the resurrection of sounds as temporally distant as these, with the re-giving of the name and hence finitude, the entry (or, rather, re-entry) into mercilessly linear history."[1]
