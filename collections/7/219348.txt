A battalion of the 173rd Airborne brigade undertook the first major U.S.-led search and destroy mission of the Vietnam War. ARVN and Australian soldiers also participated in the sweep through part of Zone D, about 40 miles northeast of Saigon.  The assault began with an artillery barrage; it located very few Viet Cong.[75]
