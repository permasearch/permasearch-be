Meat from other animals, such as beef, lamb, chicken, goat, or turkey, may also be cut, cured, or otherwise prepared to resemble bacon, and may even be referred to as "bacon".[5] Such use is common in areas with significant Jewish and Muslim populations, both of which prohibit the consumption of pigs.[6] For safety, bacon may be treated to prevent trichinosis,[7] caused by Trichinella, a parasitic roundworm which can be destroyed by heating, freezing, drying, or smoking.[8]
