The VUE Red Line includes the same 250 hp (186 kW) Honda J35A3 V6 as the regular model, but with sportier suspension tuning, lowered 1 inch, and unique power steering calibration for performance, 18 in alloy wheels, ground-effect front and rear bumpers, unique rocker panel trim, chrome exhaust tip, special black leather and suede seats (optional for 2005, standard for 2006 and 2007), footwell lighting (included with leather and suede seats package, not available with optional full-leather (heated front) seats), and a special gauge cluster complete the visual updates. It also includes some special interior features as well, such as a higher quality audio system.[1]
