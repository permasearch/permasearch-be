The isthmus formed around 2.8 million years ago.[1] This major geological event separated the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and caused the creation of the Gulf Stream. This was first suggested in 1910 by North American paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn. He based the proposal on the fossil record of mammals in Central America.[2] This conclusion provided a foundation for Alfred Wegener when he proposed the theory of continental drift in 1912.[3]
