Current laws in most states/territories allow the use of ICE motorized bicycles, provided it does not produce more than 200 watts of power (approximately 0.27 horsepower). Queensland is the only state that exclusively bans the use of ICE motorized bicycles. Well known businesses such as Zbox Australia and Rock Solid Engines provide de-tuned ICE engines with compliance certificates, proving they produce under 200 watts of power.
