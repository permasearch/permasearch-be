Bloomberg Business named Glenwood Springs the 7th wealthiest small town in America in 2015,[48][49] due principally to the influence of Aspen. Glenwood Springs and Aspen share a micropolitan statistical area, and businesses often serve the entire Valley, including a consolidated multiple listing service.[50] Many small businesses start in the area due to the ambient wealth and a strong preference for local business, but they typically relocate to larger metropolitan areas after successful growth leads to needs for more affordable labor and physical resources.[51]
