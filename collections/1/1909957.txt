Net Promoter or Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a management tool that can be used to gauge the loyalty of a firm's customer relationships. It serves as an alternative to traditional customer satisfaction research and claims to be correlated with revenue growth.[1] NPS has been widely adopted with more than two thirds of Fortune 1000 companies using the metric.[2]
