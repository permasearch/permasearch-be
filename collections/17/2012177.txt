Serving as one of the company's first self-developed products after the end of its exclusive manufacturing deal with Monster Cable Products,[1] the Beats Pill was designed by Robert Brunner's studio Ammunition Design Group, and carries a capsule-based design roughly 7.7 inches (20Â cm) in length. Its appearance is characterized by curved surfaces and a gloss finish. The speaker contains minimal controls; the logo serves as a multi-purpose button for starting and stopping tracks, and the only other buttons are volume keys and the power button.[2][3]
