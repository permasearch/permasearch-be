Hitchcock became a highly visible public figure through interviews, film trailers, cameo appearances in his own films, and his ten years of hosting the Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1955â€“1965) television programme. He also fashioned a recognisable directorial style, and the term Hitchcockian is now often used to refer to his filmmaking style. Hitchcock's stylistic trademarks include the use of camera movement that mimics a person's gaze, forcing viewers to engage in a form of voyeurism. In addition, he framed shots to maximise anxiety, fear, or empathy, and used innovative forms of film editing. His work often features fugitives on the run alongside alluring blonde female characters. He directed more than fifty feature films in a career spanning six decades, and is often regarded as one of the most influential directors in cinematic history. His first thriller, The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog (1927), helped shape the thriller genre in film. His 1929 film, Blackmail, is often cited as the first British sound feature film. Two of his 1930's thrillers, The 39 Steps (1935) and The Lady Vanishes (1938), are ranked by the British Film Institute (BFI) as being among the greatest British films of the 20th century.
