In 1935, beer cans with flat tops were marketed, and a device to puncture the lids was needed. The same term, "church key", came to be used for this new invention: made from a single piece of pressed metal, with a pointed end used for piercing cans â€” devised by D.F. Sampson[3][4] for the American Can Company, who depicted operating instructions on the cans,[5] and typically gave away free "quick and easy" openers with their beer cans.[6]
