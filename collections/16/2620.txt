In season five, Luke was seen attending Whitmore College. He quickly found himself working with Elena and her friends in an effort to stop Markos and the Travelers. Luke's neck was snapped by Caroline Forbes in order to motivate Liv to cast a spell to resurrect him, Stefan and the rest of their deceased friends on the rapidly disintegrating Other Side. Liv eventually revived Luke, and when he saw how the spell was draining her of her life force, he used his magic to force her to stop the spell. The two then fled, leaving Damon and Bonnie trapped on the Other Side when it collapsed.
