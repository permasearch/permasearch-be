The caipirinha is the strongest national cocktail of Brazil[7] and is imbibed in restaurants, bars, and many households throughout the country. Once almost unknown outside Brazil, the drink has become more popular and more widely available in recent years, in large part due to the rising availability of first-rate brands of cachaÃ§a outside Brazil.[8] The International Bartenders Association has designated it as one of their Official Cocktails.[9]
