The meditation scene required clips from previous episodes to appear in flashback. Initially, Paul Rabwin and the special effects crew cut the necessary scenes and placed them in animated bubbles. According to Rabwin, at this point, the crew was just experimenting with ideas. Eventually, the crew decided that the bubbles were too "hokey", so they adopted a more standard slit-scan effect.[16] In order to create the sequence of Scully visualizing Waterston's heart condition, Nicolas Surovy had to lie naked on a platform surrounded by a blue screen. A sphere was matched via motion control as a marker for a prosthetic beating heart that was crafted and filmed separately. The two shots were then combined.[16]
