Turtles have been traditionally believed to be surviving anapsids, on the basis of their skull structure.[14] The rationale for this classification was disputed, with some arguing that turtles are diapsids that reverted to this primitive state in order to improve their armor (see Parareptilia).[1] Later morphological phylogenetic studies with this in mind placed turtles firmly within Diapsida.[15] All molecular studies have strongly upheld the placement of turtles within diapsids, most commonly as a sister group to extant archosaurs.[16][17][18][19]
