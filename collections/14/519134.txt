Back in New York, a frustrated David Wallace reveals to Michael that Dunder Mifflin's corporate leaders have no plan to get the company back on track, much less a 45-day plan. Michael is astounded by this but remains positive, and calls Oscar into the hotel room for some suggestions. However, Oscar is visibly embarrassed and unwilling to criticize the management to their faces. Oscar instead compliments them, does not repeat any of his earlier suggestions, and leaves. Michael follows and rebukes Oscar for backing down, but Oscar still refuses to help him. When Michael returns, he is further lambasted by the CEO and former U.S. Congressman Chris O'Keefe who openly insults Michael. In his defense, Michael points out he is the only person who seems to be making money for Dunder Mifflin and the only one offering any positive suggestions, and goes so far as to return the former Congressman's insult. Enraged, O'Keefe, who is presiding over the meeting, takes away Michael's limo privileges. Michael then triumphantly sneaks away with Dwight, Andy, and Oscar back out into their limo and drives out of the city. As they leave, Michael justifies his actions by saying that of everyone there, he and his team are the only ones who deserve to celebrate with limo rides. As they leave, the camera catches a glance at the stock market ticker, where the Dunder Mifflin (DMI) stock price, currently at $1.13, down 6 7/8, continues to drop dramatically.
