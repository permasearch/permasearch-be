During the Indian independence movement, the people of Solapur enjoyed full freedom on 9â€“11 May 1930.[52] However, this resulted in the executions of Mallappa Dhanshetti, Abdul Rasool Qurban Hussein, Jagannath Bhagwan Shinde and Shrikisan Laxminarayan Sarada, who were hanged on 12 January 1931, in the prison at Pune. This resulted in the city becoming recognized as "The City of Hutatmas" literally "The City of Martyrs".[53]
