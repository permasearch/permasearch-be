Gross national happiness and other subjective measures of happiness are being used by the governments of Bhutan and the United Kingdom.[19] The World Happiness report, issued by Columbia University[20] is a meta-analysis of happiness globally and provides an overview of countries and grassroots activists using GNH. The OECD issued a guide for the use of subjective well-being metrics in 2013.[21] In the U.S., cities and communities are using a GNH metric at a grassroots level.[22]
