Critics have noted that Narayan's writings tend to be more descriptive and less analytical; the objective style, rooted in a detached spirit, providing for a more authentic and realistic narration.[80] His attitude, coupled with his perception of life, provided a unique ability to fuse characters and actions,[81] and an ability to use ordinary events to create a connection in the mind of the reader.[82] A significant contributor to his writing style was his creation of Malgudi, a stereotypical small town, where the standard norms of superstition and tradition apply.[83]
