The deal had initial support from the United States, the United Kingdom,[95] France,[96] Japan,[97] Russia,[98] and Germany.[99][100] After some initial opposition, there were reports of Australia,[101] Switzerland,[102] and Canada[103][104] expressing their support for the deal. Selig S. Harrison, a former South Asia bureau chief of The Washington Post, has said the deal may represent a tacit recognition of India as a nuclear weapon state,[105] while former U.S. Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Robert Joseph says the "U.S. State Department made it very clear that we will not recognize India as a nuclear-weapon state".[106]
