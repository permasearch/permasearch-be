Children with autism exhibit significant impairment in imitation skills.[47] Imitation deficits have been reported on a variety of tasks including symbolic and nonsymbolic body movements, symbolic and functional object use, vocalizations, and facial expressions.[47] In contrast, typically-developing children can copy a broad range of novel (as well as familiar) rules from a very early age.[58] Problems with imitation discriminate children with autism from those with other developmental disorders as early as age 2 and continue into adulthood.[59]
