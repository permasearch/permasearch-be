Varsity Blues is a 1999 American comedy-drama film directed by Brian Robbins that follows a small-town 5A high school football team and their overbearing coach through a tumultuous season. The players must deal with the pressures of adolescence and their football-obsessed community while having their hard coach on their back constantly. In the small (fictional) town of West Canaan, Texas, football is a way of life, and losing is not an option.
