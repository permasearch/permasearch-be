The novel ends with Billie Jo describing her life as not the best but still happy. Even though she misses Ma and wants Franklin back, she is out of the rest of her struggles and always tries to forget about it; sad and happy. The departure of the dust storms and her father being happy and alive gives her hope. She just might stay out of the dust after all.[1]
