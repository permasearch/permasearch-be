The song enjoyed a resurgence in popularity — and was introduced to a new generation — after being featured in Cameron Crowe's critically acclaimed film Almost Famous in 2000. An early scene in the film, set in 1973, finds the free-spirited character "Anita" (Zooey Deschanel) playing the song for her mother (Frances McDormand) to "... explain why [she] is leaving home to become a stewardess." The financial services company American Express also used the song in a series of popular television advertisements in the late 2000s.
