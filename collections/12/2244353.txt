Some people, including Greenpeace founder and first member Patrick Moore,[62][63][64] George Monbiot,[65] Bill Gates[66] and James Lovelock[67] have specifically classified nuclear power as green energy. Others, including Greenpeace's Phil Radford[68][69] disagree, claiming that the problems associated with radioactive waste and the risk of nuclear accidents (such as the Chernobyl disaster) pose an unacceptable risk to the environment and to humanity. However, newer nuclear reactor designs are capable of utilizing what is now deemed "nuclear waste" until it is no longer (or dramatically less) dangerous, and have design features that greatly minimize the possibility of a nuclear accident. These designs have yet to be proven. (See: Integral Fast Reactor)
