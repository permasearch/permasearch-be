Extending across the north and south side of the Alps in west-central Europe, Switzerland encompasses a great diversity of landscapes and climates on a limited area of 41,285 square kilometres (15,940 sq mi).[43] The population is about 8 million, resulting in an average population density of around 195 people per square kilometre (500/sq mi).[43][44] The more mountainous southern half of the country is far more sparsely populated than the northern half.[43] In the largest Canton of Graubünden, lying entirely in the Alps, population density falls to 27 /km² (70 /sq mi).[45]
