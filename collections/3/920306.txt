The family lived on a thousand square-mile (2,600 sq. km) ranch called the Ponderosa on the eastern shore of Lake Tahoe in Nevada.[10] The vast size of the Cartwrights' land was quietly revised to "half a million acres" (2,000 sq. km) on Lorne Greene's 1964 song, "Saga of the Ponderosa." The ranch name refers to the Ponderosa Pine, common in the West. The nearest town to the Ponderosa was Virginia City, where the Cartwrights would go to converse with Sheriff Roy Coffee (played by veteran actor Ray Teal), or his deputy Clem Foster (Bing Russell).
