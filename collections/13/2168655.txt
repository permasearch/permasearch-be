In the DC Rebirth rebooted universe, Scarecrow has a cameo appearance as one of the many trials that Batman's apprentice Duke Thomas has faced in his training.[51] He later works with The Haunter to release a low dose of fear gas around Gotham on Christmas, and sets up a small stand for her to pickup the fear gas. Both he and Haunter are paralyzed by the effects of the fear gas and arrested by Batman.[52] The Scarecrow later emerges using a Sinestro Corps' Power ring to induce fear and rage against Batman in random citizens throughout Gotham, to the point where he provokes Alfred Pennyworth into threatening to shoot Simon Baz as part of his final assault.[53]
