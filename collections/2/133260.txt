On 23 February, the broadcast put out a casting call for contestants who would appear on the game show.[16] On 9 March, Jeremy Clarkson was confirmed as the new host of the show.[17] On 13 April, the trailer for the revival premiered on ITV and confirmed that the show would return in May for a week long run,[18] with it later confirmed on 25 April, that the show would begin airing from 5 May and finish 11 May.
