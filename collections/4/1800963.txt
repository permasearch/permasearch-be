Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley fascinated many across the country, including Frederic Ward Putnam of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University. Putnam spent much of his career lecturing and publishing on the Ohio mounds, specifically the Serpent Mound. When he visited the Midwest in 1885, he found that plowing and development were destroying many of the mounds. In 1886, with help from a group of wealthy women in Boston (such as the noted Glass Flowers' patroness Mary Lee Ware),[20] Putnam raised funds to purchase 60 acres (240,000Â m2) at the Serpent Mound site for preservation. The purchase also contained three conical mounds, a village site and a burial place.[21] Serpent Mound is listed as a "Great Wonder Of the Ancient World" by National Geographic Magazine.[22]
