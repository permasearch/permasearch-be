Watch Tower Society publications have claimed that God has used Jehovah's Witnesses (and formerly, the International Bible Students) to declare his will[374][375] and has provided advance knowledge about Armageddon and the establishment of God's kingdom.[376][377][378] Some publications also claimed that God has used Jehovah's Witnesses and the International Bible Students as a modern-day prophet.[note 5] George D. Chryssides stated, "while prediction may be part of a biblical prophet's role, the root meaning of prophecy is that of proclaiming God's word." He went on to say that, "Jehovah's Witnesses ... are the recipients of prophecy, who regard themselves as invested with the interpretation of biblical writings."[379][note 6] With these interpretations, Jehovah's Witnesses' publications have made various predictions about world events they believe were prophesied in the Bible.[380][381] Failed predictions have led to the alteration or abandonment of some doctrines.[382][383] Some failed predictions had been presented as "beyond doubt" or "approved by God".[384]
