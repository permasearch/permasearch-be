Arno's story starts in Versailles as a child, but for most of the story he is in Paris. His adventure in Paris starts on the eve of the French Revolution in 1789, and extends up to the Thermidorian Reaction in 1794.[16] The modern day setting focuses on the Assassins contacting the player and requesting their help to explore Arno in the past, as well as helping in the present.[22] Co-operative multiplayer missions follow the development of the Brotherhood of Assassins during the French Revolution.[18] In addition, "time anomalies" are introduced during the story. Accessing them takes Arno to various points of Parisian history, such as Paris' Belle Ã‰poque, or its occupation by Nazi Germany during World War II.[23]
