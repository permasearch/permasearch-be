During the third decade, Dr. Durgabai Deshmukh having nurtured the society for 25Â years handed over the society to Dr. B. Venkatappaiah in 1972. An Integrated Development Fund was created with grants from the A.P. government and TTD which paved the way for establishing a network of schools in other areas. Under the expansion programme, two more schools (one at Janakpuri and another at Lajpatnagar) were established in 1975.
