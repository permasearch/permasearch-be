To demonstrate the notion of varying levels of abstraction and inclusiveness, three types of self category are often given as examples.[3][4][6][10] The lowest level of abstraction is given as a personal self, where the perceiver self categorizes as “I”. A higher level of abstraction corresponds to a social self, where the perceiver self categorizes as “we” in comparison to a salient outgroup (them). A highest level of abstraction is represented by we humans, where the salient outgroup is animals or other non-humans. A common misconception is that these three example categories represent the self categories that humans use. Instead, the theory posits that there are innumerable self categories that a perceiver may use (see, online category formation), and in particular that there are a myriad of different personal and social identities that a perceiver may invoke in his or her day-to-day life.[11][14] The misconception may also be attributable to the early writing of Turner where a singular social identity was contrasted against a singular personal identity.[19] This however predates the formal statement of self-categorization theory.
