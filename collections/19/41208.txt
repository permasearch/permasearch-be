Above the temperature minimum layer is a layer about 7006200000000000000♠2,000 km thick, dominated by a spectrum of emission and absorption lines.[93] It is called the chromosphere from the Greek root chroma, meaning color, because the chromosphere is visible as a colored flash at the beginning and end of total solar eclipses.[90] The temperature of the chromosphere increases gradually with altitude, ranging up to around 7004200000000000000♠20,000 K near the top.[93] In the upper part of the chromosphere helium becomes partially ionized.[100]
