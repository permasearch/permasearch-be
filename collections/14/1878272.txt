Until the mid-17th century, during the early Portuguese mandate of Macau, some 5,000 slaves lived in the territory, in addition to 2,000 Portuguese and an ever-growing number of Chinese, which in 1664 reached 20,000.[103][104] This number decreased in the following decades to between 1000 and 2000.[105] Most of the slaves were of African origin.[103][106] Rarely did Chinese women marry Portuguese, initially, mostly Goans, Ceylonese/Sinhalese (from today's Sri Lanka), Indochinese, Malay (from Malacca), and Japanese women were the wives of the Portuguese men in Macau.[107][108][109][110] Slave women of Indian, Indonesian, Malay, and Japanese origin were used as partners by Portuguese men.[111] Japanese girls would be purchased in Japan by Portuguese men.[112] From 1555 onwards Macau received slave women of Timorese origin as well as women of African origin, and from Malacca and India.[113][114] Macau was permitted by Pombal to receive an influx of Timorese women.[115] Macau received an influx of African slaves, Japanese slaves as well as Christian Korean slaves who were bought by the Portuguese from the Japanese after they were taken prisoner during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592â€“98) in the era of Hideyoshi.[116]
