As the Flight Data Recorder and the Cockpit Voice Recorder were retrieved by investigators, it was revealed that both black boxes had been damaged. The FDR had a slight damage, and was downloaded by investigators in a file. However, the situation was different for the CVR. The CVR coaxial spools were under tension during its normal operating flight. When the tape was severed, the spool would have spun freely which resulted in the release of additional tape into the transport area. There were some problems with both black boxes, but the data was filtered several times until the audio became reasonably intelligible.[13]
