Christians would clearly distinguish between evangelism and proselytism, with the latter being viewed as unethical because it involves the abuse of people’s freedom and the distortion of the gospel of grace by means of coercion, deception, manipulation, and exploitation.[3] Within Christianity, the label of ‘proselytism’ generally arises when one group does not approve of the missional activities of another, particularly when one group is losing members or the potential exists for this to occur.[4]
