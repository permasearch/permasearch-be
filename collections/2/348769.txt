2013 was also the first season in which no Sunday Night Game was originally scheduled for Week 17 of the NFL season, thus allowing the ability to move the most intriguing and Playoff-relevant matchup of the week to the Sunday Night time slot. The final game of the 2013 NFL Regular season was played on December 29, 2013 between the Philadelphia Eagles and Dallas Cowboys to determine the NFC East division champion. The Eagles won by a score of 24-22, thus advancing to the playoffs.
