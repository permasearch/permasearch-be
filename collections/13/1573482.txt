The melismatic vocals mainstream during the 1990s and 2000s in pop and contemporary R&B lost favor by mid-late 2009, as vocally lower key artists, including Katy Perry, Taylor Swift and Rihanna, started to outsell new releases by perennial melismatic favorites, Mariah Carey and Christina Aguilera. By the mid-2010s, the style of vocals popular in indie pop have become immensely widespread among pop instrumentalists as they are commonly used by younger artists, like Lorde and Birdy.[1]
