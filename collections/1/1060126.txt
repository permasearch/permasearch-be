Benzema began his football career at his hometown club Bron Terraillon SC at the age of eight. While at the club, he was nicknamed Coco by friends and, after scoring two goals in an under-10 match against the Lyon youth academy, began attracting attention from the biggest club in the city.[13][14] According to Serge Santa Cruz, who was president of Bron Terraillon in the 1990s, Lyon officials had visited him directly in an attempt to sign the youngster; however, Santa Cruz refused.[15] After talking with Benzema's father, the club allowed the player to undergo a trial with Lyon.[15] Following the trial, Benzema officially joined Lyon and was inserted into the club's academy.[16]
