Actually, six Syracuse University students painted the Nittany Lion on Wednesday night, Nov. 2, 1966. The six students had driven from Syracuse to State College that evening with an old, air-loaded fire extinguisher filled with orange paint. Arriving on the Penn State campus, they found the Nittany Lion statue flood lit, deserted and completely clean. Within minutes they had painted the lion, jumped back in their car and driven away from campus, undetected.
