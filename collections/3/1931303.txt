A tourist is found dead in Central Park with the word "guilty" written across her forehead. With the help of CSU technician Dale Stuckey, Benson and Stabler discover that a deranged former artist (Nick Stahl) was at the park during the crime. They arrest him, but are unable to make the charges stick due to a clerical error by Stuckey. Munch and Tutuola attempt to follow the prime suspect to Coney Island and discover another dead body after losing the suspect. At first, they assume that their mark escaped and committed the murder, however subsequent murders and attacks tell them that something much more sinister is going on.
