Where force (F) equals lift (L) for forces measured perpendicular to the airstream to determine C = CL or force (F) equals drag (D) for forces measured in line with the airstream to determine C = CD on a sail of area (A) and a given aspect ratio (length to average cord width). These coefficients vary with angle of attack (αj for a headsail) with respect to the incident wind (VA for a headsail).[29] This formulation allows determination of CL and CD experimentally for a given sail shape by varying angle of attack at an experimental wind velocity and measuring force on the sail in the direction of the incident wind (D—drag) and perpendicular to it (L—lift). As the angle of attack grows larger, the lift reaches a maximum at some angle; increasing the angle of attack beyond this critical angle of attack causes the upper-surface flow to separate from the convex surface of the sail; there is less deflection of air to windward, so the sail as airfoil generates less lift. The sail is said to be stalled.[29] At the same time, induced drag increases with angle of attack (for the headsail: αj ).
