Russia has a plan for increasing its fleet of fast breeder reactors significantly. A BN-800 reactor (800Â MWe) at Beloyarsk was completed in 2012, succeeding a smaller BN-600. In June 2014 the BN-800 was started in the minimum power mode.[84] Working at 35% of nominal efficiency, the reactor contributed to the energy network on 10 December 2015.[85] It reached its full power production in August 2016.[86]
