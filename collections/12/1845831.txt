DNA replication at the replication fork can be halted by a shortage of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) or by DNA damage, resulting in replication stress.[91] This halting of replication is described as a stalled replication fork. A fork protection complex of proteins stabilizes the replication fork until DNA damage or other replication problems can be fixed.[91] Prolonged replication fork stalling can lead to further DNA damage. Stalling signals are deactivated if the problems causing the replication fork are resolved.[91]
