In this section, the author puts forward his theory that sense deprivation may encourage psychic abilities, and he criticises the work of parapsychologist J.B. Rhine for failing to consider this. While Seabrook was generally sceptical of such abilities, he was perplexed by some incidents he recorded, and suggests that the theories about time and space of Albert Einstein might hold the answer to some of these mysteries.
