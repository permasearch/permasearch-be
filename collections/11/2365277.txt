Notes: Final part starts off with four GGG judges competing in a regular format episode where the last chef standing will win $40,000 for their charity. For winning best dish last episode, Aaron's advantage in round 1 was not having to use 1 ingredient from the grocery list. Since no one was eliminated in round 1, there was a double elimination in round 2. The food pyramid game combined the "Face Wheel" concept (photos of all judges) from part 1 and the game "Watch Your Weight", plus it assigned them their dish. Damaris' round 1 "best dish" advantage was getting an extra 2 lbs. of food. The final game combined "Grocery List" with "Express Lane" and required them to use only the 7 items on the list. The runner-up got $5,000 towards their charity.
