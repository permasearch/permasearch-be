A young woman (Urmila Matondkar), home alone, is watching the news of a serial killer on television when the doorbell rings. The woman sees through the peephole that it is a young man, who later identifies himself as Sameer A. Purnavale (Manoj Bajpai), claiming to be a business partner of Mr. Malhotra. She is reluctant to open the door, due to the news of a killer on the loose. The woman claims that the house doesn't belong to Mr. Malhotra, but to Mr. Gupta. However, the man believing that there has been a mix up, persistently keeps ringing the doorbell even after the woman tells him that she won't let him in. To scare him away, the woman lies and tells the man that her husband is sleeping upstairs. The man then claims that he hears a noise upstairs so that if her husband is awake can he talk to him. Upon hearing this and a subsequent noise from within the house, the woman is spooked and runs outside. Purnavale then takes the woman back inside, reassuring her that he is protecting her.
