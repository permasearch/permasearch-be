The jerseys have only been altered a few times, with the addition of shoulder stripes and numbers. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Huskers wore full shoulder stripes reminiscent of those worn by the Baltimore Colts of the NFL. These were gradually phased out when mesh and tearaway jerseys became popular. NU's jerseys had a script "Nebraska" embroidered onto the front for the 1974 Cotton Bowl Classic, but this change was for the bowl game only. From 1980 to 1983, Nebraska's jerseys featured only a simple block "N" on the sleeves. In 1984, two sleeve stripes and sleeve numbers were added back to the uniform, where they remain today, although the stripes and numbers have decreased in size as jersey sleeves have shortened over the years.
