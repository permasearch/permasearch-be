On September 1, 2016, DeWalt debuted an industry-first hybrid voltage battery pack it branded "FLEXVOLT". The pack runs at either 20V (18V nominal) or 60V (54V nominal) depending upon whether it is placed into a 60V FlexVolt tool or one of their 20V Max tools. The pack switches between connecting the battery cells in series (60V, 2Ah) or parallel (20V, 6Ah) depending upon the activated pin configuration determined by the power tool. [10]
