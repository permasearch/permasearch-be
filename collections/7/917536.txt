In Algeria, 69.1% of the population over 15 in Alger, Constantine, Oran and Annaba can read and write French.[72] According to a survey conducted in 2012, fewer than four in 10 Algerians identified with a Francophone identity. Conversely, speaking French was seen as essential by seven in 10, though a third of the population felt that the use of French is declining.[73] In urban areas, the ability to speak fluent French is considered almost mandatory to find employment, especially in specialized white collar fields.[74] French is the first foreign language in Algeria, and is introduced at the primary level. In higher education, French is the language of instruction in scientific and technical fields.[75]
