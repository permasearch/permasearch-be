New Age religiosity is typified by its eclecticism.[126] Generally believing that there is no one true way to pursue spirituality,[127] New Agers develop their own worldview "by combining bits and pieces to form their own individual mix",[128] seeking what Drury called "a spirituality without borders or confining dogmas".[129] The anthropologist David J. Hess noted that in his experience, a common attitude among New Agers was that "any alternative spiritual path is good because it is spiritual and alternative".[130] This approach that has generated a common jibe that New Age represents "supermarket spirituality".[131] York suggested that this eclecticism stemmed from the New Age's origins within late modern capitalism, with New Agers subscribing to a belief in a free market of spiritual ideas as a parallel to a free market in economics.[132]
