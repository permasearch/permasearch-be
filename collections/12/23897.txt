The idea of reverse transcription was very unpopular at first, as it contradicted the central dogma of molecular biology, which states that DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into proteins. However, in 1970, when the scientists Howard Temin and David Baltimore both independently discovered the enzyme responsible for reverse transcription, named reverse transcriptase, the possibility that genetic information could be passed on in this manner was finally accepted.[6]
