"My Best Friend's Girl" begins with chords in the lower register of the guitar, a two-bar progression moving from I to IV to V in F.[3] Hand claps enter in bar five, and after the eight-bar intro, the first verse begins featuring Ric Ocasek's vocals over a lead guitar lick in the key of F.[3] An organ is introduced in the first chorus, followed by a rockabilly guitar lick which leads to the second verse.[3] The song is composed in contrasting verse-chorus form.[3] Interestingly, the song was originally written and recorded in E major, one semitone lower, then the entire master tape was sped up to place it in F major. Many live performances show the band performing the song in E.[4] The lyrics depict a man's frustration with a woman who is dating his best friend after the man dated her.[5] The narrator coolly[6] notes, "She's my best friend's girl, but she used to be mine."[5]
