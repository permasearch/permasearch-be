One-third of the world's population is thought to be infected with TB.[1] New infections occur in about 1% of the population each year.[11] In 2016, there were more than 10 million cases of active TB which resulted in 1.3 million deaths.[3] This makes it the number one cause of death from an infectious disease.[3] More than 95% of deaths occurred in developing countries, and more than 50% in India, China, Indonesia, Pakistan and the Philippines.[3] The number of new cases each year has decreased since 2000.[1] About 80% of people in many Asian and African countries test positive while 5â€“10% of people in the United States population tests positive by the tuberculin test.[12] Tuberculosis has been present in humans since ancient times.[13]
