The Maxima was redesigned for the 2009 model year and made its debut at the 2008 New York International Auto Show. The newest Maxima (A35) is built on the Nissan D platform sharing this platform with the fourth generation Nissan Altima and second generation Nissan Murano. The exterior and interior design are somewhat similar to the Infiniti G and Infiniti M, with an updated navigation interface and optional USB interface system that works with the main console monitor and steering wheel controls. It serves as Nissan's North American top front wheel drive sedan at Nissan dealerships.
