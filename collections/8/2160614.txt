The Pingelapese language uses a distinction between nouns.[15] There are several classifier forms. the first is for objects which tend to be pretty large in size and not being a favorite possession (tree or shirt), the second is for small, controllable, favorite objects like dogs, books or spears. A third form would be set aside for food objects like bananas, oranges or fish. Drinks like water or coconut liquor also have a classifier forms. A fifth classifier would be designated for things that are to be chewed but not fully consumed. The only example of this was from the book Papers in Kosraean and Ponapeic, the fruit, pandanus, is chewed for the sweet/ bitter juice, but what remains after consuming the juice discarded. The 6th classifier forms are set aside for ways of transportation (bikes, canoes, and boats). The last two classifiers are designated for the land and the house.
