Bulgaria has made numerous contributions to space exploration.[261] These include two scientific satellites, more than 200 payloads and 300 experiments in Earth orbit, as well as two cosmonauts since 1971.[261] Bulgaria was the first country to grow wheat and vegetables in space with its Svet greenhouses on the Mir space station.[262][263][264] It was involved in the development of the Granat gamma-ray observatory[265] and the Vega program, particularly in modelling trajectories and guidance algorithms for both Vega probes.[266][267] Bulgarian instruments have been used in the exploration of Mars, including a spectrometer that took the first high quality spectroscopic images of Martian moon Phobos with the Phobos 2 probe.[261][265] Cosmic radiation en route to and around the planet has been mapped by Liulin-ML dosimeters on the ExoMars TGO.[268] Variants of these instruments have also been fitted to the Chandrayaan-1 lunar probe and the International Space Station.[269][270] Bulgaria's first geostationary communications satellite—BulgariaSat-1—was launched by SpaceX in June 2017.[271]
