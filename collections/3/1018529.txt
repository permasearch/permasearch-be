Like the North American tour, Dark Horse was much maligned on release.[98][99] According to Simon Leng, Harrison's rejection of rock 'n' roll tradition and the Beatles' legacy during the tour was the cause for the album's unfavourable critical reception; in the case of "It Is 'He'", Leng continues, this manifested as "outright hostility" from some reviewers, who saw it as "one Krishna paen too many".[100] Bob Woffinden of the NME wrote: "You keep looking for saving graces [on the album], for words of enthusiasm to pass on ... Tracks like 'It Is HE (Jai Sri Krishna)' are more typical. There, the endless repetition of 'Jai Sri Krishana, Jai Sri Radhe' over an enfeebled tune is hardly compelling listening."[101] Writing for Rolling Stone, Jim Miller opined: "[Harrison's] religiosity, once a spacey bauble in the Beatles' panoply, has come to resemble the obsessiveness of a zealot."[102][103] In a more favourable review, Brian Harrigan of Melody Maker called the song "a bit of a groover" and credited Harrison with the creation of "a new category in music – Country and Eastern".[64]
