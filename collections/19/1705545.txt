The only reliable way to prevent EOD currently is intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis  (IAP), that is to say administration of antibiotics during delivery.  It has been proved that intravenous penicillin or ampicillin administered for â‰¥4 hours before delivery to GBS colonized women are very effective at preventing vertical transmission of GBS from mother to baby and EOD.[4][18] Cefazolin, clindamycin, and vancomycin are used to prevent EOD in infants born to penicillin-allergic mothers.[18]
