Potholes are a notorious problem in Los Angeles and frequently cause severe damage to all kinds of vehicles.  Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa made "Operation Pothole" one of his top priorities in 2008 and pledged to fill 1 million potholes.[27] However, due to the city's poorly managed budget, the city's Bureau of Street Services has only a single dedicated pothole-repair truck to cover 275 miles (440Â km) of streets (meaning that the backlog is still bad and getting worse).[28]  Many city streets, such as Wilshire Boulevard, were engineered when cars, trucks, and buses were much smaller, and desperately need to be torn up and rebuilt from scratch to handle the weight of today's larger vehicles.[28]
