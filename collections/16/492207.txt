In season 8, he is formally reintroduced to the story once his parents learn he is missing in action. It turns out his plane, the Katie Ann, was shot down and crashed into the sea near Britain while he was out looking for stories. He and the pilot were forced to tread water for hours at a time to stay afloat, but after growing exhausted, his comrade succumbed to his injuries and drowned, while John-Boy, who had suffered extreme head trauma, lost consciousness as he was rescued from the sea. Due to the severity of his injuries, he slipped into a lengthy coma and was flown back to America to undergo medical care, leaving his parents to wait on his recovery. When he at last emerged from his coma, he was stricken with amnesia from the traumatic injury he suffered to his head, and no longer could participate in the war. After World War II ended, he tried to return to New York at the promise of an opportunity waiting for him to tell his own story like many others, but subsequently lost his footing as a novelist due to an over-saturated market of war stories ousting his from consideration. He then turned his attention to reporting news instead and gained a steady means of living once more, but would one day have to break the news of the John F. Kennedy assassination. However, it was in this profession that he finally found the love of his life in the form of Janet, and eventually married her.
