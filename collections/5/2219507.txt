In 1957, Utzon unexpectedly won the competition to design the Sydney Opera House. His submission was one of 233 designs from 32 countries, many of them from the most famous architects of the day.[6] Although he had won six other architectural competitions previously, the Opera House was his first non-domestic project.  One of the judges, Eero Saarinen, described it as "genius" and declared he could not endorse any other choice.[7]
