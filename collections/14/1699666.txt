This station's 1970s overhaul included fixing its structure and the overall appearance by replacing the original wall tiles, old signs, and incandescent lighting to the 1970s modern look wall tile band and tablet mosaics, signs and fluorescent lights. It also included fixing staircases and platform edges. In 2001, the station received a major state of repairs, including upgrading for ADA compliance, restoring the original late 1910s tiling, repairing the staircases, re-tiling for the walls, new tiling on the floors, upgrading the station's lights and the public address system, installing ADA yellow safety threads along the platform edge, new signs, and new trackbeds in both directions.
