Cavil later boards the Galactica, calling himself "Brother Cavil," and takes over the Galactica's chapel. The creation of Galactica's "wall of remembrance" is depicted, where survivors posted pictures and mementos of their dead or missing loved ones. Using religious fliers which talk about a "plan", Cavil covertly gathers the seven known cylons. Cavil tells them that he intends to continue his plan to utterly destroy the human race. He also tells them that there is a sleeper agent aboard the Galactica, a Number Eight, whom he also plans to use.
