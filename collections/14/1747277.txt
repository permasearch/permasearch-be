According to a Rediff.com article, "The Most Memorable Mani Movies", "This was arguably the film that announced Mani Ratnam to the Tamil film industry as a talent to watch out for. An excellent script by Ratnam himself, [cinematography by P. C. Sreeram] and a lilting score by [Ilaiyaraaja] made it a hit with both critics and moviegoers".[93] Deccan Chronicle listed Karthik and Revathi on its "Top 10 Jodis" of Tamil cinema; they "made a fresh pair and were adored by the youth, especially the college students. Their awesome on-screen chemistry in Mouna Ragam was a talking point back then".[94] For the April 2013 centenary of Indian cinema, Forbes India included Revathi's performance in its 25 Greatest Acting Performances of Indian Cinema.[95] Mouna Ragam was included in a CNN-News18 poll of the most popular romantic films of all time,[96] and Sify included the film on its list of top five Ilaiyaraaja-Ratnam films.[97]
