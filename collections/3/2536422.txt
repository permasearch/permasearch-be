SIRS is a serious condition related to systemic inflammation, organ dysfunction, and organ failure. It is a subset of cytokine storm, in which there is abnormal regulation of various cytokines.[4] SIRS is also closely related to sepsis, in which patients satisfy criteria for SIRS and have a suspected or proven infection.[1][2][3][5]
