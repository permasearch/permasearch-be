When Manila became an archdiocese in 1595, regular friars who had already established permanent churches in Catanghalan, Bulacan decided that the sitio of Polo be separated from the town and have its own church to cater its increasing spiritual needs. Through successive efforts of Franciscan friar Juan Taranco and Don Juan Monsod, sitio Polo was successfully separated from Catanghalan on November 7, 1621, the feast day of the town's new patron, St. Didacus of Alcalá, known locally as San Diego de Alcalá.[18] The first cabeza de barangay of Polo was Monsod while Taranco run the parish which would become the present-day San Diego de Alcalá parish on a small tavern.[19] The separation was then confirmed by Governor-General Alonso Fajardo de Entenza on November 12, 1623. Later, the date of November 12 is adopted as the foundation day of the city.[1][2]
