Does anyone who made a famous statement that it is your own intelligence that forms the cell for you and furthermore it is a cell which we cannot escape. Unfortuntaly, I can't remember who made this statement and I didn't understand it, when I first read it, but the longer I think about is the more meaning it gains. Thank you for looking, if there is a volunteer.Sha-Sanio (talk) 19:08, 18 December 2008 (UTC)
