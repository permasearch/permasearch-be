The 737 interior arrangement has changed in successive generations. The original 737 interior was restyled for the 737 Classic models using 757 designs, while 777 architecture was used for the debut of the Next Generation 737. Designed using Boeing's new cabin concepts, the latest Sky Interior features sculpted sidewalls and redesigned window housings, along with increased headroom and LED mood lighting.[69][120] Larger pivot-bins similar to those on the 777 and 787 have more luggage space than prior designs.[120] The Sky Interior is also designed to improve cabin noise levels by 2â€“4 dB.[69] The first 737 equipped with the Boeing Sky Interior was delivered to Flydubai in late 2010.[69] Continental Airlines,[121][122]Alaska Airlines,[123] Malaysia Airlines,[124] and TUIFly have also received Sky Interior-equipped 737s.[125]
