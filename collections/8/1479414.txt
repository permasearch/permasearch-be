Today, the Osage Nation has 13,307 enrolled tribal members, with 6,747 living within the state of Oklahoma.[37] Since 2006 it has defined membership based on a person's lineal descent from a member listed on the Osage Rolls at the time of the Osage Allotment Act of 1906. A minimum blood quantum is not required. But, as the Bureau of Indian Affairs restricts federal education scholarships to persons who have 25% or more blood quantum in one tribe, the Osage Nation tries to support higher education for its students who do not meet that requirement.
