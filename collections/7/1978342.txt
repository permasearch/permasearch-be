The negative impedance converter originated from work by Marius Latour around 1920.[151][152] He was also one of the first to report negative capacitance and inductance.[151] A decade later, vacuum tube NICs were developed as telephone line repeaters at Bell Labs by George Crisson and others,[26][125] which made transcontinental telephone service possible.[125] Transistor NICs, pioneered by Linvill in 1953, initiated a great increase in interest in NICs and many new circuits and applications developed.[123][125]
