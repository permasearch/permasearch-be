NestlÃ© and the Japan Post launched a campaign in 2009, allowing people to write messages and mail the chocolate bars from 20,000 post offices.[2] The special packages included a space to write a message of encouragement and affix a stamp. The promotional packages were sold out within a month.[12] That campaign won the Media Grand Prix in 2010's Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival.[5]
