The Yankees had home field advantage for the Series as the American League had won that year's All-Star Game.[33] The team match-up was heavily discussed and analyzed in the media, per the east coast bias, prior to the beginning of the series. Both teams' offensive lineups were heavily touted,[34][35][36][37] with the Yankees and Phillies leading their respective leagues in runs scored per game.[38] Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez drew particular focus in the media for his success in earlier rounds of the 2009 playoffs in contrast to past postseason performances.[39][40][41] The two lineups featured twenty former All-Stars and three former MVP award winners.[35] Only one regular starter between both teams, Phillies catcher Carlos Ruiz, did not have at least ten home runs during the 2009 regular season.[35] The two teams combined for 468 home runs during the season, more than any pair of opponents in World Series history.[35]
