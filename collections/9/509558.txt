Michonne begins to let her guard down, and Rick asks Douglas if there is a job for her in the community. Since there is no need for lawyers, Douglas recommends making her a constable to uphold the law in Alexandria.[23] Michonne attends a welcome party held by Douglas in honor of Alexandria's new residents, but is quiet and reserved during the festivities. When one of Alexandria's residents, Barbara, tries playing matchmaker between Michonne and a young man named Heath, Michonne wearies of the conversation among the partygoers and attempts to leave. Barbara makes a well-intentioned attempt to dissuade her, but becomes insistent about what Michonne would care to eat and says she'd hate to cook a meal Michonne did not enjoy. Michonne snaps and asks if that's all she truly concerns herself about. The guests grow silent. Michonne, uncomfortable, leaves.[24]
