The Challenge involves the contestants having to carry the weight they have lost each week in the form of footballs. They will run across a football field, and each trip down the field, they will drop off one football representing that week. The winner will win a vacation package for two to the 2010 NFL Pro Bowl. Alison then introduces cornerback Rod Woodson, wearing his Steelers jersey. Woodson tells them that the NFL will also donate $5000 in athletic equipment to the school of the winner's choice. Allen wins. Back at the house, Danny plays and sings a song he wrote about their time at the Biggest Loser Ranch.
