Melbourne has a wide range of religious faiths, the most widely held of which is Christianity. This is signified by the city's two large cathedralsâ€”St Patrick's (Roman Catholic), and St Paul's (Anglican). Both were built in the Victorian era and are of considerable heritage significance as major landmarks of the city.[186]
