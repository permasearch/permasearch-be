Among Jordan's biggest fans were Berry and Little Richard.[citation needed] Some have suggested that Berry modeled his musical approach on Jordan's, changing the lyric content from black life to teenage life, and substituting cars and girls for Jordan's primary motifs of food, drink, money and girls. Berry's iconic opening riff on "Johnny B. Goode" bears a striking similarity to the intro played by the guitarist Carl Hogan on the 1946 hit "Ain't That Just Like a Woman"; Berry has acknowledged the debt in interviews[21][22][23] Jordan was also an obvious and substantial influence on the British-based jump blues exponent Ray Ellington, who became famous through his appearances on The Goon Show.
