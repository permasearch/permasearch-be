In a more negative review, Digital Spy's Robert Copsey rated it two stars (out of possible five) and wrote that "the sampling of DJ Avicii's 'Levels' - which in turn samples Etta James's 'Something's Got a Hold on Me' - makes this club-rap number sound about as authentic as Asda's tinned spaghetti."[7] Following James's death on January 20, 2012, Flo Rida dedicated the song in her memory.[8]
