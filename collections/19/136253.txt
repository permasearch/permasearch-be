The Toronto Argonauts currently lead the Canadian Football League in total wins and in winning percentage in the Grey Cup.[5] Early success in the final can partly be attributed to the weakness of western teams: between 1921 and 1952 the Argonauts won in nine straight appearances, including six straight against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. The team's success is not merely an historical aberration, however: they have won seven of their ten appearances since the formation of the CFL, including their last six straight.
