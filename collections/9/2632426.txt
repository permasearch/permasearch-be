In recent years, the brewery has experience significant growth.[1] With over 30% growth in 2010, Left Hand has steadily increased its production, making the Brewers Associationâ€™s Top 50 Craft Brewers list in 2012.[2] The brewery has added six 480 barrel fermenters, an additional 500 barrel bright tank, and a new KHS keg line. Left Hand has also expanded the brewery property, purchasing the warehouse across Boston Avenue to house offices as well as the site of a new 6,000 square foot cooler, bringing the total brewery acreage to 5.5 acres. In the fall of 2012, Left Hand opened a new bottling line that runs four times faster than their previous system and fills 200 bottles per minute.[citation needed]
