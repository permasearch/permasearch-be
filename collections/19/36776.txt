Microsociology is one of the main points (or focuses) of sociology, concerning the nature of everyday human social interactions and agency on a small scale: face to face.[1] Microsociology is based on interpretative analysis rather than statistical or empirical observation,[2] and shares close association with the philosophy of phenomenology. Methods include symbolic interactionism and ethnomethodology; ethnomethodology in particular has led to many academic sub-divisions and studies such as microlinguistical research and other related aspects of human social behaviour. Macrosociology, by contrast, concerns the social structure and broader systems.
