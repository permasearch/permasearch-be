Army Archerd reported that due to the 100-day Writers Guild of America strike only 22 episodes would be produced instead of the planned 23, which is much closer to the length of a regular season than most live-action and animated programs that were also affected by the strike.[3] Entertainment Weekly also reported that at the time, there were only 6 episodes remaining that were ready, which would make the season's production run consist of a total of 22 episodes.[4]
