The Scottish Football Union (SFU), the governing body for rugby union in Scotland, did not give the New Zealanders an official welcome, and sent only one official to greet them on their arrival in Edinburgh.[80] In addition, the SFU refused a financial guarantee for the match, promising the gate receipts to the New Zealanders instead;[h] this meant that the NZRFU had to take on all monetary responsibilities for the match.[110][i] One reason for the cold reception from the SFU may have been because of negative reports from David Bedell-Sivright, who was Scotland's captain and had also captained the British Isles team on their 1904 tour of New Zealand. Bedell-Sivright had reported unfavourably on his experiences in New Zealand the previous year, especially regarding the wing-forward play of Gallaher.[112]
