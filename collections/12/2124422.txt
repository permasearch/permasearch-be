The first wave of major mandates occurred in the 1960s and 1970s, concerning civil rights, education, and the environment.[18] The arrival of the Reagan administration ostensibly undermined various federal mandate efforts, as the executive branch promised to decrease federal regulatory efforts.[18] For example, the passage of Executive Order 12291 required a cost-benefit analysis and an Office of Management and Budget clearance on proposed agency regulations, and the State and Local Cost Estimate Act of 1981 required the Congressional Budget Office to determine the state and local cost effects of proposed federal legislation moving through the Legislative Branch.[6] However, the U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR)] reported that, during the 1980s, more major intergovernmental regulatory programs were enacted than during the 1970s.[19]
