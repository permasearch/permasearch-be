A common, albeit incorrect assumption, is that an SSID is a string of human-readable characters (such as ASCII), terminated by a NUL character (as in a C-string). SSIDs must be treated and handled as what they are, a sequence of 0â€“32 octets, some of which may not be human-readable. Note that the 2012 version of the 802.11 standard defines a primitive SSID encoding, an enumeration of UNSPECIFIED and UTF-8, indicating how the array of octets can be interpreted.
