DR-DOS 7.02 and higher provides a CONFIG.SYS directive named SCROLLOCK=ON|OFF to change the Scroll Lock status on the fly.[4] Activating Scroll Lock during boot will enter a DIAG mode as well, wherein some special drivers may display more verbose messages,[4] but in contrast to the situation under the Multiuser DOS family normal DOS drivers do not typically display additional information. The operating system, however, will temporarily suspend any automatic timeouts (TIMEOUT=<seconds>,<character>,<switch>) in CONFIG.SYS trace (TRACE=ON|OFF) and F7/F8 single-stepping modes for as long as Scroll Lock is active.[4]
