American Idol faced criticism for implications of gender and ethnic bias in its finalists; for five consecutive seasons—seven through eleven—the winner of American Idol was a guitar-playing, Caucasian male. The string of winners led to complaints by critics, who classified them as being a "white guy with guitar" (WGWG), and felt that the likely winner of the program had become too predictable due to the repeated victories by such performers.[33][34][35]
