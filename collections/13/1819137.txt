Hercules is the title character of the franchise. He is based on the mythological Heracles, best known under the Roman spelling Hercules. In the original movie, Josh Keaton voiced Hercules as a teenager, while Tate Donovan was the hero as an adult, and Roger Bart was Hercules' singing voice in the song "Go the Distance". Donovan went on to voice the teenage Hercules in a derived animated series where the hero in training attended high school. His appearance is top-heavy, muscular, and handsome, with orange hair and eyebrows and blue eyes. His teenage version wears a one-sleeved Greek tunic, while the adult version wears a Cuirass-like tank armor tunic  with a blue cape (the television series has teenage Hercules wearing this armor during hero missions).
