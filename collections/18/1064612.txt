In 1946, King followed Bukka White to Memphis, Tennessee. White took him in for the next ten months.[10] However, King returned to Mississippi shortly afterward, where he decided to prepare himself better for the next visit, and returned to West Memphis, Arkansas, two years later in 1948. He performed on Sonny Boy Williamson's radio program on KWEM in West Memphis, where he began to develop an audience. King's appearances led to steady engagements at the Sixteenth Avenue Grill in West Memphis and later to a ten-minute spot on the Memphis radio station WDIA.[17] The radio spot became so popular that it was expanded and became the Sepia Swing Club.[18]
