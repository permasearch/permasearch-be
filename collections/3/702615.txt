The video received attention from reporters for its shock value owing to Eminem's suicidal scene and the use of a gun for it.[19] Jonsin dismissed the controversy surrounding the graphic suicidal scene, "Things happen in movies all the time...When my kids watch it, I like to explain to them in that manner: 'It's like a movie, ya know? He isn't really killing himself.'"[18] The video was harshly criticized by anti-violence campaigners in the United Kingdom.[20] Anti-violence group, Mothers Against Violence, told the British Daily Mirror, "It's all about the money with these videos. Eminem isn't thinking about the families affected."[21] The music video was both praised by fans and noted for its graphic nature.[22] Before the music video's television premiere in July, editor Kathleen Perricone from the New York Daily News expressed her opinion on the censorship of the video, saying, "Despite the gruesome and violent nature, music networks like MTV and BET have yet to ban the videoâ€”or even air it."[23] Josh Grossberg from E! News reacted to the graphic suicide, saying it "sounds like an Eminem video, all right."[24] According to British tabloid The Sun, the song and its music video are similar to the controversial Eminem song, "Kim" from The Marshall Mathers LP (2000). The video was noted as "another dark fantasy and uncomfortable offering from the rapper."[25]
