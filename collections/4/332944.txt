Data collected by NASA showed that ocean surface temperatures in the path of Irma were above 30 °C (86 °F) at the time, more than enough to sustain a Category 5 hurricane.[31] Additionally, ocean surface temperatures in areas along the Strait of Florida extended to 32 °C (90 °F),[32][33] which could support a maximum potential intensity of 200 miles per hour (320 km/h), if ideal conditions had been met.[34]
