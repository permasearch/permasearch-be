The shift of a demand curve takes place when there is a change in any non-price determinant of demand, resulting in a new demand curve.[5] Non-price determinants of demand are those things that will cause demand to change even if prices remain the sameâ€”in other words, the things whose changes might cause a consumer to buy more or less of a good even if the good's own price remained unchanged.[8] Some of the more important factors are the prices of related goods (both substitutes and complements), income, population, and expectations. However, demand is the willingness and ability of a consumer to purchase a good under the prevailing circumstances; so, any circumstance that affects the consumer's willingness or ability to buy the good or service in question can be a non-price determinant of demand. As an example, weather could be a factor in the demand for beer at a baseball game.
