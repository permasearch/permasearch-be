In July 2016, CSX Transportation announced it will build its $270 million state of the art Carolina Connector cargo terminal in Rocky Mount. Studies by the North Carolina Department of Transportation show warehouses and other distribution facilities usually cluster around such cargo hubs, and officials have projected the Carolina Connector could eventually spawn up to 13,000 related jobs statewide. It will be located off of US 301 in the northern part of Rocky Mount, near North Carolina Wesleyan College. Construction will begin in 2018 and it is expected to open in 2020.[19]
