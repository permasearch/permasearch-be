The ability to generate memory cells following a primary infection and the consequent rapid immune activation and response to succeeding infections by the same antigen is fundamental to the role T and B cells play in the adaptive immune response. For many years, NK cells have been considered to be a part of the innate immune system. However, recently increasing evidence suggests that NK cells can display several features that are usually attributed to adaptive immune cells (e.g. T cell responses) such as expansion and contraction of subsets, increased longevity and a form of immunological memory, characterized by a more potent response upon secondary challenge with the same antigen.[11][12] In mice the majority of research was carried out with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and in models of hapten-hypersensitivity reactions. In humans most studies focused on the expansion of an NK cell subset carrying the activating receptor NKG2C. This expansion was observed primarily in response to Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) but other infections, e.g. Hantavirus, have been reported to trigger expansion of NKG2C+ NK cells as well.
