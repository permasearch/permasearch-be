When one of his roommates (Janet Wood) gets married to Phillip Dawson in the Three's Company series finale, Jack proposes to flight attendant Vicky Bradford. Even though she loves him, Vicky turns him down since she doesn't want to get married and wants them to live together instead. Jack refuses at first but then changes his mind and they move into the apartment above his bistro. Three's Company then ends and the spinoff series Three's a Crowd begins, with Vicky and Jack living above the bistro and Vicky's father having purchased the restaurant from Mr. Angelino.
