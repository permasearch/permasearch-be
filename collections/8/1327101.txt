Lee became known for his "frightening" tendency to not "mince words".[72] The director often had his cast do numerous takes for a scene in order to get the perfect shot,[12][30] and was not afraid to call something "boring" if he disliked it.[72] Thompson later recalled the director would "always come up to you and say something unexpectedly crushing", such as asking her not to "look so old."[68][73] She also commented, however, that "he doesn't indulge us but is always kind when we fail."[74] Due to Thompson's extensive acting experience, the director encouraged her to practice t'ai chi to "help her relax [and] make her do things simpler."[60] Other actors soon joined them in meditating â€“ according to Doran, it "was pretty interesting. There were all these pillows on the floor and these pale-looking actors were saying, 'What have we got ourselves into?' [Lee] was more focused on body language than any director I've ever seen or heard of."[60] He suggested Winslet read books of poetry and report back to him in order to best understand her character. He also had Thompson and Winslet live together to develop their characters' sisterly bond.[27] Many of the cast took lessons in etiquette and riding side-saddle.[75]
