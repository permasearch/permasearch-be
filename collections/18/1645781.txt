The Polyus module or spacecraft would have served as the FGB,[citation needed] a foundation which provides propulsion and guidance, but it lacks life support. Polyus was a satellite interceptor/destroyer, carrying a 1 megawatt carbon dioxide laser. The module had a length of almost 37 metres (121 ft) and a diameter of 4.1 metres (13 ft), with a mass of nearly 80 t[which?], and included two principal sections, the smallest, the functional service block (FGB), and the largest, the aim module.[clarification needed][6]
