From 1906 to 1909, John's grandsons George and Alexander II expanded the line and had three blended whiskies in the market, The Old Highland 5 Year Old (YO) ; the Special Old Highland 9YO and the Extra Special Old Highland 12 YO. These three brands had the standard Johnnie Walker labels, the only difference being their colour, White, Red and Black respectively. They were already being referred to in public by the colour of their labels.[24] In 1908, when James Stevenson was the Managing Director, the slogan "Born 1820—Still going Strong!" was created, along with the Striding Man logo, a figure used in their advertisements to this day, etched by illustrator Tom Browne, in honour of the founder, and given the same name. Soon thereafter, the re-branding was finalised and kept simple, in that the public-identified names were retained. In 1909, The Old Highland 5 YO was renamed the Johnnie Walker White Label,[25] now a 6 YO; the Special Old Highland 9YO became the Johnnie Walker Red Label 10 YO and the Extra Special Old Highland was renamed Johnnie Walker Black Label 12 YO.[26] As per current Scottish law, if an age is stated on a bottle, it must be that of the youngest Scotch Whisky in the product, [27] so mandated in The Scotch Whisky Regulations 2009, [(SWR 2009) p8, para 10].[28]
