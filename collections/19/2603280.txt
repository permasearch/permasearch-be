The M855A1 was put on hold in August 2009 due to the experimental bismuth-tin alloy core exhibiting undependable ballistics at high temperatures. The US Army has since replaced the bismuth-tin alloy core with one of solid copper eliminating the heat issue. The United States Marine Corps purchased 1.8 million rounds in 2010, with plans to adopt the round to replace the interim MK318 SOST rounds used in Afghanistan when the M855A1 project was delayed.[111] The Marine Corps plans to adopt the M855A1 round in 2018; although testing revealed it caused "some durability issues" with the Marines' M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle, the weapon is still "operationally suitable" when firing the round.[112]
