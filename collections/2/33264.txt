As Soviet troops marched across the Balkans, they committed rapes and robberies in Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.[38] The population of Bulgaria was largely spared this treatment, due possibly to a sense of ethnic kinship or to the leadership of Marshal Fyodor Tolbukhin.[38] The population of Germany was treated significantly worse.[39] Rape and murder of German civilians was as bad as, and sometimes worse than, Nazi propaganda had anticipated.[40][41] Political officers encouraged Soviet troops to seek revenge and terrorise the German population.[42] On "the basis of Hochrechnungen (projections or estimations)", "1.9 million German women altogether were raped at the end of the war by Red Army soldiers."[43][44][45] About one-third of all German women in Berlin were raped by Soviet forces.[43] A substantial minority was raped multiple times.[45][46] In Berlin, contemporary hospital records indicate between 95,000 and 130,000 women were raped by Soviet troops.[45] About 10,000 of these women died, mostly by suicide.[43][45] Over 4.5 million Germans fled towards the West.[47] The Soviets initially had no rules against their troops "fraternising" with German women, but by 1947 they started to isolate their troops from the German population in an attempt to stop rape and robbery by the troops.[48] Not all Soviet soldiers participated in these activities.[49]
