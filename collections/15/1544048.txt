Hamzah was reportedly four years older than Muhammad.[2]:4 This is disputed by Ibn Sayyid, who argues: "Zubayr narrated that Hamza was four years older than the Prophet. But this does not seem correct, because reliable hadith state that Thuwayba nursed both Hamza and the Prophet." Ibn Sayyid concludes that Hamza was only two years older than Muhammad, though he adds the traditional expression of doubt, "Only God knows."[5] Ibn Hajar writes: "Hamza was born two to four years before Muhammad."[6]
