Mr. Yang (Ally Sheedy) was a serial killer who murdered her first victim in 1995. That year, she killed six people after a game of cat-and-mouse with each of them. Over the next 14 years, she killed two others, and was still not caught, nor her identity revealed. She first appeared in "An Evening with Mr. Yang" (3.16) and most recently in Psych: The Musical (7.15).
