Milkman eventually mentions to Macon the bag that hangs from the ceiling of Pilate's modest home. The bag is heavy and Pilate mentions that it contains her "inheritance." Macon interprets "inheritance" to mean the gold that was left behind in the cave. Macon assumes that Pilate returned to the cave and claimed the gold for her own. Macon then sends Milkman and Guitar on a "quest" to steal the bag of gold from Pilate. As Milkman and Guitar form their plan, they observe a white peacock on a vehicle nearby.The peacock is interpreted differently by each man, with Guitar claiming that all of its "jewelry" weighs it down, and Milkman seeing the symbol of flight and escape that he longs for. In fact, Milkman only agrees to Macon's plan to steal the gold from Pilate because it will give him the means to leave the town and his family, as Milkman has grown tired and impatient of working for his father. Milkman and Guitar succeed in stealing the bag from Pilate, but are stopped by the police and arrested after the police discover that the bag contains, not gold, but human bones. Macon Dead and Pilate both go to the police station to try to free the two young men. Macon attempts to use his influence and money to persuade the police to release the men, but ultimately it is Pilate who frees them by acting like a worn-out, subservient, old black woman. The performance hurts Milkman, as he has never seen his aunt to be anything less than tall, strong, and commanding. For Guitar, Pilate's performance elicits hatred toward her and deepens his already manifested misogyny.
