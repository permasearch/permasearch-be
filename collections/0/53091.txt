"Like a Boss" is a song written and recorded by comedy hip hop troupe The Lonely Island for their debut studio album Incredibad. The song is a parody of the first official single from Slim Thug's first album Already Platinum, also named "Like a Boss". The song had multiple versions, including an audio-only that did not have the celebrity interviewer and a clean version that was produced in both audio and video. In 2011 it was also subject to a lawsuit from the producers of the song who claimed they never received proper compensation for their work.
