About one-sixth of Nagaland is covered by tropical and sub-tropical evergreen forestsâ€”including palms, bamboo, rattan as well as timber and mahogany forests. While some forest areas have been cleared for jhum cultivation, many scrub forests, high grass, and reeds. Many staple Indian species live in Nagaland including dholes, pangolins, porcupines, elephants, leopards, bears, many species of monkeys, deer, and buffaloes thrive across the state's forests.
