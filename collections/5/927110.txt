A try is analogous to a touchdown in American and Canadian football, with the major difference being that a try requires the ball be simultaneously touching the ground in the in-goal area and an attacking player who is in the field of play or in-goal, whereas a touchdown merely requires that a player in possession of the ball enter the end zone. In the laws of both codes of rugby, the term touch down formally refers only to grounding the ball by the defensive team in their in-goal.
