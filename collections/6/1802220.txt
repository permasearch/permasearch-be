Terry returns home to find his father murdered, ostensibly by Jokerz. He later discovers that Derek Powers (who has assumed leadership of a merged Wayne-Powers) ordered Warren's death after the latter discovered Powers' plan to mass-produce biological weapons. Powers' right-hand man Mr. Fixx leads a raid on the McGinnis home and shoots Warren McGinnis. (In the comic books, he orders one of his henchmen, who is a great grand-nephew of Joe Chill, to shoot Warren).[2] Terry then seeks Bruce's assistance in bringing Powers down but cannot convince the old man to inflict swift justice. Bruce is still shaken from an ordeal 20 years earlier of having relied on a gun for self-defense as well as the events portrayed in Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker. Bruce suggests that Terry take the evidence against Powers to the current commissioner of police but, after a scuffle with Powers during which Derek is able to reclaim the evidence, Terry takes matters into his own hands and steals the latest incarnation of the Batsuit. Despite some initial mistrust, their similar backgrounds convince Bruce to aid Terry. Terry successfully derails Powers' plan, exposing Powers to his own hazardous chemicals in the process, resulting in his mutation into Blight.
