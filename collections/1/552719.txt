We need to show that every integer greater than 1 is either prime or a product of primes. For the base case, note that 2 is prime. By strong induction: assume true for all numbers between 1 and n. If n is prime, there is nothing more to prove. Otherwise, there are integers a and b, where n = ab and 1 < a â‰¤ b < n. By the induction hypothesis, a = p1p2...pj and b = q1q2...qk are products of primes. But then n = ab = p1p2...pjq1q2...qk is a product of primes.
