Ever since the Kimberley diamond strike of 1868, South Africa has been a world leader in diamond production.[citation needed] The primary South African sources of diamonds, including seven large diamond mines around the country, are controlled by the De Beers Consolidated Mines Company. In 2003, De Beers operations accounted for 94% of the nation's total diamond output of 11,900,000 carats (2.38 t). This figure includes both gem stones and industrial diamonds.[17] Diamond production rose in 2005 to over 15,800,000 carats (3.16 t).[13]
