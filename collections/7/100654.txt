A folded dipole is a half-wave dipole with an additional wire connecting its two ends. If the additional wire has the same diameter and cross-section as the dipole, two nearly identical radiating currents are generated. The resulting far-field emission pattern is nearly identical to the one for the single-wire dipole described above, but at resonance its feedpoint impedance      R  f d     {\displaystyle R_{fd}}   is four times the radiation resistance of a single-wire dipole. This is because for a fixed amount of power, the total radiating current      I  0     {\displaystyle I_{0}}   is equal to twice the current in each wire and thus equal to twice the current at the feed point. Equating the average radiated power to the average power delivered at the feedpoint, we may write
