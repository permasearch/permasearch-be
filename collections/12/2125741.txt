After Greek astronomy was transmitted to the medieval Islamic world, astronomers made some changes to Ptolemy's cosmological model, but did not greatly change his estimate of the Earth–Sun distance. For example, in his introduction to Ptolemaic astronomy, al-Farghānī gave a mean solar distance of 7003117000000000000♠1170 Earth radii, whereas in his zij, al-Battānī used a mean solar distance of 7003110800000000000♠1108 Earth radii. Subsequent astronomers, such as al-Bīrūnī, used similar values.[35] Later in Europe, Copernicus and Tycho Brahe also used comparable figures (7003114200000000000♠1142 and 7003115000000000000♠1150 Earth radii), and so Ptolemy's approximate Earth–Sun distance survived through the 16th century.[36]
