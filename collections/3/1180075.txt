Ignition typically occurs around 15 degrees before top dead centre. The spark plug must be sited so that the flame front can progress throughout the combustion chamber. Good design should avoid narrow crevices where stagnant "end gas" can become trapped, as this gas may detonate violently after the main charge, adding little useful work and potentially damaging the engine.[citation needed]
