Some scholars feel the need to group the Amami and Okinawa Islands because Amami is closer to Okinawa in some respects, for example from a linguistic point of view, than Miyako and Yaeyama. Japanese scholars use "Amamiâ€“Okinawa"[18] while American and European scholars use "Northern Ryukyuan".[19] They have no established single-word term for the group since the native population had not felt the need for such a concept.[10]
