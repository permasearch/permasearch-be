After the Cassirer family fled Hitler's persecution of Jews, Heinz Cassirer came to believe that Jesus was the promised Messiah and was baptized into the Anglican Church in 1955 and considered himself henceforth a Jewish Christian. He eventually translated the New Testament, God's New Covenant: A New Testament Translation. Cassirer completed his translation of the New Testament in just thirteen months.[1]
