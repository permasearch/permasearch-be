Chikmagalur district is  known for not well maintained roads.[20][21] The poor state of the roads has hampered development of this district to some extent; more so because of the absence of even a good rail network in this district.[22] The total length of roads in this district is 7264Â km.[5] There are only three National Highways that pass through this district. The National Highway NH-13 (Solapur to Mangalore) passes through the towns of Koppa and Sringeri,  the National Highway NH-206 (Bangalore to Honnavar)  passes through the towns of Kadur, Birur and Tarikere and NH-173 passes through Mudigere - Kottigehara connecting Mangaluru via charmadi ghat. There is a proposal to upgrade the existing state highways Tarikere-Belur, Sringeri-Hassan to national highway status.[23]
