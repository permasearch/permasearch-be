The ICC is financed by contributions from the states parties. The amount payable by each state party is determined using the same method as the United Nations:[141] each state's contribution is based on the country's capacity to pay, which reflects factors such as a national income and population. The maximum amount a single country can pay in any year is limited to 22% of the Court's budget; Japan paid this amount in 2008.
