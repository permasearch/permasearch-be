Tipu Sultan (born Sultan Fateh Ali Sahab Tipu,[2] 10 November 1750 – 4 May 1799), also known as the Tipu Sahib,[3] was a ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore. He was the eldest son of Sultan Haidar Ali of Mysore.[4] Tipu introduced a number of administrative innovations during his rule,[5] including his coinage, a new Mauludi lunisolar calendar,[6] and a new land revenue system which initiated the growth of the Mysore silk industry.[7] He expanded the iron-cased Mysorean rockets and commissioned the military manual Fathul Mujahidin, and is considered a pioneer in the use of rocket artillery.[8] He deployed the rockets against advances of British forces and their allies during the Anglo-Mysore Wars, including the Battle of Pollilur and Siege of Seringapatam. He also embarked on an ambitious economic development program that established Mysore as a major economic power, with some of the world's highest real wages and living standards in the late 18th century.[9]
