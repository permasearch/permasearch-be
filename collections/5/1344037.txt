Certain scenes and dialogues from the film earned iconic status in India, such as "Kitne aadmi the" (How many men were there?), "Jo dar gaya, samjho mar gaya" (One who is scared is dead), and "Bahut yaarana laagta hai" (Looks like you two are very close) – all dialogues of Gabbar Singh.[12][105] These and other popular dialogues entered the people's daily vernacular.[106] Characters and dialogues from the film continue to be referred to and parodied in popular culture.[107] Gabbar Singh, the sadistic villain, ushered in an era in Hindi films characterised by "seemingly omnipotent oppressors as villains", who play the pivotal role in setting up the context of the story, such as Shakal (played by Kulbhushan Kharbanda) of Shaan (1980), Mogambo (Amrish Puri) of Mr. India (1987) and Bhujang (Amrish Puri) of Tridev (1989).[108] Filmfare, in 2013, named Gabbar Singh the most iconic villain in the history of Indian cinema,[109] and four actors were included in its 2010 list of "80 Iconic Performances" for their work in this film.[110][111][112][113]
