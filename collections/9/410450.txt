A flotilla of ships sailed from England beginning in April 1630, sometimes known as the Winthrop Fleet. They began arriving at Salem in June and carried more than 700 colonists, Governor John Winthrop, and the colonial charter.[30] Winthrop delivered his famous sermon "City upon a Hill" either before or during the voyage.[31]
