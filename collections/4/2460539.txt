All twenty takes of "Stuck Inside of Mobile" were recorded in the early hours of February 17, 1966, in Columbia's Music Row Studios in Nashville. Dylan continuously reworked the song in the studio, revising lyrics and changing the song's structure as he recorded different takes. Eventually, after recording for three hours, a master take, the twentieth and final take, was chosen.[3] Take five would eventually be released on The Bootleg Series Vol. 7.
