A professor's unusual encounter with Amaro sends the SVU on an investigation into reports of sexual abuse at a prestigious private school. Stonewalled by the school board, Benson and Barba enlist former students and Professor Walter Tompkins (Elliott Gould), a retired teacher, to help reveal a massive cover-up as more victims emerge. As the detectives manage to get their hands on key evidence linked to one of the victims, the school throws up a roadblock in court until another former student comes forward.
