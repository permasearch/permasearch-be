In 1966, the NBA introduced a coin flip between the worst teams in each division to determine who would obtain the first overall draft pick. The team who lost the coin flip would get the second pick, while the rest of the first-round picks were determined in reverse order of the win-loss record. In this system, the second-worst team would never have a chance to obtain the first pick if it was in the same division as the worst team. The coin flip meant that both teams had an equal chance to draft first. The coin-flip system remained in operation until 1984.[1]
