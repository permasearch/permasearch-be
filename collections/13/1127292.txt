In practice, there was a wide number of variations to this common design.[23] A castle could have more than one bailey: at Warkworth Castle an inner and an outer bailey was constructed, or alternatively, several baileys could flank the motte, as at Windsor Castle.[24] Some baileys had two mottes, such as those at Lincoln.[24] Some mottes could be square instead of round, such as at Cabal Trump.[24] Instead of single ditches, occasionally double-ditch defences were built, as seen at Berkhamsted.[24] Local geography and the intent of the builder produced many unique designs.[25]
