Starting in 1970, professional drag racers Don Prudhomme (driver of The Snake) and Tom McEwen (driver of The Mongoose) were sponsored by Hot Wheels, and later on, Hot Wheels created the  Snake and Mongoose Drag set in 1970. Later somewhere in 1972, the second versions of both funny cars were released, when McEwen had the Mongoose 2, and Prudhomme had the Snake 2. The drag set remained the same. Then, Hot Wheels made rail-dragster versions of them, based on the actual funny cars and was featured in the Wild Wheelie Set. Later in Hot Wheels' lifespan, the normal drag set with Snake and Mongoose were still being produced. The latest set with the Snake and Mongoose is in the Drag-Strip Demons lineup.
