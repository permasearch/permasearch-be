No parking signs indicate that loading or unloading there while temporarily stopped is permitted, but parking is not.[4] Some no parking signs display time restrictions, while others are permanent restrictions. There are also temporary versions of the signs, often of similar design to the permanent ones. These signs are specified by the MUTCD to be red on white, although local variations do occur.
