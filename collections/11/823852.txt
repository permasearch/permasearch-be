Girls Aloud performed "See the Day" live for the first time at Children in Need's Great Big Bid. The band appeared on Blue Peter, CD:UK (twice), Hit40UK, Ministry of Mayhem, The Paul O'Grady Show, Today with Des and Mel, Top of the Pops, and Top of the Pops Reloaded. It was also featured on 2006's Chemistry Tour. As one of the group's least favourite singles, as well as one of the worst-performing, "See the Day" has rarely been performed live since its release.
