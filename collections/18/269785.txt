Unbeknownst to the Precursors. who for reasons unknown were unable to hear the Sea Emperor's telepathic voice, the Sea Emperor Leviathan was trying to tell them that the only way to hatch the eggs was to place them in their natural conditions, where enzymes produced by local flora would trigger full maturity and the hatching process to begin. After several attempts they took two of the seven Emperor eggs that had been collected and placed one in a laboratory dedicated to the research of eggs, and dissected the other. The egg dissection was a failure as the embryo was incapable of producing potent Enzmye 42. Desperate, the Precursors stole two eggs from another native species, the "Sea Dragon Leviathan", a species related to the Sea Emperor Leviathan species that shares many features with it, albeit smaller and far less intelligent. These eggs were taken to research the hatching conditions of the Sea Emperor, as the Emperor's eggs were too precious to lose more of. The Precursors underestimated the Sea Dragon Leviathan, and it pursued them to another of their bases, the "Disease Research Facility". One of the two Dragon eggs had been contained here and the Sea Dragon Leviathan launched an assault on the base, ending with it ramming headfirst into one of the support cables keeping the facility suspended above the ground, a feat that - according to the player's PDA - would have required a ramming force of three hundred tons, and resulted in the death of the creature due to massive head trauma. The cable was ripped from the cave wall and the facility dropped, causing other cables to detach also and the facility to fall to the cave floor. This facility was the site in which Kharaa's effects were tested on the local fauna, and its destruction caused Kharaa to break out into the ecosystem. Upon outbreak, several automated quarantine procedures were put into place:
