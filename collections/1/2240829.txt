By 1930 or earlier the idea of extending postal district or zone numbering plans beyond large cities to cover even small towns and rural locales was in the air. These developed into postal codes as we define them today. (The name of US postal codes, "ZIP codes", reflects this evolutionary growth from a zone plan to a zone improvement plan [ZIP].) Modern postal codes were first introduced in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in December 1932,[3] but the system was abandoned in 1939. The next country to introduce postal codes was Germany in 1941,[4] followed by Argentina in 1958, the United States in 1963[5] and Switzerland in 1964.[6] The United Kingdom began introducing its current system in Norwich in 1959, but they were not used nationwide until 1974.[7]
