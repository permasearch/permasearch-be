In spring 333 BC, Alexander crossed the Taurus into Cilicia. After a long pause due to an illness, he marched on towards Syria. Though outmanoeuvered by Darius' significantly larger army, he marched back to Cilicia, where he defeated Darius at Issus. Darius fled the battle, causing his army to collapse, and left behind his wife, his two daughters, his mother Sisygambis, and a fabulous treasure.[58] He offered a peace treaty that included the lands he had already lost, and a ransom of 10,000 talents for his family. Alexander replied that since he was now king of Asia, it was he alone who decided territorial divisions.[59] Alexander proceeded to take possession of Syria, and most of the coast of the Levant.[54] In the following year, 332Â BC, he was forced to attack Tyre, which he captured after a long and difficult siege.[60][61] The men of military age were massacred and the women and children sold into slavery.[62]
