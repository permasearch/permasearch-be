Nests, hatchlings, and sometimes adults[49] are commonly eaten by raccoons, foxes, rats[29][50][51] and many species of birds, especially crows and gulls.[32][52] Density of these predators are often increased because of their association with humans. Predation rates can be extremely high; predation by raccoons on terrapin nests at Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge in New York varied from 92-100% each year from 1998â€“2008,[29] Burke unpubl. data).
