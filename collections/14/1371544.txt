Based upon how they are manufactured gold bars are categorised as having been cast or minted with both differing in their appearance and price.[1] Cast bars are created in a similar method to that of ingots whereby molten gold is poured into a bar shaped mold and left to solidify. This process often leads to malformed bars with uneven surfaces which although imperfect makes each bar unique and easier to identify. Cast bars are also cheaper compared to those that are minted because they are quicker to produce and require less handling.
