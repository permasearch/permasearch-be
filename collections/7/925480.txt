Since the 2013 elections, overseas voting has been open to the majority of Malaysian registered voters living abroad[73]. However, registered overseas Malaysian voters were reported to have received their ballots late, some even on election day, despite the election commission requiring their ballots to be returned before the close of polling stations to be counted as valid.[74] As a result, many of these overseas voters organised on social media to bring theirs and other ballots back through casual couriers.[75][76] The Election Commission of Malaysia currently denies trying to stop overseas Malaysians to vote.
