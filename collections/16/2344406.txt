Challenge coins issued by presidents date back to the late 1990s. Separately, the White House Communication Agency (WHCA) has issued challenge coins for foreign heads and military during Presidential visits. In May 2018, controversy arose when WHCA released a coin featuring Trump and North Korean head Kim Jong-un ahead of peace talks scheduled for June 2018 in Singapore.[16][17]
