The Chipped Cup is taken from the story between Rumplestiltskin and Belle. While serving Rumplestiltskin at his castle, Belle accidentally drops a drinking cup, causing it to be chipped. After Rumplestiltskin demands her to leave following her romantic feelings for him, he is falsely informed by the Evil Queen Regina that she had died. He then places the cup on display as a tribute or remembrance.[1]
