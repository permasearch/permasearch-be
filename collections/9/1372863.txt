A preform is a pre-made shape of solder specially designed for the application where it is to be used.[121] Many methods are used to manufacture the solder preform, stamping being the most common. The solder preform may include the solder flux needed for the soldering process. This can be an internal flux, inside the solder preform, or external, with the solder preform coated.[122]
