The Nixon administration's choice of tree topper, the atomic symbol of peace rather than a traditional star, was criticized.[16] The 1995 Blue Room Christmas Tree sought ornaments made by architecture students from across the United States.[17] Contest winner Rene Spineto stirred up some controversy when she designed an ornament that depicted two stockings, one marked "Bill" and the other marked "Newt" (in reference to President Bill Clinton and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich).[17] While the stocking marked "Bill" was filled with candy and presents, the one marked "Newt" was filled with coal.[17] The Clinton administration hung the ornament on the tree without censorship.[17]
