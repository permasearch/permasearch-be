Fair Harvard! we join in thy Jubilee throng, And with blessings surrender thee o’er By these Festival-rites, from the Age that is past, To the Age that is waiting before. O Relic and Type of our ancestors’ worth, That hast long kept their memory warm, First flow’r of their wilderness! Star of their night! Calm rising thro' change and through storm.  Farewell! be thy destinies onward and bright! To thy children the lesson still give, With freedom to think, and with patience to bear, And for Right ever bravely to live. Let not moss-covered Error moor thee at its side, As the world on Truth’s current glides by, Be the herald of Light, and the bearer of Love, Till the stock of the Puritans die.  [Revised 1998]
