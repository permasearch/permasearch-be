She was engaged to cameraman Michael Bosman; however, the two were not legally married, saying they would wait until everyone can get married in the United States. They instead filed for all the legal protections that are available to same-sex couples. The couple had dated for four years, but Bosman did not propose until the legalization of same-sex marriage in California in June 2008. The couple then campaigned very publicly against California's Prop. 8.[20] Perrette and Bosman later split, and in December 2011, she announced her engagement to former British Royal Marine Thomas Arklie.[21] She had again announced that the couple would not marry until Proposition 8 is invalidated.[22]
