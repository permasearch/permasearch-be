Gaucher's disease (GD) has three common clinical subtypes.[5][6] These subtypes have come under some criticism for not taking account of the full spectrum of observable symptoms (the phenotypes[7]). Also, compound heterozygous variations occur which considerably increase the complexity of predicting disease course.
