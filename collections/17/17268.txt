Frank Bryce is a reclusive Muggle World War II veteran who works as the caretaker of the Riddle family mansion in Little Hangleton. In 1942, the Riddles were murdered by Tom Riddle (later to become Lord Voldemort), and since Bryce had the keys to the large house where the deaths occurred, he was arrested and questioned in connection with the murders. As there was lack of evidence (because the bodies were unmarked as the Killing Curse leaves no sign of violence or damage on the victims) the police could not prove that the Riddles had been murdered, and were forced to release Bryce. However, the community of Little Hangleton was distrustful of Bryce. As a result, he lived out the rest of his life by himself, living on the grounds of the Riddles' estate, while still tending to the grounds.
