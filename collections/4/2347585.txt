The lineage of La Cerda continued throughout the Middle Ages and was constituted as a noble house of the first rank, playing a leading role in Castilian politics. This line, like others from the Civil War of mid-fourteenth century, continued through the female line to shift the family heirloom until Dona Isabel de la Cerda, married Bernardo de Bearne, first Count of Medinaceli.
