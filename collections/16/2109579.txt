The serval is a carnivore that preys on rodents, particularly vlei rats, small birds, frogs, insects and reptiles, and also feeds on grass that can facilitate digestion or act as an emetic. Up to 90% of the preyed animals weigh less than 200 grams (7Â oz); occasionally it also hunts larger prey such as duikers, hares, flamingoes and young antelopes.[5] The percentage of rodents in the diet has been estimated at 80-97%.[23][25][26] Apart from vlei rats, other rodents recorded frequently in the diet include the African grass rat, African pygmy mouse and multimammate mice.[8]
