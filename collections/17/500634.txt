In 1876, games played in Montreal were "conducted under the 'Hockey Association' rules";[24] the Hockey Association was England's field hockey organization. In 1877, The Gazette (Montreal) published a list of seven rules, six of which were largely based on six of the Hockey Association's twelve rules, with only minor differences (even the word "ball" was kept); the one added rule explained how disputes should be settled.[25] The McGill University Hockey Club, the first ice hockey club, was founded in 1877[26] (followed by the Quebec Hockey Club in 1878 and the Montreal Victorias in 1881).[27] In 1880, the number of players per side was reduced from nine to seven.[7]
