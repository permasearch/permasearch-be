Goodbye, Farewell and Amen is a television film that served as the 251st and final episode of the American television series M*A*S*H. Closing out the series' 11th season, the 2 hour episode first aired on CBS February 28, 1983, and retelecast on September 19, 1983, fittingly ending the series' original run altogether. (CBS reran it one last time September 16, 1984.) It was written by a large number of collaborators, including series star Alan Alda, who also directed.
