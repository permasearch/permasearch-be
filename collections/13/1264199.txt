In the episode "Four Aliens and A Baby", Liz blasts Tess Harding twice, using a green energy that exited from her hands. In "Graduation", she starts to see flashes about the future after touching people. She sees a customer of the Crashdown CafÃ© in danger and she and Max save her. While she is making out with Max she gets a flash of Max, herself, Michael and Isabel being killed by someone. Thanks to this power, they flee Roswell at the end of the series, before the FBI can kill them.[12][13]
