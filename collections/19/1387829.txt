The Infinite Sadness continues the night that The Clash at Demonhead performs. After the venue clears out, Envy invites Scott and his friends backstage. Disgusted by Envy's new personality, Scott blames Todd for changing her and tries to attack him, but is stopped by Todd's psychic vegan powers. A flashback reveals that Envy, formerly known as Natalie V. Adams, was a mousy girl who gradually bloomed into a confident musical talent. She broke up with Scott once their band started to get noticed. A contest is set up by Envy, pitting Scott and Todd against each other in landmark discount store Honest Ed's. Todd's psychic powers end up destroying the store in a bout of existential dread. Scott and Ramona decide to blow off the next battle. Two days later, it's revealed Todd (who once punched a hole in the moon for Envy) is cheating on her with the band's drummer Lynette. When Envy discovers this, (and the fact that Todd had punched a hole in the moon for Ramona first) Todd strikes her with his powers, shocking everyone. Todd and Scott have a battle, which Todd almost wins until the Vegan Police show up and strip him of his powers for violating his vegan diet (by eating gelato and a chicken parmesan). Scott headbutts the powerless Todd, who is reduced to a pile of coins, and receives an extra life in the process. Envy goes solo and leaves town, showing some regret at the bitchy Diva she's become, but leaving her standing with Scott unresolved and him pining for some closure. Scott and Ramona look forward to the future.
