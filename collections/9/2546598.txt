TSM qualified for the 2016 League of Legends World Championships as North America's first seed.[62] TSM was drawn into Group D, which contained Samsung Galaxy, and Royal Never Give Up, and Splyce.[63] TSM lost their first game against RNG,[64] but were able to win their first game against Samsung.[65] A victory against Splyce[66] put them in a three-way tie for first[67] with Samsung and RNG. In the second week, Samsung beat TSM[68] after Doublelift infamously dashed into the opposing mid laner, which forced them to not take the baron. TSM then won against Splyce[69] and lost to RNG.[70] They were ultimately eliminated in the group stage with a 3-3 record.[71]
