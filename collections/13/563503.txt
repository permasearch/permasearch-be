Scientist Sanjay Mehra (Rakesh Roshan) creates a computer program from which he sends variations of the syllable om into space, hoping to attract the attention of extraterrestrial life. When he believes he has finally received a response, the scientific community mocks him. While driving home, an alien spacecraft appears overhead. Sanjay drives off the road, causing the car to hit a stone, flip over, and explode. While Sanjay dies, his pregnant wife Sonia (Rekha) survives the wreck and returns home to India. When their son Rohit Mehra (Hrithik Roshan) is born, he is mentally disabled due to the injury he received in the accident while still being a foetus. Sonia  learns from a doctor that although surgery is the only solution to Rohit's disability, it could potentially result in his paralysis or even death. His mother raises him in the town of Kasauli, where he grows up to be a man of limited intellect and childish personality, but with a loving and emotional heart. Rohit has a number of much younger friends; loyal children who play with him.
