The narrator's comments on Jews in the book are cited by a journalist for Haaretz when considering what he terms "Orwellâ€™s latent anti-Semitism".[29] Some suggest the work may have been Orwell's parody of his own social upbringing and social class, noticing the narrator has both racist and anti-racist outbursts.[30][31] Another commentator cites the book as evidence that anti-Semitism was much more prevalent in Paris than in London.[32]
