The term USP has been largely replaced[according to whom?] by the concept of a positioning statement, popularized by the publication of Al Ries and Jack Trout's Positioning: Battle For Your Mind.[24] The positioning statement determines what place a brand (tangible good or service) should occupy in the consumer's mind compared to the competition. The model directs managers to determine the cognitive gap, locating "which functional benefit in a given category is most valued by consumers and least dominated by other brands."[24] Positioning is also commonly known as mindshare marketing; the aim is to stake a claim to the cognitive association in consumers' minds, connecting the brand's trademark with the benefit claim as "simply, consistently and frequently as possible."[24]
