The quake claimed one life in Watsonville:[51] a driver who collided with panicked horses after they escaped their collapsed corral.[53] In other Santa Cruz and Monterey county locations such as Boulder Creek and Moss Landing, a number of structures were damaged, with some knocked off of their foundations.[54] Many residents slept outside their homes out of concern for further damage from aftershocks, of which there were 51 with magnitudes greater than 3.0 in the following 24 hours, and 16 more the second day.[54] The earthquake damaged several historic buildings in the Old Town district of Salinas, and some were later demolished.[55]
