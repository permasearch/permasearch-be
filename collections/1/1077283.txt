Thanh Nien was designed to prepare for an armed struggle against the French colonial occupation.[5] Ho Chi Minh and his associates envisioned three phases.[5] In the first phase, an external center was to be established as a training center, source of unified political propaganda and headquarters for strategic decision-making and the maintenance of organizational and ideological discipline.[5] Secret revolutionary groups called "cells" were to be trained in Canton and returned to Vietnam to operate.[6]
