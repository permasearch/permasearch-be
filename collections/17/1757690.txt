The A. m. iberica haplotype is present in the honey bees of the western United States,[28] Mexico and South America, where the honey bees are not native. They were introduced from Spain during the conquest of America, from populations of indeterminate origin with African haplotypes. Apis mellifera iberica is a hybrid between the North African and European bees, Apis mellifera mellifera, and Apis mellifera intermissa.[29] Presents six haplotypes different, five of them correspond to an evolutionary lineage from Africa and one from Western Europe. From this, infer the hybrid nature of this subspecies, is similar to that of African populations in the number of alleles detected and the values of genetic diversity. Additionally A.m.intermissa genoma, present in A.m.iberica belongs to a group shown by experiment to have similar mtDNA, this including A. m. monticola, A. m. scutellata, A. m. adansonii and A. m. capensis.[30][31][32]
