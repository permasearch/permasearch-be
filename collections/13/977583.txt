In existence since about 1829, Bartlett was incorporated in 1866 and remained a small town for another 100 years. From the "old" town of only 508 people at Stage Road and the railroad in 1960, Bartlett grew rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s both through new residents, largely due to "white flights" from Memphis, and through annexation, primarily to the east and north, to over 54,000 people today. In 2007, it was the ninth largest city in Tennessee.
