As the conflict escalates, Iron Man is able to reach General America and reveal that Bucky is a Skrull, prompting General America to accept a telepathic 'update' from Emma Frost that confirms that the Skrulls have manipulated the conflict for years. Accepting their mutual responsibility for the situation, Rogers and Stark sacrifice themselves to detonate the Bellcurve bomb. The blast depowers the superhumans and reverts the Skrulls to their true state. A few months later, a powerless Peter and Jennifer are shown discussing the tentative truce that has been formed between the two sides, and wonder whether Stark and Rogers knew that peace would be the result of their sacrifice.[20]
