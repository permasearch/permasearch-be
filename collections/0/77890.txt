Life with Archie: The Married Life was based on the Archie Marries Veronica/Archie Marries Betty storyline, but was not a direct continuation on it. The series lasted from 2010 to 2014, ending with 37 issues. Issues 1-35 contained two stories each, the first story was Archie Marries Veronica and the second one was Archie Marries Betty. The last two issues, on the other hand, were structured differently. Instead of having two stories both issues had one, but were twice as long as the others. Also, neither issue made it clear whether Archie was married to Betty or Veronica. Together both issues make up The Death of Archie storyline.
