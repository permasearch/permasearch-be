Sarah then started pursuing Quinn, learning that he's trying to reassemble The Key, a device that can modify the Intersect's original function. When she fails to stop him on a plane, she returns to Chuck to ask for his help. They track Quinn to Berlin, where by coincidence, she started re-enacting the events from the pilot. However, she made the mistake of assuming that Chuck would kill Quinn, who not only allowed Quinn to escape, but accidentally shot down Casey's helicopter in the process. Locked back in Castle, Sarah was convinced to work with the team as they tried to stop Quinn. Sarah is forced to shoot Quinn when he reaches for his gun, ruining their chances of deactivating the bomb Beckman is sitting on. Chuck then decides that he must upload the Intersect back into his head in order to figure out how to defuse the bomb, thus eliminating the only chance of Sarah getting her memories back. He gets the Intersect, but cannot figure out to disarm the bomb once he's on the computer for it. Sarah suggests searching for "Irene Demova" (a porn virus) on the Internet which Chuck does and is surprised that she knows about, pointing out it was from five years ago and the bomb is disarmed after the virus crashes it
