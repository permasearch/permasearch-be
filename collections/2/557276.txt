Watersheds of North America include the Arctic, Atlantic, and Pacific watersheds of North America, as well as the continent's endorheic watershed areas (e.g., Great Divide Basin) and watersheds between the limits of the Arctic Ocean and the northern limits of the Atlantic and Pacific[1] (e.g., Greenland Sea Watershed and Chukchi Sea Watershed of North America). The largest is the Atlantic Watershed of North America, which drains over 2,250,000 sq mi (5,800,000 km2) of area across both the Atlantic Seaboard Watershed and the North American portion of the American Mediterranean Sea Watershed.
