In 1993, Castles and Coltheart describe developmental dyslexia as two prevalent and distinct varieties using the subtypes of Alexia (acquired dyslexia), Surface and Phonological Dyslexia.[23] Understanding these subtypes is useful in diagnosing learning patterns and developing approaches for overcoming visual perception impairments or speech discrimination deficits. Cestnick and Coltheart (1999) demonstrated what these underlying deficits are in part, through unveiling different profiles of phonological versus surface dyslexics.[24] Surface Dyslexia is characterized by subjects who can read known words but who have trouble reading words that are irregular.[23] Phonological Dyslexia is characterized by subjects who can read aloud both regular and irregular words but have difficulties with non-words and with connecting sounds to symbols, or with sounding out words. Phonological processing tasks predict reading accuracy and comprehension.[23] Cestnick and Jerger (2000)[25] and Cestnick (2001)[26] further demonstrated distinct processing differences between phonological and surface dyslexics. Manis et al. 1996, concluded that there were probably more than two subtypes of dyslexia, which would be related to multiple underlying deficits.[27]
