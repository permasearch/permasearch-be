On January 12, 1966, ABC replaced The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet with Batman, an action series based on the DC Comics series starring Adam West that was known for its kitschy style.[94] In 1967, WLS radio CEO Ralph Beaudin was appointed as the president of ABC Radio.[95] Under his leadership, ABC Radio was divided into four "networks" devoted to different types of programming: news, informative series, pop music, and talk shows.[95] Two other networks were later created to provide rock music and traffic reporting.
