This is the list of rural banks in Ghana. Rural banks were first established in Ghana in 1976 to provide banking services to the rural population, providing credit to small-scale farmers and businesses and supporting development projects,[1] with the first being in Agona Nyakrom in Central Region.[2][3] The banks are locally owned and managed.[4] By 2002 115 rural banks had been established.[5] They are supervised by the clearing bank ARB Apex Bank[6] under the regulation of the Bank of Ghana,[7] which owns shares in the banks.[8][9][10][11][12][13]
