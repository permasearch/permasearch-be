Other 320 GB Xbox 360 S limited editions soon followed. Like the 250 GB "Super Elite" consoles, 320 GB Xbox 360 S consoles were only available as part of limited/special edition console bundles (as of  September 2011[update]), with stand-alone 320 GB hard drives also being available for purchase.[26]
