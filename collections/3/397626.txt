Regardless of the pros and cons of Second Life, language teachersâ€™ interest in virtual worlds continues to grow. The joint EUROCALL/CALICO Virtual Worlds Special Interest Group[67] was set up in 2009, and there are now many areas in Second Life that are dedicated to language learning and teaching, for example the commercial area for learners of English, which is managed by Language Lab,[68] and free areas such as the region maintained by the Goethe-Institut[69] and the EduNation Islands.[70] There are also examples of simulations created specifically for language education, such as those produced by the EC-funded NIFLAR[71] and AVALON[72] projects. NIFLAR is implemented both in Second Life and in Opensim.
