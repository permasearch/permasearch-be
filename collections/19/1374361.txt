In the 2013 race, the Norwegian vessel Wyvern was shipwrecked between the Swedish islands of Gotland and Ã–land in the Baltic Sea. The crew were rescued. A man from the Dutch schooner Wylde Swan was presumed drowned after he and two others from the schooner had boarded the Wyvern in an attempt to save it from going down.[5][6]
