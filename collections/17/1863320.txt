Robin Franson Pruter from Forced Viewing rated the episode with 3/4 stating that it was a solid, yet unremarkable episode. "Overall, “Unpleasantville” isn’t a stand-out episode. The series has found its groove now, and “Unpleasantville” presents an example of an average episode, typified by solid story development and character interaction."[6]
