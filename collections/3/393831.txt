The second season of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air premiered on September 9, 1991 and aired its season finale on May 4, 1992. In this season, the kitchen and living room sets of the Banks mansion (which is where most scenes were shot) were rebuilt to be larger and more contemporary, as opposed to the more formal style of the first season. They were connected by an archway, allowing scenes to be shot continuously between the sets.
