1993: 5-1, #10 Tennessee led #2, defending national champion Alabama at Legion Field 17-9 with 1:44 remaining. Alabama quarterback Jay Barker then led an 83-yard touchdown drive to close the gap to 17-15 before star wide receiver David Palmer ran in a two-point conversion to tie the game at 17 with only 21 seconds remaining. Tennessee elected to run out the clock, preserving the 17-17 tie - the last tie in Alabama football history - and ending Alabama's 28 game winning streak.[33]
