The council consists of 85 councillors elected for a five-year term from 23 wards. These wards were introduced for the 2017 election, replacing those introduced in 2007, and each returns three or four members by the single transferable vote system of election. This system was introduced by the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004,[9] as a means of ensuring a reasonably proportionately representative outcome.
