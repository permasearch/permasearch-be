Toyota's new Corolla offers two engine selections, both all aluminium, 1.8-liter inline four cylinder engines. With the exception of the LE Eco trim, the 1.8-liter engine is equipped with dual Intelligent VVT-i variable valve timing, producing 98 kW (132 hp). The LE Eco model has a 104 kW (140 hp) engine featuring Toyota's Valvematic option, which improves the Eco model's fuel efficiency. Valvematic offers a broader range of continuously variable valve timing (lift and phasing) over VVT-i, providing more optimal intake valve (not on exhaust side) operation relative to engine demands conferring a five-percent improvement in fuel economy and engine output.[3][34] The Eco model's engine also has an increased compression ratio of 10.6:1.[36]
