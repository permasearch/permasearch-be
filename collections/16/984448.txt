At Bordeaux and again at Garonne, the Umayyad forces were mostly cavalry, and had the chance to mobilize, which led to the devastation of Odo's army. Odo's forces, like other European troops of that era, lacked stirrups, and therefore had no heavy cavalry. Most of their troops were infantry. The Umayyad heavy cavalry broke the Frankish infantry in their first charge, and then slaughtered them as they broke and ran.
