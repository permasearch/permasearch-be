Jhansi Ki Rani begins with Manikarnika (Manu) at age 14. She lives with her father, Moropant Tambe, a pandit in the Bithoor court of Peshwa Baji Rao II and Nana Saheb. Manu is trained in the arts of war by Tatya Tope. She despises the British rule of India, and takes the form of Kranti Guru to combat it. Manu is a thorn in the side of Manson, a British official. She marries Jhansi's maharaja, Ganghadar Rao Newalkar; her name changes to Lakshmi Bai, and her life changes drasically. At Jhansi a servant, Moti Bai, collaborates with British officer Captain Fraser but changes sides after meeting Rani. Another officer, Marshal, kills Prachi (Baji Rao's daughter) and is killed by Kranti Guru in revenge. When the maharaja discovers that Kranti Guru is Rani, their relationship deteriorates. He agrees with a British officer that Kranti Guru will not be accused of Marshal's death if he hands over Rani's friend, Samar Singh. When Rani saves Samar, the maharaja casts her away.
