The Bing Crosby recording was released by Decca Records as catalog number 18608. The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on June 29, 1944 and lasted four weeks on the chart, peaking at #5.[2] The flip side, "Amor," also charted, making this a two-sided hit. The Crosby version of "Long Ago (and Far Away)" was used in the film Someone to Love (1987).[3]
