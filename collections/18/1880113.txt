Leonard and Penny elope in Las Vegas, live streaming the ceremony for friends at home. Leonard wrote a touching cosmology-based wedding vow while Penny recites "You've Got a Friend in Me". When they kiss after he carries her over the threshold, Penny is still bothered that Leonard kissed Mandy two years ago and is outraged to hear they work together. When Leonard and Penny return home, she goes to her apartment alone. Sheldon, confused and hurt by Amy's indecision about their relationship, insults her before all their friends watching the wedding at Howard and Bernadette's house. Amy openly breaks with him, upon which all leave except for Howard and Stuart, who actually see the wedding to the end. Sheldon calls his mother to return his great-grandmother's ring which he had intended for Amy, but Mary tells him to wait. Sheldon briefly considers dating Mandy to hurt Amy. He is angered that Penny knew Amy was unhappy and did not defend him. A dejected Leonard cannot believe he is spending his wedding night with Sheldon, though Sheldon always expected this.
