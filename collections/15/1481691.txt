Practical application in medical imaging started in the early 2000s.[17] Amorphous selenium is used in commercial large area flat panel X-ray detectors for mammography and general radiography due to its high spatial resolution and x-ray absorbing properties.[18] However Selenium's low atomic number means a thick layer is required to achieve sufficient sensitivity.[19]
