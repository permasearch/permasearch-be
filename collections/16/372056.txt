Females use dens to give birth and to shelter kits. Dens are classified as either natal dens, where parturition takes place, or maternal dens, where females move their kits after birth.[3] American marten females use a variety of structures for natal and maternal denning, including the branches, cavities or broken tops of live trees, snags,[20] stumps, logs,[20] woody debris piles, rock piles, and red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) nests or middens. Females prepare a natal den by lining a cavity with grass, moss, and leaves.[15] They frequently move kits to new maternal dens once kits are 7â€“13 weeks old. Most females spend more than 50% of their time attending dens in both pre-weaning and weaning periods, with less time spent at dens as kits aged. Paternal care has not been documented.[3]
