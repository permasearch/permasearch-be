The suction is the maximum pressure difference that the pump can create. For example, a typical domestic model has a suction of about negative 20 kPa.[citation needed] This means that it can lower the pressure inside the hose from normal atmospheric pressure (about 100 kPa) by 20 kPa. The higher the suction rating, the more powerful the cleaner. One inch of water is equivalent to about 249 Pa; hence, the typical suction is 80 inches (2,000Â mm) of water.
