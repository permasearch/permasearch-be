where      Î¸  f     {\displaystyle \theta _{f}}   is the angle above the aim angle at which the bullet leaves the barrel,      t  f     {\displaystyle t_{f}}   is the time of travel of the bullet in the barrel and L is the distance the bullet travels from its rest position to the tip of the barrel. The angle at which the bullet leaves the barrel above the aim angle is then given by:
