In August 1995, the Fort Wayne (Indiana) Journal Gazette published the first mainstream media article[1] about the "synchronicity", citing the Usenet discussion group alt.music.pink-floyd. Soon afterward, several fans began creating websites in which they touted the experience and tried to comprehensively catalogue the corresponding moments. A second wave of awareness began in April 1997, when Boston radio DJ George Taylor Morris discussed "Dark Side of the Rainbow" on the air, leading to further mainstream media articles and a segment on MTV news.[citation needed]
