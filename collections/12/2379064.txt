Issue #3 received an average score of 6.3/10 based on 23 reviews from critics on Comic Book Roundup.[36] Schedeen gave it a 5.1 saying, "Civil War II looks every bit as good as you'd expect from Marvel's flagship event comic. Unfortunately, this series doesn't have nearly enough to offer beneath that gorgeous exterior. There's too much dialogue and exposition and not enough progress or dramatic weight to the story."[50] Pepose gave it a 6 and said, "Civil War II #3 is a decent chapter of an event story that feels like plenty of other event stories. But as far as memorials go, it's unfortunately pretty forgettable fare."[51]
