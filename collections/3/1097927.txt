Dale was born on 6 May 1947 in Dunedin, Otago, New Zealand.[2][3] One of four children, Dale enjoyed his childhood, but his family was relatively poor.[1] Growing up in New Zealand without televisions, Dale loved the theatre and amateur dramatics.[4] His first performance was for a school concert, at the age of 13, doing an impression of comedian Shelley Berman. His parents became founding members of an amateur theatre in Auckland called "The Little Dolphin Theatre". Dale often operated the stage equipment used to produce weather effects,[1][2] Although a skilled rugby player, Dale opted to move into drama instead because "the acting fraternity didn't like footballers and the footballers didn't like actors. [...] Acting gave me the same buzz and there was the chance of a longer career."[4] He gave up rugby at the age of 21 because it was not considered a workable career at the time, and he had to support his family.[1] Acting roles were limited in New Zealand so Dale worked in multiple jobs, including as a male model,[5] a car salesman and a realtor.[4] While working as a milkman he heard the disc jockey at his local radio station resign during a broadcast. Dale went over to the station and told the managers he could do a better job. They gave him a trial and then signed him up for the afternoon show.[4] At the age of 27 he decided to become a professional actor.[1]
