In 1984, Richard Meier was chosen to be the architect of the center.[6] After an extensive conditional-use permit process,[7] construction by the Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Company[8] began in August 1989.[9] The construction was significantly delayed, with the planned completion date moved from 1988 to 1995 (as of 1990).[10] By 1995, however, the campus was described as only "more than halfway complete".[7]
