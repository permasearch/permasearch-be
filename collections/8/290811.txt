Miles Prower (マイルス・パウアー, Mairusu Pauā), better known by his nickname Tails (テイルス, Teirusu) is a two-tailed fox who is Sonic's best friend and sidekick. His name is a pun on "miles per hour". He is able to use his two tails to propel himself into the air like a helicopter for a limited time. Yasushi Yamaguchi, originally the main artist and zone designer for Sega's Sonic Team, designed Tails for an internal competition for a sidekick to Sonic. His first appearance was in Sonic 2 for the Game Gear, where he was kidnapped by Robotnik for a "hefty" ransom, and was first made playable in the Genesis version of Sonic the Hedgehog 2.[11] Tails has appeared in almost every Sonic game since his first appearance. Tails also starred in two solo spinoff games for the Sega Game Gear in 1995 - Tails' Skypatrol, and Tails Adventures.[12] Frequently portrayed as a sweet-natured[13] and humble fox,[14] Tails used to be picked on because of his twin tails, before he met Sonic.[15] Tails has a very high IQ and excellent mechanical ability.
