One 2016 review of stem cell therapy trials found tentative evidence that intraspinal stem cell implantation was relatively safe and possibly effective.[106] A 2016 Cochrane review of cell based therapies found that there was insufficient evidence to speculate about efficacy.[107] Stem cell therapy can provide additional proteins and enzymes that have shown to help prolong survival and control the symptoms associated with ALS.[77][108] Those proteins include neurotrophic factors and insulin-like growth factor 1. Both those proteins are still under clinical trials and need to be further studied to evaluate their efficiency and associated side effects.[77][108]
