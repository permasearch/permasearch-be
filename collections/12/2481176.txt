Elsewhere, Flash finds himself at Doctor Fate's tower and is introduced to Doctor Fate and his assistant Zatanna. After Flash explains his predicament to Doctor Fate, Doctor Fate reveals that by overloading his powers, he broke his connection to the Speed Force which he proceeds to explain to the Flash. Doctor Fate and Zatanna then proceed to send Flash into the Speed Force where Flash will be placed with various trials in order to prove his worthiness of his powers. Remembering the advice of his fellow Justice Leaguers, Flash is able to complete the trials and is introduced to the Speed Force Nexus, the primary source of power in the Speed Force. Right at that moment, Reverse Flash arrives and reveals that he planned for Flash to complete the trials so that he could acquire the Nexus without having to deal with the trials himself. As Reverse Flash steals the Nexus and places it into his suit, his powers become increased exponentially and he is able to leave Flash trapped in the Speed Force.
