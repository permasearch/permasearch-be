In Italian football, Roma is a club with many rivalries; first and foremost is their rivalry with Lazio, the club with whom they share the Stadio Olimpico. The derby between the two is called the Derby della Capitale, it is amongst the most heated and emotional footballing rivalries in the world. The fixture has seen some occasional instances of violence in the past, including the death of Lazio fan Vincenzo Paparelli in 1979â€“80 as a result of an emergency flare fired from the Curva Sud,[82] and the abandonment of a match in March 2004 following unfounded rumours of a fatality which led to violence outside the stadium.[83]
