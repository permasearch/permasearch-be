Cummings is associated with the modernist free-form poetry associated with much poetry in the 20th century. Much of his poetry is written with a original syntax and largely inclining toward an extended use of lower case typography for poetic expression. His use of lower case syntax extended to the rendering even of the personal pronouns "I" to the lower case "i" as may be found in the phrase "i shall go". Cummings was politically neutral much of his life until the rise of the Cold War when he became a Republican in political orientation and a supporter of Joseph McCarthy during the height of the Cold War. He died in the 1960s after briefly teaching at Harvard University in the 1950s, having lived nearly seventy years.
