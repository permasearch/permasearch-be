The differences in National Assessment for Educational Progress (NAEP) math scores between boys and girls nearly double from the 9-year-olds to the 17-year-olds.[101] This inconsistency in which gender shows more achievement could be due to the fact that class grades, especially in middle and high school, usually depend on a studentâ€™s completion of homework assignments, and studies have shown that girls report spending more time on homework than boys.[104] The gender gap in mathematics is particularly large among the highest-achieving students; for example, there is a 2.1 to 1 male-female ratio among students who score an 800 on the math portion of the SAT.[105]
