Although PCH advertises its sweepstakes along with magazine subscriptions, no purchase is necessary to enter or win.[10][42][43] In 1995, PCH began the tradition of announcing winners of its $10 million prize just after the Super Bowl.[44] As of 2012, $225 million in prizes have been distributed.[8] Some of its larger prizes are for $5,000 a week for life,[45] or $10 million.[46] Prizes can also range from $1 Amazon gift cards to $2,500, $1 million or $3 million.[47] The larger cash prizes are paid in installments, typically with a balloon payment at 30 years,[48] reducing the present value of prizes to much less than their nominal values.
