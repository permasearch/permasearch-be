The Angolite is the inmate-published and -edited magazine of the institution, which began in 1975 or 1976.[126] Each year, six issues are published.[84] Louisiana prison officials believed that an independently edited publication would help the prison. The Angolite gained a national reputation as a quality magazine and won international awards under two prisoner editors, Wilbert Rideau and Billy Sinclair,[127] who became co-editors in 1978.[128] Associate editor Ron Gene Wikberg joined them in 1988, moving up from a position as staff writer. He worked on the magazine until gaining parole in 1992.
