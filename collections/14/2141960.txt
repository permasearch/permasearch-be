On April 5, 1968, the Las Vegas media was given a tour of the Landmark.[67] During the event, Caroll beat the Landmark's interior designer, Leonard Edward England, for allegedly flirting with Caroll's wife. Caroll was arrested on April 17, 1968, on charges of assault and battery against England.[72][71][73][74] On April 22, 1968, Caroll withdrew his request for a gaming license,[70] a decision that was approved two days later.[71] The company then planned to receive new financing and to eventually submit a new gaming application. Approximately 600 people were expected to be employed at the Landmark upon its opening.[62] The Landmark was put up for sale in April 1968,[75] and the charges against Caroll were dropped two months later on the condition that he not renew his gaming license application.[73][76]
