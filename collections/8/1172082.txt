The lyrics of "Whip It" are disjointed and nonsensical.[12] For example, its central theme revolves around the ability to solve one's problems by "whipping it"; other lines include motivational statements like "go forward, move ahead" and "it's not too late".[12] Casale wrote the lyrics, which were intended to satirize American optimism. He took inspiration from communist propaganda posters and Gravity's Rainbow by Thomas Pynchon, a 1973 novel that contains satirical limericks about capitalist can-do clichés.[13] Casale incorporated lyrics that would sound like motivational clichés if taken out of context.[14]
