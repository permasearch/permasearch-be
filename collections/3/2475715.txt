dbx was a competing analog noise reduction system developed by David E. Blackmer, founder of dbx laboratories.[16] It used a root-mean-squared (RMS) encode/decode algorithm with the noise-prone high frequencies boosted, and the entire signal fed through a 2:1 compander. dbx operated across the entire audible bandwidth and unlike Dolby B was unusable as an open ended system. However it could achieve up to 30Â dB of noise reduction.
