Library binding is done at a commercial library binding company.  Sending books to the library binder is a mass production process.  The library will gather and set aside their volumes which they want library bound, and then box and ship these books to a library binding company. The binding company handles each volume one at a time, and then places all the items from the shipment back into boxes and sends them back to the library.
