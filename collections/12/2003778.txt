Traveling performance troupes advertised the product in medicine shows across the Midwest,[3][4] with runs as long as six weeks in a town. They used horse-drawn wagons and dressed in silk top hats, frock coats, pinstriped trousers, and patent leather shoesâ€”with spats.[5] They distributed song books at the shows and in druggists.[6][7] Performers included James Whitcomb Riley, singer and composer Paul Dresser from Indiana,[8] and southern gospel music progenitor Charles Davis Tillman.
