Following the release of Erin Brockovich, Eckhart co-starred with Ren√©e Zellweger in LaBute's Nurse Betty (2000).[20] He next appeared in Sean Penn's mystery feature The Pledge (2001), in which he played a young detective partnered with a veteran detective, played by Jack Nicholson.[42] The movie received generally favorable reviews,[43] but it did not fare particularly well at the box office.[44] The following year, he collaborated with LaBute in a film adaptation of the Man Booker Prize-winning novel Possession (2002).[45] In 2003, Eckhart co-starred with Hilary Swank in The Core, a film about a geophysicist who tries to detonate a nuclear device in order to save the world from destruction.[46] The film was critically and financially unsuccessful.[47][48] Also in 2003, he appeared in The Missing, in which he played Cate Blanchett's lover,[49] and in the action-thriller Paycheck opposite Ben Affleck.[50] Paycheck, based on a short story by science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, garnered generally negative reception.[51] Film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two stars (out of four), saying that he "enjoyed the movie" but felt that it "exploits [Dick's story] for its action and plot potential, but never really develops it."[52]
