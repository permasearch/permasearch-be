NSW Premier Barry O'Farrell asked Prime Minister Gillard in his first official meeting with her after becoming Premier in April 2011 to divert the Federal funds allocated to the Parramatta to Epping rail link to the North West Rail Link project.[48] Despite this, the Federal Government did not allocate any funds to the North West Rail Link in the 2011 Budget.[49] At least part of the reason for the snub, apart from the Federal Government's transport priorities, is the fact that the O'Farrell State Government did not submit a project proposal for the North West Rail Link to Infrastructure Australia.[50]
