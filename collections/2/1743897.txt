One aspect not yet considered is the statistical or molecular interpretation of work and heat. At a recent seminar at my university, I was reminded that the average energy for a canonical ensemble of weakly interacting particles is <E> = ΣNiεi / ΣNi = Σεi exp(-εi/kT), whose differential is dE = Σ(∂E/∂εi)dεi + Σ(∂E/∂Ni)dNi, and that the first and second terms of the differential represent the statistical expressions for the infinitesimal work and heat respectively.
