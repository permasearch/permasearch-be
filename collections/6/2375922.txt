Özil missed Arsenal's opening day defeat to Liverpool, after his excursions at UEFA Euro 2016 meant he was not match-fit. However, he started his first game of the new season for his club in a 1–3 away win at Watford on 28 August, in which he scored his first goal of the campaign, heading in an Alexis Sánchez cross to score Arsenal's third of the afternoon.[102] His second arrived just under a month later, netting a controlled volley in a 3–0 home win against Chelsea.[103] On 15 October, Özil again scored a volley at home, as he recorded the decider in a tense 3–2 win against Swansea.[104] Four days later, in a Champions League home game against Ludogorets Razgrad, Özil assisted Theo Walcott's goal, and scored his first professional career hat-trick, which was concluded after again volleying as Arsenal went on to win 6–0.[105] On 29 October, he registered his first league assist of the season, after Giroud latched onto a corner to score the club's third in a 1–4 win against Sunderland.[106] For his performances, he was awarded the club's Player of the Month award for the month of October.
