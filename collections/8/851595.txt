The editorial board of The Wall Street Journal tends to reject widely held views on climate changeâ€”namely that it poses a major threat to human existence, is largely caused by fossil fuel emissions, and can be prevented through public policy. The Journal is regarded as a forum for climate change skeptics,[57][58] publishing articles by scientists skeptical of the consensus position on climate change in its op-ed section, including several essays by Richard Lindzen of MIT.[59][60][61] Similarly, the Journal has been accused of refusing to publish opinions of scientists which present the mainstream view on climate change.[62] According to a 2016 analysis, 14% of the guest editorials presented the results of "mainstream climate science", while the majority did not. Also, none of 201 editorials published in the WSJ since 1997 concede that the burning of fossil fuels was causing climate change.[63] A 2015 study found The Wall Street Journal was the newspaper that was least likely to present negative effects of global warming among several newspapers. It was also the most likely to present negative economic framing when discussing climate change mitigation policies,[64] tending to taking the stance that the cost of such policies generally outweighs their benefit.
