But with the approach of Aslan, her magical winter thaws, and Edmund is rescued after his treason. He had been greeted with a hostile reception from the White Witch after arriving at her castle alone, and even more so after informing her that Aslan had come to Narnia. The harshness of the Witch's winter had made Edmund realise that he had been wrong in thinking that her side was the right side to be on, and he realised the full extent of her evil when he witnessed her turning a party of creatures into stone after their revelation that Father Christmas had been in Narnia - much to the Witch's horror after she had banished him.
