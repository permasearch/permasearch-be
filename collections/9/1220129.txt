Between shows, in the off season, and of course after retirement, a horse does not wear its tail set and even a nicked tail will drop to some degree; many returning to a completely normal appearance and even regaining their ability to clamp down. If the horse is shown again at a later time, many horses with nicked tails need only wear the tail set for a few days before a show to re-stretch the tail muscles into the correct position.
