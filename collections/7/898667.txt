Reaction from critics centered on Costner's performance. One characterized it as "unsentimental", but handled "with such ease and conviction" that it anchors the film.[5] Roger Ebert noted that in building the premise, "the movie makes a plucky stab at explaining how it comes to happen â€“ and it almost sounds plausible." He gave it three stars,[6] saying that a "mix of comedy and drama is winning; Costner couldn't be better, and the little girl is a find." Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle also gave it favorable reviews.[7] However, Richard Roeper was quoted as saying, "Not a bad movie, probably OK to rent on DVD, but I'm saying don't rush to the theaters."[8]
