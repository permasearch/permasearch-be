1985 The 1985 infringement claim was based on USPA’s use of the word Polo on their retail clothing and fragrances as well as a logo similar to that of Polo Ralph Lauren. Polo Ralph Lauren, which was founded in 1967, began using a solid image of a horseman playing polo as their logo after the release of their men’s fragrance in 1978. A few years later, USPA released a men’s fragrance in a similar dark blue package with a solid image of two horsemen playing polo as their logo. The judge ruled that USPA would be allowed to use the logo as so long as they make changes to clearly distinguish it from Polo Ralph Lauren so it does not confuse consumers. The Lauren company was granted the right to use trademarks that USPA argued were generic to the sport of polo.[4]
