Murray attended Clarence High School in Clarence, New York.[4] He became a fan of literature, and was heavily involved in playing football.[2] In his late teens, he broke his nose. This led to reports during his career that he had received a nose job. Murray clarified in a 2004 interview, "I got jumped in a Burger King when I was 18 and had my nose put on the other side of my face. It was three guys – what the hell was I supposed to do? The doctors didn't even bother running X-rays. They just reset it. But it wasn't a nose job – I hate the fact that people say it was a nose job!"[5]
