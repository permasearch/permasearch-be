The black mamba is primarily terrestrial, but occasionally arboreal, especially where it occurs in forest.[27] Typically it inhabits neglected areas of scrub, termite mounds, abandoned burrows and rock crevices.[25] It is adapted to terrain ranging from savannah and woodland to rocky slopes and dense forests.[26] The black mamba prefers moderately dry environments such as light woodland and scrub, rocky outcrops, and semi-arid dry savannah, to dense forest or arid desert.[26]
