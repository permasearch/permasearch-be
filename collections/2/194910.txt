Participation in CCAs is graded together with other non-academic achievements throughout a student's secondary school education in a scoring system known as LEAPS 2.0. (LEAPS 1.0 was abolished and the cohort of 2016 taking the 'O' level examination would be last to use this system).[32][a] Points accumulated in the areas of leadership, enrichment, achievement, participation and service will determine a student's CCA grade.[32] Students may get up to a maximum of two bonus points for entry into a junior college depending on their CCA grades.[33] LEAPS 2.0 is about leadership, achievement, participation and service. The method of calculating the 2 bonus points are very different, with LEAPS 2.0 making it harder to achieve the 2 bonus points.
