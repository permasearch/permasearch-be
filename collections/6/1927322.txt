The hotel has been entirely renovated in order to help it attain the 'Palace' distinction, which is a title bestowed by the French ministry of economy, industry and employment.[1] It was closed from 1 August 2012 and reopened in June 2016.[2] Because of its status as a symbol of high society and luxury, the hotel has featured in many notable works of fiction including novels (F. Scott Fitzgerald's Tender Is The Night and Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises), a play (NoÃ«l Coward's play Semi-Monde), and films (Billy Wilder's 1957 comedy Love in the Afternoon and William Wyler's 1966 comedy How to Steal a Million).
