Herds of cattle are often marked using a freeze brand to show which herd or owner they belong to. Other methods of doing this include ear tags, ear notches, ear tattoos, and electronic identification. These are often used in conjunction to freeze branding, with one being an individual marker and the other, usually the freeze brand, denoting the herd.[8]
