Up to 23 million years ago tree dwelling great apes began building sleeping platforms, including wooden pillows, to improve their sleep.[6] According to studies on chimpanzees that sleep up to eight to nine hours a night using specifically selected ironwood pillows, sturdy pillows enabled great apes to escape being hunted by night predators and not fall out of the trees while asleep.[6] It is likely that this was necessitated by the evolution of large, energy consuming brains.[6] Though it may also have led to longer periods of REM sleep, that in turn increased their cognitive capacity.[6]
