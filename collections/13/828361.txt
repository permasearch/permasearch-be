Notorious crimes by released murders occurred in the 1980s and 1990s, are often credited with influencing politics along Law and Order lines [2]. Most notably the release of the murderer Willie Horton who committed a rape and a rampage of severe violence when he was released Willie Horton, is generally credited with favoring the election of president George H. W. Bush over the man who released him, Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis. Whatever the cause, Bush beat Dukakis by a margin of both popular and electoral college votes that has not been surpassed since United States presidential election, 1988. Also, the release of the murderer Reginald McFadden who went on a serial murder and rape spree [3] by the acting governor of Pennsylvania, Mark Singel may have been a contributing factor in the election of Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge. Ridge's win against Singel was quite clear at 45% to 39% Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, 1994.
