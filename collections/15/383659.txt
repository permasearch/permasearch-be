Although immigration rates to New France remained very low under direct French control,[72] most of the new arrivals were farmers, and the rate of population growth among the settlers themselves had been very high.[73] The women had about 30 per cent more children than comparable women who remained in France.[74] Yves Landry says, "Canadians had an exceptional diet for their time."[74] This was due to the natural abundance of meat, fish, and pure water; the good food conservation conditions during the winter; and an adequate wheat supply in most years.[74] The 1666 census of New France was conducted by France's intendant, Jean Talon, in the winter of 1665â€“1666. The census showed a population count of 3,215 Acadians and habitants (French-Canadian farmers) in the administrative districts of Acadia and Canada.[75] The census also revealed a great difference in the number of men at 2,034 versus 1,181 women.[76]
