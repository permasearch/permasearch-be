Berry Gordy got his start as a songwriter for local Detroit acts such as Jackie Wilson and the Matadors.  Wilson's single "Lonely Teardrops", written by Gordy, became a huge success, but Gordy did not feel he made as much money as he deserved from this and other singles he wrote for Wilson. He realized that the more lucrative end of the business was in producing records and owning the publishing.
