On the March 10, 2014 episode of Raw, WrestleMania XXX host Hulk Hogan announced that he was establishing the André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal in honor of André's legacy that would take place at the event on April 6, with the winner receiving the André the Giant Memorial Trophy (made in the likeness of André).[2] Cesaro would win the match after eliminating Big Show using a body slam similar to the body slam Hogan used on André at WrestleMania III.[4]
