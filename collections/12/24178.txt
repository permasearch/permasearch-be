The final episode shows how the unique properties of visible light provide an insight into the origins and development of mankind and the Universe. At Karnak Temple in Egypt he observes the sunrise of the winter solstice through precisely aligned stone columns. The central star of the Lagoon Nebula, Herschel 36, and Eta Carinae are then compared to our sun, and the light from distant objects such as these allows us to engage on a journey back in time. Aboard a Hawker Hunter he easily breaks the sound barrier, but a speed of light was not first considered until the time of Ole RÃ¸mer in the 1670s. Cox then explains how the limitations of the light barrier allow scientists to measure distance and time with accuracy, and to peer back into the distant corners of the universe's creation. In 2003-2004 the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field captured images of galaxies 13 billion light-years distant, and a rainbow over the Victoria Falls in Zambia reveals a red-blue spectrum. The stretched "Invisible light" of the Big Bang is also discussed as part of the Cosmic microwave background as seen in the WMAP image. At Burgess Shale in Yoho National Park he concludes the series with the evolution of the eye and pikaia.
