On 26 January 1569, Mary was moved to Tutbury Castle[174] and placed in the custody of the Earl of Shrewsbury and his formidable wife Bess of Hardwick.[175] Elizabeth considered Mary's designs on the English throne to be a serious threat and so confined her to Shrewsbury's properties, including Tutbury, Sheffield Castle, Wingfield Manor and Chatsworth House,[176] all located in the interior of England halfway between Scotland and London, and distant from the sea.[177] Mary was permitted her own domestic staff, which never numbered fewer than sixteen,[178] and needed thirty carts to transport her belongings from house to house.[179] Her chambers were decorated with fine tapestries and carpets as well as her cloth of state on which she had the French phrase En ma fin est mon commencement ("In my end lies my beginning") embroidered.[180] Her bedlinen was changed daily,[181] and her own chefs prepared meals with a choice of thirty-two dishes served on silver plates.[182] She was occasionally allowed outside under strict supervision,[183] spent seven summers at the spa town of Buxton, and spent much of her time doing embroidery.[184] Her health declined, perhaps through porphyria or lack of exercise, and by the 1580s she had severe rheumatism in her limbs, rendering her lame.[185]
