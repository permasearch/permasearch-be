Eventually, the band appeared for the first time on stage together in nearly five years as presenters at the February 2009 Grammy Awards, announcing their reunion.[78] The trio embarked on a reunion tour of North America from July to October 2009,[79] with a European trek following from August to September 2010.[80] The recording process for Neighborhoods, the band's sixth studio album, was stalled by its studio autonomy, tours, managers, and personal projects. DeLonge recorded at his studio in San Diego while Hoppus and Barker recorded in Los Angeles—an extension of their strained communication.[49][81] The self-produced album—their first without producer Jerry Finn[47]—was released in September 2011 and peaked at number two on the Billboard 200.[82] Its singles—"Up All Night" and "After Midnight"—only attracted modest chart success, and label Interscope was reportedly disappointed with album sales.[83]
