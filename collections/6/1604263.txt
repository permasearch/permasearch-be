Since Aiello's admittance, the link between head injuries in football and long-term brain damage have become more accepted in the NFL In a roundtable discussion with the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce, Jeff Miller, the NFL's senior vice-president for health and safety, admitted that "there is a link between football-related head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy."[38] However, public relations issues continue to plague the League. A report from the Democratic members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce said that "the NFL rescinded a gift to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for concussion research when it learned the study's findings would be detrimental to the league's image."[39] The N.F.L had tried to funnel the funds it gave to the NIH towards its own studies. The League rejected the accusations.[40]
