Starting with the 2011 season, Major League Baseball instituted a new disabled list, a 7-day list specifically for concussions. The idea is to prevent long-term brain damage which may take up to 7 days by current standards.[4] If a player is not activated from the concussion DL after those 7 days have passed, he is automatically transferred to the 10-day DL.
