Cartilaginous joints are connected entirely by cartilage (fibrocartilage or hyaline).[1] Cartilaginous joints allow more movement between bones than a fibrous joint but less than the highly mobile synovial joint. Cartilaginous joints also forms the growth regions of immature long bones and the intervertebral discs of the spinal column.
