Michael Tedder of New York called the episode "the single funniest episode of the show since Steve Carell left" and praised Brian Baumgartner's performance for hitting "notes of sweetness, frustration, and emotional confusion that normally get written for the topliners". He also praised the plotlines, writing that "what made this episode so great was that not only did every plot line work ... but every moment positively sang". He gave the episode five stars, concluding that "The Office still has some surprises in it".[19]
