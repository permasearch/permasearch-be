The decade of the 1980s saw changes in NASCAR and within the No. 21 team. Pearson parted ways with the team, and was replaced by an emerging talent named Neil Bonnett from Hueytown, Alabama. Bonnett was a member of the "Alabama Gang" which included driving stars Bobby and Donnie Allison, and this would later include Davey Allison and Hut Stricklin.
