Income patterns are evident on the basis of age, sex, ethnicity and educational characteristics. In 2005 roughly half of all those with graduate degrees were among the nation's top 15% of income earners. Among different demographics (gender, marital status, ethnicity) for those over the age of 18, median personal income ranged from $3,317 for an unemployed, married Asian American female[7] to $55,935 for a full-time, year-round employed Asian American male.[8] According to the US Census, men tended to have higher income than women, while Asians and Whites earned more than African Americans and Hispanics.
