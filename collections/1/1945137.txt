Daniel is a student at Harvard, and later business partner of Conrad. He returns home for the summer to see his family and later meets and falls in love with Emily Thorne. After dating for a while, he proposes to her and the two become engaged. At their engagement party, he is attacked by a former friend, Tyler Barrol, and is forced to shoot him before being knocked out (later revealed to be Satoshi Takeda, who finishes off Tyler). Daniel is framed and charged with the murder of Tyler Barrol but is exonerated, due to Conrad arranging a cover-up. After Conrad tells Daniel the real story of David Clarke, Daniel chooses to stand by his father and take over the company, rather than expose the truth. During season 1, Daniel is thrice led to accuse Emily of cheating on him with Jack Porter (despite not being true). On the third occasion, which occurs at the season finale, Emily – who is disgusted by Daniel's choice of standing by his father – terminates the engagement.
