RNA is a very similar molecule to DNA, and only has two chemical differences. The overall structure of RNA and DNA are immensely similarâ€”one strand of DNA and one of RNA can bind to form a double helical structure. This makes the storage of information in RNA possible in a very similar way to the storage of information in DNA. However, RNA is less stable.
