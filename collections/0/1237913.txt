In the Stitch! anime series, HÃ¤msterviel is seen out of prison with Gantu and Reuben working for him again and now goes out in open more often to fight against Stitch and his new friend Yuna. He also inexplicably has a number of experiments in his possession, despite them having previously been reformed in the first series, and often sends them out to fight for him. In the third season, ~Best Friends Forever~, he partners with Delia, an alien woman introduced in that season. At the end of the season, he, Gantu, Reuben, and Delia all get arrested by the Grand Councilwoman.
