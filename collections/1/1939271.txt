The detection of a surge in release of luteinizing hormone indicates impending ovulation. LH can be detected by urinary ovulation predictor kits (OPK, also LH-kit) that are performed, typically daily, around the time ovulation may be expected.[18]  A conversion from a negative to a positive reading would suggest that ovulation is about to occur within 24â€“48 hours, giving women two days to engage in sexual intercourse or artificial insemination with the intention of conceiving.[19]
