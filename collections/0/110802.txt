Ted meets a new girlfriend who turns out to be just slightly younger than 21 (and also a leather cuff salesperson who convinced him to buy a leather cuff), so the gang is unable to meet her in person at MacLaren's. While he finds her really attractive, their age difference means he has trouble connecting with her. When he is about to give up and end things with her, Barney convinces him to give it a shot, which will allow Barney to live vicariously through Ted now that Barney is engaged to Robin. Ted finally gives in when he realizes she likes Star Wars. After they sleep together, however, Barney finds out that she is actually Carly, his half-sister. Barney attempts to marry Ted and Carly, and mentions that he finds the idea of a one-night stand "cheap, meaningless (and) disgusting". Both Ted and Barney then realise that Barney is done with his detox from one-night stands.
