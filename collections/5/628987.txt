On July 1, the JMA upgraded a low-pressure area it had been monitoring to a tropical depression, located south-southwest of Okinotorishima.[28] Later that day, the JMA began issuing advisories once the depression's sustained winds were estimated at 55 km/h (35 mph).[29] Shortly thereafter, the PAGASA classified the system as a tropical depression, assigning the local name Emong. On July 2, the JMA classified the system as a tropical storm, and assigned the official name Nanmadol.[28] The JTWC followed suit and gave the internal designation of 05W. The cyclone continued to intensify, and was upgraded by the JMA to a severe tropical storm later that day.[28] Nanmadol reached peak intensity at about 06:00 UTC on July 3,[28] and maintained this strength until making landfall on the western coast of Kyushu several hours later. The cyclone began to accelerate while following a generally eastward course across the south of Japan. After brushing the southern coast of Japan, the JTWC issued its final advisory during the next day. The JMA followed suit late on July 4, when it had become extratropical.[28] Its remnants moved out of the basin three days later.[28]
