On December 8, 2008, after a 23-point loss to the Los Angeles Clippers that dropped the team to 4â€“15, the Timberwolves fired head coach Wittman and McHale took over. McHale also relinquished his vice president of basketball operations duties. It was unclear whether McHale's future with the team was dependent on the success or progress of the team which he had put together over the previous four years.
