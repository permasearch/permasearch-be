The Promise Pie is the main villain in "Pie Contest". He first appears inside a garbage can and lies to Mordecai and Rigby when they ask him to help judge the contest without hurting anyone's feelings (although Mordecai at first refuses his help, as he didn't trust him earlier), but he actually intended on eating everybody instead, making him grew to a gargantuan size and claiming that he was lowering the competition to make judging simpler for them. This forces the duo to tell the truth to everyone, shrinking him down to size. Mordecai ended up smashing him against a garbage truck, killing him for good.
