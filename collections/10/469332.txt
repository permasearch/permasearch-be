Marvel Comics also adapted the film as the first six issues of its licensed Star Wars comic book, with the first issue sold in April 1977. Roy Thomas was the writer and Howard Chaykin was the artist of the adaptation. Like the novelization, it contained certain elements, such as the scene with Luke and Biggs, that appeared in the screenplay but not in the finished film.[75] The series was so successful that, according to Jim Shooter, it "single-handedly saved Marvel".[243] In 2013, Dark Horse Comics published a comic adaption of the original screenplay's plot.[244]
