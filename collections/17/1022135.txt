1954 marked the beginning of the Pageant of Peace. The pageant was the brainchild of Edward M. Kirby, public relations counsel for the National Capitol Committee of the Washington Board of Trade.[85] Kirby had flown into the District of Columbia in early December 1953, and was disappointed that the city had none of the visual impact that other major metropolises did. On December 29, 1953, Kirby submitted a memo to the Board of Trade proposing a pageant of light, music, and art.[85] The concept evolved into a three-week-long series of nightly performances and religious observances.[86][87] The Board of Trade was also interested in the idea because of waning interest in the lighting ceremony.[86] The pageant would, however, require that the Christmas tree be moved off the White House grounds and that the tree lighting ceremony be moved from Christmas Eve to earlier in December.[86] President Dwight Eisenhower approved the plan on November 4.[88]
