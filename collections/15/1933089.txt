Infection with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) or carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae is emerging as an important challenge in health-care settings.[13] One of many CREs is carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP). Over the past 10 years, a progressive increase in CRKP has been seen worldwide; however, this new emerging nosocomial pathogen is probably best known for an outbreak in Israel that began around 2006 within the healthcare system there.[14] In the USA, it was first described in North Carolina in 1996;[15] since then CRKP has been identified in 41 states;[16] and is recovered routinely in certain hospitals in New York and New Jersey. It is now the most common CRE species encountered within the United States.
