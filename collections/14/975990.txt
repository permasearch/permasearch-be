Sutton was captured and recommitted in June of 1931, charged with assault and robbery. He failed to complete his 30-year sentence however, escaping on December 11, 1932, using a smuggled gun and holding a prison guard hostage. With the guard as leverage, Sutton acquired a 45-ft (13.5 meter) ladder to scale the 30-ft (9 meter) wall of the prison grounds.[citation needed]
