In his review for the Movie Fan Central website, Mrs. Data gave the film 6.5 out of 10 stars, calling it a "cute and sweet TV movie".[3] Data wrote that Witt was "really adorable and real as the female lead" and that she had good chemistry with Wiebe.[3] Data also noted that while Weibe's on-screen family felt like a "genuine group", most of the other characters come across "very perfect", that they "only exist in movies".[3]
