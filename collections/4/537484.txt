SCAD's efforts to work with the city of Savannah to preserve its architectural heritage[8] include restoring buildings for use as college facilities, for which it has been recognized by the American Institute of Architects, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the Historic Savannah Foundation and the Victorian Society of America.[9] The college campus includes 67 buildings throughout the grid-and-park system of downtown Savannah. Many buildings are on the famous 21 squares of the old town,[10] which are laden with monuments, live oaks and a Southern-Gothic feel.
