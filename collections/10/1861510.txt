Michael Barrett was born in 1841.[2] At the age of 27 he joined the Fenians, which, in the 1860s, was a political movement that dominated Irish politics and defied the Catholic Church and middle-class nationalists who advocated milder approaches. Tens of thousands of Irishmen in both Ireland and Great Britain were recruited into its ranks.[citation needed]
