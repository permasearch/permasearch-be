As president, Roosevelt was hit from both the right and the left. He came under attack for his supposed anti-business policies, for being a "warmonger", for being a "Fascist" and for being too friendly to Joseph Stalin. Long after his death, new lines of attack criticized his policies regarding helping the Jews of Europe,[300] incarcerating the Japanese on the West Coast,[301] and opposing anti-lynching legislation.[302]
