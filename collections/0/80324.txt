The Parlement de Bretagne (Administrative and judicial centre of Brittany, Breton: BreujoÃ¹ Breizh) is the most famous 17th century building in Rennes. It was rebuilt after a terrible fire in 1994 that may have been caused by a flare fired by a protester during a demonstration. It houses the Rennes Court of Appeal. The plaza around is built on the classical architecture.
