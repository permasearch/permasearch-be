Special short codes are used to control various supplementary services offered by digital local exchanges. These services were first introduced as 'PhonePlus' in 1981 on the first generation of Alcatel E10 and Ericsson AXE digital exchanges used in Ireland and were rolled out nationally throughout the 1980s.  These services are available on all Irish PSTN lines, regardless of operator. There is a more expansive range of services available, but these are the most commonly used. Different codes apply on cable telephony lines, such as those provided by Virgin Media Ireland and on  VoIP providers.
