The issue of the radius of the electron is a challenging problem of the modern theoretical physics. The admission of the hypothesis of a finite radius of the electron is incompatible to the premises of the theory of relativity. On the other hand, a point-like electron (zero radius) generates serious mathematical difficulties due to the self-energy of the electron tending to infinity.[77] Observation of a single electron in a Penning trap suggests the upper limit of the particle's radius to be 10−22 meters.[78]  The upper bound of the electron radius of 10−18 meters[79] can be derived using the uncertainty relation in energy. There is also a physical constant called the "classical electron radius", with the much larger value of 6985281789999999999♠2.8179×10−15 m, greater than the radius of the proton. However, the terminology comes from a simplistic calculation that ignores the effects of quantum mechanics; in reality, the so-called classical electron radius has little to do with the true fundamental structure of the electron.[80][note 5]
