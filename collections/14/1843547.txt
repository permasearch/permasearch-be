In the budget of fiscal year 2017 - 18 the government of India has decided to set aside Rs. 17,000 crore, the highest ever allocation to this sector, in order to boost the Skill India Mission.  At least ten million Indian youth enter the countryâ€™s workforce each year, but the employment creation in India has not been able to absorb this influx, making increasing unemployment a severe problem. Through this allocation the government aims at generating employment and providing livelihood to the millions of young Indians who enter the work force every year.
