Carnival Triumph is the second of the five member Destiny-class of cruise ships. As she and her three younger sisters are each a modified version of the lead ship in the class, she is sometimes referred to as the first of the Triumph-class of cruise ships. Along with her sisters Carnival Sunshine and Carnival Victory, she is operated by Carnival Cruise Line. Carnival Triumph is home ported in New Orleans as of April 2016, joining Carnival Dream and replacing Carnival Elation.
