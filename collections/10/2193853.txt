In 2004, Eminem's fifth studio album Encore became the rapper's third consecutive studio album to reach number one in the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and United Kingdom. Sales, however, were significantly less than the two previous studio albums, with over five million sold copies in the United States[19] and eleven million worldwide.[20] Much success for Encore's singles came from the United Kingdom, where "Just Lose It" and "Like Toy Soldiers" went on to top the UK Singles Chart and two other songs, "Mockingbird" and "Ass Like That" reached position number four. Eminem released a greatest hits album Curtain Call: The Hits in 2005, which sold almost three million copies in the US[19] and received a double platinum certification from RIAA. The following year, Shady Records released Eminem Presents: The Re-Up, a compilation album performed by Eminem along various artists from the record label. The album received a platinum certification from the RIAA in 2007 and sold slightly over a million copies in the United States.[16]
