Historically, the term eugenics has referred to everything from prenatal care for mothers to forced sterilization and euthanasia.[71] To population geneticists, the term has included the avoidance of inbreeding without altering allele frequencies; for example, J. B. S. Haldane wrote that "the motor bus, by breaking up inbred village communities, was a powerful eugenic agent."[72] Debate as to what exactly counts as eugenics continues today.[73]
