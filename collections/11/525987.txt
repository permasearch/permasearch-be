From January 2006, a multinational ISAF contingent started to replace U.S. troops in southern Afghanistan. The British 16 Air Assault Brigade (later reinforced by Royal Marines) formed the core of the force, along with troops and helicopters from Australia, Canada and the Netherlands. The initial force consisted of roughly 3,300 British,[153] 2,300 Canadian,[154] 1,963 Dutch, 300 Australian,[155] 290 Danish[156] and 150 Estonian troops.[157] Air support was provided by U.S., British, Dutch, Norwegian and French combat aircraft and helicopters.
