The traditions and rituals of Freemasonry contributed more to the basic structure of the OA ritual than any other organization. In fact, there appears to be no known fraternal organization more faithful in form to Freemasonry than the OA. Familiar terms such as "lodge" and "obligation" were borrowed from Masonic practice, as were most of the ceremonial structures and ritual formulae. Even the early national meeting was called a "Grand Lodge," a Masonic reference.[18][19][20][14][15] Of course, despite several facts—the common intent to impart a sense of obligation to a higher moral authority; that groups such as OA that employ these rituals share many of the moral precepts; and even that there are historical connections to the founders of OA and other organizations to Freemasonry—nothing should imply any political connection to Freemasonry itself.
