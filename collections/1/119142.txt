Kublai readied the move of the Mongol capital from Karakorum in Mongolia to Khanbaliq in 1264,[62] constructing a new city near the former Jurchen capital Zhongdu, now modern Beijing, in 1266.[63] In 1271, Kublai formally claimed the Mandate of Heaven and declared that 1272 was the first year of the Great Yuan (Chinese: 大元) in the style of a traditional Chinese dynasty.[64] The name of the dynasty originated from the I Ching and describes the "origin of the universe" or a "primal force".[65] Kublai proclaimed Khanbaliq the "Great Capital" or Daidu (Dadu, Chinese: 大都 in Chinese) of the dynasty.[66] The era name was changed to Zhiyuan to herald a new era of Chinese history.[67] The adoption of a dynastic name legitimized Mongol rule by integrating the government into the narrative of traditional Chinese political succession.[68] Khublai evoked his public image as a sage emperor by following the rituals of Confucian propriety and ancestor veneration,[69] while simultaneously retaining his roots as a leader from the steppes.[68]
