Support Your Local Sheriff! was the first producing effort by Garner and his  Cherokee production company, completed on a "shoestring" budget of $750,000.[2] Early in pre-production, Paramount Pictures threatened a lawsuit as the studio contended that the first scene was "lifted" from their musical Paint Your Wagon (1969) where a similar gold mine discovery is featured. Eventually, Garner was able to show where the original screenplay had found its source material, and the lawsuit went away. [3]
