Toepick is a yellow-skinned ogre-like alien who wears a metal cage as a helmet to conceal his horrific face which induces fear in any who see it, even himself as his own species cannot look at each other for that reason. The Omnitrix symbol is on the bottom of the collar his cage is on, which is connected by chains to a pair of black briefs.
