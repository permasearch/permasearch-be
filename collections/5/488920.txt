Over subsequent centuries the Moorish art was further damaged, and in 1812 some of the towers were destroyed by the French under Count Sebastiani.[4] In 1821, an earthquake caused further damage. Restoration work was undertaken in 1828 by the architect JosÃ© Contreras, endowed in 1830 by Ferdinand VII. After the death of Contreras in 1847, it was continued with fair success by his son Rafael (died 1890) and his grandson.[4]
