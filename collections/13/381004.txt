Given an arbitrary angle θ, let us rotate the positive half of the x-axis by this angle around the center O of the unit circle, which is also the origin of the coordinates. If     θ > 0 ,   {\displaystyle \theta >0,}   the half-axis is rotated counterclockwise, and if     θ < 0 ,   {\displaystyle \theta <0,}   it is rotated clockwise. The rotated half-axis intersects the unit circle, the line x = 1, and the line y = 1 at points A, B and C respectively (see the figure). The trigonometric functions cos(θ) and sin(θ) are defined, respectively, as the x- and y-coordinates of point A.[8] When     0 ≤ θ ≤ π  /  2 ,   {\displaystyle 0\leq \theta \leq \pi /2,}   this definition is the same as the right-angled triangle definition, as one can see by considering the right-angled triangles having OA as hypotenuse. Since the equation of the unit circle is      x  2   +  y  2   = 1 ,   {\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}=1,}   this definition of cosine and sine justifies the Pythagorean identity, which is written as
