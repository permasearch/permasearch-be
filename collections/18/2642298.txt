The project was officially announced in May 2006[6] and was originally set to take place in the era of Warcraft: Orcs and Humans. This setting, however, was later dropped, with Blizzard feeling that it would be too similar to The Lord of the Rings.[13] Initially scheduled for a 2009 release, the film was later delayed to 2011.[14] However, by Comicon 2011, the film was announced to still be in the "Treatment stage".[15]
