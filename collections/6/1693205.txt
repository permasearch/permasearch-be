In terms of how biomass is used as fuel, percentages were gathered in the United States of 2016. 5% is considered primary energy in the U.S. Making up that 5% of primary energy, about 48% comes from biofuels (mostly ethanol), 41% from wood based biomass, and around 11% from municipal waste.[4] Historically, humans have harnessed biomass-derived energy since the time when people began burning wood to make fire.[5] Even in 2018, biomass is the only source of fuel for domestic use in many developing countries. Biomass is all biologically-produced matter based in carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. The estimated biomass production in the world is 104.9 petagrams (104.9 × 1015 g – about 105 billion metric tons) of carbon per year, about half in the ocean and half on land.[6] Wood remains the largest biomass energy source today;[5] examples include forest residues (such as dead trees, branches and tree stumps), yard clippings, wood chips and even municipal solid waste. Wood energy is derived by using lignocellulosic biomass (second-generation biofuels) as fuel. Harvested wood may be used directly as a fuel or collected from wood waste streams to be processed into pellet fuel or other forms of fuels.
