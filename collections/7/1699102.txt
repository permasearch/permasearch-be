Prince Albert, Duke of York, and Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon were married on 26 April 1923 in Westminster Abbey. In an unexpected and unprecedented gesture,[8] Elizabeth laid her bouquet at the Tomb of The Unknown Warrior on her way into the Abbey,[9] in memory of her brother Fergus.[10] Ever since, the bouquets of subsequent royal brides have traditionally been laid at the tomb, though after the wedding ceremony rather than before.
