Alison DiLaurentis is a fictional character on Freeform's Pretty Little Liars, a television series which is based on a book series of the same name written by American author Sara Shepard. In the beginning of both the books and the television series, Alison is a central character who is shown mostly in flashbacks.[1] The narrative is set when Alison mysteriously disappears and leaves the suburb of Rosewood shocked. Due to her position as a queen bee of Rosewood's social scene, Alison's actions and relations were constantly under scrutiny from the town's citizens. Sasha Pieterse, who portrays Alison on screen, has described the character as an indecisive person, showing herself as a ruthless, manipulative girl.[2] Due to the massive reformulation on the story's timing, pacing and overall narrative for the television adaptation, the on-screen Alison DiLaurentis holds various differences from her literary counterpart, such as the fact that the latter has a identical twin sister, while the former does not.
