In 1814, two British warships, HMS Briton and HMS Tagus, chanced upon Pitcairn. Among those who greeted them were Thursday October Christian and George Young (Edward Young's son)[193]. The captains, Sir Thomas Staines and Philip Pipon, reported that Christian's son displayed "in his benevolent countenance, all the features of an honest English face".[194] On shore they found a population of 46Â mainly young islanders led by Adams,[194] upon whom the islanders' welfare was wholly dependent, according to the captains' report.[195] After receiving Staines's and Pipon's report, the Admiralty decided to take no action.
