This build brings further UX improvements and refinements, updates to Cortana and its integration with apps and services. This build also includes app updates, including updates to the photos app and the Snipping Tool app that allows the capture of screenshot after a user defined timer. Starting with this build, the Insider Hub app is no longer installed by default but can be reinstalled from the Settings app. The legacy Windows Photo viewer app no longer has various picture format associations in the registry in favor of the Photos app.[61]
