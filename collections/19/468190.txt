Early settlements included the Scythians in the 9th century BC.[38] Following the Scythians, Iranian Medes came to dominate the area to the south of the Aras.[36] The Medes forged a vast empire between 900–700 BC, which was integrated into the Achaemenid Empire around 550 BC.[citation needed] The area was conquered by the Achaemenids leading to the spread of Zoroastrianism.[48] Later it became part of Alexander the Great's Empire and its successor, the Seleucid Empire.[citation needed] During this period, Zoroastrianism spread in the Caucasus and Atropatene. Caucasian Albanians, the original inhabitants of northeastern Azerbaijan,[citation needed] ruled that area from around the 4th century BC, and established an independent kingdom.[citation needed]
