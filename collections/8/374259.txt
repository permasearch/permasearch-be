Perhaps his greatest feat occurred in 1895, when he was reported to have lifted 4,337 pounds (1,967Â kg) on his back in Boston by putting 18 men on a platform and lifting them.[4] One of his most memorable displays of strength occurred in Montreal on 12 October 1891. Louis resisted the pull of four draught horses (two in each hand) as grooms stood cracking their whips to get the horses to pull harder, a feat he again demonstrated in Ottawa with Queen Victoria's team of draught horses during her 'Royal' visit.[citation needed] While in Ottawa he volunteered with the police when they took deputees to round up a local gang of miscreants; they turned him away claiming he would be too slow due to his bulk. He challenged the regular officers to a foot race, beating the majority, and they took him on.[1]
