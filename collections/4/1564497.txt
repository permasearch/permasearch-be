In the 2013 New Zealand census, 7.4 percent of the New Zealand population identified with one or more Pacific ethnic groups, although 62.3 percent of these were born in New Zealand.[8] Those with a Samoan background make up the largest proportion, followed by Cook Islands Maori, Tongan, and Niuean.[8] Some smaller island populations such as Niue and Tokelau have the majority of their nationals living in New Zealand.[9]
