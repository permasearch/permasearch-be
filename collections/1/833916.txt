Germany scored the most with a total of 16 goals in the 2010 World Cup, in comparison, the winning nation Spain scored only 8 goals.[101] The German team became the first team since Brazil in 1982 to record the highest goal difference in a World Cup without winning it. In an internet poll, Germany was voted the World Cups Most Entertaining Team, although FIFA discontinued the official award. German youngster Thomas MÃ¼ller won the Golden Boot with the most goals and assists scored (succeeding teammate Miroslav Klose),[102] and he was also given the Best Young Player Award (succeeding teammate Lukas Podolski).[103]
