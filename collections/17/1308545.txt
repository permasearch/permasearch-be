Despite the success Los Angeles had as a host city, the games were boycotted by fourteen Eastern Bloc countries, including the Soviet Union. Romania and Yugoslavia however, did not take part in the boycott and competed at the 1984 Summer Olympics. The United States and many other NATO nations had boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow four years earlier.
