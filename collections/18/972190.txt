Chromates react with hydrogen peroxide giving products in which peroxide, O2âˆ’2, replaces one or more oxygen atoms. In acid solution the unstable blue peroxo complex Chromium(VI) oxide peroxide, CrO(O2)2, is formed; it is an uncharged covalent molecule which may be extracted into ether. Addition of pyridine results in the formation of the more stable complex CrO(O2)2py.[1]
