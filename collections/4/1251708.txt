The Whigs became champions of Parliamentary reform. They made Lord Grey prime minister 1830â€“1834, and the Reform Act 1832 became their signature measure. It broadened the franchise slightly and ended the system of rotten and pocket boroughs (where elections were controlled by powerful families), and gave seats to new industrial centres. The aristocracy continued to dominate the government, the Army and Royal Navy, and high society.[51] After parliamentary investigations demonstrated the horrors of child labour, limited reforms were passed in 1833.
