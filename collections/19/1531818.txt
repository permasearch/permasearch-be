From 1901 the fence was constructed by private contractors, but in 1904 the project became the responsibility of the Public Works Department of Western Australia, under the supervision of Richard John Anketell.[3] With a workforce of 120 men, 350 camels, 210 horses and 41 donkeys, Anketell was responsible for the construction of the greater part of No. 1 Fence and the survey of its last 70 miles.[4]
