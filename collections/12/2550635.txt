Four Arms is a Tetramand from the desert planet Khoros. Tetramands are 12-foot-tall powerhouses with extremely dense musculature, making them unmatched in pure physical strength (although the females are substantially stronger than the males). However, the muscle mass and heavy skin makes Tetramands relatively slow and unable to use things normally used by smaller life forms.
