The ancient Egyptians had a deep conviction of an underlying holiness and unity within the universe. Cosmic harmony was achieved by correct public and ritual life. Any disturbance in cosmic harmony could have consequences for the individual as well as the state. An impious King could bring about famine, and blasphemy could bring blindness to an individual.[9] In opposition to the right order expressed in the concept of Maat is the concept of Isfet: chaos, lies and violence.[10]
