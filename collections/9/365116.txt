Fluoride came into use to prevent tooth decay in the 1940s.[6] Fluoride, as sodium fluoride, is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system.[7] In the United Kingdom a typical month supply costs the NHS about 0.36 pounds.[4] It is also not very expensive in the United States.[8]
