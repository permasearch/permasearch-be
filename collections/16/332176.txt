While driving to Summer Bay to reunite with their sister Tori Morgan (Penny McNamee), Justin and his brothers, Brody (Heywood) and Mason (Pledger), almost crash into Martin Ashford's (George Mason) car. Justin tries to fight Ash, but Brody tells him to move on. Tori introduces her brothers to Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher). Justin goes to Summer Bay Auto to enquire about a job, but leaves when he finds out that Ash is the owner. Justin meets Phoebe Nicholson (Isabella Giovinazzo) at the beach and they have a one-night stand. Tori gets Justin a job with Alf on his boat. When Alf suffers a heart attack, Justin swims to the shore to get help. When Mason's girlfriend, Lara Adams (Elle Harris) arrives in town, Justin warns her to stay away from Mason. He also tells Mason to end the relationship. Justin becomes the temporary manager of Alf's bait shop, while Alf recovers. Mason tells his sibling that he told Lara that they are in witness protection. Spike Lowe (Jason Montgomery) takes Tori hostage and threatens to hurt her if Justin refuses to give him a book, but Justin and Tori do not know what he is talking about. They fight back and Spike leaves. With their cover exposed, the Morgans are temporarily relocated by the police. They are taken hostage by Spike and Blaine Varden (Ashley Lyons), after Mason tells Lara where they are. Blaine tells Brody, Mason and Tori that their mother sacrificed herself for Justin, and that he knew all along who killed their parents. The police, led by the family's protection officer Decker (John Adam), turn up and arrest Blaine and Lara. Brody is taken the hospital after suffering a head injury. Tori and Mason ask Justin to leave the house, so he moves in with Phoebe.
