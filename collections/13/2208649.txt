Scott attended Gonzaga College, a private Jesuit Catholic school for boys on the south side of Dublin. He took Saturday classes at a drama school for children, and appeared in two ads on Irish television. At seventeen, he was chosen for a starring role in his first film, Korea. Scott won a bursary to art school, but elected to study drama at Trinity College, Dublin, leaving after six months to join Dublin's Abbey Theatre.[2][4] He once stated to the London Evening Standard magazine that he always had a "healthy obsession" with acting.
