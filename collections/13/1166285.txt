The Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) is a South African HIV/AIDS activist organisation which was co-founded by the HIV-positive activist Zackie Achmat in 1998.[1] TAC is rooted in the experiences, direct action tactics and anti-apartheid background of its founder.[1] TAC has been credited with forcing the reluctant government of former South African President Thabo Mbeki to begin making antiretroviral drugs available to South Africans.[2] TAC is aligned to but often critical of the ruling African National Congress.[3]
