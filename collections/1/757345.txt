However while the Mavericks were upset in the first round by the eight-seed Golden State Warriors, the 61-21 Suns would handily defeat Kobe Bryant and the Lakers in five games in the opening round of the playoffs. This set up a rematch of the 2005 Western Conference Finals against the San Antonio Spurs. The series saw the Spurs defeat the Suns in six games, in what many called "the real finals" of the 2006â€“07 season.[20] The Spurs went on to win the championship that year.
