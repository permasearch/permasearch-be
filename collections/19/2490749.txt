Romanian cuisine is a diverse blend of different dishes from several traditions with which it has come into contact, but it also maintains its own character. It has been significantly influenced by the Ottoman Empire, yet it also includes culinary elements stemming from the cuisines of other fellow Balkan neighbor countries, especially Serbian and Bulgarian as well as Ukrainian.
