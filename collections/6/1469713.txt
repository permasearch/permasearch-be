Time Warner Center is a mixed use (office/commercial and residential) twin-tower building[2][3] in New York City. Developed by The Related Companies and AREA Property Partners (formerly known as Apollo Real Estate Advisors), its design by David Childs and Mustafa Kemal Abadan of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill,[4] consists of two 750 feet (230 m) twin towers bridged by a multi-story atrium containing upscale retail shops. Construction began in November 2000, following the demolition of the New York Coliseum, and a topping-out ceremony was held on February 27, 2003. The property had the highest-listed market value in New York City, $1.1 billion, in 2006.[5] Originally constructed as the AOL Time Warner Center, the building encircles the western side of Columbus Circle and straddles the border between Midtown and the Upper West Side. The total floor area of 2.8 million square feet (260,000 m2) is occupied by office space (notably the offices of Time Warner and an R&D Center for VMware), residential condominiums, and the Mandarin Oriental, New York hotel. The Shops at Columbus Circle is an upscale shopping mall located in a curving arcade at the base of the building, with a large Whole Foods Market grocery store on the lower level.
