In Canada,[9] anatomical pathology is a five-year residency. Residents who wish to become forensic pathologists must then complete a one-year fellowship in forensic pathology. Forensic pathology is a sub-specialty by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons. Three schools that have training programs are the University of Toronto, University of Alberta, and Mcmaster University.
