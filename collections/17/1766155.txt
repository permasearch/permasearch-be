Following his placement, representatives debated whether he should take the oath. Representative James Madison stated "The proper definition of Mr. White is to be found in the Laws and Rules of the Constitution. He is not a member of Congress, therefore, and so cannot be directed to take an oath, unless he chooses to do it voluntarily."[11] As he was not a Member, he was not directed to take the oath, though every delegate after him has done so.[5] He was also extended franking privileges, which allowed him to send official mail free of charge, and compensation at the same rate as members.[5]
