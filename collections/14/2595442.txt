There are several reports on accidents with a monster truck, resulting in more than twenty deaths and several hundreds of wounded people. On January 16, 2009, at a Monster Jam event in Tacoma, Washington a 6-year-old spectator was killed when struck by flying debris from the truck Natural High.[2] In 2009 at the Monster Jam World Finals, the truck Captain's Curse lost its brakes during the run. Alex Blackwell, driver at the time, realized he had no brakes, and steered it. This was an attempt to roll the truck over rather than crashing into the seats head-on. The truck eventually landed several rows in the stands of Sam Boyd Stadium, although no one was injured. In 2009, the monster truck named Samson was involved in an accident that caused the death of announcer George Eisenhart after he accidentally stepped in front of Samson while it was moving.[3]
