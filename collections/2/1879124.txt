Islamic exegesis affirms the virginal birth of Jesus similarly to the Gospel account and occurring in Bethlehem.[19] The narrative of the virgin birth is an announcement to Mary by the angel Gabriel while Mary is being raised in the Temple after having been pledged to God by her mother. Gabriel states she is honored over all women of all nations and has brought her glad tidings of a holy son.[20]
