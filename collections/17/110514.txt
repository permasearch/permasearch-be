Since independence, the country has struggled to maintain unity against local insurgencies and separatist movements.[136] Some, notably in Aceh and Papua, have led to an armed conflict, and subsequent allegations of human rights abuses and brutality from all sides.[137][138] The former was resolved peacefully in 2005,[73] while the latter still continues, amid a significant, albeit imperfect, implementation of regional autonomy laws, and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses, since the presidency of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.[139] Other engagements of the army include the campaign against the Netherlands New Guinea to incorporate the territory into Indonesia, the Konfrontasi to oppose the creation of Malaysia, the mass killings against the PKI, and the invasion of East Timor, which was–and remains–Indonesia's largest military operation.[140][141]
