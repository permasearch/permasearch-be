There were two attempts to make a U.S. version of Jonathan Creek. The first involved Castle Rock, the production company behind series such as Seinfeld, but the initial scripts were not felt to be good enough, and David Renwick's scripts were rejected by CBS.[15] The second attempt, also by Renwick, was for Whoopi Goldberg and would have included Alan Davies.[15]
