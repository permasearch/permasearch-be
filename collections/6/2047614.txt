With Unicron's destruction in Energon, the collapse of his body results in the creation of an enormous black hole which, if left unchecked, will consume and destroy everything. The Autobots must find the Omega Lock and the Cyber Planet Keys to save Cybertron and the universe. Later, the Cybertron Transformers learn from Primus that destroying Unicron results in an imbalance between good (Primus, who still exists) and evil (Unicron, who is gone); this imbalance factored into the creation of the black hole, known as the Unicron Singularity in American fiction or the Grand Black Hole in Japan. His scattered pieces are absorbed by Megatron giving Megatron dark powers and causing him to look like Unicron.
