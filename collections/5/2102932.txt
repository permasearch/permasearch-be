While DBMS vendors debate the relative merits of their favored designs, some companies and researchers question the inherent limitations of relational database management systems. GigaSpaces, for example, contends that an entirely different model of distributed data access and transaction processing, space-based architecture, is required to achieve the highest performance and scalability. On the other hand, Base One makes the case for extreme scalability without departing from mainstream relational database technology.[7] For specialized applications, NoSQL architectures such as Google's Bigtable can further enhance scalability. Google's horizontally distributed Spanner technology, positioned as an relational alternative to Bigtable[8], supports general-purpose database transactions and provides a more conventional SQL-based query language.[9]
