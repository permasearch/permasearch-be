The difference between the earlier definition for the big-O notation and the present definition of little-o, is that while the former has to be true for at least one constant M, the latter must hold for every positive constant ε, however small.[5] In this way, little-o notation makes a stronger statement than the corresponding big-O notation: every function that is little-o of g is also big-O of g, but not every function that is big-O of g is also little-o of g. For example,     2  x  2   = O (  x  2   )   {\displaystyle 2x^{2}=O(x^{2})}   but     2  x  2   ≠ o (  x  2   ) .   {\displaystyle 2x^{2}\neq o(x^{2}).}
