Children with spina bifida are more likely than their peers without spina bifida to be dyscalculic.[44] Individuals with spina bifida have demonstrated stable difficulties with arithmetic accuracy and speed, mathematical problem-solving, and general use and understanding of numbers in everyday life.[45] Mathematics difficulties may be directly related to the thinning of the parietal lobes (regions implicated in mathematical functioning) and indirectly associated with deformities of the cerebellum and midbrain that affect other functions involved in mathematical skills. Further, higher numbers of shunt revisions are associated with poorer mathematics abilities.[46] Working memory and inhibitory control deficiencies have been implicated for math difficulties,[47] although visual-spatial difficulties are not likely involved.[44] Early intervention to address mathematics difficulties and associated executive functions is crucial.[47]
