Still under contract with ABC, Wolf returned to local sportscasting with a job at WABC-TV in New York in 1976, and then in 1980 moved to rival station WCBS-TV.  His move to WCBS-TV resulted in a lawsuit, American Broadcasting Co. v. Wolf, in which ABC alleged that Wolf failed to negotiate in good faith and sought specific performance of their contract which would have kept Wolf off the air for two years.  The New York Court of Appeals rejected ABC's argument, although they permitted ABC to seek relief in the form of monetary damages.  He also broadcast live sports reports for Israeli television during the 1991 Gulf War.
