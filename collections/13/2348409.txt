Home Evening groups are often formed to allow both the young single adults and single adults to conduct activities similar to those practiced in Family Home Evening. Although there may be Home Evening groups wherever there are LDS wards, they are more prominent in LDS singles wards. The groups are sometimes led by a young man and a young woman, often jokingly referred to as the Home Evening group "mom" and "dad."[citation needed]
