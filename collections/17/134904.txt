During the Philadelphia campaign, Howe failed to pursue and destroy the defeated Americans on two occasions; once after the Battle of Brandywine,[186][187] and again after the Battle of Germantown.[190] At the Battle of White Marsh, Howe failed to even attempt to exploit the vulnerable American rear,[192] and then inexplicably ordered a retreat to Philadelphia after only minor skirmishes, astonishing both sides.[191] While the Americans wintered only twenty miles away, Howe made no effort to attack their camp, which critics argue could have ended the war.[194][195][196] Following the conclusion of the campaign, Howe resigned his commission, and was replaced by Henry Clinton on May 24, 1778.[198]
