Religion in Japan is dominated by Shinto (the ethnic religion of the Japanese people) and by Buddhism. According to surveys carried out in 2006[1] and 2008,[2] less than 40% of the population of Japan identifies with an organised religion: around 35% are Buddhists, 3% to 4% are members of Shinto sects and derived religions, and from fewer than 1%[3][4][5] to 2.3% are Christians.[note 2] In 2009, an official survey showed that over half the Japanese families had a "butsudan" or Buddhist altar in their homes. A 2009 data from the Agency of Cultural Affairs stated that there were 89 million Buddhists in Japan.[6] In 2011, it was reported that 90% of the Japanese identified as Buddhist or Shinto or a combination of both.[7]
