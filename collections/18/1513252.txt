In other words,     2    3 4      {\displaystyle 2{\tfrac {3}{4}}}   is the same as        8 4    +    3 4      {\displaystyle {\tfrac {8}{4}}+{\tfrac {3}{4}}}  , making 11 quarters in total (because 2 cakes, each split into quarters makes 8 quarters total) and 33 quarters is     8    1 4      {\displaystyle 8{\tfrac {1}{4}}}  , since 8 cakes, each made of quarters, is 32 quarters in total.
