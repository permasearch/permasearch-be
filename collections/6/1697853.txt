Although some scholars took note of, and reproduced, Shakespeare’s handwriting as early as the 18th century,[13] the paleographer Sir Edward Maunde Thompson wrote in 1916 that the subject of Shakespeare’s handwriting had “never been subjected to a thorough and systematic study.” One reason for this neglect is that the only examples of Shakespeare’s handwriting that were known to earlier scholars were five authentic signatures.[16] A further difficulty was that three of the known signatures were written in the last weeks of Shakespeare’s life, when he may have been suffering from a tremor or otherwise enfeebled by illness, and the other two had been written under conditions that restrained free movement of the hand. Those signed to the Blackfrairs mortgage had to be squeezed into the narrow space of the seal.[17]
