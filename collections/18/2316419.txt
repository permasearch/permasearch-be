At a ruck early in the match, Mealamu and Umaga each attempted to clear O'Driscoll from the ruck. The two All-Black players each lifted one of O'Driscoll's legs before driving him towards the ground; O'Driscoll's shoulder was dislocated upon landing. While O'Driscoll was being lifted, the touch judge was heard telling Mealamu and Umaga to let O'Driscoll go, but he took no further action regarding the incident. Opinions differed on the incident. Many British and Irish commentators and fans claimed that it was an illegal "spear tackle" and Lions coach Clive Woodward reported the pair to the IRB-appointed citing commissioner, William Venter, who decided, on the basis of the video footage available to him at the time, not to refer the matter to a disciplinary tribunal. New Zealand commentators and fans were largely of the view that the two All Blacks were merely clearing out the ruck and that there had been no intention to injure O'Driscoll. However, four months later, and following new footage of the incident,[2] the International Rugby Board unequivocally condemned Umaga and Mealamu's actions. IRB spokesman Greg Thomas said: "This footage wasn't available at the time and the IRB are unable to act retrospectively because the two sides had both signed a tour agreement whereby disciplinary matters had to be resolved within 12 hours of the match. But we have subsequently been able to view the video and we are determined that such tackles are removed from the game. They're totally unacceptable and have absolutely no place in rugby." [3]
