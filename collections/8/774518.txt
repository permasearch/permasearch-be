Wanting a well-known actor to play the role, Lear had approached Jackie Gleason and Mickey Rooney to play Archie; both declined. O'Connor accepted, not expecting the show to be a success and believing he would be able to move back to Europe. In her book Archie & Edith, Mike & Gloria: the Tumultuous History of All in the Family, Donna McCrohan noted that O'Connor requested that Lear provide him with a return airplane ticket to Rome as a condition of his accepting the role, so he could return to Italy when the show failed. Instead, the show became the highest-rated television show on American television for five consecutive seasons until the 1976â€“77 season (the sixth season).
