File Explorer is a Windows component that can browse the shell namespace. In other words, it can browse disks, files and folder as a file manager would, but can also access Control Panel, dial-up network objects, and other elements introduced above. In addition, the explorer.exe executable, which is responsible for launching File Explorer, is also responsible for launching the taskbar, the Start menu and part of the desktop. However, the task switcher, the charms, or Autoplay operate even when all instances of the explorer.exe process are closed, and other computer programs can still access the shell namespace without it.
