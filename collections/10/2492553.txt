In areas with large Mexican-American populations, mariachis are being hired for events outside this ethnic group as well.[16] Outside of schools, the most important venue for the music in the United States is mariachi festivals with the longest running festivals in Tucson and Fresno.[27] The Tucson International Mariachi Conference began in 1982. It originally was held in the downtown but in 2012 moved to the Casino Del Sol. It showcases over 500 elementary, middle, and high schools and college mariachi players.[28] The Las Vegas International Mariachi Festival, established in 1991, is televised on Telemundo and PBS and has headlined artists such as Pedro Fern√°ndez, Ana Gabriel, and American born mariachi singer Pepe Aguilar and more.[29]
