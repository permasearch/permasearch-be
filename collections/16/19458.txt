Henry Doheny (Steve Tom) is a formerly famous magician who moves in with the family in the episode "The Great Doheny". Josh, Walter and Megan idolize him while Drake hates him. Doheny does magic wherever he goes, such as interfering with random people and doing magic tricks for them and even puts a sandwich inside his stomach without eating it. When Drake could no longer stand Doheny being in the house, he tried to harm him with a baseball bat but Josh decided to help him become famous again instead. Megan came up with a trick called "The Box of Impalement", which backfired due to putting Doheny in a large box and sticking swords into his body, killing him. However at the funeral Henry came back to life and regained his career and went off to Las Vegas to perform there for four years.
