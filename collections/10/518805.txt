Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan both appeared on the Australian TV series Neighbours but before they recorded the song, both left the series to concentrate on a music career. Kylie released the album Kylie, while Donovan was working on his studio album Ten Good Reasons. Both singers' production company Stock, Aitken & Waterman wrote a song for the singers so they could sing a duet on the track. The song was released as a single on 28 November 1988 but later was included on the American version of Kylie Minogue's second album, Enjoy Yourself.
