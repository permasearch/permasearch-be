The beacons that are between 510 kHz and 530 kHz can sometimes be heard on AM radios that can tune below the beginning of the Medium Wave(MW) broadcast band. Frequencies close to the MW band, like 515 kHz, may be within the receive bandwidth of some AM radios. However, reception of NDBs generally requires a radio receiver that can receive frequencies below 530 kHz (the longwave band). A NDB in Miramichi, New Brunswick once operated at 530 kHz as "F9" but had later moved to 520 kHz. Most so-called "shortwave" radios also include mediumwave and longwave, and they can usually receive all frequencies from 150 kHz to 30 MHz, which makes them ideal for listening to NDBs. Whilst this type of receiver is adequate for reception of local beacons, specialized techniques (receiver preselectors, noise limiters and filters) are required for the reception of very weak signals from remote beacons.[6]
