The external expression of anger can be found in physiological responses, facial expressions, body language, and at times in public acts of aggression.[8] The rib cage tenses and breathing through the nose becomes faster, deeper, and irregular.[62] Anger activates the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis.[63] The catecholamine activation is more strongly norepinephrine than epinephrine.[10] Heart rate and blood pressure increase. Blood flows to the hands. Perspiration increases (particularly when the anger is intense).[64] The face flushes. The nostrils flare. The jaw tenses. The brow muscles move inward and downward, fixing a hard stare on the target. The arms are raised and a squared-off stance is adopted. The body is mobilized for immediate action, often manifesting as a subjective sense of strength, self-assurance, and potency. This may encourage the impulse to strike out.[10]
