East Orange, New Jersey-born field athlete Dorian Scott competed for Jamaica in the men's shot put. He was 26 years old at the time, and had not competed at any Olympic games prior to his performance in Beijing.[28] During the August 14 qualifying round, Scott was placed in the second heat, which included 23 athletes.[29] He was given three chances to put the shot. During his first attempt, the shot flew 19.54 meters, placing him 10th; in the second, 19.94 meters, placing him sixth; and in the third, 19.71 meters. However, since his second score was the best mark he received, the third score went unranked and the second score was used as his final score in the qualifying round.[28] Overall, Scott placed 15th out of the 40 placing athletes, falling behind the Ukraine's Andriy Semenov (20.01 meters) but displacing Australia's Justin Anlezark (19.91 meters). He did not progress to the final round on August 15.[29]
