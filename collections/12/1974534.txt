The population of the countries and regions of the United Kingdom was last measured by census in 2011.[1] and the Census organisations have produced population estimates for subsequent years by updating the census results with estimates of births, deaths and migration in each year. The census results, and the annual population estimates,[2] summarised below show that England is by far the most populous country of the United Kingdom and its population is therefore also presented by region.
