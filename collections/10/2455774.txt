In Gampaha District, Tamils have historically inhabited the coastal region. In the Puttalam District, there was a substantial ethnic Tamil population until the first two decades of the 20th century.[91][93] Most of those who identify as ethnic Tamils live in villages such as Udappu and Maradankulam.[94] The coastal strip from Jaffna to Chilaw is also known as the "Catholic belt".[95] The Tamil Christians, chiefly Roman Catholics, have preserved their heritage in the major cities such as Negombo, Chilaw, Puttalam, and also in villages such as Mampuri.[91]
