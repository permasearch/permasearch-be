As a result, colleges use wait lists as a hedge to make sure they have enough students in the fall. Some schools "under-invite" applicants in the regular admissions season to appear highly selective and then about-face and accept them from their wait lists later.[9] One report is that Vanderbilt gets a tenth of their first-year class from the wait list.[9] But it varies from college to college and from year to year. For example, in 2010 Stanford and Yale wait-listed 1,000 students while Duke wait-listed 3,000 students.[296] Overall, one survey suggested that 30% of wait-listed students are eventually accepted,[296] but this is an average figure for all wait-listed students, and the percentage is dramatically lower at elite or prestigious schools. There is a report suggesting that in recent years, the lists are more fluid than in previous years, in the sense that there is more wait list activityâ€”which have become more of a safety net for colleges rather than students.[11] Estimates vary about how many college applicants find themselves on a wait list; one report was that 10% of applicants were wait-listed.[297]
