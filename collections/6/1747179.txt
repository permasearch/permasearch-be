By the mid-18th century, the economic and administrative collapse of provinces within the Mughal Empire, from Punjab to Bengal, led to its dissolution.[22] Internal unrest resulted in multiple battles for independence and further deterioration of the region, which then led to formal colonialisation as established by the Government of India Act 1858, with direct control under the British Raj from 1858 to 1947.[23][24] In 1880, Poham Young CIE, a British colonial officer, proposed construction of a new strategic town within the area.[25] His proposal was supported by Sir James Broadwood Lyall and the city of Lyall was developed.[25] Historically, Faisalabad, (Lyallpur until 1979), became one of the first planned cities within British India.[13]
