The phrase is often considered to be sarcastic or obnoxious. The phrase was popularized by actor and comedian Martin Lawrence in his 1992 sitcom Martin.[3] The phrase is formally reported from as early as 1995, when a local Indianapolis magazine story noted "Talk to the handâ€”The phrase, which means, 'Shut up', is accompanied by a hand in front of the victim's face".[4]
