Timber was critical for the development of the shipbuilding industry. It has been stated, “For every ton of shipping a vessel held, at least one and half loads of timber were required, with a load of timber being approximately equivalent to one tree’s worth of wood.”[1] More specifically, British war vessels required two thousand trees for construction.[2] The abundance of timber and lumber made shipbuilding highly economical in the colonies. Woods like Pine, oak, maple, beech, birch, hickory, ash and cypress trees were plentiful in Colonial America.[3]
