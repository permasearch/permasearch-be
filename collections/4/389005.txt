Although they were discontinued after the devastation of the Anshi Rebellion (755â€“763) during the Tang dynasty, lavish Chinese carnivals were revived and once again celebrated during the Song dynasty.[52] Chinese carnival celebrations were held nationwide when the emperor felt a great occasion warranted a grand display of his benevolence and generosity, such as renowned military victories, abundant harvests after long droughts or famines, the granting of grand amnesties by the throne, sacrifices to deities, the installation of a crown prince, marriages within the imperial family, etc.[53]
