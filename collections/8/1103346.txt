Most of the town and the business district are centered on Big Bear Boulevard. Its limits are defined on the West by Division Road and on the east by the left turn at Highway 38, which goes to Redlands and Highway 18 which goes to downtown San Bernardino. Though its south boundary is loosely defined by the residential boundary, the north side is defined by North Shore Road. The east-west postal divider of Big Bear City is Green Way Drive. It is here that Highway 18 (Big Bear Boulevard) turns north and crosses over to North Shore Drive heading east toward Lucerne Valley, and Highway 38 coming from the east turns north to North Shore and heads west to Big Bear Dam in the city of Big Bear Lake, California.
