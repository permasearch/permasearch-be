The Council of the Royal Society can recommend members of the British Royal Family for election as Royal Fellows of the Royal Society. As of 2016[update] there are five royal fellows: Charles, Prince of Wales (1978),[27] Anne, Princess Royal (1987),[28] Prince Edward, Duke of Kent (1990),[29] Prince William, Duke of Cambridge (2009)[30] and Prince Andrew, Duke of York (2013).[31] Her Majesty the Queen, Elizabeth II is not a Royal Fellow, but provides her patronage to the Society as all reigning British monarchs have done since Charles II of England. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (1951) was elected under statute 12, not as a Royal Fellow.[32]
