The Latin word data is the plural of datum, "(thing) given," neuter past participle of dare "to give".[4] Data may be used as a plural noun in this sense, with some writers -- usually scientific writers -- in the 20th century using datum in the singular and data for plural. However, in non-specialist, everyday writing, "data" is most commonly used in the singular, as a mass noun (like "information", "sand" or "rain").[5]
