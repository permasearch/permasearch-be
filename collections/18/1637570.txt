In early 2015, Grande embarked on The Honeymoon Tour, with shows in North America, Europe, Asia and South America.[108] Following the tour's early success, more dates were added,[109] and the tour concluded in October 2015 after a total of nearly 90 dates.[110] It earned approximately $40 million and sold over 800,000 tickets.[111] Reviews of the tour performances generally praised Grande's vocals and ability to convey emotion in the songs but found the concerts to be over-produced: "[S]ome judicious editing would've elevated the evening from surprising to satisfying and possibly even shockingly good. As it is, Grande is so busy piling on the spectacle she neglects to highlight the one thing – those deceptively powerful pipes – setting her apart from her contemporaries."[112]
