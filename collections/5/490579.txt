At the end of the 2012–13 season, Moyes left his position at Everton to take over at Manchester United. He was replaced by Roberto Martínez,[28] who led Everton to 5th place in the Premier League in his first season while amassing the club's best points tally in 27 years with 72.[29] The following season, Martínez led Everton to the last 16 of the 2014-15 UEFA Europa League, where they were defeated by Dynamo Kyiv,[30] whilst domestically finishing 11th in the Premier League. Everton reached the semi-finals of both the League Cup and the FA Cup in 2015–16, but were defeated in both. After a poor run of form in the Premier League, Martínez was sacked following the penultimate game of the season, with Everton lying in 12th place.[31] He was replaced in the summer by Ronald Koeman, who left Southampton to sign a 3-year contract with Everton.[32] In his first season at the club he guided them back into the group stages of the Europa League, after finishing 7th. A disastrous start to the following season left Everton in the relegation zone after 9 games, and Koeman was sacked on 23rd October following a 5-2 home defeat to Arsenal.[33]
