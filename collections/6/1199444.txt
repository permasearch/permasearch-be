Gaston is depicted as a very narcissistic, self-centered and superficial individual, motivated by extreme jealousy.[38][21][39] Identified as the film's villain by the Orlando Sentinel's Joy Boyar,[40] Gaston is not ugly in appearance, nor does he realize that he himself is a villain until approximately midway through the film and during "The Mob Song",[7][41] a musical number he uses to convince his loyal followers to storm the Beast's castle and kill him,[42] although traces of his villainy are first hinted after he proposes to Belle.[43] Simon Brew of Den of Geek attributes Gaston's increasing villainy to "his raging jealousy and insecurity" that ultimately "transforms him into the storyâ€™s antagonist" after he finally succumbs to "circumstance[s] of his life".[21] The character's villainy peaks after he attempts to have Maurice incarcerated, although his transformation remains far from complete.[21] Further distinguishing Gaston from the villains in Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Sleeping Beauty (1959) and The Little Mermaid (1989), respectively, the character does not undergo a hideous physical transformation before he dies.[1] Mania.com's Rob Vaux observed that Gaston is "small-minded" in comparison to other Disney villains because his ideas tend to resemble those of school bullies, particularly one whose ego has been inflated "by the people around him", as opposed to "grand schemes";[32] the character has no known desire to conquer the world, lacking ambitions beyond simply marrying the woman he is attracted to.[21] The character is also void of both magical powers and political influence.[44] The Huffington Post's Lauren Duca agreed that Gaston is "more aggressively intolerable than horrifying."[45]
