Transitional phases at the onset or departure of El Ni単o or La Ni単a can also be important factors on global weather by affecting teleconnections. Significant episodes, known as Trans-Ni単o, are measured by the Trans-Ni単o index (TNI).[27] Examples of affected short-time climate in North America include precipitation in the Northwest US[28] and intense tornado activity in the contiguous US.[29]
