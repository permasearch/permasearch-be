In 1934, Sanders took over the lease of the Pure Oil filling station on the other side of the road, due to its greater visibility for motorists.[8] He then began to sell fried chicken.[9] To improve his skills, Sanders took an eight-week restaurant-management course at the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration.[10] By 1936, his business had proved successful enough for him to be given the honorary title of Kentucky colonel by Governor Ruby Laffoon.[11] In 1937, Sanders expanded his restaurant to 140 seats, and in 1940 purchased a motel across the street, the Sanders Court & Caf√©.[12]
