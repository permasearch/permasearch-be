In a 1975 New York magazine cover story, which called him "The funniest man in America", NBC executives referred to Chase as "The first real potential successor to Johnny Carson" and claimed he would begin guest-hosting The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson within six months of the article. Chase dismissed chatter that he could be the next Carson by telling New York, "I'd never be tied down for five years interviewing TV personalities." In fact, Chase did not even appear on the program until May 4, 1977, when he was promoting a prime time special for NBC. Carson later said of Chase; "He couldn't ad lib a fart after a baked bean dinner".[28]
