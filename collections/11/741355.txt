sIgA primarily acts by blockading epithelial receptors (e.g. by binding their ligands on pathogens), by sterically hindering attachment to epithelial cells, and by immune exclusion.[14] Since sIgA is a poor opsonin and activator of complement, simply binding a pathogen isn't necessarily enough to contain itâ€”specific epitopes may have to be bound to sterically hinder access to the epithelium.[14]
