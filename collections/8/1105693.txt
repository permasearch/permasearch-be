Many other cuprate superconductors have since been discovered, and the theory of superconductivity in these materials is one of the major outstanding challenges of theoretical condensed matter physics.[38] There are currently two main hypotheses – the resonating-valence-bond theory, and spin fluctuation which has the most support in the research community.[39] The second hypothesis proposed that electron pairing in high-temperature superconductors is mediated by short-range spin waves known as paramagnons.[40][41][dubious – discuss]
