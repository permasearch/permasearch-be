On Halloween, Greg and Rowley go trick-or-treating, but are challenged by teens who spray Greg and Rowley with a water-filled fire extinguisher. Greg tries to threaten them by saying-"We're calling the cops", but the teenagers start to chase them. The two friends escape and go to Greg's grandmother's house until the teens leave.
