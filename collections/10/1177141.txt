Ichigo constantly refuses the exercise Rukia subjects him to to shape him up, much to her irritation. Meanwhile, Rukia's older brother, Byakuya (Rukia had been adopted by Kuchiki family as a child), sends her childhood friend, Renji Abarai, to fetch her. He has a brief altercation with Ichigo that ends when someone threatens him with arrows, forcing him to flee. The person turns out to be Ichigo's classmate, Uryū Ishida. Uryū is a Quincy, humans who are spiritually aware and can dispatch Hollows with bow and arrows. He hates Reapers for having massacred his kind a long time ago and challenges Ichigo, whom he identified as a Reaper, to fight Hollows by deliberately summoning them.
