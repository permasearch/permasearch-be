In 1928, Tesla received U.S. Patent 1,655,114, for a biplane capable of taking off vertically (VTOL aircraft) and then of being "gradually tilted through manipulation of the elevator devices" in flight until it was flying like a conventional plane.[188] Tesla thought the plane would sell for less than $1,000,[189] although the aircraft has been described as impractical.[190] This would be his last patent and at this time Tesla closed his last office at 350 Madison Ave., which he had moved into two years earlier.
