On 20 February 2014 Pastor Cho and his son (Hee-jun) were convicted of embezzling US$12 million in church funds.[7] The presiding judge once told Cho, "We know that this case is not your problem. You just need to blame it on your son, then you will have no responsibilities," Change wrote, adding that Cho refused, "My son can be unrighteous to me, but I cannot be unrighteous to my son."[8] In June 2016, this incident became a non-prosecution because there was "no suspicion."[9]
