In the 1970s, Hugo Besedovsky, Adriana del Rey and Ernst Sorkin, working in Switzerland, reported multi-directional immune-neuro-endocrine interactions, since they show that not only the brain can influence immune processes but also the immune response itself can affect the brain and neuroendocrine mechanisms. They found that the immune responses to innocuous antigens triggers an increase in the activity of hypothalamic neurons[10][11] and hormonal and autonomic nerve responses that are  relevant for immunoregulation  and are integrated at brain levels (see review[12]). On these bases, they proposed that the immune system acts as a sensorial receptor organ that, besides its peripheral effects, can communicate to the brain and associated neuro-endocrine structures its state of activity.[11] These investigators also identified products from immune cells, later characterized as cytokines, that mediate this immune-brain communication[13] (more references in [12]).
