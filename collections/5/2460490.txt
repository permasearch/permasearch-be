Reception for the new MacBook has been generally positive, with critics praising the design and overall quality of the product. However, several described it as a limited first-generation product designed to avoid extensive use until the MacBook reached greater maturity, and its price dropped sufficiently for mainstream adoption.[16][17][18][19][20][21] The slow performance of the Intel Core M processor was regarded as the new MacBook's main deficiency, relative to the cheaper and faster MacBook Air and Pro.[22] Among the other criticisms of the new MacBook are the lack of various popular ports, particularly USB Type-A ports, which limits data transfer and overall convenience without the use of an adapter.[23]
