The uranium district of south Texas was discovered by accident in 1954 by an airborne gamma radiation survey looking for petroleum deposits. The coastal plain had previously been regarded as highly unfavorable for uranium deposits.[64] The uranium occurs in roll-front type deposits in sandstones of Eocene, Oligocene and Miocene age.[65] The deposits are distributed along about 200 miles (320Â km) of coastal plain, from Panna Maria in the north, south into Mexico. Uranium production began in 1958, from open-pit and in situ leach mines.
