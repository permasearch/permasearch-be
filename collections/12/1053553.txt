Drivers often flash headlights to indicate the intention to overtake or pass another driver,[8][9] or to signal a driver who has just overtaken that he or she is far enough ahead to change back into the lane of the overtaken vehicle. Flashing is also commonly used to request or insist that a leading driver speed up or change lanes to get out of the way of a faster following driver.[10][11] Headlight flashing may also be a part of aggressive driving,[10] and can be used in an attempt to intimidate others into speeding or otherwise driving unsafely.[12]
