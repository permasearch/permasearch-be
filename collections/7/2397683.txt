Pathogenic micro-organisms include bacteria, fungi, and viruses. They kill or debilitate their host and are relatively host-specific. Various microbial insect diseases occur naturally, but may also be used as biological pesticides.[60] When naturally occurring, these outbreaks are density-dependent in that they generally only occur as insect populations become denser.[61]
