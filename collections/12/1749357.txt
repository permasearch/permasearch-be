Most States have effected statutes relating to the sale of goods, such as the Sale of Goods Act 1896, (Qld)[191] which imply conditions and warranties in relation to fitness and merchantibility.[192] However, in many instances such implied terms can be displaced by the contrary intention appearing in the contract between the parties. This has meant that, in practice, in many sale of goods contracts these provisions are displaced.[citation needed]
