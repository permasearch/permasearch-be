At launch no Linux based operating systems were supported, mainly because there was no Linux driver available for the MegaRAID controller for shared storage access.[7] As of June 2014, Linux support for the VRTX Shared PERC 8 was released. This driver supports the single-controller Entry Shared Mode (ESM) configuration, support for the dual-controller High Availability Shared PERC configuration has not been announced. [8]
