Due to a dispute among the owners, the Kochi Tuskers franchise failed to pay the 10% bank guarantee of the total franchise fee that it was supposed to pay before the season began. The BCCI claimed that it had sent several requests for payment to the franchise owners but received no response.[17] On 19 September 2011, then BCCI president N. Srinivasan announced that the Kochi Tuskers Kerala IPL franchise was terminated by the BCCI because they failed to provide the bank guarantee to cover their annual fee.[18] The franchise's plea seeking to restrain the BCCI from encashing its bank guarantee of ₹1.56 billion was rejected by a single bench of Justice SF Vajifdar.[18]
