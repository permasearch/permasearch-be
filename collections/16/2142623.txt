The London Underground is a large metro system operating across London and beyond, commonly known as "the Tube". Its 408-kilometre (254Â mi)[21] is made up of 11 lines; electrification began during the 1890s. It was largely unified between 1900 and 1910 and nationalised in 1933, becoming the railway component of London Transport (LT). A major expansion programme (the "New Works") was launched, in which LT took over several urban branches of mainline railways.
