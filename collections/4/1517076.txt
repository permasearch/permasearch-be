Alongside Faline from Bambi (1942) and Maid Marian from Robin Hood (1973) added, Nala belongs to a trio of Disney heroines who, after having been separated from their love interests for several years, eventually reunite with them.[39] Stephens believes that Nala and Simba's separation allows the characters to fall in love "properly" upon reuniting as young adults.[28] Because The Lion King is loosely based on William Shakespeare's tragedy Hamlet,[40][41][42] Nala is considered to be the film's "representative" of the Hamlet character Ophelia, Hamlet's love interest.[43] Both characters' relationships with and opinions of their love interests are similar,[44] however, there are several differences between the two women.[33] While identifying Nala as "the closest character in The Lion King to Ophelia," Shepherd University's Emmylou Allen acknowledged in her article "Shakespeare in the Pride Lands" that "their similarities are not as great as their contrasts."[33] Unlike Ophelia, Nala does not succumb to insanity, nor does she eventually die. Instead, Nala establishes herself as "a physically powerful ally"[45] by encouraging Simba to return to Pride Rock, and helping the character overthrow Scar.[43] Additionally, Nala is a more stubborn character than Ophelia, the latter of whom is quite passive and obedient.[44] While Ophelia is raised by a single father, Nala is raised solely by her mother, which inspired Allen to believe that Nala is a manifestation of how Ophelia would have turned out had she been raised by a woman instead of a man, concluding, "Nala is able to show the potential that Ophelia could have had.".[33]
