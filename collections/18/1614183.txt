In 2013, the teams again split their games, and the Seahawks won the division by a game and went on to win Super Bowl XLVIII, defeating the 49ers in the NFC Championship game. All three 49ers-Seahawks games were highly anticipated that season, and most sports analysts called it the best rivalry in the NFL. Ever since then the San Francisco 49ers and the Seattle Seahawks fans are always eagerly awaiting this divisional round matchup.[28]
