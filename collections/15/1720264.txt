Some Mayan monuments include glyphs that record an 819-day count in their Initial Series. These can also be found in the Dresden codex.[32] This is described in Thompson.[33] More examples of this can be found in Kelley.[34] Each group of 819 days was associated with one of four colors and the cardinal direction with which it was associated â€” black corresponded to west, red to east, white to north and yellow to south.
