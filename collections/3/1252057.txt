In Islam sexual intercourse is allowed only after marriage and only with one's spouse. Sex outside of marriage is prohibited, called zina, as is adultery, which is considered a sin and is strictly prohibited and punishable. According to the chapter Al-Israa', verse 32 of the Qur'an, Allah (God) prohibits Muslims from getting close to (engaging in) zina, and having relations with anyone other than one's spouse. And since marriage is only between a man and a woman, any sexual intercourse between two men is prohibited. Islam does not accept homosexuality or allow anal sex even between married couples or even during menstrual cycles. Furthermore, sex is like an act of charity if done with right intentions. One cannot seek sexual means outside of marriage and must lower gaze when outside.
