There were several changes made in the exam from 2018. The Joint Admission Board (JAB) decided to conduct the entire exam online from 2018 since it reduces chances of paper leak and makes logistics and evaluation easier. It said that the online exam will neutralise the problem of misprinting. The number of students appearing for the JEE (Advanced) has been increased by 4000, which was earlier 2,20,000.[28]
