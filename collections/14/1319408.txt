For example, after the Sino-Soviet split, the Chinese refused to embrace their Soviet counterparts or to address them as "comrade."[12] Even with the normalization of relations in 1989, the Chinese continued to omit the fraternal embrace when greeting Soviet leaders, even as they exchanged the fraternal embrace with leaders from other Communist countries.[13] This was done to emphasize that Sino-Soviet relations were not returning to the level that they were in the 1950s, prior to the split; Chinese protocol specifically insisted on "handshake, no embrace."[14][4]
