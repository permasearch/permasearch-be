RCA re-signed Pure Prairie League and their third album, Two Lane Highway, was released in June 1975. It featured guest appearances by Chet Atkins, fiddler Johnny Gimble, Don Felder from The Eagles, and Emmylou Harris, who dueted with the band on the song "Just Can't Believe It", which received much airplay on country stations. Highway was the band's highest 'charter' at No.Â 24 and Bustin' Out reached Gold status. This began a string of five consecutive Top 40 album releases as If the Shoe Fits (January 1976), Dance (November 1976), and Live, Takin' the Stage (September 1977) all made the Top 40.
