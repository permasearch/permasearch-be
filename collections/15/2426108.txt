At the behest of Joseph Cogswell, John Jacob Astor placed a codicil in his will to bequeath $400,000 (equivalent of $11.1 million in 2016) for the creation of a public library.[5] After Astor's death in 1848, the resulting board of trustees executed the will's conditions and constructed the Astor Library in 1854 in the East Village.[6] The library created was a free reference library; its books were not permitted to circulate.[7] By 1872, the Astor Library was described in a New York Times editorial as a "major reference and research resource",[8] but, "Popular it certainly is not, and, so greatly is it lacking in the essentials of a public library, that its stores might almost as well be under lock and key, for any access the masses of the people can get thereto".[9]
