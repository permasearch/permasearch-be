Some child rights activists argue that child labour must include every child who is not in school because he or she is a hidden child worker.[25] UNICEF, however, points out that India faces major shortages of schools, classrooms and teachers particularly in rural areas where 90 percent of child labour problem is observed. About 1 in 5 primary schools have just one teacher to teach students across all grades.[26][27][28][29]
