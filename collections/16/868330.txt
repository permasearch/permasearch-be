In December 2011 Polish foreign minister Rados≈Çaw Sikorski said that Poland aimed to adopt the euro on 1 January 2016, but only if "the eurozone is reformed by then, and the entrance is beneficial to us."[16] The current Polish government plans to comply with all the Euro convergence criteria by 2015.[15]  In autumn 2012 the Monetary Policy Council of the Polish National Bank published its official monetary guidelines for 2013, confirming earlier political statements that Poland should only join the ERM-II once the existing eurozone countries have overcome the current sovereign-debt crisis, to maximise the benefits of monetary integration and minimise associated costs.[17] The governor of the National Bank, Marek Belka, has stated that the euro won't be adopted before the end of his term in 2016.[15]
