In the novel The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, this spacecraft is found on the surface of Magrathea, parked next to the Heart of Gold. It is described as "a bulbous, shark-like affair, slate-green in color, with stenciled writing in various degrees of size and unfriendliness informing whoever cared to read them as to where the ship was from, what section of the police it was assigned to, and where the power feeds should be connected." It is also totally dark and silent, as if dead.
