Tort reform opponents argue that corporations and insurance companies are the worst abusers of the litigation system.[citation needed] In particular, they contend, corporations often use their enormous resources to unfairly delay trial, pursue frivolous appeals, and contest claims in which liability is clear.[citation needed] In response, a number of tort reform supporters argue that that criticism is not a reason to oppose tort reform; such abuse would be deterred by proposed tort reforms such as "loser pays," which would prevent large corporations from using litigation as a cudgel against individuals and small businesses who cannot afford to defend themselves in court by providing an incentive for law firms to provide contingent defense.[citation needed] Opponents of tort reform contend that most private citizens would be afraid to sue wealthy corporations or insurers if they could be bankrupted by an award of the defendant's legal fees if they lost.[citation needed] This would limit legitimate claims, and effectively deny many citizens a forum to redress the harm caused them.[citation needed]
