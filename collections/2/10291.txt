Congress first exercised its power to regulate elections nation-wide 1842, when the 27th Congress passed a law requiring the election of Representatives by districts. In subsequent years, Congress expanded on the requirements, successively adding contiguity, compactness, and substantial equality of population to the districting requirements. These standards were all later deleted in the Reapportionment Act of 1929.[52] Congress subsequently reinstated the requirement that districts be composed of contiguous territory, be "compact," and have equal populations within each State.[53] Congress has allowed those requirements to lapse,[54] but the Supreme Court has re-imposed the population requirement on the States under the Equal Protection Clause[21] and is suspicious of districts that do not meet the other "traditional" districting criteria of compactness and contiguity.[55]
