Producer Simon Kinberg revealed in September 2015 that discussions had begun regarding ideas for a sequel to Deadpool, which was set to be released in February 2016. One idea was for the film to introduce the character Cable, who had previously been looked at to appear in the first Deadpool, and X-Men: Days of Future Past before that.[25] Cable's inclusion in the potential sequel was confirmed by the character Deadpool, breaking the fourth wall, in the post-credit scene of the first film. Domino, a character with connections to Cable in the comics, was also believed to be featured in the sequel.[26] By the first film's release, 20th Century Fox had green-lit a sequel, with writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick returning to write the screenplay. Though director Tim Miller and producer/star Ryan Reynolds were not confirmed for the sequel at the time, Fox was "intent on keeping the creative team together".[3] Miller and Reynolds' involvement was confirmed at the 2016 CinemaCon that April,[27] though Miller had still not formally signed on to direct the sequel yet. He began work developing the script with the writers, while Reynolds had signed a new contract granting him "casting approval and other creative controls".[28]
