On October 15, 1965, David J. Miller burned his draft card at a rally held near the Armed Forces Induction Center on Whitehall Street in Manhattan. He spoke briefly to the crowd from atop a sound truck and then tried but failed to burn his card with matchesâ€”the wind kept blowing them out. A lighter was offered by the crowd and it worked. Miller was arrested by the FBI three days later in Manchester, New Hampshire while setting up peace literature on a table.[5] The 24-year-old pacifist, member of the Catholic Worker Movement, became the first man convicted under the 1965 amendment.[20] In April 1966 with his wife and breast-feeding baby in attendance, he was sentenced to 30 months in prison.[20][21] The case was argued in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in June. Miller's attorney held that "symbolic speech is protected by the First Amendment; burning a draft card is a most dramatic form of communication, and there is a constitutional right to make one's speech as effective as possible."[22] The court did not agree. The case was decided later that year in October: Miller's conviction was confirmed and his sentence upheld.[23] Loudon Wainwright, Jr. wrote in Life magazine that Miller, "without really knowing it, might be embarking on a lifelong career of protest."[24] Miller remained free on bail until June 1968 at which time he served 22 months in federal prison.[5]
