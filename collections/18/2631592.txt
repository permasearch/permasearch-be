A Pocket Full of Rye is a work of detective fiction by Agatha Christie and first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club on 9 November 1953,[1] and in the US by Dodd, Mead & co. the following year.[2][3]  The UK edition retailed at ten shillings and sixpence (10/6)[1] and the US edition at $2.75.[3] The book features her detective Miss Marple. Like several of Christie's novels (e.g., Hickory Dickory Dock and One, Two, Buckle My Shoe) the title and substantial parts of the plot reference a nursery rhyme, in this case "Sing a Song of Sixpence".
