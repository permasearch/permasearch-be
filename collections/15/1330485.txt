Although in principle it is possible to practice DevOps with any architectural style, the microservices architectural style is becoming the standard for building continuously deployed systems.[22] Because the size of each service is small, it allows the architecture of an individual service to emerge through continuous refactoring,[49] hence reducing the need for a big upfront design[citation needed] and allows for releasing the software early[citation needed] and continuously.
