For his first official monster hunting assignment, Justin is dispatched to capture a mind controlling mummy after all of the other monster hunters are apparently killed in action. Arriving at the museum, Justin and Juliet end up getting trapped in an exhibit with a soundproof plastic window, leaving them unable to call for help and the window itself immune to Justin's magic. Justin believes that they can wait until morning for a worker to let them out, but quickly realizes otherwise when he remembers that exposure to sunlight will incinerate Juliet. Justin ultimately decides that Juliet needs to look in the mummy's eyes and become his slave in order to leave so she will not be destroyed, though he promises to hunt down the mummy and save Juliet one day.
