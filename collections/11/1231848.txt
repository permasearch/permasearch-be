Meanwhile, in Hawaii, Jen takes Woody and Sonya on a snorkeling trip. She's encouraged them to overcome their fears all season, and now she wants them to help her push past her fear of water. The three White Team members have a beautiful time and Woody and Sonya thank their trainer for saving their lives and helping them get to this point. As the contestants paddle into their first Hawaiian weigh-in, they are all nervous about the Red Line, seeing as travel often complicates weight loss. Sonya is up first and is six pounds away from losing 100 pounds, a feat she never thought was possible. She steps on the scale at 189 pounds and is overjoyed to lose exactly six pounds to weigh 183 pounds. Lori is up next and drops 10 pounds to weigh 230. This is the first time she's lost double digits, and she couldn't be happier. Up next is Toma, who needs to lose more than seven pounds to avoid the Red Line. He, too, drops 10 pounds, to 225. Next on the scale is Rob, who is incredibly scared, considering how poorly he handles change. He needs to lose more than 11 pounds to stay safe, and he loses 12! Jordan is next on the scale and loses just six pounds to reach 227, landing his name right above the Red Line. The last contestant to weigh in is Woody, who hopes to either lose six pounds to weigh under 300, or eight pounds, to reach 100 pounds lost. Woody handily beats his goal by losing 12 pounds to weigh 294! He knows his wife is looking down on him, and he couldn't be more thankful for the Biggest Loser experience. Sadly, this means it's time for Jordan to leave paradise. Back at home, JJ is at 261 lbs. and finally wanted to fulfill the promise to his younger brother and his younger brother wants to be a football player like JJ. He plans to coach his brother's football team and winning the At-home prize.
