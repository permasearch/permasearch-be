Many expansions to the METRO system are currently in the early planning stages, and two are under construction. The Central Mesa extension project, which extends the Main Street line 2Â½ miles from its current terminus at Sycamore to Mesa Drive in Downtown Mesa, has finished construction and opened on August 22, 2015.[30] The Northwest rail project opened March 2016. The project extended the 19th Avenue track from its former terminus at Montebello Ave to Dunlap Avenue, 3 miles north.[31] Many more extensions are funded, with further projects being studied for feasibility.
