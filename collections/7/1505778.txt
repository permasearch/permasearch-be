The United Kingdom established the worldâ€™s first civil nuclear programme,[2] opening a nuclear power station, Calder Hall at Windscale, England, in 1956. At the peak in 1997, 26% of the nation's electricity was generated from nuclear power. Since then a number of reactors have closed and by 2012 the share had declined to 19%.[3] The older AGR reactors have been life-extended, and further life-extensions across the AGR fleet are likely.[4][5]
