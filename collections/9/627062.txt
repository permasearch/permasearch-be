Dilip Kumar (Muhammad Yusuf Khan), who debuted in the 1940s and rose to fame in the 1950s, was one of the biggest Indian movie stars. He was a pioneer of method acting, predating Hollywood method actors such as Marlon Brando. Much like Brando's influence on New Hollywood actors such as Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, Kumar inspired many famous Indian actors, from Amitabh Bachchan and Naseeruddin Shah to Shah Rukh Khan to Nawazuddin Siddiqui.[88] Kumar was described as "the ultimate method actor" (natural actor) by Satyajit Ray.[89]
