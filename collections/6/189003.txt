At times, Theresa can be controlling of her kids and their lives; for example, in "Quincea単era", she completely takes control of the plans for Alex's Quincea単era fifteenth birthday party and turns it into the party that she wants, attempting to manipulate Alex into letting her. She refuses to listen to Alex's objections all because she herself never got to have a Quincea単era of her own. This eventually gets so irritating to Alex that she casts a spell to switch bodies with her mother, partially so Theresa would be able to have the Quincea単era that she never got to have.
