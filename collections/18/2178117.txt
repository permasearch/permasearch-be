In absence of dark energy, a flat universe expands forever but at a continually decelerating rate, with expansion asymptotically approaching zero.[citation needed] With dark energy, the expansion rate of the universe initially slows down, due to the effect of gravity, but eventually increases.[citation needed] The ultimate fate of the universe is the same as an open universe.
