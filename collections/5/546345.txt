Much more than earlier periods, the Tang era was renowned for the time reserved for leisure activity, especially for those in the upper classes.[249] Many outdoor sports and activities were enjoyed during the Tang, including archery,[250] hunting,[251] horse polo,[252] cuju football,[253] cockfighting,[254] and even tug of war.[255] Government officials were granted vacations during their tenure in office. Officials were granted 30 days off every three years to visit their parents if they lived 1,000 mi (1,600 km) away, or 15 days off if the parents lived more than 167 mi (269 km) away (travel time not included).[249] Officials were granted nine days of vacation time for weddings of a son or daughter, and either five, three, or one days/day off for the nuptials of close relatives (travel time not included).[249] Officials also received a total of three days off for their son's capping initiation rite into manhood, and one day off for the ceremony of initiation rite of a close relative's son.[249]
