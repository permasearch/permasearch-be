McCartney was released in Britain on 17 April 1970 (as Apple PCS 7102), and three days later in America (Apple STAO 3363).[91] Although McCartney's standing among Beatles fans had plummeted as a result of his announcement,[92][93] news of the band's break-up ensured that the album was highly publicised.[27][94] Adding to this exposure in the US, McCartney commissioned a second set of print advertisements for the album,[95] to counter what Doggett describes as Klein's "incendiary statement of fact" in the official advertisements that Apple was "an ABKCO-managed company".[96]
