Malay poetry is highly developed, and uses many forms.[37] A Hikayat is a traditional narrative, and stories written in that fashion are named using Hikayat followed by the name(s) of the protagonist(s). The pantun is a form of poetry used in many aspects of Malay culture. The Syair is another form of narrative, once very popular.[29] The Hikayat form remains popular, and the pantun has spread from Malay to other languages.[37] Until the 19thÂ century, literature produced in Malaysia focused mainly on tales of royalty,[29] as it was produced just for royalty.[23] It was after this point that it expanded to other areas.[29] The race riots of 1969 strongly influenced literature; the improvements of the economy in the 1980s brought about social changes and new forms of literature.[23]
