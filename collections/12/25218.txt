European diseases (smallpox, influenza, measles and typhus) to which the native populations had no resistance were the overwhelming cause of the depopulation of the Native American population.[42] Cruel systems of forced labor (such as encomiendas and mining industry's mita) under Spanish control also contributed to depopulation. Lower bound estimates speak of a decline in the population of around 20â€“50 per cent, whereas high estimates arrive at 90 per cent.[43] Following this, African slaves, who had developed immunity to these diseases, were quickly brought in to replace them.[citation needed]
