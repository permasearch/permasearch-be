While the round pound was operational, others that entered circulation, although not legal tender, in the UK were some Â£1 coins of British Crown Dependencies, Gibraltar and UK South Atlantic Overseas Territories.  Most coins of these territories, in all denominations, were of the same size and composition as a UK equivalent and most bore the same portraits of the UK monarch.[48][49] None of these territories rushed to replace their round pound coins except Gibraltar after the UK did so, which continues to use gibraltarian pound coins as legal tender as well as the new UK pound coins.
