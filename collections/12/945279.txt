Noble published the sheet music under the title "My Little Grass Shack in Kealakekua." In "Notes on Hawaiian Music," Noble said, "The first two thousand copies sold locally went like hot cakesâ€”the demand for the song was too great. I ordered another two thousand and they too were sold out within a few weeks."[4] With offers from many mainland music publishers, he awarded publishing rights to San Francisco-based Sherman, Clay & Co. for a $500.00 advance against royalties.[5]
