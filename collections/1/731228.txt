The Residence Act had granted the president the authority to locate the federal capital’s territory only as far south and east as the mouth of the Anacostia River in Maryland. However, President Washington wanted to expand the territory’s area southward so that its boundaries could encompass the town of Alexandria. In 1791, Congress amended the Residence Act to approve President Washington’s selected site, which included the portion of the territory that Virginia would cede.[27]
