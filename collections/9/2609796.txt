Ranbir Talwar (Saif Ali Khan), a leading industrialist in India, is lonely because he has lost everyone who is dear to him which include his childhood friend and his mother. Due to distraction, he mistakenly kills a husband and wife in a car accident. The judge sentences him to look after their four children, and to do so without sending them to a boarding school nor keeping them in the care of anyone else. The children resent Ranbeer for his role in their parents' death and desire revenge, whereas he is unprepared to live with them, making both him and the children miserable in this situation.
