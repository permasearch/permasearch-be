"Earth Angel" was recorded as a literal garage demoâ€”it was recorded in a home garage at the Los Angeles home of Ted Brinson (a relative of Williams who had previously played bass for the Jimmie Lunceford and Andy Kirk bands).[2][1] The home was located at 2190 West 30th Street in South Los Angeles.[6] The garage was used as the primary recording space of Dootsie Williams for all of his Dootone artists, and had also been used to record demos for Jessie Mae Robinson.[2] It was recorded on a single-track Ampex tape recorder, owned by big band veteran Ted Brinson, who performs bass guitar on the track.[2] The drums were muffled with pillows so as to not overwhelm the vocals.[2] A neighbor's pet dog stopped many takes by barking. "Everytime the dog barked next door, I'd have to go out and shut him up, and then we'd do another take," remembered Williams.[1] Williams performs piano on the track,[2] with Preston Epps on bongos (though this unconfirmed), as well as an unknown drummer.[6] The song is composed in the key of A-flat major and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 76 beats per minute. Duncan's vocal range spans from F3 to G4.[7] The first five seconds of the intro are cut off of the recording by accident.[6]
