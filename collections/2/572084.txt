In 2012, Newman scored The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. He also scored the 23rd James Bond movie Skyfall, directed by his longtime collaborator Sam Mendes, which celebrates the film franchise's 50th anniversary.[10] His work on this film earned him his eleventh Oscar nomination and a second BAFTA win.  During 2013, he scored Steven Soderbergh's Side Effects and Saving Mr. Banks.  The latter score was very well received by film music critics, earning Newman BAFTA and Oscar nominations for the second consecutive year, both of which he lost to Steven Price for Gravity.
