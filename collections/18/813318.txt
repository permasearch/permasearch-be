Construction of the original route from the Georgia border to Tampa via Gainesville and Ocala lasted through most of the 1960s. The first segment of I-75 to open in Florida was from the Georgia border to State Road 6 just south of Jennings, which opened in 1963. It would reach U.S. 90 in Lake City later that year. By mid-1964, I-75 opened from Lake City to the newly completed Florida Turnpike (known then as the Sunshine State Parkway) in Wildwood. Segments of the original route that are now part of I-275 near Tampa would begin opening in 1966, and construction of the full route would be completed by 1969.[10]
