Reynolds amassed a large collection of movie memorabilia, beginning with items from the landmark 1970 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer auction, and she displayed them, first in a museum at her Las Vegas hotel and casino during the 1990s[52] and later in a museum close to the Kodak Theater in Los Angeles. On several occasions, she auctioned off items from the collection.
