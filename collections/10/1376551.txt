Rohmer and Schroder then sold the rights of two of their short films to French television in order to raise $60,000 to produce the feature film La Collectionneuse in 1967, the third "Moral Tale".[18] The film's budget only went to film stock and renting a house in St. Tropez as a set. Rohmer described it as a film about "l'amour par dÃ©soeuvrement" ("love from idleness"). La Collectionneuse won the Jury Grand Prix at the 17th Berlin International Film Festival and was praised by French film critics, although US film critics called it "boring".[9]
