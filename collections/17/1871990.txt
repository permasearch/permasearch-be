The surgical pain causes Aditya to have a clairvoyant experience exposing Dr. Sameer's plot to murder Aditya, also revealing that Ria worked at the hospital under Dr. Sameer and has conspired with him against Aditya. Ria's plan was to marry Aditya, and then poison the donor heart to cause its rejection, thus murdering Aditya to collect insurance money to pay off Dr. Sameer's debts. The scheme unravels and Gayatri, realising what has happened, sacrifices herself so that Aditya can live, having barely survived the surgery and attempt on his life. She commits suicide and her heart is switched for the poisoned one by Dr. Trehan (Om Puri). During a shared out-of-body experience, Gayatri reveals to Aditya that his father's death was not his fault but just an accident and that he should value his life for which both his parents has sacrificed. Dr. Sameer and his conspirators are being arrested and Aditya comes back to consciousness. Film closes with Aditya telling Ria that he knows the truth due to anaesthesia awareness and hands her over to police.
