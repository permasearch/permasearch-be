Common periwinkles have been introduced to the  Atlantic coast of North America, possibly by rock ballast in the mid-19th century.[12] This species is also found on the west coast of the United States, from Washington to California. The first recorded sighting in the East was in 1840 in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.[12] It is now abundant on rocky shores from New Jersey northward to Newfoundland.[8][13] In Canada, its range includes New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador.[3]
