The video box set (or "Multi-Box Music Video Set") award is a classification for video compilations that include three or more videos that are grouped and marketed together as a set.  Like Video Longform, this includes DVD and VHS releases and the certification criteria is the same. Each individual video within set is counted as one toward certification.[25]
