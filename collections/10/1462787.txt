Gangstar Vegas is structured similarly to previous games in the series, and by extension, to Grand Theft Auto and its numerous clones. The overall play area is much larger, with Gameloft marketing it as "Gangstar's largest open world". In addition to the main storyline, players can free roam and/or partake in a number of side activities, namely bank robberies, street racing and underground fighting tournaments. Property management is also present, allowing the player to gain income through businesses acquired during the course of the game. In keeping with the game's Las Vegas theme, casino minigames such as video poker, blackjack and slot machines were also introduced, along with a number of establishments such as a nightclub and convenience stores.[1]
