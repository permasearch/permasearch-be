To gain playing time, Vokes moved to League One side Leeds United in October 2009 on loan until the New Year,[11] making his Leeds debut in a 2â€“1 victory over Norwich City on 19 October. He scored once for the club against Bristol Rovers[12] but competition between Leeds strikers meant Vokes returned to Wolves when the deal ended.
