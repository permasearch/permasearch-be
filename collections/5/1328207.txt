In England and Wales, the common law courts originally recognised only wax seals, but this requirement was gradually relaxed. By the 20th century a small circle of red adhesive paper affixed to the document in question was sufficient when an individual had to use a seal[5] (most commonly on a contract for the sale of land), although the courts also held that a circle containing the letters "L.S." was adequate.[6]
