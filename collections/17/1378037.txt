Morley's production was re-launched yet again in 1986, with Daniel Abineri both as director and in the lead role of Frank-N-Furter. This time the tour commenced in New Zealand, where its cast included local actors Andrew Binns as Brad, Ann Wilson as Janet, Andrea Cunningham as Magenta/Usherette, Rachel King as Columbia and Russell Crowe as Eddie/Dr. Scott. For a brief stint, former New Zealand Prime Minister Robert Muldoon appeared as the Narrator.
