The ideal, no-load average output voltage      V   a v      {\displaystyle V_{\mathrm {av} }}   of the B6 circuit results from the integral under the graph of a DC voltage pulse with the period duration of       1 3   π   {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{3}}\pi }   (from 60° to 120°) with the peak value         v ^      D C    =   3   ⋅  V   p e a k      {\displaystyle {\hat {v}}_{\mathrm {DC} }={\sqrt {3}}\cdot V_{\mathrm {peak} }}  :
