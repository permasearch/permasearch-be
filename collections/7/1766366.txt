Writing for the website No Ripcord, Gary McGinley said that the song "has an aching beauty and the hallmarks of a modern standard."[30] He further added that it "sounds poised to soundtrack atmospheric TV trailers over the coming months."[30] A writer of URB magazine called "Someone like You" "a heart-wrencher made all the more real by reeling phrasing and bare-voiced pleading, 'I wish nothing but the best for you, too.'"[31] John Murphy of MusicOMH categorized "Someone like You" and "Turning Tables" as "the two best songs on the album."[17] He concluded that the song was "desperately sad and utterly, utterly gorgeous."[17] Bary Walters of Spin wrote that on "the piano-led finale, she vows, 'I'll find someone like you,' as if that's progress. It's a statement that's utterly WTF and yet true to the cyclical nature of psychological damage."[32] Sputnikmusic's Joseph Viney called the song "an ode to stalking with a perverse attitude that lies underneath the fragile composition, looks set to become the soundtrack to a million messy break-ups."[33] Allison Stewart of The Washington Post put the song on her list "Recommended tracks".[34]
