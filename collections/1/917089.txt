The second generation Volkswagen Passat was launched in 1981. The platform, named B2, was once again based on the corresponding version of the Audi 80, which had been launched in 1978. The B2 Passat was slightly longer and the car's updated styling was instantly recognizable as a Passat, with the most obvious difference being the rectangular headlights. By this time, front-wheel drive and a hatchback were becoming commonplace on this size of car â€“ a notable popular example being the Opel Ascona/Vauxhall Cavalier which was launched in the same year.
