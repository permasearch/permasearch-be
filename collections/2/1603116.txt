From that moment on, Craig has been trying to get into the good graces of Rosanna, but she wasn't interested. All she wanted was to be with Paul and get back at Craig for what he had done to her. Rosanna soon learned about the on and off relationship between Paul and Meg. She saw Meg as a threat, but when Paul married her on Halloween 2007, Rosanna was relieved and believed nothing could come between her and Paul anymore. However, Rosanna noticed Paul was still in love with Meg, so she met with Craig and demanded him to get Meg pregnant as soon as he could. A few weeks later, Meg was indeed pregnant. Both Craig and Rosanna were happy about this, until Rosanna learned that Megs baby wasn't Craig's, but Paul's. Rosanna switched the result of the tests that were done to find out who the father was. Meg and Craig heard that Craig was the father and once again, Rosanna felt safe now that Meg was bonded to Craig. Unfortunately for Rosanna, Craig found out the truth and discovered that Meg had cheated on him and the baby was Paul's. Craig fell back into his old habits and is currently looking for medication that will cause a miscarriage with Meg. On January 29, 2008, Rosanna slipped back into her coma.
