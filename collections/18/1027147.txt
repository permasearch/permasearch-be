Mainstream scholars suggest that the image of the fiery serpent served to function like that of a magical amulet. Magic amulets or charms were used in the ancient Near East[24] to practice a healing ritual known as sympathetic magic in an attempt to ward off, heal or reduce the impact of illness and poisons.[1] Copper and bronze serpent figures have been recovered, showing that the practice was widespread.[24] A Christian interpretation would be that the bronze serpent served as a symbol for each individual Israelite to take their confession of sin and the need for God’s deliverance to heart. Confession of sin and forgiveness was both a community and an individual responsibility. The plague of serpents remained an ongoing threat to the community and the raised bronze serpent was an ongoing reminder to each individual for the need to turn to the healing power of God.[1] It has also been proposed that the bronze serpent was a type of intermediary between God and the people[24] that served as a test of obedience, in the form of free judgment,[25] standing between the dead who were not willing to look to God’s chosen instrument of healing, and the living who were willing and were healed.[26] Thus, this instrument bore witness to the sovereign power of Yahweh even over the dangerous and sinister character of the desert.[25]
