Meanwhile, Rama, Lakshmana, Sugriva and the vanara Kingdom’s subjects are all gathered along the south coast, discussing how to travel to Lanka. It is then that Vibhishana appears and offers to join Rama’s forces. Rama is convinced of Vibhishana’s sincerity by Hanuman and agrees to accept Vibhishana, who in turn advises Rama to pray to the Sea God for a solution to cross over to Lanka. For seven days and seven nights Rama observes prayers, and on the eighth dawn the Sea God splashes a wave on Rama making his hair wet and he reveals himself and instructs Rama to build a bridge with stones that have his name inscribed. The stones would be supported by the ocean and all living beings could walk across safely. The members of Rama’s army then set about building the bridge, after which they proceed to Lanka where they will set up base camp not far from the capital city. In Ravana’s Palace, the King and his council members discuss the threat of war. Prahastha, the Chief Minister, assures Ravana that the threat is futile and that Rama’s army would be finished off. While an elderly member, presumably Ravana’s father, is against the war and even himself advises the King to return Sita, the other members appear wholeheartedly in support of the war, including Ravana’s son Indrajit. From base camp in Lanka, Rama wants to avoid war so Rama then asks Angada to convey a message of peace to Ravana, namely that if he was to release Sita and the other prisoners who would in turn take refuge under him, there would be no need of war and the subsequent bloodshed. But when Angada carries this message to Ravana at the Palace, he is rebuffed and even attacked by the Royal Guards. Ravana gives a clear sign that he wants war, and after Angada relays this message to Rama later that evening, Rama is then a bit upset then addresses his army, asking them if they would fight for ‘Justice and Rama’, to which they emphatically say yes.
