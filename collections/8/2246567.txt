There were three streams used as feeders: Rocky Run feeder (section #9, around 7 Locks), Great Falls feeder (section #18) and the Tuscarora feeder (section #78). There was a contemplated feeder at the Monocacy (not built).[97] Of course, the remains of the Potomac Company Little Falls skirting canal was used as a feeder also. Inlet lock #2 is called the Seneca Feeder in historic documents.[98]
