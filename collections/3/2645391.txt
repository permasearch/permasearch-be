Further works continued during the 1980s. The County Council in Berkshire, supported by local councils, estimated that £1,275,000 was needed for works at the eastern end of the canal and commenced work on replacing some of the bridges. In Wiltshire concerns over the limited water supply to the summit, at the highest point of the canal, indicated that back-pumping would be required, which increased the estimated cost for the county to £761,560. The Wilton Water reservoir was estimated to produce less than 750,000 imperial gallons (3,400 m3) per day, and the Seend feeder only 250,000 imp gal (1,100 m3). Wessex Water Authority agreed to the extraction of 1,000,000 imp gal (4,500 m3) per day from the Avon at Claverton to be pumped east; the costs of the pumps was £175,000.[26]
