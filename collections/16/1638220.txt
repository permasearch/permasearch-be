The Independent gave the book a positive review, calling it an "excellent book" that "will do wonders to raise enthusiasm for physics among young readers". It did, however, add that the storytelling has some rough edges, and noted the book had a couple of scientific inaccuracies.[4] About.com gave the book 3½ out of 5, stating "Recommended for kids, but not for adults. The story in this book is a bit contrived, but as a book intended to teach children the basics of astronomy, astrophysics, cosmology, and other principles that govern our universe, it does a fair job."[5] The reviewer from Kirkus Reviews was more critical, accusing the authors of setting aside the laws of physics whenever convenient to the story. The reviewer concluded that they expected the book to sell well, but that it "doesn’t show much respect for its target audience".[3] Common Sense Media gave the book 2 stars out of 5, stating "The nonfiction parts are fine: good information, clearly told, with some spectacular photos. But surprisingly, much of the fictional story isn't scientifically accurate. This might be forgivable in straight sci-fi or fantasy ... but in a book that purports to teach the basics of astronomy and physics, it's just confusing -- how are young readers to know what's true, what's theoretical, and what's just plain nonsense?"[6]
