The character types, states Zarrilli, reflect the Guṇa theory of personalities in the ancient Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy.[44] There are three Guṇas, according to this philosophy, that have always been and continue to be present in all things and beings in the world.[45] These three Guṇas are sattva (goodness, constructive, harmonious, virtuous), rajas (passion, aimless action, dynamic, egoistic), and tamas (darkness, destructive, chaotic, viciousness). All of these three gunas (good, evil, active) are present in everyone and everything, it is the proportion that is different, according to Hindu worldview.[45][46][47] The interplay of these gunas defines the character of someone or something,[45] and the costumes and face coloring in Kathakali often combines the various color codes to give complexity and depth to the actor-dancers.[44][48]
