On July 7, 2015, The Hollywood Reporter announced that the series had been renewed for an eighth season.[4] The season's storyline writers included Jack Pendarvis, Adam Muto, Kent Osborne, and Ashly Burch.[5][6] Originally, the show's seventh season was supposed to comprise the episodes "Bonnie & Neddy" through "Reboot",[nb 1] and its eighth season was supposed to include the episodes "Two Swords" through "Three Buckets",[nb 2] but when it came time to upload the seventh season onto streaming sites, Cartoon Network chose to end the season with its 26th episode, "The Thin Yellow Line."[11] Consequently, the episodes "Broke His Crown" through "Reboot" (which had originally been ordered as the last episodes of the show's seventh season) and the episodes "Two Swords" through the Islands miniseries (which had originally been ordered as the beginning of the show's eighth season) were combined to form the show's official eighth season. This new episode count was cemented by the release of the complete seventh season DVD on July 18, 2017, which included episodes up until "The Thin Yellow Line",[12] as well as the release of the complete eighth season on the Cartoon Network website.[nb 3]
