Prior to the release of Mass Effect: Andromeda, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Blake Jorgensen projected that it would sell 3 million units before the end of March, and 6 to 9 million units during its lifetime.[139] BioWare General Manager Aaryn Flynn predicted that it would sell at least 5 million copies worldwide.[140] Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter estimated that Mass Effect: Andromeda sold at least 2.5 million physical units in its opening quarter, resulting in $110 million in revenue.[141] The closest that EA has come to noting an exact figure was in their fourth quarter (Q4) of fiscal year 2017 (FY17) notes for investors, which stated that $53 million of the game's net sales related to its special editions were to be captured in Q1 FY18 instead of Q4 FY17 (the quarter of its release) for accounting purposes.[142]
