P. aeruginosa is often preliminarily identified by its pearlescent appearance. Clinical identification of P. aeruginosa may include identifying the production of both pyocyanin and fluorescein, as well as its ability to grow at 42 °C. P. aeruginosa is capable of growth in diesel and jet fuels, where it is known as a hydrocarbon-using microorganism, causing microbial corrosion.[51] It creates dark, gellish mats sometimes improperly called "algae" because of their appearance.[citation needed]
