After a twenty-year hiatus, Olympic baseball (labelled an exhibition sport/event by the IOC) returned but with tournament formatting (1984 Los Angeles).  At the 1988 Seoul games, it was termed a demonstration sport.  Japan defeated the United States in the inaugural tournament finale in 1984.  However, in 1988, the United States won over Japan.
