Peter Griesar was a bartender at Miller's beginning in 1989.  In the August 1991, during Miller's annual respite for inventory, Matthews, Beauford, Moore and Lessard used the empty bar for rehearsing.  Griesar heard the rehearsal, decided to take a break, and pulled out his harmonica and started playing with the band. After a few songs, he was invited to perform with them. He immediately accepted and became the band's first keyboardist.
