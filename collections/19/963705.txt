Alongside cassava, rice is the staple food of the republic, with 238,000 tonnes produced in 2013. The foodstuff accounts for 22% of agricultural GDP, far higher than all livestock.[7] However, the harvest still falls short of 1988 levels which were 299,000 tonnes even though the population has doubled.[13][17] Yields are also low with most rice at 3 tonnes per hectare, less than half the average in the United States.[12]
