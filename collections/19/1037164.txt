Salt marsh species also facilitate sediment accretion by decreasing current velocities and encouraging sediment to settle out of suspension.[10] Current velocities can be reduced as the stems of tall marsh species induce hydraulic drag, with the effect of minimising re-suspension of sediment and encouraging deposition.[18] Measured concentrations of suspended sediment in the water column have been shown to decrease from the open water or tidal creeks adjacent to the marsh edge, to the marsh interior,[17][18][19] probably as a result of direct settling to the marsh surface by the influence of the marsh canopy.[18][19]
