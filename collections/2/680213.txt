On the afternoon of a prisoner's scheduled execution,[40] he or she is transported directly from his or her death row unit to the Huntsville Unit.[41] Men leave the Polunsky Unit in a three-vehicle convoy bound for the Huntsville Unit;[40] women leave from the Mountain View Unit. The only individuals who are informed of the transportation arrangements are the wardens of the affected units. The TDCJ does not make an announcement regarding what routes are used.[41]
