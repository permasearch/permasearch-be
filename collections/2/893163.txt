Females will purse their lips and slowly approach a male while making eye contact. This serves to urge the male to mount her. If the male does not respond, then she will try to attract his attention by reaching towards him or slapping the ground.[48] In multiple-male groups, solicitation indicates female preference, but females can be forced to mate with multiple males.[48] Males incite copulation by approaching a female and displaying at her or touching her and giving a "train grunt".[47] Recently, gorillas have been observed engaging in face-to-face sex, a trait once considered unique to humans and bonobos.[49]
