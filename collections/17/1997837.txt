Jerry Fielding was born as Joshua Itzhak Feldman in Pittsburgh,[5] to Hiram Harris Feldman and Esther Feldman, both American Jews. After trying the trombone, he took up the clarinet and joined the Taylor Allderdice High School band.[6] He was offered a scholarship to the Carnegie Institute for Instrumentalists. After a short attendance, because of ill health he was bedridden for two years with an undiagnosed ailment. While housebound, he listened to the radio, and became a fan of the big band sound and Bernard Herrmann's music for Orson Welles's radio dramas.
