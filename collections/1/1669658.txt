Like "Karen Don't Be Sad", the acoustic "Something About Space Dude" has been compared to material from The Flaming Lips' Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots (2002).[19] In "Space Bootz" Cyrus expresses affection for a love interest who is "emotionally unavailable",[20] with a more "cosmic-pop" production and "interstellar whooshes and synths" than the lyrically-similar "Something About Space Dude".[18] "Fuckin Fucked Up" is a witch house-inspired interlude before "BB Talk";[21] in "BB Talk" Cyrus expresses distaste for public displays of affection from a love interest and a desire for him to "fuck [her] so [he stops] baby talking."[20] The "swaying, stoney, piano-based" "Fweaky" describes a sexual encounter after drinking and using drugs.[20] "Bang Me Box", a "raunchy electro R&B" song, expresses an explicit desire for lesbian sex.[20][22]
