Some Canadians were, by the early 1980s, informally referring to the holiday as Canada Day,[n 3] a practice that caused some controversy:[49] Proponents argued that the name Dominion Day was a holdover from the colonial era, an argument given some impetus by the patriation of the Canadian constitution in 1982, and others asserted that an alternative was needed as the term does not translate well into French.[44] Conversely, numerous politicians, journalists, and authors, such as Robertson Davies,[50] decried the change at the time and some continue to maintain that it was illegitimate and an unnecessary break with tradition.[44] Others claimed Dominion was widely misunderstood and conservatively inclined commenters saw the change as part of a much larger attempt by Liberals to "re-brand" or re-define Canadian history.[44][50][51] Columnist Andrew Cohen called Canada Day a term of "crushing banality" and criticized it as "a renunciation of the past [and] a misreading of history, laden with political correctness and historical ignorance".[52]
