The term (or its French equivalent) has other uses, in particular the rondeau, either the vocal Rondeau of the Medieval and early Renaissance period, or the French Baroque Rondeau usually associated with brief movements (for keyboard or larger ensemble) of the Baroque era and earlier, e.g. Jean-Philippe Rameau's "Rondeau des Indes Galantes" or Les Barricades Myst√©rieuses which is also not really a rondo, but a form of its own.[citation needed]
