On 31 October 1996, TAM Transportes Aéreos Regionais Flight 402 crashes into a heavily populated residential area seconds after takeoff from São Paulo–Congonhas Airport, killing all 96 people on board and 3 on the ground. The crash was attributed to the uncommanded deployment of a faulty thrust reverser on the right engine, which was aggravated by the co-pilot's forceful inputs on the right engine's throttle.
