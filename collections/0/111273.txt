Around the Horn premiered on November 4, 2002.[2] From its premiere until January 2004, the show was hosted by Max Kellerman, who at the time was largely known strictly as a contributor to ESPN's Friday Night Fights. Kellerman departed from the network for Fox Sports[3] [4] and after the show tried out several replacements, current host Tony Reali was named the permanent host in February 2004.[5] As of August 2017, Woody Paige has the most wins in the history of the show, with more than five hundred.[6] Despite early negative reviews due to its argumentative formatting,[7] the show has lasted more than fifteen years on the air, remaining a staple on ESPN.[8]
