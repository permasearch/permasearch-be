The important Bohemian version of the style developed in the court of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor in Prague, which for a brief period[5] became a leading force in the development of European art. Charles came from the Luxembourg dynasty, was tutored by the future Pope Clement VI, and as a youth spent seven years at the French court, as well as visiting Italy twice. This and family relationships gave him intimate links with the various courts of France, including that of the Avignon Papacy, and from 1363 the separate Valois Duchy of Burgundy under Philip the Bold. The Bohemian style initially lacked the elongated figures of other centres, but had a richness and sweetness in female figures that were very influential. Charles had at least one Italian altarpiece, apparently made in Italy and sent to Prague, near where it remains today in his showpiece Karl≈°tejn Castle. For St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague, he first used a French architect, and then the German Peter Parler.[6]
