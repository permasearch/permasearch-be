Makeup is also worn in this sport, but FINA has recommended a more natural look. Motions have been made by FINA, as well as national aquatics officials to regulate and diminish the use of elaborate makeup. In Canada, eye makeup must be smaller than a circle made by the swimmers thumb and forefinger, and be used solely for "natural enhancement".
