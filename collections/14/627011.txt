The Princess and the Goblin was the first animated feature from Wales, and the 25th full-length cartoon from Hungary.[4] The film was produced by the Welsh television station S4C, and the Cardiff-based Siriol studio,[5] along with Hungary's Pannonia and Japan's NHK. Costing $10 million,[3] the film teamed producer/screenwriter Robin Lyons with director József Gémes (from 1982's Heroic Times).[3] Most of the principal animation was produced at the Siriol facilities.[6]
