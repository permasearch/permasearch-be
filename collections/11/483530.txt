Set by Tony Mullane whose career spanned from 1881 to 1894. Mullane pitched through a staggering 4531.1 innings (24 all-time) throwing a total of 343 wild pitches and averaged an errant pitch in 7.56% of those innings. The great Nolan Ryan pitched the second most wild throws with 277. In today's MLB, the active leader is Félix Hernández with 140, just 40% of Mullane. With modern pitchers throwing fewer innings as well as wild pitches this record is safely unbreakable.
