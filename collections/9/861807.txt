Among the South African indigenous peoples (specifically Zulus) these pots also became known as phutu pots, after a popular food prepared in it. The larger pots are normally used for large gatherings e.g. Funerals or weddings to prepare large quantities of food. Wooden spoons referred to as Kombe in the Tsonga language are used for mixing and stirring.
