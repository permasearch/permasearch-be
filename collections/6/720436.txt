The local news reports that Stephen Hawking has discovered a new black hole at the edge of the solar system, but the Griffin family pays no attention to the announcement. Peter alerts the family that he has been selected for jury duty, which he believes is an exclusive experience. After Brian informs him that everyone serves jury duty at some point, Peter tries to be kicked out of court by annoying the others, expressing fabricated prejudices, singing Surfin' Bird, and attempting to discuss the trial outside of the courtroom. When Peter returns home that night, the local news announces that the Earth will be destroyed by the newly discovered, and continually expanding, black hole within the next 24 hours. Frantic over the news, everyone in Quahog attempts to live out the best last day possible. Herbert finally attempts to have sex with Chris, Quagmire has sex with Bonnie, and Peter finally manages to steal a lion from the zoo and say the "you-know-what word" in a black neighborhood (he is well respected as a result). As the countdown reaches its final seconds, Peter confesses to Lois that while he loves her, he hates spending time with his kids. Immediately afterward, the news anchors reveal the black hole report was an April Fools' joke.
