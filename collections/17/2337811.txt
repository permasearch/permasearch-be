Raw cold-pressed linseed oil – commonly known as flax seed oil in nutritional contexts – is easily oxidized, and rapidly becomes rancid, with an unpleasant odour, unless refrigerated.  Even when kept under cool conditions, it has a shelf life of only a few weeks.[9][dubious  – discuss] Oil with an unpleasant or rancid odor should be discarded.  Oxidation of flax seed oil is a major commercial concern, and antioxidants may be added to prevent rancidification.[10] Linseed oil is not generally recommended for use in cooking, yet one study does show that the alpha linolenic acid (ALA) while bound in flaxseed was found to be stable for cooking. When bound to flaxseed ALA can withstand temperatures up to 350 degrees F (176.67 C) for two hours.[11]
