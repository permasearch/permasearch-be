There are at least 17,000 people who have survived infection from the Ebola virus in West Africa; some of them have reported lingering health effects.[347] In early November, a WHO consultant reported: "Many of the survivors are discharged with the so-called Post-Ebola Syndrome. We want to ascertain whether these medical conditions are due to the disease itself, the treatment given or chlorine used during disinfection of the patients. This is a new area for research; little is known about the post-Ebola symptoms."[348][349]
