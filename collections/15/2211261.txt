Temperament is determined through specific behavioral profiles, usually focusing on those that are both easily measurable and testable early in childhood. Commonly tested factors include traits related to energetic capacities (named as "Activity", "Endurance", "Extraversion"), traits related to emotionality (such as irritability, frequency of smiling, and an approach or avoidance of unfamiliar events.[1][3] There is generally a low correlation between descriptions by teachers and behavioral observations by scientists of features used in determining temperament.[5] Temperament is hypothesized to be associated with biological factors, but these have proven to be complex and diverse.[1][3]
