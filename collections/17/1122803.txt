In his autobiography, Dixon explained that the lyrics were "his [Bo Diddley's] bag 100%Â ... and when I told him about it, he like it immediately".[4] Diddley's original recording breaks the fourth wall by encouraging the listener to turn his or her radio up after the first verse. In 1962, the song reached number 21 on the Billboard magazine R&B chart and number 48 on the Billboard Hot 100.[2]
