This model takes into account only atomic hydrogenÂ : Temperature larger than 3000 K breaks molecules, lower than 50 000 K leaves atoms in their ground state. It is assumed that influence of other atoms (He ...) is negligible. Pressure is assumed very low, so that durations of free paths of atoms are larger than ~ 1 nanosecond duration of light pulses which make ordinary, temporally incoherent light .
