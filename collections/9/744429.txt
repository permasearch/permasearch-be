There are also several extrajudicial administrative courts. The Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings adjudicates matters for all city agencies unless otherwise provided for by executive order, rule, law or pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. The Department of Finance Adjudication Division (Parking Violations Bureau) adjudicates parking violations, and the Tax Appeals Tribunal adjudicates disputes regarding city-administered taxes other than real estate assessment claims, which are adjudicated by the city Tax Commission. The state DMV Traffic Violations Bureau adjudicates non-parking traffic violations.
