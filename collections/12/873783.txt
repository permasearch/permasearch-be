The character of Molly was introduced as the daughter of local baker Diggory Compton (Eric Potts) in 2005. She was a former class mate of character Fiz Brown (Jennie McAlpine); Molly was very resentful against Fiz, who had bullied her at school. She worked in the bakery until her father's departure and worked briefly as a kennel-maid before becoming an assistant to Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin) at the Corner Shop.
