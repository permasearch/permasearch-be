Determinations of Pluto's size had been complicated by its atmosphere,[109] and hydrocarbon haze.[107] In March 2014, Lellouch, de Bergh et al. published findings regarding methane mixing ratios in Pluto's atmosphere consistent with a Plutonian diameter greater than 2360 km, with a "best guess" of 2368 km.[111] On July 13, 2015, images from NASA's New Horizons mission Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI), along with data from the other instruments, determined Pluto's diameter to be 2,370 km (1,470 mi),[115][116] which was later revised to be 2,372 km (1,474 mi) on July 24,[112] and later to 7006237400000000000♠2374±8 km.[6] Using radio occultation data from the New Horizons Radio Science Experiment (REX), the diameter was found to be 7006237660000000000♠2376.6±3.2 km.[5]
