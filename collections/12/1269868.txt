In 1952, Norrköping in Sweden became one of the first cities in Europe to fluoridate its water supply.[99] It was declared illegal by the Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden in 1961, re-legalized in 1962[100] and finally prohibited by the parliament in 1971,[101] after considerable debate. The parliament majority said that there were other and better ways of reducing tooth decay than water fluoridation. Four cities received permission to fluoridate tap water when it was legal.[99]:56–57 An official commission was formed, which published its final report in 1981. They recommended other ways of reducing tooth decay (improving food and oral hygiene habits) instead of fluoridating tap water. They also found that many people found fluoridation to infringe upon personal liberty/freedom of choice by forcing them to be medicated, and that the long-term effects of fluoridation were insufficiently acknowledged. They also lacked a proper study on the effects of fluoridation on formula-fed infants.[99]:29 In the year 2004 the allowed amount of fluoride in the water was decreased to 1,5 mg/l.[102]
