In cases of prolonged consumption of excess amounts of caffeine, studies show that individuals exhibit a reduced response to HPA axis activation by the hormone ACTH and a generalized increase in basal levels of stress hormone corticosterone. This led researchers to conclude that "caffeine consumption decreases adrenal gland sensitivity to ACTH. A blunted HPA response to psychological stress has been seen in humans with panic disorder compared to healthy controls following administration of a psychosocial test".[9]
