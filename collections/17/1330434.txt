"Over You" is a country ballad written by Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton about a personal experience Shelton had as a teenager when his older brother was killed in a car accident. According to Lambert, she decided to record the song because of Shelton's emotional connection to the song: "Blake said he couldnâ€™t record it for himself or sing it onstage every night, but he would be honored for me to."[1]
