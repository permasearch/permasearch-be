All the Monoliths are black, extremely flat, non-reflective rectangular solids. In the novels (not in the films), their dimensions are in the precise ratio of 1 : 4 : 9 (the squares of the first three positive integers). These dimensions are the main source of debate about the simple external design of the Monoliths. It is suggested in the 2001 novel that this number series does not stop at three dimensions.[1]
