According to descriptions by Katarina and Henri, Mogadorians soldiers/scouts have white albino-like skin, black eyes, and serrated teeth, which are actually vat-born/clones, made by Setrakus Ra and his scientists to increase the Mogadorian population problem and made stronger, faster, but not as smart as a Trueborn Mog. Trueborn Mogadorians are effectively identical in appearance to humans. All are gregarious and share a predilection for cities and crowded places. The Mogadorians are having a harder time conceiving children. And even if a child is born, mothers often die in childbirth.
