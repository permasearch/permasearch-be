It has been observed that the value of Î¨w decreases as the cell becomes more dehydrated,[30] but scientists have speculated whether this value will continue to decrease but never fall to zero, or if the value can be less than zero. There have been studies[37][38] which show that negative cell pressures can exist in xerophytic plants, but a paper by M. T. Tyree explores whether this is possible, or a conclusion based on misinterpreted data. In his paper, he concludes that by miscategorizing "bound" and "free" water in a cell, researchers that claimed to have found negative turgor pressure values were incorrect. By analyzing isotherms of apoplastic and symplastic water, he shows that negative turgor pressures cannot be present within arid plants due to net water loss of the specimen during droughts. Despite his analysis and interpretation of data, negative turgor pressure values are still used within the scientific community.[39]
