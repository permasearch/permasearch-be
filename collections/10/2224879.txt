Between the World and Me is Coates's second book, following his 2008 memoir The Beautiful Struggle. Since then, and especially in the 18 months including the Ferguson unrest preceding his new book's release, Coates somberly believed less in the soul and its aspirational sense of eventual justice. Coates felt that he had become more radicalized.[2] The book's title comes from a poem by Richard Wright,[6] which is now published in numerous collections and was first published in the July/August 1935 issue of the journal Partisan Review.[7] Wright's poem is about a black man discovering the site of a lynching and becoming incapacitated with fear, creating a barrier between himself and the world.[8][9] Despite many changes in Between the World and Me, Coates always planned to end the book with the story of Mabel Jones. The only endorsement Coates sought was that of novelist Toni Morrison, which he received. Between the World and Me was published by Spiegel & Grau in 2015.[2]
