The legal name of the organization is the Four Seasons Partnership, formed by Gaudio and Valli taken after a failed audition in 1960. While singers, producers, and musicians have come and gone, Gaudio and Valli remain the band's constant (with each owning fifty percent of the act and its assets, including virtually all of its recording catalog).[1][2] Gaudio no longer plays live, leaving Valli the only member of the band from its inception who is touring as of  2017[update].[3]
