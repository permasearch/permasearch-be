In far western Thargomindah, late in the 19th century, the civic fathers set up the first natural gas powered generating station in the world.[21] Electricity for lighting was also generated from the pressure of artesian water bores.[22] The use of bore water at Thargomindah has been described as Australia's first hydro-electricity scheme and operated until 1951.[23]
