Shoulder Girdle strengthening is a preventative procedure to help minimize tissue damage or other injuries while completing complex progressions in sports. Strengthening of the shoulder area can done by exercising specific muscle groups which are as follow. The positioners of the shoulder are the rotator cuff muscles: supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis. Propellers are major movers to create force with the arms, which include larger muscles: pectoralis major/minor, latissimus dorsi, and trapezius. The stabilizers of the shoulder are the deltoid group. Several other muscles should not be forgotten that assist with control of scapula thoracic rhythm: rhomboid muscles, serratus posteriors, levator scapulae muscle, and others smaller muscles.[15] A key way to prevent shoulder injury is making sure to do slow and in control stretches and exercises in proper form with proper progression. In any sporting activity proper progression should include strengthening below 90 degrees, then progressing into a 90 degree range, and then full overhead exercises.[16] Specific progression exercises should target rotator cuff muscles and other muscles that attach to the shoulder girdle. Many individuals at gyms are injured because of incorrect equipment use. An experienced professional should assist with program development, progression, and implementation in injury prevention such as a certified personal trainer. If a minor shoulder injury does occur and isnâ€™t severe, these measures can be taken to activate and recuperate the muscles: light stretching, light weightlifting, warm or cold packs as needed, and therapeutic message. Each sport has a different shoulder movement mechanics, and when executed correctly it will put less strain on the shoulder which in-turn preserves the shoulder longer.
