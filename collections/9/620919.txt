Lestat then turns and walks to where Jesse is lying lifeless, and cradling her in his arms, gives her his blood, turning her into a vampire. Jesse, now a vampire, and Lestat then return the journal to the Talamasca. After they leave, a scene of David reading the journal is shown as Marius's voice catches his attention, cheerfully saying, "Hello, David". The film closes with Lestat and Jesse walking away, among mortals, into the night. As they exit it is shown that they are now a couple, holding hands.
