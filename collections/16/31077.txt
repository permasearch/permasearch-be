Marceline has been critically acclaimed and is popular with fans of Adventure Time. The character was also the focus of a miniseries entitled Stakes (2015), which aired during the show's seventh season. Early in the show's history, Ward himself has stated that Marceline is his favorite character in the series because he does not know everything about her history and backstory, which he noted adds a mysterious element to her character. Despite the positivity, the episodes "What Was Missing" and "Sky Witch" became somewhat controversial because of an implied past relationship between Princess Bubblegum and Marceline.
