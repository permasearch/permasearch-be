The "One Less Lonely Girl" phrase spawned several products from Bieber's official store to have the coined phrase on them. One of the products is a cranberry colored scarf, the same color as a shirt Bieber wore in the music video.[21] One end of the scarf has a patch with the "One Less Lonely Girl" phrase on it and the other end has a signature by Bieber.[21] Tamar Antai of MTV Buzzworthy called the scarf "boundsly adorable" and "a total bargain for less loneliness".[21] Another product was a white t-shirt that had the phrase stylized as "1LessLâ™¥nleyGirl" in variations of sky blue colors. In December 2009, Bieber teamed up with 1-800-Flowers for a promotion. The company came out with a "One Less Lonely Girl"-branded bouquet of red "intuition" roses and a Valentine's Day card from Bieber, depicting the singer holding a heart.[22][23] Packages could either have a twenty-four or twelve count stems, and a red, silver or clear vase.[22] The flowers could be set for delivery between January 12-February 12, 2010, before Valentine's Day.[22] The first one thousand customers received a free replica of the scarf in the "One Less Lonely Girl" video.[24] A portion of the proceeds went to Pencils of Promise, a charity that helps build schools in developing areas of the world. Bieber frequently participates in the charity.[22] A contest was also set in place in which a winner would be greeted with their flowers by Bieber himself, or could win the flower bouquet and other Justin Bieber merchandise.[25]
