Castroneves won the Indianapolis 500 in 2001, 2002, and 2009, making him one of only nine drivers, and the only active driver, to have won at least three times. He also finished second at Indy in 2003, 2014, and 2017. Castroneves has won four pole positions for the Indy 500, including back-to-back poles in 2009 and 2010, the first driver to do so since Scott Brayton in 1996. He is also one of only five drivers – along with Wilbur Shaw, Mauri Rose, Bill Vukovich, and Al Unser being the other four – and the only active driver to win the Indy 500 in back-to-back races.
