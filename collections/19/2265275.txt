In 2015, Quinn became President and CEO of Women in Need (WIN), a nonprofit organization that is one of New York City's largest providers of services to homeless women and children and a role she still currently occupies. WIN serves more than 11,600 people annually and has placed 750 families into permanent housing last year all while operating 11 homeless shelters in four different boroughs.[61][when?] Since Quinn's first job was as a housing organizer for poor and homeless people, Quinn noted that she had come full-circle with her new role as leader of WIN. Quinn said she was hoping to continue the good work of WIN's previous longtime leader, Bonnie Stone, and use a holistic approach to help women facing domestic violence, eviction, and other issues.[62] Quinn was forthcoming in her approach having taken New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg to court contesting his homelessness policy. [63] Specifically, Quinn disliked the policy for not only was it created not in accordance with the rule making established under the Citywide Administrative Protection Act (CAPA) but, also, it made it increasingly harder for homeless adults to seek refuge in shelters. [64] Quinn felt obligated to address a growing, local program in her community that she could no longer ignore given her leadership role on New York's City Council. Leading the Council as Speaker, Quinn successfully shut down the policy measure proposed by Mayor Bloomberg that would require homeless persons to prove that they lacked alternative housing or virtually could not live anywhere else before shelter provisions were made by the city.
