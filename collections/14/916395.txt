On February 14 the Repeal of the Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers Rule (Pub.L. 115â€“4, H.J.Res. 41) was signed, nullifying the Securities and Exchange Commission regulation known as the "Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers" rule.[515] The SEC regulation was mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and which was similar to transparency initiatives adopted by the European Union and Canada.[516] Advocates argued that "Disclosure of Payments" rule prevented companies from bribing foreign governments and engaging in other forms of corruption. Those who argued for the its repeal, claimed that rule had placed an excessive burden on American companies and created a competitive disadvantage.[515]
