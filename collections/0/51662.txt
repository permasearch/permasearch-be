The story is loosely based on the life of singer Janis Joplin. Originally titled Pearl, after Joplin's nickname, and the title of her last album, it was fictionalized after her family declined to allow the producers the rights to her story.[4] It was written by Bill Kerby and Bo Goldman from a story by Bill Kerby, and directed by Mark Rydell.[3]
