Co-writer Kevin Parker of Tame Impala was unaware that the track would be on West's album until a friend informed him that it was being played at West's listening party and Parker thought he was credited on "Ghost Town", not "Violent Crimes".[2] In October 2018, West took to Twitter and revealed that co-writer Pardison Fontaine was the person held most responsible for writing the track, with him claiming in the tweet to have "changed 2 lines" but giving the credit to Fontaine for writing "the entire song".[3] Tyler, The Creator revealed when speaking to GQ that the song's chords made him cry.[4]
