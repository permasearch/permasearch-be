All Xbox One consoles were initially shipped with the Kinect sensor includedâ€”a holdover from a previously-announced, but retracted mandate requiring Kinect to be plugged into the console at all times for it to function.[85] In June 2014, bundles without Kinect were made available,[86] along with an updated Xbox One SDK allowing game developers to explicitly disable Kinect skeletal tracking, freeing up system resources that were previously reserved for Kinect even if it was disabled or unplugged.[86][87]
