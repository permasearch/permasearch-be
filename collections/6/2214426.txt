Critics of feudalism have complained of a "culture of feudal impunity", where local police will refuse to pursue charges against an influential landowning family even when murder or mayhem have been committed;[6][8] of abuse of power by some landlords who may place enemies in "private prisons" and "enslave" local people through debt bondage;[1] the harming of "progress and prosperity" by feudals who discourage the education of their "subjects" for fear it will weaken feudal power;[7] the giving of "space" to extremists (such as the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan) who peasants turn to in the search for deliverance from the cruelty of feudal lords;[7] and an agriculture sector made stagnant by absentee landlordism.[7]
