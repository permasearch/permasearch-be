The Angus is naturally polled and solid black or red, though the udder may be white. The native colour is black, but more recently red colours have emerged.[2] The UK registers both in the same herd book, but in the US they are regarded as two separate breeds – Red Angus and Black Angus. Black Angus is the most common breed of beef cattle in the US, with 324,266 animals registered in 2005.[3][4] In 2014, the British Cattle Movement Service named Angus the UK's most popular native beef breed, and the second most popular beef breed overall.[5]
