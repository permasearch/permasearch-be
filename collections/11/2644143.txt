On September 13, 2018 President Trump began tweeting about the results of the GWU study and his administration's response to the disaster. He called the recovery efforts "an incredible, unsung success" despite widespread condemnation of its inadequacy.[33][34] He claimed "3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico"—referring to Irma and Maria, and that these reports of large numbers of deaths were caused by "bad politics" pushed by Democrats to smear his image.[32] Described as a conspiracy theory by media outlets, Trump made these accusations without evidence.[35][33]
