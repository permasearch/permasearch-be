After a four-year gap, construction of Stage 4 began, which would take the freeway to Erindale Road.[19] The first half of the stage, up to Karrinyup Road, opened on 12 December 1983, while the project wasn't complete until 21 September 1984.[11]:308 [17] It was opened by the state Minister for Transport Julian Grill, MLA. This section completed 24 kilometres (15 mi) of freeway in Perth, from Bull Creek to Balcatta.[21] The next two stages were constructed together, extending the freeway to Hepburn Avenue. Stage 5 was from Erindale to Warwick Road, and involved excavating a large quantity of material, including 600,000 tonnes (590,000 long tons; 660,000 short tons) of limestone. That stage cost $22.73 million, while Stage 6 only cost $8.06 million.[11]:308–9 Both stages were opened together, on 6 August 1986.[11]:309 [17] The first stage of Reid Highway (then known as the North Perimeter Highway[22]) was built at the same time, and opened on 16 May 1986.[17] A further extension to Ocean Reef Road was opened on 2 July 1988 by the Federal Minister for Transport, Peter Morris,[23] at a cost of $17.5 million. The state and federal governments provided most of the funds, $9.7 million and $5.2 million respectively. The City of Wanneroo contributed $1.3 million, Joondalup Development Corporation $1 million, and land developers $300,000, as they wanted the freeway built ahead of schedule to stimulate local development.[11]:309–10
