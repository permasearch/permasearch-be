The state's name appears to originate from an earlier Spanish name, Arizonac, derived from the O'odham name alĭ ṣonak, meaning "small spring," which initially applied only to an area near the silver mining camp of Planchas de Plata, Sonora.[11][12][13][14] To the European settlers, their pronunciation sounded like "Arissona".[15] The area is still known as alĭ ṣonak in the O'odham language.[16] Another possible origin is the Basque phrase haritz ona ("the good oak"), as there were numerous Basque sheepherders in the area.[17][18][19]
