Plans from a number of European aircraft manufacturers called for a successor to the relatively successful BAC One-Eleven, and to replace the 737–200 and DC-9.[17] Germany's MBB (Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm), British Aircraft Corporation, Sweden's Saab and Spain's CASA worked on the EUROPLANE, a 180- to 200-seat aircraft.[17][18] It was abandoned after intruding on A310 specifications.[19] VFW-Fokker, Dornier and Hawker Siddeley worked on a number of 150-seat designs.[17]
