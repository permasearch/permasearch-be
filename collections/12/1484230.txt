Oracle Cluster Synchronization Services daemon (OCSSd) provides basic ‘group services’ support. Group Services is a distributed group membership system that allows the applications to coordinate activities to achieve a common result. As such, it provides synchronization services between nodes, access to the node membership information, as well as enabling basic cluster services, including cluster group services and cluster locking. It can also run without integration with vendor clusterware. Failure of OCSSd causes the machine to reboot to avoid a split-brain situation. This is also required in a single instance configuration if Automatic Storage Management (ASM) is used. ASM was a new feature in Oracle 10g. OCSSd runs as the "oracle" user.
