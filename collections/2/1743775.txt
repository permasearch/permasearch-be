I think that the previous edit was meaningful and useful. Energy is an abstraction if ever there was one. Its non-uniqueness is part of the meaning of that. One can measure the length of a rod, and there is no arbitrary zero adjustment for that; the length of a rod is a more concrete, less abstract and less purely mathematical, quantity, than the energy of a system. I agree that it is useful, as you suggest, to note that the arbitrary constant is an additive one.Chjoaygame (talk) 23:52, 11 August 2011 (UTC)
