In 2010, Lopez wrote the song "Bet Against the American Dream" which was featured on the NPR program "This American Life". The song was written in the style of a Broadway show tune, and parodied a scene from the musical "The Producers" to illustrate the story of a real-life hedge fund called Magnetar that made millions of dollars when the housing market collapsed.
