Thus, the entire SPD faction in the Reichstag voted in favour of the war bonds on 4 August 1914. Two days earlier, the Free Association of German Trade Unions had already agreed to refrain from labour strikes and demands for higher wages for the duration of the war. It was with those decisions by the party and the unions that the full mobilisation of the German Army became possible. Haase explained the decision against his will with the words: "We will not let the fatherland alone in the hour of need!" The Emperor welcomed the so-called "truce" (Burgfrieden), declaring: "Ich kenne keine Parteien mehr, ich kenne nur noch Deutsche!" ("I no longer see parties, I see only Germans!").[4]
