Starting in mid-2018, Pysonix will introduce the Rocket Pass, a type of battle pass. Each Pass, which lasts a few months, will have challenges and other opportunities through playing Rocket League that allow the player to increase the tier of the Pass, from which new unique customization options tied to that Pass can be unlocked. While the base Pass will be free to all players, a flat-cost premium Pass can be purchased which accelerates the rate the Pass can level up.[21]
