Let     m    {\displaystyle m\!}    be the plaintext message that Alice wants to secretly transmit to Bob and let      E  k      {\displaystyle E_{k}\!}   be the encryption cipher, where        k      {\displaystyle _{k}\!}   is a cryptographic key. Alice must first transform the plaintext into ciphertext,     c    {\displaystyle c\!}  , in order to securely send the message to Bob, as follows:
