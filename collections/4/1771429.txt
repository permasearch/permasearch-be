Interest in preserving the open land along the blufftop arose in the 1880s as the local population boomed. The City of Saint Paul struggled to buy the land from its various private owners, as some proved unwilling to sell and others sold to real estate speculators first. Enough property was assembled by 1896 for the city to begin landscaping and building visitor amenities.[9] In sharp contrast to modern practices, 11 mounds were leveled on the grounds that they blocked the view of the river.[10] Only the six largest mounds were left.[7]
