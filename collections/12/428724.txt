The main story ("Chaos") ran in Avengers #500-503 and a special epilogue ("Avengers Finale") and drew considerable controversy due to its overt continuity errors related to its main plot and deaths and vilification of classic Avengers members. These continuity errors and fan backlash would lead to retconning of the events in "Avengers: The Children's Crusade" and "AXIS," as well as the "Marquis of Death" story line from Mark Millar's Fantastic Four run and the Kurt Busiek and George Perez "Avengers/JLA" mini-series and J. Michael Straczynski's "Amazing Spider-Man" run.
