In the 1950s and 1960s, members left the Cloud Club for other clubs. Texaco, whose executives comprised most of the Cloud Club's membership, moved to Westchester County in 1977,[185] and the club closed two years later.[181] Although there have been several projects to rehabilitate the club or transform it into a disco or a gastronomic club, these plans have never materialized,[182][186] as then-owner Cooke reportedly did not want a "conventional" restaurant operating within the old club.[187] Tishman Speyer rented the top two floors of the old Cloud Club.[188] The old staircase has been removed, as have many of the original decorations,[182] which prompted objections from the Art Deco Society of New York.[186]
