Blue and red are the traditional colours of Paris, used on the city's coat of arms. Blue is identified with Saint Martin,[citation needed] red with Saint Denis.[citation needed] At the storming of the Bastille in 1789, the Paris militia wore blue and red cockades on their hats. White had long featured prominently on French flags and is described as the "ancient French colour" by Lafayette.[2] White was added to the "revolutionary" colours of the militia cockade to "nationalise" the design, thus creating the tricolour cockade.[2] Although Lafayette identified the white stripe with the nation, other accounts identify it with the monarchy.[5] Lafayette denied that the flag contains any reference to the red-and-white livery of the Duc d'Orléans. Despite this, Orléanists adopted the tricolour as their own.
