Preliminary findings from BP's internal investigation indicated several serious warning signs in the hours prior to the blowout.[37][38] Equipment readings indicated gas bubbling into the well, which could signal an impending blowout.[25] The heavy drilling mud in the pipes initially held down the gas.[34] A House Energy and Commerce Committee statement in June 2010 noted that in a number of cases leading up to the explosion, BP appears to have chosen riskier procedures to save time or money, sometimes against the advice of its staff or contractors.[39]
