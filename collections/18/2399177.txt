Despite the departure of their leading scientists and engineers, in March 1961 Fairchild announced their first commercial IC series, named "Micrologic", and then spent a year on creating a family of logic ICs.[74] By that time ICs were already produced by their competitors. Texas Instruments abandoned the IC designs by Kilby and received a contract for a series of planar ICs for space satellites, and then for the LGM-30 Minuteman ballistic missiles.[48] Whereas the ICs for the onboard computers of the Apollo spacecraft were designed by Fairchild, most of them were produced by Raytheon and Philco Ford.[79][48] Each of these computers contained about 5,000 standard logic ICs,[79] and during their manufacture, the price for an IC dropped from US$1,000 to US$20â€“30. In this way, NASA and the Pentagon prepared the ground for the non-military IC market.[80]
