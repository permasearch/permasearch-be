On 15 August 1975 a few sacked army officers, disgruntled junior officers and NCOs secretly planned and assassinated President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his entire family at his personal residence in Dhanmondi, Dhaka, except for his two daughters (Sheikh Hasina and Sheikh Rehana) who were abroad.[12] Five of those responsible officers were executed in January 2010 while others are still absconding and are outside Bangladesh.[13] After the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, new government led by Khandkar Mushtaq Ahmed and supported by the coup plotters was set in place. Khandakar Mushtaq passed the Indemnity ordinance which provided immunity to the assassins of Sheikh Muibur Rahman.[14]
