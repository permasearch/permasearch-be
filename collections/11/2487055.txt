I'm Glad You're Here With Me Tonight was the second Neil Diamond album in a row to also garner a television special, which was broadcast on November 17, 1977 over the NBC television network.[2] The television special received a Directors Guild of America award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Musical/Variety for Director Art Fisher, Associate Director David Grossman and Stage Manager Bob Graner. It was also nominated for three Emmy Awards. The special was a thematic and "behind the scenes" based program with interspersed live performances. It also features a pioneering segment with one of the earliest broadcasts of what would come to be known as a music video with its treatment of Diamond's song "Morningside".
