In August 2011, the Internet blogger Paul Staines—who writes a political blog as Guido Fawkes and heads the Restore Justice Campaign—launched an e-petition on the Downing Street website calling for the restoration of the death penalty for those convicted of the murder of children and police officers.[52] The petition was one of several in support or opposition of capital punishment to be published by the government with the launch of its e-petitions website. Petitions attracting 100,000 signatures would prompt a parliamentary debate on a particular topic, but not necessarily lead to any Parliamentary Bills being put forward.[53] When the petition closed on 4 February 2012 it had received 26,351 signatures in support of restoring capital punishment,[54] but a counter-petition calling to retain the ban on capital punishment received 33,455 signatures during the same time period.[55]
