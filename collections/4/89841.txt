Agatha Mary Clarissa Miller was born on 15 September 1890, into a wealthy upper middle-class family in Torquay, Devon.[13]:1 Her mother Clara was born in Belfast in 1854 to Captain Frederick Boehmer and Mary Ann West as the couple's only daughter. Captain Boehmer was killed in a riding accident while stationed on Jersey in April 1863, leaving his widow Mary Ann to raise her children alone on a meagre income. Mary Ann's sister Margaret had married a wealthy American, Nathaniel Frary Miller, in 1863, and the couple lived in Southbourne, West Sussex. Margaret had no children of her own, and so the two sisters arranged that Clara should be raised by her aunt and uncle. It was here she met her future husband, an American stockbroker named Frederick Alvah Miller, who was the son of Nathaniel's first marriage.[13]:2â€“4
