During the siege and for days afterwards, the toll of casualties remained unclear. Eyewitnesses were reported to have seen 50 bodies in the mall.[57] In addition, at first there were reported hostages taken by attackers, but later it became apparent no hostages were ever held,[2] other eyewitnesses also said that they had seen dozens wounded.[4] An unnamed local hospital reported that it was overwhelmed with the number of wounded being brought in and that it had consequently diverted victims to a second facility.[17] At least 67 people were killed, possibly including four terrorists.[2] In addition to numerous Kenyans who were killed, at least 19 foreigners of different nationalities also died.[58] The National Disaster Operation Centre said that the wounded ranged in age from 2 to 78.[29] Sources said 175 people were wounded,[59] including 11 soldiers.[60] There are also claims of torture carried out by the terrorists.[61] Notable victims included Kenyan journalist Ruhila Adatia-Sood, President Uhuru Kenyatta's nephew Mbugua Mwangi and his fiancÃ©e Rosemary Wahito ,[62] Ghanaian poet and diplomat Kofi Awoonor[63] and Canadian diplomat Annemarie Desloges.[48] Kenyan interior minister Joseph Ole Lenku said Israelis were not targeted. "This time, the story is not about Israel. The minister is saying that this is an internal Kenyan issue. His security forces tell him that this terror organisation was not targeting Israelis."[64]
