Many future matches attempted to replicate some of the spots from the match at King of the Ring. In his autobiography Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks, Foley wrote that he could not remember much of what happened, and he had to watch a tape of the match to write about it. The match was voted Pro Wrestling Illustrated's Match of the Year for 1998. Although many fans regard the match as a classic, it has generated controversy as well. Critics charge that the falls in the match were so extreme and they set the bar for further bumps so high that the inevitable attempts to equal or surpass them would be very dangerous for any wrestlers involved. While WWE continues to have Hell in a Cell matches—and even now has an annual pay-per-view featuring the match—the match itself has been toned down somewhat in the wake of WWE moving towards more family-friendly programming since 2008.[19] Foley himself acknowledged in 2014 while being interviewed about the Monday Night Wars that had the match taken place today, WWE would have immediately stopped the match after the first fall off the top of the cage "and rightfully so."[20]
