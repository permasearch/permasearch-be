Brother and sister Chad (Dylan Minnette) and Kelly (Debbie Podowski) are facing difficulties: their father has abandoned the family, and their mother (Debbie Podowski), while concerned for her children, is busy with work. Chad pretends that everything is fine, but Kelly senses tension hiding beneath his apparent stoicism. The siblings promise to always be there for one another--but their bond is tested when a mysterious traveling funhouse comes to their neighborhood and sets up in an abandoned junkyard. Chad feels inexplicably drawn to the funhouse, where the lone Carny (James Pizzinato) who runs the facility entices him inside. The end of the attraction features an animatronic family eating dinner and arguing. Chad loses his temper an, at the urging of a voice heard over the room's speakers, destroys the entire set with a giant sledgehammer. Chad loves the rush of destruction and begins to act nasty and short-tempered with his mother and sister at home. Soon, he cannot stop visiting the funhouse and takes more and more joy with every round of destructive anger--and becomes more and more violent and cruel outside the attraction. Eventually, Chad mutates into a twisted version of his former self bringing his violent tendencies home and smashing everything in his kitchen. Kelly follows her monstrous brother to the funhouse where she urges him to face his own rage before it consumes him. Her words move Chad and he smashes his reflection in a mirror freeing him from the grip of his anger. The siblings leave the funhouse where the Carny urges them home. But when they turn around to confront him, both the Carny and the entire set-up have vanished into thin air.
