As a recurring gag, Dale sees several signs of the affair, but always draws the wrong conclusions. On one occasion, he finds him trying to sneak inside to have sex with Nancy, but thinks he is trying to steal his mower; when Dale reports having a vision of a Native American making love with his wife and Joseph (in full Native American ceremonial garb) being handed to him, he then assumes that means he is part Native American himself; when John Redcorn says straight to a TV camera that "I slept with Hank's best friend's wife for thirteen years" with Dale inches away, Dale thinks he means Bill's wife and not his. John's access to Nancy is caused primarily by Dale ignorantly allowing him to be her masseur and often trusting her to him to keep her away from other men who may have affairs with her. It is revealed in Season 6 that Dale believes John to be gay, which partially explains his contentment with letting him be alone with his wife so often.
