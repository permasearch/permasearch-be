On August 8, 2017, the LA Stadium Premiere Center in Playa Vista, California opened as a place for suite buyers and season ticket holders to be able to preview the stadium. The center contains a massive replica model of the stadium which will include: ribbon-like LED high definition jumbotron and LED ribbon boards that go from the field to the ceiling, giving potential buyers a preview of what they can expect when the stadium opens.[33][34][35]
