Other unethical practices exposed at the Inquiry were Green's 'baby smears' experiment in which cervical smears were taken from newborn baby girls without their parents' consent, all part of Green's theory that some women were born with abnormal cervical cells and that these were not linked to cervical cancer. Also exposed was the hospital's practice of teaching vaginal examinations and IUD insertions on unconsenting women anaesthetised for operations.[10]
