Many mods drove motor scooters, usually Vespas or Lambrettas.[66] Scooters were a practical and affordable form of transportation for 1960s teens, and in the early 1970s, public transport stopped relatively early in the night. For teens with low-paying jobs, scooters were cheaper and easier to park than cars, and they could be bought through newly-available hire purchase plans.
