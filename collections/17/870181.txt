The S5 contains a number of new security features. The fingerprint reader can be used to unlock the phone, while an SDK is available so third-party developers may offer fingerprint-oriented functionality in their apps; for example, PayPal integrated support for the fingerprint sensor to authenticate online purchases.[38] The S5 also adds "Private Mode", which allows users to maintain hidden apps and file folders that cannot be accessed without additional authentication.[16][17] The camera app was updated with a new "Shot & More" menu that allows users to make edits to photos after they are taken, and also adds a new selective focus mode.[39]
