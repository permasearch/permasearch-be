The film was shot in CinemaScope on location in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. Shooting began in the Winter of 1960. Tuesday Weld replaced Lois Smith as Selena Cross at the last minute in December 1960, while Luciana Paluzzi took over Barbara Steele's role as Ted's wife.[16] By this time, Crawford also pulled out as Mrs. Roberta Carter, and Davis was unsuccessfully searched as her replacement.[16] Mary Astor was eventually cast in the role. However some of her scenes were cut before the final release. After failing to have Michael Rossi discharged, she goes home and burns her house down in order to kill Ted and his wife. In the trailer for the film we see the fire but not in the movie itself. There is even reference to a fire as one of the characters refers to it.
