Horses, particularly colts, sometimes are physically capable of reproduction at about 18Â months, but domesticated horses are rarely allowed to breed before the age of three, especially females.[53] Horses four years old are considered mature, although the skeleton normally continues to develop until the age of six; maturation also depends on the horse's size, breed, sex, and quality of care. Larger horses have larger bones; therefore, not only do the bones take longer to form bone tissue, but the epiphyseal plates are larger and take longer to convert from cartilage to bone. These plates convert after the other parts of the bones, and are crucial to development.[54]
