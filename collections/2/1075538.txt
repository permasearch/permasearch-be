Doyle was born on 22 May 1859 at 11 Picardy Place, Edinburgh, Scotland.[6][7] His father, Charles Altamont Doyle, was born in England, of Irish Catholic descent, and his mother, Mary (nÃ©e Foley), was Irish Catholic. His parents married in 1855.[8] In 1864 the family dispersed because of Charles's growing alcoholism, and the children were temporarily housed across Edinburgh. In 1867, the family came together again and lived in squalid tenement flats at 3 Sciennes Place.[9] Doyle's father died in 1893, in the Crichton Royal, Dumfries, after many years of psychiatric illness.[10][11]
