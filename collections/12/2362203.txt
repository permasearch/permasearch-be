There, over a three-day period in October 1518, Luther defended himself under questioning by papal legate Cardinal Cajetan. The Pope's right to issue indulgences was at the centre of the dispute between the two men.[53][54] The hearings degenerated into a shouting match. More than writing his theses, Luther's confrontation with the church cast him as an enemy of the pope.[55] Cajetan's original instructions had been to arrest Luther if he failed to recant, but the legate desisted from doing so.[56] Luther slipped out of the city at night, unbeknownst to Cajetan.[57]
