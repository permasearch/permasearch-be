Tim Claypole (who shares his name with the mischievous and delightfully campy jester Timothy Claypole from the 1980s kids' TV show Rentaghost) is the new bar manager of The Archer at the start of Series 7. He turns it into a theme pub, and the only evidence of the John Barrowman theme is a single framed photograph. He temporarily employs Janet as a barmaid before hiring Donna, who soon takes over his position as manager. Although appearing to be gay, he maintains that he is happily married to a rugby-playing wife named Helena and has children. In series 8 Tim is more involved with the group in helping solve their problems such as advising Donna to stay away from Gaz. By series 9, Tim has given the Archer a makeover and has made peace with his best friends Gaz and Donna, but then his younger sister Cassie arrives into his life and causes chaos. With the arrival of Cassie and all the subsequent changes in his life, Tim reveals that Helena has left him and he is gay. He later meets a new love interest, Leonard.
