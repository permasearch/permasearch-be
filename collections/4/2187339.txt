This has approximately a chi-squared distribution with k − 1 degrees of freedom.  The fact that there are k − 1 degrees of freedom is a consequence of the restriction     ∑  N  i   = n   {\displaystyle \sum N_{i}=n}  .  We know there are k observed cell counts, however, once any k − 1 are known, the remaining one is uniquely determined.  Basically, one can say, there are only k − 1 freely determined cell counts, thus k − 1 degrees of freedom.
