The main criticism toward the film was the animation. Many criticized it as cheap, wooden, non-engaging, and out-of-date;[36][37][39][40][41][45][46] some reviewers drew negative comparisons to 1960s marionette-based shows Thunderbirds and Fireball XL5,[39][42][46][47] although George Lucas previously said the animation style was a deliberate homage to such shows.[13] Tom Long of The Detroit News said the animation "is downright weak compared to what's generally seen on screens these days"[48] and said the characters are so stiff they look like they were "carved by Pinocchio's father."[48] Roger Ebert said "the characters have hair that looks molded from Play-Doh, bodies that seem arthritic, and moving lips on half-frozen facesâ€”all signs that shortcuts were taken in the animation work."[37] McCarthy said "the movements, both of the characters and the compositions, look mechanical, and the mostly familiar characters have all the facial expressiveness of Easter Island statues." But some of the same reviewers who criticized the animation acknowledged some positive elements about it; McCarthy said it allowed for "somewhat more dramatic compositions and color schemes,"[40] and Carrie Rickey, of The Philadelphia Inquirer, said the scenery and backgrounds were "vivid and alive",[41] although she said the characters "move as you would imagine the statues at a waxworks might."[40]
