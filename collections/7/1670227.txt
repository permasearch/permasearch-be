Shortly before recording began for the band's debut album (Pronounced 'Lĕh-'nérd 'Skin-'nérd), Wilkeson left Lynyrd Skynyrd and was replaced by Ed King.[7] Later during the sessions the bassist returned, with King subsequently taking up the role of third guitarist.[8] Burns remained for 1974's Second Helping, but left in January 1975 due to touring fatigue, with Artimus Pyle taking his place.[9] King left on May 26, 1975, two months after the release of Nuthin' Fancy.[10] He was replaced the following year by Steve Gaines, who was recommended by his sister Cassie Gaines after she had recently joined as one of the band's touring backing vocalists.[11][12]
