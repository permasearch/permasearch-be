Their vocals span from E4 to B5.[5] An alternate version of the song with different lyrics was written and recorded by the band in January 1999. The version was included in some early demo presses of the album. In the alternate version, the song has the opposite message ("I love it when I hear you say, I want it that way").[6] [7] The alternative lyrics were written by Martin and Carlsson in collaboration with Mutt Lange.[8]
