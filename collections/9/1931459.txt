Old English diphthongs also arose from other later processes, such as breaking, palatal diphthongization, back mutation and i-mutation, which also gave an additional diphthong ie /iy/. The diphthongs could occur both short (monotonic) /æa, eo, iu, iy/ and long /æːa, eːo, iːu, iːy/. The interpretations /æa/ and /eo/ for ea and eo are generally accepted (evidence for the former comes, for example, from the behavior of breaking and back mutation as described below, and the Middle English development of ea into /a/). However, the interpretations /iu/ and /iy/ for io and ie are controversial, with many (especially more traditional) sources assuming that the pronunciation matched the spelling (/io/, /ie/), and hence that these diphthongs were of the opening rather than the height-harmonic type.
