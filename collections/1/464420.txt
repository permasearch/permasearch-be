Yankton-Yanktonai has the same three ablaut grades as Lakota (a, e, iÅ‹),[13] while in Santee-Sisseton there are only two (a, e). This significantly impacts word forms, especially in fast speech and it is another reason why Yankton-Yanktonai has better mutual intelligibility with Lakota than with Santee-Sisseton.
