The badge provides the wearer with free entry to many British attractions, particularly museums and exhibitions that are featured on the show[3] although many of the attractions will only allow one badge holder for each full price paying adult. The programme producers suspended the privileges amid concerns about the badges being sold in March 2006, but they were reintroduced with additional security a few months later (see below).
