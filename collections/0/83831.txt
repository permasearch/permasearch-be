5 Years Later: It's the day of Dan and Serena's wedding. Chuck and Blair are now parents of a son named Henry. Nate, now a successful businessman with The Spectator flourishing, is likely to run for Mayor of New York. Ivy has written an autobiography about her career as a con artist in the Upper East Side, which was adapted into a film starring both Lola and Olivia Burke (Hilary Duff). Blair and Jenny have become business partners in the fashion world and together they have created a clothing line called "J for Waldorf". Lily and William are back together while Rufus (Matthew Settle) is in a relationship with Lisa Loeb. Jack Bass and Georgina have also become a couple. The final scene shows the new generation of high school kids on the Upper East Side, mirroring the elite and the exclusion. The show ends as a new Gossip Girl is teased as "there will always be someone on the outside wanting to get in."
