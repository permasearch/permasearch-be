In November 1989, Case scored her first television role playing Dawn Winthrop on the ABC Network soap opera General Hospital. Case wanted to "perfect" her audition prior to screen testing as Dawn, who served as the long-lost daughter of the long-running character Monica Quartermaine (Leslie Charleson). Speaking of the audition, Case stated: "I practiced night and day [...] It was a heavy scene in which Dawn learned that her boyfriend Ned (Kurt Robin McKinney) had once slept with her mother! I knew I had to do the best job [possible]".[10] She departed General Hospital the next year, after a guest appearance on another ABC series, the comedy drama Doogie Howser, M.D.. In 1991, Case appeared in various other television series, including Diplomatic Immunity, Beverly Hills, 90210, Parker Lewis Can't Lose and Cheers.[6][11] From November 1992[12] to 1993 Case stepped into her second soap opera role, as Debbie Simon on the CBS Network drama As the World Turns. Case has stated that she loved the role, and wanted to stay on to explore more into the character of Debbie who was a "manic depressive", an issue that hadn't been covered on daytime television.[13] During this, she also appeared on the CBS crime drama Silk Stalkings as Bonnie Abagail. In 1994, a year after departing from As the World Turns, she became a regular on the primetime soap opera Valley of the Dolls, which was based on the romantic novel of the same name.[14] In 1997, Case had a role in the HBO film Breast Men.[4] Previously, she turned down a larger role in the film due to being uncomfortable topless on-screen. Instead, she accepted a smaller, clothed role.[6]
