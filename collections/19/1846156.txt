In the Treaty of Fort McIntosh in 1785 and the Treaty of Fort Harmar in 1789, the US fixed boundaries between United States and tribal lands. The Shawnee and other tribes continued to resist US encroachment into their historic lands. This resistance led to the Northwest Indian War after the Revolution, in which a coalition of Native American tribes tried to repulse US settlement; it lasted until 1795 but the Indians were finally defeated.
