In 259 BC, consul Lucius Cornelius Scipio occupied Aleria in Corsica and probably Olbia in Sardinia. Hanno died while fighting at Olbia. The Romans withdrew because of the arrival of a Carthaginian fleet. Cornelius Scipio celebrated his victories over the Carthaginians and Sardinians with a triumph the following year[44]. During the same year a naval battle occurred near Sulci. The Carthaginian fleet was defeated and the commander Hannibal Gisco who abandoned his men and fled to Sulci was later captured by his soldiers and crucified.
