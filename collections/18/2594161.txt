Initially all northern districts of Brisbane belonged to the Nundah Divisional Board, established in 1879.  In 1883, Toombul Divisional Board separated.  In 1886, the Nundah Divisional Board was subdivided into three smaller boards.  In 1903, the board responsible for the district renamed to Kedron Divisional Board and subsequently Kedron Shire Council to better reflect its representation, since it was no longer based in Nundah.  On 1 October 1925, the Kedron Shire Council was integrated into Greater Brisbane.
