The application for broader public policy started from the work of Otto Eckstein,[17] who in 1958 laid out a welfare economics foundation for CBA and its application for water resource development. Over the 1960s, CBA was applied in the US for water quality,[18] recreation travel,[19] and land conservation.[20] During this period, the concept of option value was developed to represent the non-tangible value of preserving resources such as national parks.[21]
