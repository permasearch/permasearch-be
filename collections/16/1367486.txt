Hecate is the primary feminine figure in the Chaldean Oracles (2nd-3rd century CE),[50] where she is associated in fragment 194 with a strophalos (usually translated as a spinning top, or wheel, used in magic) "Labour thou around the Strophalos of Hecate."[51] This appears to refer to a variant of the device mentioned by Psellus.[52]
