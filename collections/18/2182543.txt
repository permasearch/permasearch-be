The problem was keenly felt by the RAF during the first years of the war, because the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines fitted to Hurricanes and Spitfires suffered from the problem, unlike the direct fuel injection engines of their German counterparts. It was largely solved by installing a flow-restricting washer that allowed just enough fuel into the carburetor for the engine to develop maximum power (the R.A.E. restrictor was known as "Miss Shilling's orifice"). However, it was only a stopgap solution.
