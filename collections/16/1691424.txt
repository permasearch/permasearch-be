In 1906, Yongala was transferred to the Brisbane–Fremantle route.[2] The ship was the first to sail the 5,000-kilometre (2,700 nmi) direct route between Fremantle and Brisbane; the longest interstate trip at that time.[2] During the winter months from 1907 to early 1911, a lack of demand on the Brisbane-Fremantle run meant the ship was reassigned to the Adelaide Steamship Company's Melbourne-Cairns route.[2]
