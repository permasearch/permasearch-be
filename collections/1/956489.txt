In the Renaissance, the story of the jar was revisited by two immensely influential writers, Andrea Alciato in his Emblemata (1534) and the Neo-Latin poet Gabriele Faerno in his collection of a hundred fables (Fabulum Centum, 1563). Alciato only alluded to the story while depicting the goddess Hope seated on a jar in which, she declares, “I alone stayed behind at home when evils fluttered all around, as the revered muse of the old poet [Hesiod] has told you”.[17] Faerno’s short poem also addressed the origin of hope but in this case it is the remainder of the "universal blessings" (bona universa) that have escaped: “Of all good things that mortals lack,/Hope in the soul alone stays back.”[18]
