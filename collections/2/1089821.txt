Late in 1953 it was learned that the land upon which Yankee Stadium was built was for sale. On December 17, 1953, the order purchased the property for $2.5Â million and then leased it back for 28 years at $182,000 a year with the option to renew the lease for three additional terms of 15 years at $125,000 a year.[87] In 1971 the City of New York took the land by eminent domain.[89]
