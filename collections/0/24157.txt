The cave became habitable at 10,600 B.P. due to the water tables dropping and flushing river sediment that once filled and buried the cave between 17,000 and 15,000 B.P.[2] The site represents five cultural components. These are Quad/Beaver Lake/Dalton (10,650-9200 cal B.C.), Early Side-Notched (10,000-9000 cal B.C.), Kirk Stemmed (8200-5800 cal B.C.), Eva/Morrow Mountain (6400-4000 cal B.C.), and Benton (4500-3600 cal B.C.).[3] The stratigraphic profile of the cave is made up of zones labeled A through Y. A is considered the youngest and Y, determined to have been from the Pleistocene, the oldest.[2]
