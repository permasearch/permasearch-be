A tradition in historiography maintains that Ghana fell when it was sacked by the Almoravid movement in 1076â€“77, although Ghanaians resisted attack for a decade.[31] but this interpretation has been questioned. Conrad and Fisher (1982) argued that the notion of any Almoravid military conquest at its core is merely perpetuated folklore, derived from a misinterpretation or naive reliance on Arabic sources.[32] Dierke Lange agrees but argues that this does not preclude Almoravid political agitation, claiming that Ghana's demise owed much to the latter.[33]Sheryl L. Burkhalter(1992) was sceptical of Conrad and Fisher's arguments and  suggested that there was reasons to believe that there was conflict between the Almoravids and the empire of Ghana.[34][35] Furthermore, the archaeology of ancient Ghana simply does not show the signs of rapid change and destruction that would be associated with any Almoravid-era military conquests.[36]
