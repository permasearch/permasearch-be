Garlic is native to Central Asia and northeastern Iran, and has long been a common seasoning worldwide, with a history of several thousand years of human consumption and use.[1][2] It was known to ancient Egyptians, and has been used both as a food flavoring and as a traditional medicine.[4][5] China produces some 80% of the world supply of garlic.
