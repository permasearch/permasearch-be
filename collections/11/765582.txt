Serving as the "county seat" of surrounding Baltimore County since 1767, the City was separated from the county by the provisions of the adoption of the new second Maryland Constitution of 1851 and became an independent city with the same status as the other 22 (later 23) counties of Maryland. Then the county seat for Baltimore County was moved after an election/referendum to Towsontown (later Towson, Maryland) with the building there of its first courthouse three years later between Allegheny, Pennsylvania and Chesapeake Streets in 1854.
