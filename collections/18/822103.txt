The Proto-Greeks probably arrived at the area now called Greece, in the southern tip of the Balkan peninsula, at the 3rd millennium BCE,[222][223] though a later migration by sea from eastern Anatolia (modern Armenia), has also been suggested.[224] The sequence of migrations into the Greek mainland during the 2nd millennium BCE has to be reconstructed on the basis of the ancient Greek dialects, as they presented themselves centuries later and are therefore subject to some uncertainties. There were at least two migrations, the first being the Ionians and Aeolians, which resulted in Mycenaean Greece by the 16th century BCE,[225][226] and the second, the Dorian invasion, around the 11th century BCE, displacing the Arcadocypriot dialects, which descended from the Mycenaean period. Both migrations occur at incisive periods, the Mycenaean at the transition to the Late Bronze Age and the Doric at the Bronze Age collapse.
