Nadine acquires her own TV show, Now!, in Memory in Death as a direct result of the story Eve fed her in Origin in Death, because the case about human cloning garnered Nadine immense publicity worldwide. Nadine writes a book about the case, The Icove Agenda. The book is later made into a "vid" (Robb's futuristic terminology for a motion picture), which forms the background to the plot of Celebrity in Death. Nadine teasingly asks Eve (but half-seriously) if they can film some of the Now interviews at Eve's house, to which she answers emphatically no. That said, Eve makes an appearance on the show (with Roarke watching from off-camera) in Innocent in Death, where she is interviewed about the Icove case.
