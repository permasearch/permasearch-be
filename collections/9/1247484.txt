In "Crimson and Clover," it is revealed that Clover has a twin sister named Crimson, with whom she has a long lasting rivalry. Despite their antagonistic behaviour, they still consider each other family and Crimson has helped Clover out on occasion. In the storyline of "Exiled", Clover went on a quest with Sage to find the perfect weapon, only to realize through the teachings of Sage's annoying mudskipper master that they need each other to be in perfect balance (after spending a day body-swapped). Koto, Sage's evil brother wanted to force Clover to marry him, and she was ready to make this sacrifice for the life of Julien, but in the end she was freed and was essential in defeating Koto and his army.
