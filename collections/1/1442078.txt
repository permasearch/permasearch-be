A reboot of the series premiered on Disney Junior on March 23, 2018.[5] As opposed to the traditional animation of the original show the reboot instead uses CGI, but still will be targeted to children ages 4–7 with each episode consisting of two 11-minute stories. Disney Junior, Disney Consumier Products and Interactive Media’s Content & Media group, and The Muppets Studio are co-producing the show. Tom Warburton, creator of Cartoon Network's Codename: Kids Next Door, will serve as the executive producer while former SpongeBob SquarePants writer Eric Shaw will serve as the story editor.[6]
