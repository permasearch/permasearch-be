The Walt Disney Company and Universal entered bidding negotiations with Warner Bros. and Rowling for the theme park rights to Harry Potter in the United States.[19] In 2004, Rowling signed a letter-of-intent with Disney, with the company intending to develop a Harry Potter section within the Magic Kingdom park at Walt Disney World.[20] Ultimately, Disney pulled out of negotiations, citing that Rowling's creative influence and the terms established by Warner Bros. was too stringent.[21]
