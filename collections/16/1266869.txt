The species Meleagris gallopavo is used by humans for their meat. They were first domesticated by the indigenous people of Mexico from at least 800 BC onwards. These domesticates were then either introduced into what is now the US Southwest or independently domesticated a second time by the indigenous people of that region by 200 BC, at first being used for their feathers, which were used in ceremonies and to make robes and blankets.[20] Turkeys were first used for meat by Native Americans by about AD 1100.[20] Compared to wild turkeys, domestic turkeys are selectively bred to grow larger in size for their meat.[21][22] Americans often eat turkey on special occasions such as at Thanksgiving or Christmas.[23][24]
