Quests are intended to be nonlinear, with multiple ways to complete objectives to allow multiple character types to be viable.[4] The storyline features some large-scale events such as castle sieges and large battles. Every non-player character (NPC) has their daily routine, and every routine can be affected by the player.[1] Characters are able to react to all player actions and adjust their routines to them.[5] NPCs will report crimes to authorities, who will punish the player accordingly, either with a fine or time in jail. Crime will affect economics and people will get suspicious or aggressive after unresolved crimes.
