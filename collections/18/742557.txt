After the initial invention in the late 1830s of a needle-fire rifle, a revolver was soon developed. This type of firearm used a paper cartridge.[11] It used a long, thin, needle-like firing pin that passed through a small hole at the rear of the cylinder, through the powder, and struck a disposable primer cap that was set behind the bullet. The revolverâ€™s cylinder simply had a small hole drilled at the rear of each chamber.[12] The use of a paper cartridge was a change from the earlier method of charging a firearm.
