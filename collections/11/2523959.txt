The Detour for this leg was a choice between Musical March or Bumpy Ride. In Musical March, teams had to make their way on foot to three plazas (Plaza del Estudiante, Plaza Bolivia and Plaza Isabela la CatÃ³lica), several blocks apart, gathering the members of a marching band. When they lead them to la Plaza Abaroa, a band leader would give them their next clue. In Bumpy Ride, teams had to make their way on foot to Mercado de las Brujas (the Witches' Market), where they had to ride a traditional wooden bicycle, down the steep cobblestone streets, to La Plaza Abaroa to receive their next clue.
