Hong Kong SAR passport holders can enter many countries visa-free, including all member states of the European Union, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, South Africa and South Korea.  The official figure of the Hong Kong Immigration Department states that 162 countries and territories grant Hong Kong SAR passport holders either visa-free or visa-on-arrival treatment as of 28 March 2018 (though this figure excludes countries and territories not officially recognised by the People's Republic of China, e.g. Kosovo and Taiwan).[29]  According to the Visa Restrictions Index, in 2017 the passport was ranked 17 out of 97, placing it the top 20 (for any given rank, often several countries are tied at that rank).  A non-SAR PRC passport was ranked 69 out of 97.
