In December 2013, Xi arrived unannounced at a small Beijing restaurant to have steam buns (包子, baozi) for lunch, with only one person accompanying him. He paid for the meal himself and dined with regular patrons.[95] Xi was applauded for the 'common touch' of the visit, and images were circulated widely on social media.[95]
