Some sources, especially those in the United Kingdom, revere the Spice Girls as "gay icons".[194][195] In a UK survey of more than 5,000 gay men and women, Victoria Beckham placed 12th and Halliwell placed 43rd in a ranking of the Top 50 gay icons of all time.[196] Halliwell was also the recipient of the Honorary Gay Award at the 2016 Attitude Awards.[197] In a 2005 interview, Emma Bunton attributed their large gay fan base to the group's fun-loving nature, open-mindedness, and their love of fashion and dressing up, concluding that: "I'm so flattered that we've got such a huge gay following, it's amazing."[198]
