While imprisoned in Storybrooke Hospital's Psychiatric Ward, Isaac is visited by Regina Mills and Henry to talk about how Henry wrote things when in a trance. Isaac stated that this happened before and that he would help them if they can get him out of Storybrooke, a return to New York, an tickets to Hamilton. Regina reluctantly agreed to the terms. Upon hearing that Regina couldn't get the tickets to Hamilton, Isaac had Henry look at the final pages of the "Once Upon a Time" book. Before leaving, Isaac tells Regina and Henry that the final battle is going to be depicted on those pages.
