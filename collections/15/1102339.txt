On 21 July 2003, Archer was released on licence from Hollesley Bay after serving half of his sentence.[76] He remained a peer, there being no legal provision through which it could be removed other than passing a new Act of Parliament.[77] He also retained membership of the House of Lords, which did not then have the power to expel members; however, Archer has not taken an active part in the proceedings of the House. Politically he is a non-affiliated member.[78]
