The Roman Pontiff may dispense from a marriage ratum sed non consummatum since, having been ratified (ratum) but not consummated (sed non consummatum), it is not absolutely unbreakable. A valid natural marriage is not regarded as a sacrament, however, if at least one of the parties is not baptized. In certain circumstances it can be dissolved in cases of Pauline privilege[8] and Petrine privilege,[9] but only for the sake of the higher good of the spiritual welfare of one of the parties.
