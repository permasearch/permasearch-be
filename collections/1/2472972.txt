In July 2003, Christopher Reeve's continuing frustration with the pace of stem cell research in the U.S. led him to Israel,[75] a country that was then, according to him, at the center of research in spinal cord injury.[76][77] Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs invited him to seek out the best treatment for his condition. During his visit, Reeve called the experience "a privilege" and said, "Israel has very proactive rehab facilities, excellent medical schools and teaching hospitals, and an absolutely first-rate research infrastructure."[76][78]
