The Pan-Arab colours black, white, green, and red are first known from the flag of the Arab Revolt in 1916.[20] The colours were intended to represent certain Arab dynasties.[21] Countries currently using flags with all four Pan-Arab colours include Jordan, Kuwait, Palestine and Sudan; several other Arab states use a subset.
