The Sovereign rarely personally exercises her executive powers; since the monarch does not normally reside in New Zealand, she appoints a governor-general to represent her and exercise most of her powers.[28] The person who fills this role is selected on the advice of the Prime Minister.[28] "Advice" in this sense is a choice generally without options since it would be highly unconventional for the Prime Minister's advice to be overlooked; a convention that protects the monarchy. As long as the monarch is following the advice of her ministers, she is not held personally responsible for the decisions of the Government. The Governor-General has no official term limit, and is said to serve "at Her Majesty's pleasure".[29]
