Most Shakespeare biographers qualify his reputed attendance at The Guild School in Stratford with phrases such as "almost certainly" because all attendance records for the time have been lost, but Shakespeare's works exhibit detailed knowledge of the grammar school curriculum and none of the university life that is evident in university-educated playwrights such as Marlowe.[9] Edward VI, the king honoured in the school's name, had in the mid-16th century diverted money from the dissolution of the monasteries to endow a network of grammar schools to "propagate good literature... throughout the kingdom", but the school had originally been set up by the Guild of the Holy Cross, a church institution in the town, early in the 15th century.[10] It was further endowed in 1482. It was free to male children in Stratford and it is presumed that the young Shakespeare attended.[11] Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era, but the grammar curriculum was standardised by royal decree throughout England,[12][13] and the school would have provided an intensive education in Latin grammar and literatureâ€”"as good a formal literary training as had any of his contemporaries".[14] As a part of this education, the students were exposed to Latin plays that students performed to better understand the language. One of Shakespeare's earliest plays, The Comedy of Errors, bears similarity to Plautus's Menaechmi, which could well have been performed at the school. There is no evidence that he received a university education.
