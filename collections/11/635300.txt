After the verdicts were announced, a crowd of protesters formed at the Los Angeles police headquarters at Parker Center in Downtown Los Angeles. The crowd grew as the afternoon passed, and as this group grew and became violent, a moving skirmish line formed between police protecting the building and protesters advancing on it.[64] In the midst of this, before 6:30 pm, police chief Daryl Gates left Parker Center, on his way to the neighborhood of Brentwood. There, as the situation in Los Angeles deteriorated, Gates attended a political fundraiser against Los Angeles City Charter Amendment F,[64] which was stated to "give City Hall more power over the police chief and provide more civilian review of officer misconduct",[65] and would limit the power and term length of his own position.[66]
