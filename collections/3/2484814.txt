Havelock Ellis (1859-1939) was working as a teacher in Australia, when he had a revelation that he wanted to dedicate his life to exploring the issue of sexuality. He returned to London in 1879 and enrolled in St. Thomasâ€™s Hospital Medical School. He began to write, and in 1896 he co-authored Sexual Inversion with John Addington Symonds, his then lover of 6 months. The book was first published in German, and a year later it was translated into English. Their book explored homosexual relationships, and in a progressive approach for their time they refused to criminalize or pathologize the acts and emotions that were present in homosexual relationships.[12]
