In December 1905 Crosby issued a card protesting the continued sale of Carletonâ€™s book, again denying she was "in distress", as she was in "comfortable circumstances and very active", giving lectures nearly once a week.[325] She indicated she had received less than $325 from the sale of the book, that her "requests had been disregarded", but that "when these facts are fully known to all, the publishers can sell the book as they desire; only I have no wish to increase its sale for my own benefit, which, of course, is very small".[317]
