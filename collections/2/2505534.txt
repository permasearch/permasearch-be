In 1805 Cornwallis was reappointed Governor-General of India by Pitt (who had again become Prime Minister), this time to curb the expansionist activity of Lord Wellesley (older brother of Colonel Arthur Wellesley, later Duke of Wellington).[112] He arrived in India in July 1805, and died on 5 October of a fever at Gauspur in Ghazipur, at that time in the Varanasi kingdom.[113] Cornwallis was buried there, overlooking the Ganges River,[114] where his memorial is a protected monument maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India.[115]
