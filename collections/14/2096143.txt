The Munak canal, is a 102 kilometer long aqueduct in Haryana and Delhi states in India. The canal conveys water from the Yamuna River at Munak, Karnal district, Haryana and travels in a southerly direction, terminating at Haidarpur, Delhi. It is one of the primary sources of drinking water for Delhi. A memorandum of understanding was signed between the Haryana and Delhi governments in 1996 and the Canal was constructed by Haryana between 2003 and 2012 on payment by Delhi. Originally a porous trench, the canal was eventually cemented due to excess seepage, saving 80 million gallons of water per day.[6][7]
