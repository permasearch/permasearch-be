Columbus is the county seat of Franklin County.[24] The municipality has also expanded and annexed portions of adjoining Delaware County, Pickaway County and Fairfield County. Named for explorer Christopher Columbus, the city was founded in 1812 at the confluence of the Scioto and Olentangy rivers, and assumed the functions of state capital in 1816.
