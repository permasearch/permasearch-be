It was more of the same in 2003 for Rossi's rivals when he claimed nine pole positions as well as nine race wins to claim his third consecutive World Championship, clinching the title in Malaysia.[26] This year, Sete Gibernau became his strongest opponent, beating Rossi several times, although Rossi got the better of Gibernau in the Czech Republic, by just 0.042 seconds.[27] The Australian Grand Prix at Phillip Island is considered by many observers to be one of Rossi's greatest career moments due to unique circumstances. After being given a 10-second penalty for overtaking during a yellow flag due to a crash by Ducati rider Troy Bayliss, front runner Rossi proceeded to pull away from the rest of the field, eventually finishing more than 15 seconds ahead, more than enough to cancel out the penalty and win the race.[28] He won the final race at Valencia with a special livery, which would turn out to be his final win for Honda.[29]
