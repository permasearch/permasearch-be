Wart is an anthropomorphic frog king who debuted in 1987's Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic, where he plays a role of a main villain and final boss of the game. The game was converted into 1988's Super Mario Bros. 2 for its North American release, and Wart remained the game's antagonist (in lieu of Bowser). In both versions, Wart creates his own monsters with a device known as the "dream machine", appoints himself ruler of the land, and enslaves its inhabitants. He has a severe weakness to vegetables.[36] Based upon this storyline, Wart and his cohorts recur in various television and comic book series within the franchise,[citation needed] including a cameo appearance in The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening.[37] Games journalists have called for Wart's inclusion in the Super Smash Bros. series[38] and placed him among the weakest characters in the Mario franchise.[39]
