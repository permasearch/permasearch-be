The linguistic use of Cockney is more identifiable, with lexical borrowings from Yiddish, Romani, and costermonger slang, and a distinctive accent that features T-glottalization, a loss of dental fricatives and diphthong alterations, amongst others. The accent is said to be a remnant of early English London speech, modified by the many immigrants to the area.[83] The Cockney accent has suffered a long decline, beginning with the introduction in the 20th century of received pronunciation, the more recent adoption of Estuary English, which itself contains many features of Cockney English, and finally with mass immigration that has made native English speakers a minority in the area[84]
