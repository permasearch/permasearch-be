Leyland of Australia produced a 4,414 cc (269.4 cu in) version of the aluminium V8 for their Australia-only 1973 Leyland P76. The bore was 88.9 mm (3.50 in) and the stroke was 88.9 mm (3.50 in), making it a square engine. The block deck height was extended and longer conrods were fitted 158.75 mm (6.250 in) between centres. This rare engine produced 200 hp (149 kW) and 280 ft•lbf (380 N•m) and, although export (to the UK) versions were planned, the closure by British Leyland of their Australian operations in 1975 precluded the widespread application of this engine. British Leyland did import one complete P76 engine for assessment but it was never fitted to a vehicle and was sold off on the demise of the company.
