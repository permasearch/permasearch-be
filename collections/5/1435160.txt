Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) was conceived by producer Dennis Spooner in 1967. Spooner had a keen interest in the paranormal and ghostly phenomena, which he considered an inspired idea for a television series, incorporating it with the characteristic crime, drama and action of other earlier productions in the 1960s such as The Avengers and The Saint.
