Backward conditioning occurs when a CS immediately follows a US.[10] Unlike the usual conditioning procedure, in which the CS precedes the US, the conditioned response given to the CS tends to be inhibitory. This presumably happens because the CS serves as a signal that the US has ended, rather than as a signal that the US is about to appear.[13] For example, a puff of air directed at a person's eye could be followed by the sound of a buzzer.
