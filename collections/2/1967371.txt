The modern field of statistics emerged in the late 19th and early 20th century in three stages.[35] The first wave, at the turn of the century, was led by the work of Francis Galton and Karl Pearson, who transformed statistics into a rigorous mathematical discipline used for analysis, not just in science, but in industry and politics as well. Galton's contributions included introducing the concepts of standard deviation, correlation, regression analysis and the application of these methods to the study of the variety of human characteristics â€“ height, weight, eyelash length among others.[36] Pearson developed the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, defined as a product-moment,[37] the method of moments for the fitting of distributions to samples and the Pearson distribution, among many other things.[38] Galton and Pearson founded Biometrika as the first journal of mathematical statistics and biostatistics (then called biometry), and the latter founded the world's first university statistics department at University College London.[39]
