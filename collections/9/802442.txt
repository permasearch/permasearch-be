D.S. Armstrong later deliberately interrupts an intimate moment between Leela and Zack. Following the murder of Amy Barnes' (Ashley Slanina-Davies), D.S. Armstrong arrests her former partner, Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson) and makes him confess to her murder. D.S. Armstrong supports Leela and they have sex, although Leela rejects him the following day, claiming it to be a mistake. Frustrated, D.S. Armstrong graffitis Leela's wall, which Leela reports to the police. D.S. Armstrong's colleague and Amy's widower, Ryan Knight (Duncan James), takes a statement from Leela and realises D.S. Armstrong is her stalker, but decides not to report it at risk of Ste being acquitted of Amy's murder. When D.S. Armstrong plants spray paint in Zack's bag and arrests him, Ryan releases Zack from custody and tells Leela that a man serving jail time is her stalker, before warning D.S. Armstrong and telling him to take sick leave and seek psychiatric help. However, as he is leaving, D.S. Armstrong watches Leela through his hidden camera.
