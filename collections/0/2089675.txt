In 19 BC, the Senate granted Augustus a form of 'general consular imperium', which was probably 'imperium consulare maius', like the proconsular powers that he received in 23 BC. Like his tribune authority, the consular powers were another instance of gaining power from offices that he did not actually hold.[165] In addition, Augustus was allowed to wear the consul's insignia in public and before the Senate,[156] as well as to sit in the symbolic chair between the two consuls and hold the fasces, an emblem of consular authority.[165] This seems to have assuaged the populace; regardless of whether or not Augustus was a consul, the importance was that he both appeared as one before the people and could exercise consular power if necessary. On 6 March 12 BC, after the death of Lepidus, he additionally took up the position of pontifex maximus, the high priest of the college of the Pontiffs, the most important position in Roman religion.[166][167] On 5 February 2 BC, Augustus was also given the title pater patriae, or "father of the country".[168][169]
