At the end of 2012, Slovenia legislated a law of electronic communication implementing a strong principle of net neutrality.[80] Slovenia thus became the second country in Europe to enact a net neutrality law. The Government Agency for Communications, Networks and Services (AKOS) is enforcing the law and executes inspections. In January 2015 it found zero-rating infringements at the two largest mobile network providers, Telekom and Simobil (now A1).[81] In February it found similar infringaments also at Amis[82] (now Simobil) and TuÅ¡mobil[83] (now Telemach). In July 2016 the Administrative Court of the Republic of Slovenia annulled the decisions of AKOS.[84]
