Jack Nicklaus holds the record for the most Masters victories, winning the tournament six times during his career. Nicklaus is also the oldest winner of the Masters: he was 46 years 82 days old when he won in 1986.[6] Nicklaus, Nick Faldo, and Tiger Woods co-hold the record for most consecutive victories with two. Woods was the youngest winner of the Masters, 21 years 104 days old when he won in 1997.[6] Woods also set the record for the widest winning margin (12 strokes), and the lowest winning score, with 270, 18 below par (-18) in 1997. The latter was equaled by Jordan Spieth in 2015.[7]
