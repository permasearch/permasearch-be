The video is set in a futuristic theme park called "Oblivia."[58] BBC's Mark Savage noted the theme is a metaphor for the infinite distractions of modern society.[54] Billboard writer Gil Kaufman wrote that the video has "a number of not-so-subtle hints at Perry's feelings about the current political climate in the nation." The video opens with Perry walking through the gates of the theme park, where she stares at her surroundings in fascination.[59] In the video, the guests are all taking selfies, eating sticks of candy floss in the shape of a nuclear mushroom cloud [60] and crowding around a sign for "the greatest ride in the universe."[54] Perry is awestruck until she pricks her finger on a rose stem made of barbed wire.[61] The atomium, which is the Belgian national symbol, can be seen in the first two seconds of the music video. Some of the attractions contain references to the Brighton Palace Pier in the United Kingdom. The giant concrete dome in the park is supposedly a reference to the San Onofre nuclear power plant located on the Pacific coast.[62]
