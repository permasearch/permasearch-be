In the context of the 20th-century history of the United States, the Second Great Migration was the migration of more than 5 million African Americans from the South to the North, Midwest and West. It began in 1940, through World War II, and lasted until 1970.[1] It was much larger and of a different character than the first Great Migration (1916-1930).
