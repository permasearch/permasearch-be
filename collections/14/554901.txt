The name renin = ren + -in, "kidney" + "compound". The most common pronunciation in English is /ˈriːnɪn/ (long e); /ˈrɛnɪn/ (short e) is also common, but using /ˈriːnɪn/ allows one to reserve /ˈrɛnɪn/ for rennin. Renin was discovered, characterized, and named in 1898 by Robert Tigerstedt, Professor of Physiology, and his student, Per Bergman, at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.[26][27]
