Since taking power in 1978, Deng Xiaoping experimented with direct democracy at the local level.[14] Villages have been traditionally the lowest level of government in China's complicated hierarchy of governance.[15] Many have criticized the locally elected representatives as serving as "rubber stamps", though during some eras the Communists have flirted with the idea of potentially allowing some competition.[16] In the early 1980s, a few southern villages began implementing "Vote for your Chief" policies, in which free elections are intended to be held for the election of a village chief, who holds a lot of power and influence traditionally in rural society.[17] Many of these multi-candidate elections[18] were successful, involving candidate debates, formal platforms, and the initiation of secret ballot boxes.[19] The suffrage was not universal,[20] with eligible citizens above age 18 having the right to vote and be elected.[citation needed] Such an election comprises usually over no more than 2000 voters, and the first-past-the-post system is used in determining the winner,[citation needed] with no restriction on political affiliation.[21] The elections, held every three years,[22] are always supervised by a higher level of government, usually by a County Government. Part of the reason for these early elections was to shift the responsibility of ensuring good performance and reduced corruption of local leaders from the Chinese bureaucracy to the local villagers.[23]
