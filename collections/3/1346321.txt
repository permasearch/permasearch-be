Food Fest - Usually regarded as the biggest event of the week, Food Fest generally happens on the Friday of Charity Week. Lunchtime is extended to an hour, and the clubs at Airport along with a few solo entrys set up shop in the School Courtyard and sell homecooked meals such as Nachos from Tri-M, Sangria from the Spanish Honor Society, Barbeque from the Drill Team, and many more. This event annually raises the single most money out of any other event held during the week.
