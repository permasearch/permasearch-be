After being locked out, the NFL Referees Association accused the league of planning to lock them out all along rather than negotiate a new contract.[7] The union contended that the lockout would jeopardize the safety of the players and the integrity of the game, citing the fact that none of the replacement officials would come from the top college divisions and thus would not have enough experience to adjust to the speed of the NFL game or enforce the various players' safety rules.[7] The NFL denied these claims, saying that they negotiated in good faith.[5]
