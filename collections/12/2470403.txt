In 1987, The Rockers were signed by a competing promotion: the World Wrestling Federation (WWF).[6] They were fired from WWF two weeks later, for a bar incident (a misunderstanding, according to Michaels' autobiography).[6][18] They then returned to AWA, where they won the AWA tag team titles for a second time,[10] but were re-signed by WWF a year later.[18]
