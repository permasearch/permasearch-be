Sailing races have been held on Sydney Harbour since 1827.[304] Yachting has been popular amongst wealthier residents since the 1840s and the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron was founded in 1862. The Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race is a 1,170-kilometre (727-mile) event that starts from Sydney Harbour on Boxing Day.[305] Since its inception in 1945 it has been recognised as one of the most difficult yacht races in the world.[306] Six sailors died and 71 vessels of the fleet of 115 failed to finish in the 1998 edition.[307]
