The BAR was also standard issue to US naval landing forces during the period.[41] The weapon was a standard item in US warship armories, and each BAR was accompanied by a spare barrel.[41] Large capital ships often had over 200 BARs on board,[41] with many of the US Navy BARs remaining in service well into the 1960s.[41]
