Both the original 15- and 17-inch model MacBook Pros come with ExpressCard/34 slots, which replace the PC Card slots found in the PowerBook G4. All first generation 15-inch models have two USB 2.0 ports and one FireWire 400 port,[9] while the 17-inch models have three USB 2.0 ports as well as one FireWire 400 port.[10] When first introduced, the MacBook Pro did not come with FireWire 800 or S-Video ports,[7][9] although FireWire 800 was added in the next 15-inch model revision[11] and is present in every version of the 17-inch design.[10] S-Video capability can be attained through the use of a DVI to S-Video adapter.[7] External displays with up to a 2,560 × 1,600 pixel resolution are supported through a dual-link DVI port.[12] All models include a built-in Gigabit Ethernet port, Bluetooth 2.0, and 802.11a/b/g.[9][10] Later models include support for the draft 2.0 specification of 802.11n[13] and Bluetooth 2.1.
