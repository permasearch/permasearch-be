Westinghouse, Stanley and associates soon developed an easier to manufacture core, consisting of a stack of thin 'Eâ€‘shaped' iron plates, insulated by thin sheets of paper or other insulating material. Prewound copper coils could then be slid into place, and straight iron plates laid in to create a closed magnetic circuit. Westinghouse applied for a patent for the new low-cost design in December 1886; it was granted in July 1887.[126][134]
