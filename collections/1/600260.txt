Upon his return, he and Pippin were clearly seen to be the tallest of hobbits, taller even than the legendary Bullroarer Took (as Sam said at the Field of Cormallen, Merry was three inches taller than he ought to have been). Merry went on to marry Estella Bolger sometime after the end of the Third Age. He inherited the title Master of Buckland in year 11 of the Fourth Age. He retained his links with Rohan and became an expert in Rohan's language and traditions, which he discovered, to his surprise, to have close affinity to the early history of the hobbits, and was best known in the Shire for composing Herblore of the Shire, Reckoning of Years, and Old Words and Names in the Shire.[7] Although he is not recorded as having any children within the family trees, he is noted as having at least one son.
