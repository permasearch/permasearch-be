Exposes attracted a middle-class upscale audience during the Progressive Era, especially in 1902 – 1912.  By the 1900s, such major  magazines as  Collier's Weekly, Munsey's Magazine and McClure's Magazine sponsored exposés for a national audience. The January 1903 issue of  McClure's marked the beginning of muckraking journalism, while the muckrakers would get their label later. Ida M. Tarbell ("The History of Standard Oil"),[40] Lincoln Steffens ("The Shame of Minneapolis") and Ray Stannard Baker ("The Right to Work"), simultaneously published famous works in that single issue. Claude H. Wetmore and Lincoln Steffens' previous article "Tweed Days in St. Louis", in McClure's October 1902 issue was the first muckraking article.[41]
