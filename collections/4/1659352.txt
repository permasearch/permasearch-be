On this basis, many early Calvinists also eschewed musical instruments and advocated a cappella exclusive psalmody in worship,[114] though Calvin himself allowed other scriptural songs as well as psalms,[113] and this practice typified presbyterian worship and the worship of other Reformed churches for some time. The original Lord's Day service designed by John Calvin was a highly liturgical service with the Creed, Alms, Confession and Absolution, the Lord's supper, Doxologies, prayers, Psalms being sung, the Lords prayer being sung, Benedictions.[115]
