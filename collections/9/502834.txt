Billboard had kind words for the B-Side, in its review of "Last Kiss" â€” giving four stars to the song called "Funny Feeling", on the flip side, written by Joe Carpenter and Milt "Pete" Skelton. The reviewer said, "Blues, chanted in relaxed style, with a funky guitar backing. Derivative but a good job."[5] "Funny Feeling" didn't make an impression on disc jockeys, either.
