Anderson has claimed that in greater context, the miss was not particularly notable, and it is only remembered because the Falcons won the game.[41] Buchanan, who was attempting to block Anderson's kick, believes that Anderson would not have been able to convert the field goal regardless, since if the kick was on target, it would have "hit [Buchanan] in the face mask".[6] Some sportswriters,[30][42] as well as Randle,[43] have defended Anderson, claiming that the Vikings' defense deserves the real blame for the loss for allowing Atlanta to tie the game after Anderson's miss. Barreiro also criticized the performance of Cunningham, whom he felt did not handle the pressure of the game well and called "dreadful down the stretch".[44]
