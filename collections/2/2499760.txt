Mastery learning was briefly popular in the 1920s, and was revived by Benjamin Bloom in 1968. While it is difficult to implement in large, traditional classrooms, it has shown dramatic success in improving student learning.[29][30] The mastery model allows teachers to provide the materials, tools and support for learning while students set goals and manage their time.[28]
