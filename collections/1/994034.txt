The job application is called Bewerbung in Germany and usually consists of three parts, such as the Anschreiben, the Lebenslauf and the Zeugnisse. Anschreiben is the German word for Cover Letter and aims at the same goal: convincing the employer to submit an invitation for a job interview.[11] It is essential to work with the paper size DIN A4 and to stay with a length of one single page. The Anschreiben must be signed by hand and accompanied by a Lebenslauf, the Curriculum Vitae, and Zeugnisse as copies of relevant reference documents. The Lebenslauf is of an anti-chronological structure and should give information on work experience, education and professional training as well as on applicant's skills. In Germany, the Lebenslauf – respectively the Curriculum Vitae – usually includes a photograph called Bewerbungsfoto. Some employers, mainly governmental organisations, deliberately neglect the photograph to ensure a higher degree of objectivity in the course of assessment procedures. A length of two pages is to be aimed at when generating the Lebenslauf. In general, there are two options of submitting a job application in Germany: a job application folder (Bewerbungsmappe) or online (Onlinebewerbung). According to a study,[12] the Onlinebewerbung was more favored in Germany than the Bewerbungsmappe by 2012. Presumably, this development will persist.
