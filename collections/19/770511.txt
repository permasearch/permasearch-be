After the Belmont, Justify was returned to Churchill Downs where he was paraded before a large crowd on June 16.[43] He was then shipped back to Santa Anita, where he was paraded on June 23.[44] Baffert kept Justify in light training to give the colt time to recover from the grueling Triple Crown campaign. In early July, Baffert noticed a slight filling in the ankle of Justify's left front leg. The filling subsided but then reappeared a few days later, so Baffert decided to send the colt for a detailed evaluation. Justify was officially retired from racing on July 25, 2018. [45][46]
