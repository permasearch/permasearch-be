After the Coeur d'Alene mining venture died out, Earp and Sadie briefly went to El Paso, Texas, before moving in 1887 to San Diego, where the railroad was about to arrive and a real estate boom was underway. They stayed for about four years, living most of the time in the Brooklyn Hotel.[139] Earp speculated in San Diego's booming real estate market.[140] Between 1887 and around 1896, he bought four saloons and gambling halls, including one on Fourth Street and two near Sixth and E, all in the "respectable" part of town.[140][141][142] They offered 21 games, including faro, blackjack, poker, keno, and other Victorian-American games of chance such as  pedro and monte.[140] At the height of the boom, he made up to $1,000 a night in profit.[143] Wyatt also owned the Oyster Bar located in the first granite-faced building in San Diego, the four-story Louis Bank Building at 837 5th Avenue, one of the more popular saloons in the Stingaree district.[42]:71 One of the reasons it drew a good crowd was the Golden Poppy brothel upstairs. Owned by Madam Cora, each room was painted a different color, like emerald green, summer yellow, or ruby red,[144] and each prostitute was required to dress in matching garments.[145]
