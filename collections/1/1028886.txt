The journal was established in March 1917 as the American Review of Tuberculosis.[1] Since then there have been several title changes. In 1953 a subtitle was added, "A Journal of Pulmonary Diseases." In 1955 the title became the American Review of Tuberculosis and Pulmonary Diseases, and in 1959 the American Review of Respiratory Diseases (the final "s" was dropped in 1966).[1] The journal obtained its current title in 1994.[1]
