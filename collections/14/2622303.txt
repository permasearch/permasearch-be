Following Jen's eviction, HouseGuests competed in the "Tanks For the Memories" Head of Household competition.[41] For this competition, HouseGuests were asked questions about statements made by the first five evicted HouseGuests from this season; if a HouseGuest answered incorrectly, they were dumped into a tank of water.[161] Jessica was the winner.[162][163] On Day 56, HouseGuests competed in the "Shop 'til You Drop" luxury competition.[41] For this competition, the HouseGuests competed as men against women, and found letters in the outfits given to them, and were required to take off their clothing and form three words that pertain to the game with these letters. The women were the winners of the competition and won a two-minute shopping spree inside of the house.[164] Later that day, Jessica chose to nominate Amber and Zach for eviction.[165][166] When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Daniele, Eric, and Jameka were selected to compete; Dick was selected to host. On Day 57, HouseGuests competed in the "Catscratch Veto" Power of Veto competition.[41] For this competition, HouseGuests were given riddles and had to search the backyard to find the rubber rat with the correct answer on it; the last person to find the correct answer each round is eliminated.[167] Eric was the winner of the Power of Veto.[168][169] Eric, as America's Player, was informed that he was not permitted to use the Power of Veto, and that nominations were required to stay the same as the viewers did not have time to vote for a decision.[170] On Day 59, Eric officially chose to leave nominations the same.[171] On Day 62, Amber became the eighth HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a vote of three to one.[172][173][174] She became the third member of the Jury of Seven.
