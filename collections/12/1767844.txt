The USDA has issued recalls of beef supplies that involved introduction of downer cows into the food supply. Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing Company was found to have used electric shocks to prod downer cows into the slaughtering system in 2007.[37] Possibly due to pressure from large agribusiness, the United States has drastically cut back on the number of cows inspected for BSE.[38]
