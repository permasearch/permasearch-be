"Like I Love You" is the debut single recorded by American singer Justin Timberlake for his debut studio album, Justified (2002). The song features American hip hop duo Clipse. It was co-written by Timberlake and The Neptunes (Chad Hugo and Pharrell Williams), who also produced it. The song was released on October 14, 2002 as Timberlake's debut solo single, following the break-up of 'NSYNC earlier that year. According to Williams, who came up with the music loop, the song's drums were an ode to the funk era.
