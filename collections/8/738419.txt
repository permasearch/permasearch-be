K.C. is upset to learn that she has received the same SAT score as Marisa: 1060. K.C. later learns that Beverly had Craig change her SAT result because she received a perfect score. Less than one percent of the population receives a perfect score; leaving the original score intact would draw unnecessary attention to K.C., putting her spy career at risk. K.C. disagrees with Beverly's decision as it will prevent her from being accepted into certain colleges. Beverly tells K.C. that The Organization wants her to remain a spy rather than go to college. K.C. drives to New York to retake her SAT test, while Ernie and Zoe team up for a mission to stop smugglers who are working in a party supplies warehouse. After completing the mission, Ernie asks Zoe to be his girlfriend, but she tells him that she has been assigned to a four-year mission in Antarctica. Ernie agrees to wait for Zoe until she concludes her mission. Meanwhile, Marisa wants K.C. to talk to The Organization about letting her become a spy. Marisa is insulted when K.C. tells her that she is not intelligent enough to be a spy. K.C. later tells Marisa that it would be better if she attended college rather than become a spy. Marisa, who does not want to attend college, becomes further upset at K.C. and decides to temporarily end their friendship. Two months later, K.C. learns that she has received a perfect SAT score.
