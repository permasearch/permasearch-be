To reach California from the East, pioneers had to get their wagons over the Sierra Nevada mountain range.  In 1844 the Stephens-Townsend-Murphy Party followed the Truckee River into the mountains.  At the head of what is now called Donner Lake, they found a low notch in the mountains and became the first overland settlers to use the pass.[3] The pass was named after a later group of California-bound settlers.  In early November 1846 the Donner Party found the route blocked by snow and was forced to spend the winter on the east side of the mountains.  Of the 81 settlers, only 45 survived to reach California;[4] some of them resorting to cannibalism to survive.[5][6]
