President for Life is a title assumed by some authoritarian leaders to remove their term limit irrevocably as a way of removing future challenges to their authority and legitimacy. The title sometimes confers on the holder the right to nominate or appoint a successor. The usage of the title of "President" rather than a traditionally autocratic title such as that of a monarch implies the subversion of democracy by the titleholder. Indeed, sometimes a President for Life can go on to establish a Self-proclaimed monarchy, such Jean-Jacques Dessalines and Henry Christophe in Haiti.
