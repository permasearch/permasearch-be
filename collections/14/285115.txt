Stalin was ethnically Georgian,[711] and had grown up speaking the Georgian language,[712] only learning Russian when aged eight or nine.[713] Stalin remained proud of his Georgian identity and culture,[714] and throughout his life, he retained his Georgian accent when speaking Russian.[715] According to Montefiore, his adoption of Russian culture has been exaggerated, and he was profoundly Georgian in his lifestyle and personality, spending much of his final years in his homeland.[716] Montefiore was of the view that "after 1917, he became quadri-national: Georgian by nationality, Russian by loyalty, internationalist by ideology, Soviet by citizenship."[717] Service stated that Stalin "would never be Russian", could not credibly pass as one and contrary to what has been previously suggested, he never really tried to be one.[718] Stalin was described as "Asiatic" by his colleagues, and told a Japanese journalist, "I am not a European man, but an Asian, a Russified Georgian".[719] He first adopted the pseudonym "Stalin" in 1912; being based on the Russian word for "steel" it has often been translated as "Man of Steel".[145] Prior nicknames included "Koba", "Soselo", "Ivanov" and many others.[720]
