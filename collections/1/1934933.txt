During the fourth Test of the 1956 Ashes series, Laker took 9/37 in the first innings and 10/53 in the second to finish with match figures of 19/90. Imran Khan's figures of 14/116, taken in finaal match of the 1981â€“82 Test series against Sri Lanka, is the sixteenth best in Test cricket history.[91]
