One month before spring training for the 1952 season, Doby employed former Olympic track and field athlete Harrison Dillard to come to his home in New Jersey to prepare his legs in hopes of eliminating injuries, which had affected him the previous season.[49] Dillard and the Indians' team doctor prescribed lower-body warm-ups to Doby before the start of each game.[54] Leg injuries continued to bother Doby during the start of the season.[55] On June 4, 1952, he hit for the cycle.[56] By the end of the 1952 season, Doby was second in the AL in RBIs to teammate Al Rosen by one, 105 to 104. His .541 slugging percentage, runs scored (104), strikeout (111), and home run (32) totals were all highest in the AL.[57]
