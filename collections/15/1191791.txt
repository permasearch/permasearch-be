Hiruko targets the Land of Fireâ€™s Kekkei Genkai, Kakashi's Sharingan. One night, Hiruko activates a Puppet Curse placed on Kakashi over ten years ago. Kakashi asks Tsunade to allow him to go, so he can defeat Hiruko. Before he leaves, Kakashi asks Tsunade to place a special seal on him that will automatically activate Kamui, when Hiruko attempts to absorb him. Under the influence of Hiruko's Puppet Curse, Kakashi leaves the village. At the Hokage's office, Tsunade labels Kakashi as a missing-nin and orders everyone from the village without any further orders from her to stay away from Kakashi. Upon hearing of his desertion, Naruto and Sakura leave the village to pursue and rescue their teacher. Team 8, Team 10 and Team Guy are sent to retrieve them.
