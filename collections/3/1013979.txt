In the years following its independence, the Cuban republic saw significant economic development, but also political corruption and a succession of despotic leaders, culminating in the overthrow of the dictator Fulgencio Batista by the 26th of July Movement, led by Fidel and Raúl Castro Ruz, during the 1953–59 Cuban Revolution.[3] Cuba has since[update] been governed as a socialist state by the Communist Party under the leadership of the Castro brothers.[4] The country has been politically and economically isolated by the United States since the Revolution, but has gradually gained access to foreign commerce and travel as efforts to normalise diplomatic relations have progressed.[5][6][7][8][9] Domestic economic reforms are also beginning to modernize Cuba's socialist economy.[10]
