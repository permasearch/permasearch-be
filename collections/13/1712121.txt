Unlike its predecessor, the Prime is capable of running entirely on electricity in charge-depleting mode (EV mode) in more situations. The improved technology allows the Prius Prime to achieve a maximum of 68 kW (91 hp) from the electric motor system in EV mode.[93] It also allowed Toyota to raise the maximum all-electric speed from 62 mph (100 km/h) to 84 mph (135 km/h), achieving a performance that is nearly as strong in electric mode, and quell concerns with the previous generation car that wouldn’t have enough torque for safety if the gasoline engine were entirely kept out of the power flow.[91]
