The album was designed as a concept album. Albums from the time period tended to be little more than collections of singles, but Sinatra developed a distinction between songs intended as singles for radio airplay and for juke boxes, and those songs he intended to package together in an album. His sessions intended for album release tend to be more serious, artistically.[16]
