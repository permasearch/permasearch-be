The film was a financial failure at the box-office. Despite this, it is considered unusually intelligent and thoughtful for a film of the contemporary sword and sandal genre and also enjoys a 100% "Fresh" rating at Rotten Tomatoes.[2] It features the largest outdoor film set in the history of film, a 92,000 m2 replica of the Roman Forum.
