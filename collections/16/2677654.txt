The jump was filmed by several cameras at the MegaRamp at Woodward West in Tehachapi, California. A roll-over feature was custom-built which allowed the skater to drop in on the 70-foot-tall and roll right over a 50-foot gap in the ramp, thus allowing Schaar to keep momentum going all the way through to the quarter pipe.[3] Schaar performed several 720s and a 900 while warming-up. He then attempted to perform the 1080, failing four times before successfully landing his fifth attempt,[6] being propelled 15 feet above the top of the ramp.[7]
