Harry Stack Sullivan has developed the Theory of Interpersonal Relations.[15] Sullivan described friendships as providing the following functions: (a) offering consensual validation, (b) bolstering feelings of self-worth, (c) providing affection and a context for intimate disclosure, (d) promoting interpersonal sensitivity, and (e) setting the foundation for romantic and parental relationships.[12] Sullivan believed these functions developed during childhood and that true friendships were formed around the age of 9 or 10.
