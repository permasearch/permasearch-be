After Hollabrun, the armies gathered on the plains to the east of Brno. Napoleon could muster some 75,000 men and 157 guns for the impending battle, but about 7,000 troops under Davout were still far to the south in the direction of Vienna.[48] The Allies had about 73,000 soldiers, seventy percent of them Russian, and 318 guns.[48] On 1 December, both sides occupied their main positions.
