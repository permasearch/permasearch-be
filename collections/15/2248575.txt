1978 was the first year in which Club Brugge had reached the final, while Liverpool were appearing in their second successive final. The two teams had met before in the final of a European competition: the 1976 UEFA Cup Final, which Liverpool won 4–3 on aggregate.[6] Liverpool were the reigning champions and were aiming to become the first British team to win successive European Cups. Liverpool had already won the UEFA Cup twice, in the 1972–73 and 1975–76 seasons and had a chance to win two European cups as well.[7] Brugge were the first Belgian team to reach the final of the European Cup and thus were aiming to become the first to win the trophy.
