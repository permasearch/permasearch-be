Elena signs the papers to get Stefan (Paul Wesley) and Damon's (Ian Somerhalder) house where she can be safe from vampires and then she leaves for school with Bonnie (Kat Graham) and Stefan beside Damon's objection. Klaus arrives at school pretending to be Alaric. Matt (Zach Roerig) does not know how to act around Caroline (Candice Accola) since he has to pretend that he does not remember anything of what she told him. Liz (Marguerite MacIntyre) asks him to do whatever Caroline asks him and not make her understand that he knows so he can buy her some time to see what she can do.
