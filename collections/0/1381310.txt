The Packers became the fifth team in NFL history to finish the regular season with a 15â€“1 record. Rodgers played in 15 of the 16 games, with the only exception being Week 17 against the Detroit Lions, a game in which Rodgers was rested after the club clinched home-field advantage for the playoffs the previous week. The Packers' offense set franchise record for points scored in a season with 560, which as of 2016 is the third-most ever behind only the 2007 Patriots and 2013 Broncos.[97]
