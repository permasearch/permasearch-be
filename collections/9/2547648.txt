The 1999 Ibiza Mk2 facelift (Typ 6K2, also known as 6K GP01, and sometimes referred to in the UK as the Mk3) was the second Ibiza to be produced under Volkswagen Group management. In the exterior, the facelift of the Ibiza Mk2 introduced apart from the revised front and rear end, new styling cues such as the first-seen tailgate-mounted SEAT badge that doubles also as a boot release switch when pushed swinging open the rear door, while in the interior the changes included a newly designed dashboard along with new door panels. The launch of the Cupra models, along with success in rallying gave it a much stronger, sporty image, which helped with the alignment of Volkswagen Group's acquisition of Å koda Auto as a budget brand.
