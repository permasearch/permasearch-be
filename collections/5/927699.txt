Jill is last seen with her family in the far-off mountains, having all moved there to avoid trouble with the authorities. Even as a monkey, Jill is still intelligent enough to be with her husband and kids, and is trying to make things up to them by redoubling her job as a mother. She is briefly seen at the end of the "Grounded!" storyline, albeit still a monkey, while Bart brings in the mail, unaware of an invitation from the Unforgivables invite among the received letters.
