Post won an Emmy for his Murder One theme music, and had previously been nominated for NYPD Blue, among others. He has won BMI Awards for the music for L.A. Law, Hunter, and the various Law & Order series. The theme for The Greatest American Hero (co-written with Stephen Geyer) is one of the few television themes to reach as high as #2 as a single record on the Billboard Hot 100.[4] The iconic "dun, dun" sound effect he created for the Law & Order franchise has entered popular culture.[8]
