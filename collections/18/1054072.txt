The most populous states required division into multiple Numbering Plan Areas, as each NPA was limited to 540 unique central office codes.[15] For example, New York state was initially divided into five areas, the most of any state, followed by Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas with four NPAs each. These divisions attempted to avoid cutting across heavy toll traffic routes, so that most toll traffic remained within an area, and outgoing traffic in one area would not be tributary to toll offices in an adjacent area.[16][14]
