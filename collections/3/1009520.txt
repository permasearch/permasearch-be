It was decided that the sword needed to be different from other bat'leths seen on the show,[3] and so a new hardened aluminium prop was ordered after numerous designs by John Eaves were considered on paper. As with the original bat'leth, Dan Curry created the prop.[14] Sculptor Dragon Dronet then etched designs into the blade by hand using dental tools. The producers requested designs on the blade similar to the effects seen in Damascus steel, which was combined with Dronet's idea of forming these into a topographic map, with an effect described as being "as if you're staring down at mountains".[3] Klingon names were then added to the side of the weapon. Dronet also created the stand for the sword out of plexiglas which was spray-painted to look metallic. The legs of the stand were carved to look like the feet of the Klingon animal, the targ.[4] "The Sword of Kahless" also featured new prop designs for Starfleet-issued over-the-shoulder bags and the camping equipment used in the cave sequences.[2]
