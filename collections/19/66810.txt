Both during the Gold Rush and in the decades that followed, gold-seekers also engaged in "hard-rock" mining, that is, extracting the gold directly from the rock that contained it (typically quartz), usually by digging and blasting to follow and remove veins of the gold-bearing quartz.[95] By 1851, quartz mining had become the major industry of Coloma.[96] Once the gold-bearing rocks were brought to surface, the rocks were crushed and the gold separated, either using separation in water, using its density difference from quartz sand, or by washing the sand over copper plates coated with mercury (with which gold forms an amalgam). Loss of mercury in the amalgamation process was a source of environmental contamination.[97] Eventually, hard-rock mining wound up becoming the single largest source of gold produced in the Gold Country.[89][98] The total production of gold in California from then till now is estimated at 118 million ounces (3700 t).[99]
