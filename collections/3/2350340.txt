The 1960 Davenport Braves became a member of the fledgling Midwest League (MWL), a partnership that has operated uninterrupted in the subsequent decades. The 1960 team joined the Waterloo Hawks; Keokuk Cardinals; Dubuque Packers; Clinton C-Sox; Kokomo Dodgers; Quincy Giants and Decatur Commodores to form an 8-team league.[11] The Davenport franchise has remained a continual member of the Midwest League. The creation of the Midwest League essentially ended the Three-I, which folded after the 1961 season. In its long history, the Three-I had hosted teams in 31 cities.[12]
