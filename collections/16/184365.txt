Lake Hillier is about 600 metres (2,000 ft) in length by about 250 m (820 ft) in width.[2] The lake is surrounded by a rim of sand and a dense woodland of paperbark and eucalyptus trees[3] with a narrow strip of sand dunes covered by vegetation separating its northern edge from the northern coast of Middle Island. The most notable feature of the lake is its pink, vibrant colour. The vibrant colour is permanent, and does not alter when the water is taken in a container. The pink colour is considered to be due to the presence of the organism Dunaliella salina.[4] The Extreme Microbiome Project, part of the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities (ABRF), Metagenomics Research Group (MGRG), has performed a metagenomic analysis on the lake to find Dunaliella as well as Salinibacter ruber, Dechloromonas aromatica, and a few species of the Archaea.[5] Air is the best mode of transportation for viewing the lake. At one point in its history the lake was used to collect salt.
