Inspiration Mars Foundation, an American nonprofit founded by Dennis Tito, aims to launch a manned mission to flyby Mars in January 2018, or, if the 2018 date is missed, on 2021. Flight candidates include husband and wife travel duo Jane Poynter and Taber MacCallum, who participated in the Biosphere 2 experiment.[65][66]
