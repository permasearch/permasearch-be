The band started writing and recording the next album, Animal Grace, but during the lengthy process the band members were not getting along, and Myles Goodwyn moved from his native Canada to the Bahamas. Both Animal Grace and its single "This Could be the Right One" rose quickly on the charts, but stayed only for a short time. In 1984 the band got together for its announced "Farewell Tour".
