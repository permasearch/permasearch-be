The program has been met with serious criticism by a large portion of the country. The NYSC members have complained of being underpaid, paid late or not paid at all.[4] Several youths carrying out the NYSC program have been killed in the regions where they were sent due to religious violence, ethnic violence or political violence.[5] Asides the issue of security, many have wondered the continued importance of the scheme and have called for a dialogue in this regard. Many cite the fact that the program has failed to achieve any of its set out objectives. They simply see it as a waste of time and a waste of Nigeria's resources. Some even argue that the program is a conduit for massive corruption, while others see it as government providing cheap labour for schools and its other agencies.
