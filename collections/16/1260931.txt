On July 28, 2016, the first stage from the JCSAT-2B mission was successfully test-fired for a full duration at the SpaceX McGregor facility.[118] The first reuse attempt occurred on 30 March 2017[119] with the launch of SES-10,[120] resulting in a successful flight and second landing of the B1021 first stage recovered from the CRS-8 mission of April 2016.[121] Another reflight succeeded in June 2017 with BulgariaSat-1 riding the B1029 booster from the January 2017 Iridium NEXT mission.[122] Booster B1031 flew the CRS-10 mission to the ISS in February 2017 and helped loft communications satellite SES-11 to geostationary orbit in October 2017. Boosters B1035 and B1036 were flown twice each for the same customer, B1035 for NASA missions CRS-11 and CRS-13 in June and December 2017, and B1036 for two batches of 10 Iridium NEXT satellites, also in June and December 2017. B1032 was re-used for GovSat-1 in January 2018 after NROL-76 in May 2017. Finally, B1023 and B1025 were re-used as side boosters on the Falcon Heavy test flight in February 2018.
