Votto was announced as the 2010 NL MVP, coming within one vote of winning unanimously as Albert Pujols received the other first-place vote.[22] He was only the third Canadian to win the MVP award, after Larry Walker and Justin Morneau.[23] He became the first Reds player to win the National League MVP since Barry Larkin won it in 1995. "Not to be dramatic or anything, but after I was told, I couldn't help but cry because I know how much at some point this meant to me and would have meant to my (late) father", Votto remarked after being named MVP. He added, "I did some pretty good things, and most importantly, we won. We went to the playoffs – it's been a long time since we'd been to the playoffs – and I think those all together were the reason I won."[23]
