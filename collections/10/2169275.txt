Allmusic critic Eugene Chadbourne stated in his review: "This is one of this country legend's well thought-out combinations of hardcore traditional material from Hank Williams and the Delmore Brothers, combined with his own brilliant songwriting from some of his tried and true perspectives..."[2] Music critic Robert Christgau also rated the album highly, writing "These are powerful pieces whether you like them or not, rendered with passionate sympathy and a touch of distanceâ€”his strongest in years."[3]
