Musically, "Dancing Queen" is a Europop version of American disco music.[3] As disco music dominated the US charts, the group decided to follow the trend, replicating Phil Spector's Wall of Sound arrangements.[3] The song alternates between "languid yet seductive verses" and a "dramatic chorus that ascends to heart-tugging high notes."[4] It features keyboard lines by Andersson, which accentuate the melody's sophistication and classical complexity, while Ulvaeus and Andersson interlace many instrumental hooks in and out of the mix.[4] Anni-Frid Lyngstad and Agnetha FÃ¤ltskog's layered vocals have been noted for their dynamism,[3] "[negotiating] the melody's many turns flawlessly."[4] Lyrically, the song concerns a visit to the discotheque, but approaches the subject from the joy of dancing itself, thus having a greater emotional content than that of many other disco songs.[4] The music video on YouTube has 195 million views as of August 2017.[5]
