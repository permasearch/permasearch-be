Heartbroken and enraged, Mapleshade swore eternal vengeance on the Clans. She murdered Ravinwing, the ThunderClan medicine cat who had revealed her secret and then Frecklewish, the ThunderClan leader's daughter who had watched her kits drown and made no move to help. Finally, when Appledusk took another she-cat as his mate, after having promised to love Mapleshade forever, she murdered Appledusk. However, by then, Appledusk's new mate was already expecting kits. Mapleshade knew Appledusk would live on in these kits and so swore revenge on her former mate's descendants. Because of the murders she committed, Mapleshade's spirit was denied entry into StarClan and instead sent to the Dark Forest.
