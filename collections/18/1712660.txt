Colonization with H. pylori is not a disease in and of itself, but a condition associated with a number of disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract.[16] Testing for H. pylori is not routinely recommended.[16] Testing is recommended if peptic ulcer disease or low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma is present, after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer, for first-degree relatives with gastric cancer, and in certain cases of dyspepsia.[67] Several methods of testing exist, including invasive and noninvasive testing methods.
