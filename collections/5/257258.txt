Cardiac syndrome X is chest pain (angina pectoris) and chest discomfort in people who do not show signs of blockages in the larger coronary arteries of their hearts when an angiogram (coronary angiogram) is being performed.[53] The exact cause of cardiac syndrome X is unknown. One explanation is microvascular dysfunction.[54] For reasons that are not well known, women are more likely than men to have it; however, hormones and other risk factors unique to women may play a role.[55]
