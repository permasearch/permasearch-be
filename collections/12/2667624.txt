After the band's breakthrough success with the very guitar-heavy Siamese Dream album in 1993 among the grunge movement of the early 1990s, the band moved into a more eclectic collection of music in their next album, Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. The band retained their guitar-driven sound, but also experimented in other musical sounds, most notably their single "1979", which had a stripped down, simple guitar and electronic sounds.[1] The song ended up being the band's biggest hit, reaching number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Mainstream Rock Tracks and on the Modern Rock Tracks charts.[2]
