Reward/punishment: The women visited the Knott's Berry Farm amusement park. The men cleaned the kitchens and help the prom committee put up decorations. Angered by the punishment and having to be told what to do by high school students, Russell rudely addressed the prom committee when one them casually talked about the men's teamwork, until being reprimanded by James.
