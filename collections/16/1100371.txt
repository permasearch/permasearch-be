A social unit is a group of sperm whales who live and travel together over a period of years.  Individuals rarely, if ever, join or leave a social unit. There is a huge variance in the size of social units. They are most commonly between six and nine individuals in size but can have more than twenty.[169] Unlike orcas, sperm whales within a social unit show no significant tendency to associate with their genetic relatives.[170]  Females and calves spend about three quarters of their time foraging and a quarter of their time socializing. Socializing usually takes place in the afternoon.[171]
