West Clare was one of the worst areas for evictions, where landlords turned thousands of families out and demolished their derisory cabins. Captain Kennedy in April 1848 estimated that 1,000 houses, with an average of six people to each, had been levelled since November.[101] The Mahon family of Strokestown House evicted 3,000 people in 1847, and were still able to dine on lobster soup.[102]
