â€¦you can do multiple types of annotations (highlight, asterisk, question) and you can do asterisks and questions in 7 different colors. You can also attach text notes as well as search Wikipedia, Google, Dictionary.com, Wolfram Alpha, and YouTube.  And I just noticed that you can attach a link to the webpage you just found through the search. Attaching the link is not easy, but it can be done.
