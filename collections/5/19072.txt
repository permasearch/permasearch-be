The first killer whale conceived through artificial insemination was Nakai who was born to Kasatka at the SeaWorld park in San Diego in September 2001.[29] A female killer whale named Kohana, the second killer whale conceived in this manner, was born at the same park eight months later.[30] Artificial insemination lets park owners maintain a healthier genetic mix in the small groups of killer whales at each park while avoiding the stress of moving killer whales for breeding purposes.[31]
