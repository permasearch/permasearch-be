About two-thirds of Florida occupies a peninsula between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. Florida has the longest coastline in the contiguous United States, approximately 1,350 miles (2,170Â km), not including the contribution of the many barrier islands.[22] Florida has a total of 4,510 islands that are ten acres or larger.[23][24] It is the second-highest number of islands of any state of the United States; only Alaska has more.[23] It is the only state that borders both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. Much of the state is at or near sea level and is characterized by sedimentary soil. Florida has the lowest high point of any U.S. state. The climate varies from subtropical in the north to tropical in the south.[25] The American alligator, American crocodile, American flamingo, Roseate spoonbill, Florida panther, bottlenose dolphin, and manatee can be found in Everglades National Park in the southern part of the state. Along with Hawaii, Florida is one of only two states that has a tropical climate, and is the only continental U.S. state with a tropical climate. It is also the only continental U.S. state with a coral reef, called the Florida Reef.[26] It is the only living coral barrier reef in the continental United States.[27] It is the third largest coral barrier reef system in the world (after the Great Barrier Reef and Belize Barrier Reef).[28]
