Chris plugs his ears with cotton stuffing pulled from the chair's leather padding, blocking the hypnosis. When Jeremy comes to collect him for the surgery, Chris knocks him unconscious and later impales Dean on the antlers of a deer mount. After stabbing and killing Missy and beating Jeremy to death, he drives away in Jeremy's car, but hits Georgina. Remembering his own mother's death, he carries Georgina into the car, not realizing she is possessed by Rose's grandmother Marianne; she attacks him and he crashes, killing her. Rose apprehends him with Walter, who is possessed by Roman. Chris uses the flash on his cell phone's camera to expel Roman from Walter. Walter takes Rose's rifle and shoots her, wounding her, and then shoots himself. Chris begins to strangle Rose but stops. Rod arrives in a TSA car and rescues Chris.
