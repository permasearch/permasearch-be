Claude Ely describes composing the song while sick with tuberculosis in 1934 when he was twelve years old. His family prayed for his health, and in response he spontaneously performed this song. Originally recorded by Bozie Sturdivant in 1941 in a slower, Appalachian gospel style and in 1946-7 by Sister Rosetta Tharpe with barrelhouse piano;[1] the song in Ely's version was recorded in 1953 but composed in 1934.[2] Many notable artists have performed the song, including Johnny Cash on the posthumous album American VI: Ain't No Grave.
