In The Two Towers Merry states "... there must have been ten thousand at the very least.".[97] This number is later qualified by Gandalf: "I have about ten thousand Orcs to manage.",[98] that is to say at Helm's Deep, not including other members of Saruman's hosts: "troops on great wolves", "battalions of Men", "half-orcs". The chart above shows that a host can be composed of two armies or, an army and auxiliaries. The chart also shows that an army may be ten thousand strong.
