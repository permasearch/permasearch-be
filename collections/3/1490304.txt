In 2014, Lapkus launched her own podcast on the Earwolf network, called With Special Guest Lauren Lapkus. The show's premise is that each week her guest is the host of their own podcast, and she is appearing as a character on their show. Her guests have included Paul F. Tompkins, Betsy Sodaro, Andy Daly, Nick Kroll, and Scott Aukerman.[12] She has said that she "never expected to get into podcasts at all" and to her it is funny she has one.[9]
