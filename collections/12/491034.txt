Similarly, a longitudinal study was conducted to examine the effects of paired bilingual program and an English-only reading program with Spanish speaking English learners in order to increase studentsâ€™ English reading outcomes.[46] Students whose primary language was Spanish and were part of ESL program were participants of this study. Three different approaches were the focus in which immersing students in English from the very beginning and teaching them reading only in that language; teaching students in Spanish first, followed by English; and teaching students to read in Spanish and English simultaneously. This occurs through a strategic approach such as structured English immersion or sheltered instruction.
