In 1932, Wright and his wife Olgivanna put out a call for students to come to Taliesin to study and work under Wright while they learned architecture and spiritual development. (Olgivanna Wright had been a student of G. I. Gurdjieff). Twenty-three came to live and work that year, as did many more in the years that followed. There has been considerable controversy over the living conditions and education of the Fellows; recent books have given conflicting and often unflattering pictures of their treatment.[54][55] The Fellowship has evolved into what is now the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture, an accredited school.[56] Wright was reputedly a difficult person to work with. One apprentice wrote: "He is devoid of consideration and has a blind spot regarding others' qualities. Yet I believe, that a year in his studio would be worth any sacrifice."[57]
