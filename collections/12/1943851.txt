Restoration House was originally two medieval buildings (1454 and 1502â€“22) with a space between.[1] They were joined together in 1640-1660 (tree ring data from roof) by inserting a third building between the two, to create a larger house.[1][3] The first owner of the completed house was Henry Clerke, a lawyer and Rochester MP.[1] Clerke caused further works in 1670, the refacing of the entrance facade, the Great Staircase and other internal works.[1] The house was then bought by William Bockenham.[4] It was owned by Stephen T. Aveling in the late 19th century,[5] and he wrote a history of the house which was published in Vol. 15 of "Archaeologia Cantiana".[6]
