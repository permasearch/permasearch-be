More than $400 billion were stolen from the treasury by Nigeria's leaders between 1960 and 1999.[195] In late 2013, Nigeria's then central bank governor Lamido Sanusi informed President Goodluck Jonathan that the state oil company, NNPC, had failed to remit US$20 billion in oil revenues, which it owed the state. Jonathan, however, dismissed the claim and replaced Sanusi for alleged mismanagement of the central bank's budget. A Senate committee also found Sanusi's account to be lacking substance.[196] After the conclusion of the NNPC's account audit, it was announced[who?] in January 2015 that NNPC's non-remitted revenue is actually US$1.48 billion, which it needs to refund back to the Government.[197]
