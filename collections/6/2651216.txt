The original cover art for the single was an early photograph of Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo with an unidentified female friend (shown at top of page). The cover art was soon changed, however, as the woman on the cover sued Weezer for usage of her photo without legal permission. The cover art was quickly changed to a childhood picture of Cuomo next to his younger brother, Leaves Cuomo. Cuomo wished to contact the woman, to no response.
