With her supplemental education completed, she returned to Wellesley in 1895 as an associate professor of psychology. Two years after her return she became a professor of psychology and philosophy. This addition allowed her to return to her lectures on the classics and Greek. Her experimental work continued throughout this time.[12] Beginning in 1900, Calkins began to publish a series of papers in which she described psychology as a "science of the self" â€“ this would be a premise to the development of her system of self-psychology.[2]
