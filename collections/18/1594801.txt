During oral arguments before the Supreme Court, Fortas repeatedly referenced that the existing framework for a state trial court to appoint counsel was unworkable.[5] Under the existing framework, a magistrate in a preliminary hearing made a determination on whether there were "special circumstances" in the case which supported that the Defendant should receive counsel. However, as Mr. Fortas highlighted, that determination occurred too early in the case to be of any use. For example, whether a witness's statement should be barred because it was hearsay, is an extremely complicated issue that no lay man could readily confront, and such a situation only arose in the middle of a trial.
