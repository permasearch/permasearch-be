Search engine optimization (SEO) for traditional web search engines such as Google has been popular since many years. However, since a few years, the concept of SEO is also applied to academic search engines such as Google Scholar.[40] SEO for academic articles is also called "Academic Search Engine Optimization" (ASEO) and defined as "the creation, publication, and modification of scholarly literature in a way that makes it easier for academic search engines to both crawl it and index it[40]". ASEO has been adopted by many organizations such as Elsevier,[41] OpenScience,[42] Mendeley,[43] and SAGE Publishing[44] to optimize their articles' rankings in Google Scholar. However, ASEO is not free of criticism.[36]
