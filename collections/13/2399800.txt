Goldberg has made controversial comments on the program. Her first appearance included statements taken by some to condone football player Michael Vick's dogfighting.[32][33] In 2009, she opined that Roman Polanski's rape of a thirteen-year-old in 1977[34][35] was not "rape-rape",[36] later clarified that she had intended to distinguish between statutory rape ("unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor") and forcible rape.[37] Goldberg was a staunch defender of Bill Cosby from the outset of his rape allegations, asserting he should be considered innocent until proven guilty, and questioning why Cosby had never been arrested or tried for them.[38] After learning that the statute of limitations on these allegations had expired and thus could not be tried, she called for Cosby to answer the allegations, and began advising women to come forward if they are raped.[39]
