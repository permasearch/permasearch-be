SADC countries face many social, development, economic, trade, education, health, diplomatic, defence, security and political challenges.  Some of these challenges cannot be tackled effectively by individual members.  Cattle diseases and organised-crime gangs know no boundaries.  War in one country can suck in its neighbours and damage their economies.  The sustainable development that trade could bring is threatened by the existence of different product standards and tariff regimes, weak customs infrastructure and bad roads.  The socio-economic and political and security cooperation aims of SADC are equally wide-ranging, and intended to address the various common challenges.[21]
