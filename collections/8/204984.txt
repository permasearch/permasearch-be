The General Court, as the legislative and judicial bodies, and the Governor, as the chief executive of the colony, constituted a political system of division of power. It followed a recommendation in John Calvin's political theory to set up several institutions which complement and control each other in a system of checks and balances in order to minimize the misuse of political power.[118] In 1625, the settlers had repaid their debts and thus gained complete possession of the colony.[119] The colony was de facto a republic, since neither an English company nor the King and Parliament exerted any influenceâ€”a representative democracy governed on the principles of the Mayflower Compact ("self-rule").
