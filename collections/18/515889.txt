Some link with Julius Caesar or with Roman emperors exists in other languages as well. For example, the modern German, Norwegian, Danish, Dutch, Swedish, Turkish and Hungarian terms are respectively Kaiserschnitt, keisersnitt, kejsersnit, keizersnede, kejsarsnitt, sezaryen and császármetszés (literally: "emperor's cut").[115] The German term has also been imported into Japanese (帝王切開 teiōsekkai) and Korean (제왕 절개 jewang jeolgae), both literally meaning "emperor incision". Similarly, in western Slavic (Polish) cięcie cesarskie, (Czech) císařský řez and (Slovak) cisársky rez means "emperor's cut", whereas the south Slavic term is Serbian царски рез and Slovenian cárski réz, literally tzar's cut. The Russian term kesarevo secheniye (Кесарево сечение késarevo sečénije) literally means Caesar's section. The Arabic term (ولادة قيصرية wilaada qaySaríyya) also means "Caesarean birth." The Hebrew term ניתוח קיסרי (nitúakh Keisári) translates literally as Caesarean surgery. In Romania and Portugal,[116] it is usually called cesariana, meaning from (or related to) Caesar.[citation needed]
