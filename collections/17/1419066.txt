The QX4 received its first major update in 2000 for model year 2001, with a new VQ series engine (also later seen in the G35 and FX35) increasing its power from a relatively low 168 horsepower (125 kW) to a 240 hp (179 kW) V6 engine. The displacement went from 3.3 L to 3.5 L. The timing belt was replaced with a timing chain and the ignition distributor was replaced with an individual coil ignition system.
