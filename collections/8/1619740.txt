Ponies have grazed in the area of the New Forest for many thousands of years, predating the last Ice Age.[10] Spear damage on a horse shoulder bone discovered at Eartham Pit, Boxgrove (about 50 miles (80 km) from the heart of the modern New Forest), dated 500,000 BC, demonstrates that early humans were hunting horses in the area at that time,[11] and the remains of a large Ice Age hunting camp have been found close to Ringwood (on the western border of the modern New Forest).[12] Evidence from the skeletal remains of ponies from the Bronze Age suggests that they resembled the modern Exmoor pony.[13] Horse bones excavated from Iron Age ritual burial sites at Danebury (about 25 miles (40 km) from the heart of the modern New Forest),[14] indicate that the animals were approximately 12 hands (48 inches, 122 cm)[15] – a height similar to that of some of the smaller New Forest ponies of today.
