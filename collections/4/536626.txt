In January 1917, Germany started using submarines to sink all ships headed to Britain in an attempt to starve Britain into submission. To meet this threat to the food supply voluntary rationing was introduced in February 1917. Bread was subsidised from September that year; prompted by local authorities taking matters into their own hands, compulsory rationing was introduced in stages between December 1917 and February 1918 as Britain's supply of wheat decreased to just six weeks' worth.[6] To facilitate the process, ration books were introduced in July 1918 for butter, margarine, lard, meat, and sugar.[7] For the most part, rationing benefited the health of the country. During the war, average energy intake decreased only three percent, but protein intake six percent.[8]
