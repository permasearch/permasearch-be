Darabont wrote a 60-page pilot script for "Days Gone Bye".[6] His initial script for the episode was split in half and embellished. Darabont explained that he did this to "slow the narrative down and dig into the characters more deeply, so it's not just plot-driven, event-driven stuff. You really want to drag these characters into the equation."[2] Darabont felt that instituting visual maneuvers would increase the surreal atmosphere of a scene.[6] Upon reading the script, Kirkman thought that producers were consistent with his comic, adding that they could possibly improve his initial work. "Reading that pilot was just a revelation. It's extremely faithful. There are things that are so much like the comic, I can't really remember the nuance of what's different and what's not from the comic. He's definitely being more faithful than I expected, and everything that he's changing is brilliant. I couldn't be happier. I think the fans of the book are going to just love it."[3] The episode shares its name with volume one of the comic book series.[7]
