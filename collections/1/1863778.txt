Principal photography on The Artist began in November 2010,[22] taking place over the course of thirty-five days,[23] made in the 1.33:1 screen ratio commonly used in the silent film era. Though presented in black-and-white, it was shot in color by cinematographer Guillaume Schiffman.[24] All the technical details, including lenses, lighting and camera moves, were calibrated to aesthetically match silent films of the period.[25] To recreate the slightly sped-up look of 1920s silent films, the film was shot at a slightly lower frame rate of 22 fps as opposed to the standard 24 fps.[26] Most of the film is silent, except for two brief scenes with sound as well as the non-diegetic soundtrack. Throughout the shoot, Hazanavicius played music from classic Hollywood films while the actors performed.[19]
