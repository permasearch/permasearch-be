The school remained Shawnee Mission Rural until 1948, when senior Robert F. Bennett was sent to Topeka to petition the legislature for a name change to more accurately reflect the school's suburban status. In 1950 a large addition was made, including the south academic wing, the cross hall/offices, library, Field House and music rooms. After 30 years all the buildings were connected by hallways. Later elected Governor of Kansas, Bennett was named North's first 'Distinguished Alumnus' by the class of 1975. It was thus named Shawnee Mission High School until 1958, when Shawnee Mission East opened and Shawnee Mission High School became Shawnee Mission North. The student body of Shawnee Mission High had petitioned the school board to name the new school anything other than "Shawnee Mission East" in an attempt to avoid a renaming of their school. Shawnee Mission West opened in 1962, Shawnee Mission South in 1966, and Shawnee Mission Northwest in 1969. A swimming pool and science wing were built in 1969, a developmental center in 1978, the Little Theater in 1984, and the "lunch dock" was remodeled in 1993. In the summer of 1997, a new library was added as well as air-conditioning. In 1998, the cafeteria and kitchen were remodeled. A key project at Shawnee Mission North was the demolition of the original stadium and reconstruction which began in 2005, was a rush to have it ready for the Class of 2006 Graduation. Because of the rush, the turf was not properly placed. So they redid it that summer of 2006 so it was ready for the Fall'06. Followed, in 2007, by the addition of a new auxiliary gym, fresh tennis courts, pool and auditorium remodeling, the additions of two Biology rooms, and a significant enlargement of the band and choir department.
