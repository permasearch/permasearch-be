In the Rainbow Stairwell format, players make a 60 card deck utilizing six cards from each color and colorless. These six cards must have a converted mana cost ranging from one to six, with each card taking up one of six slots.[29] Rules differ on what is allowed for the 24 land slots, with the simplest rule being 4 of each type of basic land; others allow nonbasic lands, but only if the entire cycle is used.
