The soundtrack to the film was released on April 23, 2002 by Sony Classical Records.[23] The music was composed and conducted by John Williams, and performed by the London Voices and London Symphony Orchestra.[24] The soundtrack recreates "The Imperial March" from the film The Empire Strikes Back for its first chronological appearance in Attack of the Clones, even though a hint of it appeared in the previous movie in one of the final scenes. A music video for the main theme "Across the Stars" was produced specifically for the DVD.[25]
