There is a population of rare wild (feral) horses found on Assateague Island.[37] They are believed to be descended from horses who escaped from shipwrecks.[37] Every year during the last week of July, they are captured and waded across a shallow bay for sale at Chincoteague, Virginia, a conservation technique which ensures the tiny island is not overrun by the horses.[37] The ponies and their sale were popularized by the children's book, Misty of Chincoteague.
