Several sections of Interstate 82 follow railroads and wagon roads that were built in the late 19th century to connect towns in Washington Territory, generally along the route of early Indian trails.[29] In the 1880s, the Northern Pacific Railway constructed a railroad along the Yakima River between Ellensburg and Pasco as part of its transcontinental route to Tacoma via Stampede Pass.[30][31] The section through the Yakima River Canyon between Ellensburg and North Yakima (now Yakima) bypassed an early toll road constructed by settler Jacob Durr, which traveled further west via Wenas Valley and Shushuskin Canyon.[32][33]
