Embalming is distinct from taxidermy. Embalming preserves the human body intact, whereas taxidermy is the recreation of an animal's form often using only the creature's skin mounted on an anatomical form. Embalming also differs from Anatomical Wetting in which medical specimens (including cadavers) are preserved for further study and research. Anatomical Wetting does not concern with the overall appearance and uses different chemicals than a traditional funerary embalming.
