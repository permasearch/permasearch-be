Eritrea is a one-party state in which national legislative elections have been repeatedly postponed.[15] According to Human Rights Watch, the government's human rights record is considered among the worst in the world.[16] Most Western countries have accused the Eritrean authorities of arbitrary arrest and detentions, and of detaining an unknown number of people without charge for their political activism. However, the Eritrean government has continually dismissed the accusations as politically motivated.[17]
