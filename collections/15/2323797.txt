Juan Martin de Porres Velázquez was born in the city of Lima, in the Viceroyalty of Peru, on December 9, 1579. He was the illegitimate son of a Spanish nobleman, Don Juan de Porres, and Ana Velázquez, a freed slave from Panama, of African or possibly part Native American descent.[1][2] He had a sister named Juana, born two years later in 1581. After the birth of his sister, the father abandoned the family.[3] Ana Velázquez supported her children by taking in laundry.[4] He grew up in poverty and, when his mother could not support him, Martin was confided to a primary school for two years, and then placed with a barber/surgeon to learn the medical arts.[2] He spent hours of the night in prayer, a practice which increased as he grew older.
