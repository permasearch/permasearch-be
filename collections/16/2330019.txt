Small craters of special interest (for example, visited by lunar missions) receive human first names (Robert, JosÃ©, Louise etc.). One of the biggest lunar craters, Apollo, is named after Apollo missions. Many smaller craters inside and near it bear the names of deceased American astronauts, and many craters inside and near Mare Moscoviense bear the names of deceased Soviet cosmonauts.[11][12] Besides this, in 1970 twelve craters were named after twelve living astronauts (6 Soviet and 6 American).[11]
