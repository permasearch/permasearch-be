It is later said, in volume 3, chapter 19 (the epilogue) that, now with Lydia's negative influence removed, and often spending much time in the company of her two well-behaved older sisters, Kitty has improved ("Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great. She was not so ungovernable a temper as Lydia, and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid. From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's society [Kitty] was carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the 'promise' of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going").
