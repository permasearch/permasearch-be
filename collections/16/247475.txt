Increased humanâ€“bear interaction has created "problem bears": bears adapted to human activities or habitat.[114] Aversive conditioning using rubber bullets, foul-tasting chemicals, or acoustic deterrent devices attempt to condition bears to associate humans with unpleasantness, but is ineffectual when bears have already learned to positively associate humans with food.[115] Such bears are translocated or killed because they pose a threat to humans. The B.C. government kills approximately 50 problem bears each year[115] and overall spends more than one million dollars annually to address bear complaints, relocate bears and kill them.[115]
