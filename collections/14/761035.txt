Pam apologizes to Jim that Roy attacked him but her assurance that her relationship with Roy is over for good is met with polite skepticism. Roy picks up his last paycheck, apologizes to Jim for threatening him during their previous encounter, and asks Pam to join him for coffee. Their meeting at a local diner is awkward and ends with their relationship (and even friendship) appearing to be over; they hug and Pam wipes a tear from her face. Roy encourages Pam to pursue her feelings for Jim but she says she will not try to get him. Roy does not understand his long-time fiancÃ©e, especially her choice to not pursue Jim.
