Again the bass line carries the music, with now a flute line accompanying it. Soon the strings from the orchestra, make their entrance, featuring violins, violas, cellos, and basses. The second movement starts at a fairly slow tempo, before speeding up somewhat into its repeats.[2][4] The significant chord progression in this part is from C to Bâ™­add9.[5] The movement's single lyric repeats over and over as a mantra, in the style of Van Morrison. Around the 7-minute mark a full orchestra appears to accompany the band to the gradually fading conclusion.
