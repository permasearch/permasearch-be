Christine, Nina, Ronan, Phillip, Katherine, Paul, and Heather also know the truth about Chance's "death", and later Jill finds out as well. Christine tells Ronan, Paul, and Heather at the hospital that Chance is indeed a match for Ronan's partial liver transplant. The procedure is completed, but afterwards Ronan disappears. Christine later traces Ronan and it appears that Ronan came to Genoa City only to find his family and a match for a liver donation.
