The head superintendent of the project was Anthony "Tony Raf" Rafaniello,[36] who worked for HRH Construction.[37] He was in charge of coordinating construction based on the site's blueprints.[37] Rafaniello was supported by five assistant superintendents, including Jeff Doynow, who was one of the first "concrete supervisors" to be hired for the construction of a skyscraper.[38] After Rafaniello was hired for the Trump Tower project in September 1980, he spent a week planning a three-phase construction schedule.[31] Once the subcontractors were hired, Rafaniello made sure they met once a week ensure they were working on the same phase.[39]
