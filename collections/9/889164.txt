The river is heavily used for recreation, including whitewater rafting and fly fishing.  A common rafting run is the River Ranch Run. Starting from the outlet gates at Lake Tahoe stretching about 3 miles (4.8Â km), the run ends at the River Ranch Restaurant.  These rapids are almost all class 1 and class 2. In downtown Reno the river has been sculpted into a half-mile Class 2/3 whitewater park, and is used mainly for kayaking.[22]
