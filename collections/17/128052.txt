Along with the asteroid bodies, the asteroid belt also contains bands of dust with particle radii of up to a few hundred micrometres. This fine material is produced, at least in part, from collisions between asteroids, and by the impact of micrometeorites upon the asteroids. Due to the Poyntingâ€“Robertson effect, the pressure of solar radiation causes this dust to slowly spiral inward toward the Sun.[73]
