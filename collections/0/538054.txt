The trophy for the main award was created in the 1950s and cost about £1,000. It was first presented to the inaugural winner, Christopher Chataway, in 1954. It is a silver-plated four-turret lens camera, with the name of each winner engraved on individual shields attached to a plinth underneath the camera. The trophy originally had one plinth, but two more were added to create room for more shields.[53] A replica trophy was made in 1981 and sent to India in case Ian Botham won the award while playing cricket there—which he did.[54] The original trophy is still used for the ceremony, and is engraved after the show before being given to the winner, who keeps it for eight or nine months.[53] The trophies for second and third place, and for the other awards, are smaller imitations of the main trophy,[55][56] but have in the past been silver salvers.[57] For the two special awards celebrating the 50th Anniversary, and for the Sports Personality of the Century award, similar miniature trophies were presented but they were gold in colour.[58][59]
