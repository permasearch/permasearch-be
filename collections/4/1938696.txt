There is in common usage found the derivative term technocrat. Technocrat can refer to someone exercising governmental authority because of their knowledge,[11] or "a member of a powerful technical elite", or "someone who advocates the supremacy of technical experts".[12][4][5] McDonnell and Valbruzzi define a prime minister or minister as a technocrat if “at the time of his/her appointment to government, he/she: has never held public office under the banner of a political party; is not a formal member of any party; and is said to possess recognized non-party political expertise which is directly relevant to the role occupied in government”.[13]
