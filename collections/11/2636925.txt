Research on flightless rails indicates the flightless condition evolved in the absence of predators.[29] This shows flight to be generally necessary for survival and dispersal in birds.[30] In apparent contradiction to this, many landmasses occupied by ratites are also inhabited by predatory mammals.[8] However, the Kâ€“Pg extinction event created a window of time with large predators absent that may have allowed the ancestors of ratites to evolve flightlessness.[6] They subsequently underwent selection for large size.[6] One hypothesis suggests that as predation pressure decreases on islands with low raptor species richness and no mammalian predators, the need for large, powerful flight muscles that make for a quick escape decreases.[31] Moreover, raptor species tend to become generalist predators on islands with low species richness as opposed to specializing in the predation of birds. An increase in leg size compensates for a reduction in wing length in insular birds that have not lost flight by providing a longer lever to increase force generated during the thrust that initiates takeoff.[31]
