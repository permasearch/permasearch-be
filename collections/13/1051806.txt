Modeled on the British public school, and funded by the colonial administration, Government College was established in 1929 to educate Nigeria's future elite.[20] It had rigorous academic standards and was vigorously elitist, accepting boys purely on the basis of ability.[20] The language of the school was English, not only to develop proficiency but also to provide a common tongue for pupils from different Nigerian language groups.[21] Achebe described this later as being ordered to "put away their different mother tongues and communicate in the language of their colonisers".[22] The rule was strictly enforced and Achebe recalls that his first punishment was for asking another boy to pass the soap in Igbo.[21]
