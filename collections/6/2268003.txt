Following the 1967 death of actress Jayne Mansfield in an auto/truck accident, the US government agency NHTSA recommended requiring a rear underride guard, also known as a "Mansfield bar", an "ICC bar", or a "DOT (Department of Transportation) bumper".[17][18] They are required to be not more than 22 in (56 cm) from the road.[19] The trucking industry has been slow to upgrade this safety feature,[15] and there are no requirements to repair ICC bars damaged in service.[20] However, in 1996 NHTSA upgraded the requirements for the rear underride prevention structure on truck trailers, and Transport Canada went further with an even more stringent requirement for energy-absorbing rear underride guards,[21] and in July 2015 NHTSA issued a proposal to upgrade the US performance requirements for underride guards.[22]
