Since the 1978 economic reforms in China, the state reduced its role to directing economic activity rather than managing it through directive plans. By the early 21st century, the Chinese government had limited the role of directive mandatory planning to goods of national importance and large-scale construction, while increasing the scope of indicative planning and market forces in all other sectors of the economy.[4] The current Chinese Socialist market economy is largely based on market forces for consumer goods and indicative planning for heavy industry in the public sector.
