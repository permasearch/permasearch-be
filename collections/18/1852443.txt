Group marriage implies a strong commitment to be faithful[when defined as?] by only having sex within the group and staying together longterm. The group may be open to taking on new partners, but only if all members of the family agree to accept the new person as a partner. The new person then moves into the household and becomes an equal member of the family.[citation needed]
