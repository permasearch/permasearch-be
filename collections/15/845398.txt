Mostly known as Tapu. The role is played by Raj Anadkat (2017â€“present)/Bhavya Gandhi (2008-2017). He is the son of Jethalal. Tapu enjoys close bonding with his grandfather Champaklal who always shields him from the anger of Jethalal for participating in mischievous activities. He is the leader of Tapusena, the gang of society's children. Tapu is now grown up and college going teenager. Tapu is good in academics and sports. In earlier episodes, he was shown to be very naughty, often creating chaos and nuisance in the society which earned him ire of both Jethalal and Bhide. However, the grown up, mature Tapu is now capable of solving many miscellaneous problems and also indulges into social service.[3]
