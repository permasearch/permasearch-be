The term 'road rage' is commonly used to refer to situations that are the result of some form of impatience, though of course there can be other factors involved. This phrase refers to circumstances where one or both drivers get into a confrontation in which they are emotionally involved. Driving anywhere in the world can be frustrating. However, attitudes towards annoying circumstances vary widely from one place to another. Excessive honking, as a further example of impatience, is very common in some countries, but not so much in others.
