Clements and Musker enjoyed the song but would sometimes disagree with Ashman over its lyrics, which Ashman had insisted be very specific.[1] Musker specifically wanted to change the line "I wanna be where the people are" because he felt that it sounded too political and reminded him of Governor of Illinois Dan Walker, suggesting that "the" be removed.[1] Appalled by this suggestion, Ashman insisted that the line remain unchanged to prevent the word "where" from having to be held longer; Musker would eventually admit that his suggestion was "idiotic".[1] Although Ashman was very defensive about the song and typically dismissed most of the directors' suggestions, he agreed to revise lyrics that originally described the contents of Ariel's grotto using eloquent terms such as "fine china" and "books bound in leather and gold", and replaced them with words that would be more familiar to a mermaid who learns about humans from an uneducated seagull named Scuttle.[1] Ashman's revisions integrated funnier lyrics such as "thingamabobs” and “whozits and whatzits" into the song, making "Part of Your World" more consistent with the film's lighthearted tone.[1] Ashman initially pitched Ariel's reprise of "Part of Your World" as a sad lament in which the character sings "I’ll never be…part of that world".[1] Clements and Musker argued that the reprise should instead convey Ariel's determined nature as she decides to pursue her dream of becoming part of Eric's world.[1] Howard agreed to rewrite the reprise into a more positive anthem that ultimately reads "I don’t know when, I don’t know how, but I know something’s starting right now…Watch and you’ll see…someday I’ll be…part of your world", providing the film with more momentum while establishing further conflict between Ariel and her father King Triton.[1] Ashman's willingness to rewrite both versions of the song's lyrics pleasantly surprised the directors.[1]
