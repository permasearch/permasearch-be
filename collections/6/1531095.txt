TR> When the King of Stonesylvania visits Bedrock, he decides he wants to be a normal person, dead-ringer look-alike Fred is hired to fill in for him as king.

When Wilma mistakes the king for Fred, more troubles begin for both the king and Fred.  Note: This episode is a reworking of episode 22, "The Tycoon".
