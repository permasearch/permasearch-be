Two years after Hanna disappeared, Sam hacked into the bank account of a drug lord, and stole $100,000, using the money to frame Trent for the robbery, setting him up to be killed, as revenge for killing Hanna.[4] Sam later moved to New York and became a professional assassin and ruthless hacker-for-hire under the alias "Root". She has no qualms about killing, murdering or torturing people to get whatever she wants.[5] She was hired by Pete Matheson to assassinate Congressman Michael Delancey. Through the use of a patsy, Scott Powell, Root was successful. However, her plan to kill Powell afterwards was foiled by John Reese. Ultimately, the operation fell apart as Reese took out one of her men and stole his phone while Finch provided a phone recording to the FBI proving Matheson's involvement. Realizing this, Root killed her client and staged it as a suicide out of guilt for his actions, exonerating Powell. Root cleared out of her location, the dorm room of an uninvolved college student away on winter break, before the FBI, acting on an "anonymous" tip (from Finch) could apprehend her. She had a brief instant message conversation with Finch, acknowledging him as a worthy opponent and said she was looking forward to the next time. She ended the conversation with "Harold", letting him know that she knew who he was.[6]
