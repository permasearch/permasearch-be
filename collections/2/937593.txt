Following the group's unsuccessful debut, "Hey Little Bird", The Barbarians had their breakthrough with an appearance, alongside other musical artists such as The Rolling Stones and The Supremes, on The T.A.M.I. Show. In order to take advantage of their exposure, the band recorded "Are You a Boy or Are You a Girl" with the B-side, "Take It or Leave It". Guitarist Geoffry Morris, who had recently joined the band, was responsible for the arrangements.[2] The song reflected on the social commentary of the period, more so on what distinguishes a male from a female. The lyrics express both sides' opposing views on issues like hair length or how a person dresses. The band themselves were atypical as they grew their hair long and wore unusual clothing. Jerry Causi, as lead vocalist, initiates call and response with Bruce Benson and Jeff Morris on backing vocals.[3] There is also mockery toward bands from England with lyrics like "Your're either a girl, or you come from Liverpool", and more specifically "You can dance like a female monkey, but sink like a stone...yeah a rolling stone", a direct reference to The Rolling Stones.[4] The song ends with a brief R&B influenced guitar solo before fading out.
