The Imperial toga was a "vast expanse" of semi-circular white wool that could not be put on and draped correctly without assistance.[443] In his work on oratory, Quintilian describes in detail how the public speaker ought to orchestrate his gestures in relation to his toga.[442][444][449] In art, the toga is shown with the long end dipping between the feet, a deep curved fold in front, and a bulbous flap at the midsection.[444] The drapery became more intricate and structured over time, with the cloth forming a tight roll across the chest in later periods.[450] The toga praetexta, with a purple or purplish-red stripe representing inviolability, was worn by children who had not come of age, curule magistrates, and state priests. Only the emperor could wear an all-purple toga (toga picta).[451]
