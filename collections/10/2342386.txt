In March 2017, some activists of the Karni Sena broke 50-year-old mirrors installed in the Padmini Palace, that was said to have been the palace of Padmavati. The mirrors until then were shown to tourists as part of the narrative that the queen's face was revealed to Alauddin Khilji through them as part of the latter's compromise with her husband Ratan Singh. The activists deplored this claiming that mirrors did not exist during the time.[79] Later that month, while the cast and crew were filming a scene in Masai plateau, Kolhapur at night, a mob of around 20â€“30 people armed with petrol bombs, stones and lathis charged and set the set ablaze, injuring animals and destroying several costumes. The attacks were considered staged as they were based on the false pretext set up by Rajput groups that the film includes a dream sequence in which Padmavati and Alauddin Khilji are seen in intimate contact.[80] In October, a rangoli of the first poster released from the film, which reportedly took 48 hours to create, was destroyed by a group of around 100 people shouting religious slogans. Action was taken by the police after Padukone expressed her anger on social media.[81] Members of the Sena later stated that they would prevent release even if objectionable parts were cut.[82]
