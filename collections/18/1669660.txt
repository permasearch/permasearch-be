In "Cyrus Skies", Cyrus sings "I’ve been alive but I’ve been a liar" in an exaggerated manner[23] over an "opulent pop" beat which "comes off like a horror movie Lana Del Rey."[13] "1 Sun" has been called a "Lady Gaga-Sky Ferreira hybrid" with an "industrial-electro-tinged" production and environmentally-conscious lyrics reminiscent of "Wake Up America" from Cyrus' second studio album, Breakout (2008).[13][22] According to Cyrus, she "passive aggressively" included "Miley Tibetan Bowlzzz" on the album as a demonstration of artistic control and independence when her team expressed concern that the album might be "too long". Her father, Billy Ray Cyrus, recorded her playing the Tibetan bowls; she "[wanted] people to listen all the way through just once, because it’s a nice story".[29] "Pablow the Blowfish" is a piano-based ballad addressing Cyrus' grief for her pet fish, with "silly" and "endearing" lyrics (including "watching my friends eat my friends ruined my appetite", referring to a sushi outing).[20] Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz closes with "Twinkle Song", inspired by the death of her friend's cat;[30] Cyrus' vocal begins in a "controlled country-ballad voice" which becomes "powerful yelling."[31]
