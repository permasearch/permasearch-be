The Mustang has a MacPherson-strut front suspension with reverse "L" lower control arms. The rear suspension was a new three-link system with a Panhard Rod that controls the vertical and lateral movements of the axle.[15] This live axle rear suspension, while sacrificing handling, provides the benefits of reduced cost and weight over heavier, more expensive independent rear suspensions. In spite of this, Ford has drawn heavy criticism from the automotive journalism community for the decision to equip the 5th generation Mustang with the live axle system. At a press conference, Ford stated that to include an independent rear suspension would have added $5,000 to the showroom price of the car.
