Each of these algorithms using 5 weighings finds among 11 coins up to two counterfeit coins which could be heavier or lighter than real coins by the same value. In this case the uncertainty domain (the set of admissible situations) contains     1 + 2  C  11   1   +  2  2    C  11   2   =  3  5     {\displaystyle 1+2C_{11}^{1}+2^{2}C_{11}^{2}=3^{5}}   situations, i.e. the constructed WA lies on the Hamming bound for     t = 2   {\displaystyle t=2}   and in this sense is perfect.
