Lou Lumenick, of the New York Post strongly criticized both the film and Jackson's performances. Lumenick's criticism of Jackson's performances was he felt Jackson moves "stiffly and lethargically" and that it was "clear" that Jackson was lip-synching while performing "Thriller."[114] He felt Jackson's performance of "Smooth Criminal" looked "incongruous, to say the least" and that "the hokey environmental visuals accompanying 'Earth Song' are even worse," and cited "Beat It" as being the movie's "only half-decent number."[114] Lumenick said that he was certain that a "perfectionist" like Jackson would not want to have been remembered by a "shoddy piece of exploitation."[114] David Edwards, of Daily Mirror, stated that while he felt that the film is a "success" he overall disliked the film, having felt that "as an exercise in wringing every last penny from Jackson's legacy" the film "most certainly isn't it" a tribute.[115] Alex Fletcher, of Digital Spy described the film as having been an "essential viewing" and praised the film for showing "the real Michael Jackson" â€” which consisted of "difficult, odd, kind, obsessive and funny." He cited Jackson's best performances as "Thriller" and "Billie Jean" and the "worst material" as "Earth Song."[113] However, Fletcher did feel that, while based on the rehearsal footage, Jackson "falls short of his groundbreaking Dangerous and Bad world tours," he noted that Jackson's age and thinness was mostly likely a factor in his performances and described Jackson as having more "star quality and charisma than a million Simon Cowell factory-line production pop singers."[113]
