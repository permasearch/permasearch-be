On 23 September, Wellesley led his forces over a ford in the river Kaitna and the Battle of Assaye commenced.[79] After crossing the ford the infantry was reorganised into several lines and advanced against the Maratha infantry. Wellesley ordered his cavalry to exploit the flank of the Maratha army just near the village.[79] During the battle Wellesley himself came under fire; two of his horses were shot from under him and he had to mount a third.[80] At a crucial moment, Wellesley regrouped his forces and ordered Colonel Maxwell (later killed in the attack) to attack the eastern end of the Maratha position while Wellesley himself directed a renewed infantry attack against the centre.[80]
