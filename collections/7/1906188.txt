Observations on Earth and numerical modeling have shown that a crater-forming impact can result in the creation of a long lasting hydrothermal system when ice is present in the crust. For example, a 130Â km large crater could sustain an active hydrothermal system for up to 2 million years, that is, long enough for microscopic life to emerge,[25] but unlikely to have progressed any further down the evolutionary path.[29]
