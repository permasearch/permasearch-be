In pharmacological terms, melatonin works by activating one of two pharmacological receptors; MT1 or MT2. These are both G-protein coupled membrane receptors.[62] When used several hours before sleep according to the phase response curve for melatonin in humans, small amounts (0.3Â mg[63]) of melatonin shift the circadian clock earlier, thus promoting earlier sleep onset and morning awakening.[64] In humans, 90% of orally administered exogenous melatonin is cleared in a single passage through the liver, a small amount is excreted in urine, and a small amount is found in saliva.[65]
