Bond order is the number of chemical bonds between a pair of atoms. For example, in diatomic nitrogen N≡N the bond order is 3, in acetylene H−C≡C−H the bond order between the two carbon atoms is also 3, and the C−H bond order is 1. Bond order gives an indication of the stability of a bond. An element with bond order value 0 cannot exist, but compounds can have a 0 bond value. Isoelectronic species have same bond number.[1]
