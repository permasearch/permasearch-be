In 2000, Yankari National Park hosted over 20,000 tourists from over 100 countries. This makes it the most popular tourist destination in Nigeria and, if properly managed, it could become a significant part in the development and promotion of tourism throughout Nigeria.[3] It is one of a few remaining areas left in West Africa where wild animals are protected in their natural habitat.
