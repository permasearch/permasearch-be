One of Abraham's most important features in Islamic theology is his role as the constructor of the Ka‘bah. Although tradition recounts that Adam constructed the original Ka‘bah, which was demolished by the Great Flood at the time of Noah, Abraham is believed to have rebuilt it in its original form. The Qur'an, in the Muslim perspective, merely confirms or reinforces the laws of pilgrimage. The rites were instituted by Abraham and for all Muslims, as they perform the pilgrimage, the event is a way to return to the perfection of Abraham's faith.[44] Just as Medina is referred to as the "City of the Prophet [Muhammad]" or simply the "City of Muhammad", Mecca is frequently cited as the "City of Abraham", because Abraham's reformation of the purified monotheistic faith took place purely in Mecca.[45]
