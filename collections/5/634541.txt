Jonathan (Maulik Pancholy) is Jack's assistant. Jonathan harbours a desperate crush on Jack. His obsessive admiration of his boss is coupled with disdain towards Liz, whom he considers unworthy of Jack's attention. In the episode "Believe in the Stars," Jack reveals he only hired him because he was heavily medicated on Comanaprosil and he mistook Jonathan for M. Night Shyamalan.[8] In season 4, episode 11 ("Winter Madness") it is revealed that Jonathan is of Indian descent, and in episode 18 ("Khonani") he addresses the janitor Khonani in Hindi. Elsewhere, he mentions meeting his "birth parents," revealing he is adopted, and when in the season-five episode "Let's Stay Together", when Jack asks Jonathan to provide a distraction by pretending to be a stereotypical Indian and faking an Indian accent, Jonathan objects, "But I'm from Palo Alto!" More than once Jonathan has made racist comments about people from Indian Kashmir ("Khonani," "Operation Righteous Cowboy Lightning").
