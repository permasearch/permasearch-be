The Department of Treasury issued notes until 1924, when this responsibility was transferred to the Commonwealth Bank.[2] The ANB was abolished by the Commonwealth Bank Act 1924, due to Treasurer and Country Party Leader Earle Page wanting to end the monetary contraction which particularly hurt his farming constituents, who were as a result receiving reduced export prices.[7] The new Board of Directors replacing it,[2] which was composed of various areas of the industry, soon appointed Garvan chairman, and thus he continued his policies. In 1925, both the pound sterling and Australian pound returned to the pre-war gold standard. The primary role of the Commonwealth Bank continued to be a savings and trading bank, even though the government attempted to make the bank into a central bank through its actions in 1924.[7]
