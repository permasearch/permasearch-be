In the United States, the hymn is usually set to an American folk tune known as "Nettleton", composed by printer John Wyeth,[3] or possibly by Asahel Nettleton.[4] In the United Kingdom, the hymn is also often set to the tune "Normandy" by C Bost.[5] The "Nettleton" tune is used extensively in partial or full quotation by the American composer Charles Ives, in such works as the First String Quartet and the piano quintet and song "The Innate". The "Nettleton" tune is also quoted at the end of "My Trundle Bed" by Tullius C. O'Kane. A shape note song called "Warrenton" also has been sung with a chorus being in 4/4 time or 2/2 cut time; to fit the text to this melody, the second half of each verse is omitted and replaced with a refrain of "I am bound for the kingdom, will you come to glory with me? / Hallelujah, praise the Lord!"[6]
