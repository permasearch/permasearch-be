These changes have had uneven effects on Mexican agriculture.[1] Until the late 1990s, Mexico was a net exporter of agricultural products, but today it is a net importer, mostly from the United States.[9] With the need to compete with imported grains and less direct support from the government, the agricultural sector entered a crisis. Mexican agricultural income has polarized with large commercial farms dominating the sector and at the other end small subsistence farming which still is the main source of income for many, especially in the south of the country. The former are able to take advantage of reduced trade barriers and exports, especially to the United States have increased.[1][5] Former subsidies provided by the government was replaced by a program called Procampo, which gave direct cash payments to farmers growing corn, beans, wheat and other grains, allowing farmers to decide what to plant.[6][9]
