GOES-14 is in storage at 105Â°W. The launch of this satellite, which was designated GOES-O before orbiting, was delayed several times.[6][7] It was launched successfully on 27 June 2009 from Space Launch Complex 37, piggybacking on a Delta IV rocket.[8] It underwent Post-Launch Testing until December 2009 and then was placed in on-orbit storage.[2] This satellite is a part of the GOES-N Series. GOES-14 has been and will be activated should another GOES satellite suffer a problem or be decommissioned.[9] It was temporarily designated GOES-East because of technical difficulties with GOES-13 and moved towards the GOES-East location. After resolution of those problems, GOES-14 was returned to storage.[3]
