The Range Rover Sport is powered by a supercharged 4.2-litre all-aluminium Jaguar engine AJ-V8 producing 390 hp (290 kW) and 550 N⋅m (410 lb⋅ft). A naturally aspirated 4.4-litre variant produces 300 hp (220 kW) and 425 N⋅m (313 lb⋅ft) and has been adapted by Land Rover with a slightly greater capacity and increased torque. Both petrol engines have been designed with a sump and oil pick-up system to allow for operation at extreme angles. Due to lack of popularity, the naturally aspirated power plant was omitted from the UK market in 2007. The advanced 2.7-litre turbodiesel TDV6 is an adaptation of the PSA/Ford development and produces 190 hp (140 kW) and 440 N⋅m (320 lb⋅ft) in Land Rover guise. It features a compacted graphite iron block and aluminium cylinder head with fast switching piezo crystal injectors. Debuting in both the Sport and Vogue in 2007 was the 3.6-litre twin turbodiesel TDV8. This engine is a further adaptation of the TDV6 but features a 90 degree block (as opposed to a 60 degree layout), twin variable geometry turbochargers and inlet valve deactivation. All engine variants are mated to an adaptive six-speed ZF automatic transmission with CommandShift which reacts and adapts to varying driving styles. CommandShift gives the driver the freedom to sequentially manipulate gear changes.
