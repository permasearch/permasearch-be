Billboard magazine said of the single, "Cee-Lo scorches the vocal hook--"Who's gonna save my soul now?"â€”and it stops the moderately paced dance cut dead in its tracks."[7] The magazine also said it "might be his finest performance to date."[8] Entertainment Weekly called the song "dolefully paced: and "nearly dirgelike,"[9] while People called it "a gritty, gospel-infused plea."[10] Performing Songwriter praised the song as "a stark song with plucked strings and bass so heavy and distant it could be a psychic echo."[11] USA Today said of the single, "Nobody lays bare their broken heart more painfully or more plaintively than Cee-Lo," and named the tune its "Pick of the Week" in late January 2009.[12] It was featured in the closing scene of the final episode of the first season of the AMC original series Breaking Bad[13] and Detroit 1-8-7 in its 17th episode.
