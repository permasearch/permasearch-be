The government has found itself struggling to provide police forces with sufficient pay and protection to make it worthwhile resisting the threats and blandishments of drug traffickers,[1] though recent efforts to reform the federal police saw a tenth of the 30,000+ officers fired in the first eight months of 2010.[2] There has been a tendency to increase the militarization of policing. In 2006, 45,000 troops of the Mexican Army were deployed to fight Drug cartels,[1] with the number rising to 50,000 by October 2010.[2] In Monterrey, police, soldiers, and prosecutors have conducted joint patrols, which have seen violence reduced.[2]
