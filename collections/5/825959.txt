Werner von Strucker (portrayed by Spencer Treat Clark)[195] is the son of Hydra leader Wolfgang von Strucker, who is recruited to Hydra by Ward after Wolfgang's death. After failing to follow Ward's orders to kill Garner, Werner is left in a vegetative state by Kebo, and is taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. He is later hospitalized in an asylum and teams up with General Hale and her daughter Ruby upon being freed. Werner gave in to General Hale's demands when he saw one of his father's experiments in the form of Carl Creel lifting weights. After Ruby gets 8% of the gravitonium in her, Werner is accidentally killed by Ruby.
