The eruptions intensified at about 7 p.m. on 10 April 1815.[25] Three columns of "flame" rose and merged[26] as the mountain became flowing mass of "liquid fire".[26] Pumice stones of up to 20 cm (8 in) wide rained down at approximately 8 p.m., followed by ash at around 9–10 p.m. Hot pyroclastic flows cascaded from the mountain to the sea on all sides of the peninsula, wiping out the village of Tambora. Loud explosions were heard until the next evening, 11 April. The veil of ash spread as far as West Java and South Sulawesi, while a "nitrous" odor was noticeable in Batavia. The heavy tephra-tinged rain did not finally recede until 17 April.[25]
