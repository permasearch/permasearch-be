Surveys show that 40 to 70 percent of those 65 years old and older suffer from chronic sleep disturbances.[2]  The elderly tend to go to bed early in the evening and wake earlier in the morning than younger adults. Furthermore, the elderly often wake several times throughout the night and have difficulty falling asleep. They are prone to taking numerous naps during the day.  Furthermore, constant lighting in assisted living facilities has been demonstrated to impair sleep ability.[3]
