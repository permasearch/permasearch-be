The family is known to have employed Zuma's wife Bongi Ngema-Zuma. One of Zuma's sons, Duduzane Zuma was a director in a number of Gupta owned firms and one of his daughters, Duduzile Zuma, was made a director of the Gupta owned Sahara computers shortly after Zuma's election to the presidency in 2008. She has since resigned from that position.[7] Duduzane Zuma has also since resigned from all positions held at Gupta owned businesses.[32] Zuma's close relationship with the family is a source of tension within Zuma's own party the ANC.[33] Likewise, Zuma denies granting undue influence to the family.[34]
