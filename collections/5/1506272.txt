Following India's poor batting display in the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy[73] and the ODI series in South Africa, in which they were whitewashed 4â€“0,[74] Ganguly made his comeback to the Test team.[75] Wasim Jaffer, Zaheer Khan and Anil Kumble had earlier been selected for the one-day squad, despite their recent poor performances.[76] Many saw this as an indictment of coach Greg Chappell's youth-first policy.[77] Coming in at 37/4, Ganguly scored 83 in a tour match against the rest of South Africa, modifying his original batting style and taking a middle-stump guard,[78] resulting in India winning the match.[79] During his first Test innings since his comeback, against South Africa in Johannesburg his score of 51 helped India to victory, marking the first Test match win for the team in South Africa.[80][81] Though India lost the series, Ganguly accumulated the most runs on the scoring chart.[82] After his successful Test comeback he was recalled for the ODI team, as India played host to West Indies[83] and Sri Lanka[84] in back to back ODI tournaments. In his first ODI innings in almost two years,[85] he scored a matchwinning 98.[86] He performed well in both series, averaging almost 70[85] and won the Man of the Series Award against Sri Lanka.[87]
