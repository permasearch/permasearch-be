The film grossed $13,422,500 on its opening weekend,[28] playing to 1,311 theaters at its widest release. This was 29.5% of its total gross. It has achieved total lifetime worldwide gross of $87,987,055.[29] Despite being No. 1 at the box office, this illustrates the series' diminishing returns, since Jaws 3-D has earned nearly $100 million less than the total lifetime gross of its predecessor[30] and $300 million less than the original film.[31] The final sequel would attract an even lower income, with around two thirds of Jaws 3-D's total lifetime gross.[32] However, the film was still drawing huge audiences when it was pulled from theaters; film historian R.M. Hayes says this action "was pure nonsense considering some cinemas were actually turning over more money per screen than the latest Star Wars film".[17]
