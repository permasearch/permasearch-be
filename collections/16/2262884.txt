Experts have argued that a guest worker program is necessary for American employers to make up for labor shortages within the United States,[40][41][42] particularly in "agricultural labor or services of a temporary or seasonal nature."[43] Guest worker programs can "promote a healthy agricultural market in the U.S."[3] by keeping supply levels up,[3] prices for consumers down,[39][40] and wages for workers down.[39][40] It has also been argued that guest worker programs can help control immigration.[3][40] In 2009, over 80 percent of agricultural workers in the United States did not have the proper legal documentation necessary for employment.[43] Guest worker programs can help cut down on undocumented workers by allowing the Immigration and Naturalization Service to "secur[e] the cooperation of growers who [are] hiring workers illegally."[3]
