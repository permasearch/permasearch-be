In May 2013, Barnet and Chase Farm Hospitals released a YouTube video, 'Use This Handwash Style!', as part of a major new hand hygiene campaign. The video amended the lyrics to hit song Gangnam Style to remind staff about the seven stages of handwashing. Featuring over 300 members of staff from several departments washing their hands whilst dancing to the song, it became an unexpected online hit, averaging over a thousand views a day in the first week of its release.
