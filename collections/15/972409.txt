Although meant as a way of saving the Ocampa, the Caretaker's abduction caused the death of many of the Voyager Starfleet crew including some very critical roles including first officer, chief engineer, and medical staff.[10] This creates a labor shortage that has to be filled in various ways, in particular the Maquis crew, who lost their ship, are able to fill some of the highest-ranking positions including first officer and chief engineer. Voyager successfully recovers Tuvok, who was working as a spy, and he is also able to join the crew. However, over the course of the next seven years according to the theatrically exposed timeline over 40 crew are killed.[10] Sources of new crew-members included taking on the Maquis crew, aliens, and other sources.[10] The number of on-screen actors does not exceed the amount of possible crew over the course of the seven seasons.[10]
