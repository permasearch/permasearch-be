All of Neptune's inner moons are dark objects: their geometric albedo ranges from 7 to 10%.[18] Their spectra indicate that they are made from water ice contaminated by some very dark material, probably complex organic compounds. In this respect, the inner Neptunian moons are similar to the inner Uranian moons.[5]
