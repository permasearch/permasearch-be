On February 27, 2011, it was announced that The Magician's Nephew would be the next film in the series. The C. S. Lewis Estate were in final negotiations to produce it and were yet to confirm a release date and screenwriter.[133] However, in October 2011, Douglas Gresham, a co-producer of the films, said that Walden Media no longer owns the rights to produce another Narnia film. If another film were to be made, it would not be for another three or four years.[9][10] On October 1, 2013, it was announced that the Mark Gordon Company would produce The Chronicles of Narnia: The Silver Chair, now officially in development as the fourth film in the franchise.[11] While the film's producers have been calling the film a "reboot" to the series, in actuality this is referring to the fact that the film is a new franchise, has a new cast and creative team not associated with those who worked on the previous three films.[134][135] In April 2017, Joe Johnston was confirmed as the planned director for The Silver Chair.[136]
