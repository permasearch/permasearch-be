The "core habitat" of the devils is considered to be within the "low to moderate annual rainfall zone of eastern and north-western Tasmania".[37] Tasmanian devils particularly like dry sclerophyll forests and coastal woodlands.[64] Although they are not found at the highest altitudes of Tasmania, and their population density is low in the button grass plains in the south-west of the state, their population is high in dry or mixed sclerophyll forests and coastal heaths. Devils prefer open forest to tall forest, and dry rather than wet forests.[36] They are also found near roads where roadkill is prevalent, although the devils themselves are often killed by vehicles while retrieving the carrion.[60] According to the Threatened Species Scientific Committee, their versatility means that habitat modification from destruction is not seen as a major threat to the species.[60]
