Old Mr. Grace decides to publish an in-store magazine and appoints Mr. Humphries as its editor. Mr. Humphries finds himself up to his neck with the gossip column, but his greatest challenge proves to be ensuring the staff bonuses by orchestrating a beauty contest with Miss Brahms as the ringer. When Miss Brahms refuses, Mrs. Slocombe "sacrifices herself for the sake of the department" and fills in, but ironically it's Mr. Humphries (as Miss Do-It-Yourself) who takes first place: he wins a weeks holiday on Old Mr. Grace's yacht, much to his displeasure.
