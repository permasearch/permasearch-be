On 29 May 2006, at the Royal Albert Hall, David Bowie, in a guest appearance, sang Waters' part of the song. The next day, on 30 May, Richard Wright sang Waters' part, by himself, at the same venue. Both performances were immortalised on Gilmour's Remember That Night concert video, compiled from all three of his shows there on May 28, 29 and 30, 2006, which were part of his "On an Island" Tour to promote his new album of the same name.
