The Expulsion of the Acadians, also known as the Great Upheaval, the Great Expulsion, the Great Deportation and Le Grand Dérangement, was the forced removal by the British of the Acadian people from the present day Canadian Maritime provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island— parts of an area also known as Acadia.[5] The Expulsion (1755–1764) occurred during the French and Indian War (the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War)[6] and was part of the British military campaign against New France. The British first deported Acadians to the Thirteen Colonies, and after 1758 transported additional Acadians to Britain and France. In all, of the 14,100 Acadians in the region, approximately 11,500 Acadians were deported[7][8] (a census of 1764 indicates that 2,600 Acadians remained in the colony, presumably having eluded capture[9]).
