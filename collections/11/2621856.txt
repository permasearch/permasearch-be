Most individuals with LQT1 show paradoxical prolongation of the QT interval with infusion of epinephrine.  This can also unmark latent carriers of the LQT1 gene. Many missense mutations of the LQT1 gene have been identified.  These are often associated with a high frequency of syncopes, but less sudden death than LQT2.
