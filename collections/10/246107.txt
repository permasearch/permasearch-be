The Next Step is a single-camera tween drama. Shot as a reality show, The Next Step follows the lives of a group of dancers at The Next Step Dance Studio as they attempt to win dance championships. It’s not just about winning, though.  It’s about working together, accepting everyone for who they are, and finding your footing, as these young dancers become young adults.
