The Amoeba Boys (voiced by Chuck McCann in the series and the What a Cartoon! episodes and by Lou Romano in Whoopass Stew) are a trio of amoebae who are the villains featured in McCracken's original short, Whoopass Stew in A Sticky Situation. They reappear in the What a Cartoon! short Crime 101. With their gangster affectations, these aspiring criminals would love nothing more than to be regarded as serious villains worthy of fighting, and even getting beaten up and sent to jail by the Powerpuff Girls. Unfortunately, their brains are too primitive to devise a crime above the level of littering or jaywalking. Indeed, they considered stealing an orange to be their greatest crime ever in the episode "Divide and Conquer". They are Townsville's least malicious villains, even having a friendship-of-sorts with the girls. They are generally harmless, but their actions have on occasion endangered both the girls and the town purely by accident. The greatest threat they have posed to Townsville and the girls was in episode "Geshundfight", when they each caught a cold that, when merged with their DNA, created a severe virus that quickly spread through the city, making even the healthiest person fall ill instantaneously.
