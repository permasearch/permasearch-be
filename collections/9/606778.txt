The 34th Annual Session of the Indian Science Congress was held at Delhi in 3â€“8 January 1947 with Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, First Prime Minister of India, as General president. Pandit Nehru's personal interest in the Science Congress continued and there was hardly any session which he did not attend. He immensely enriched the activities of the Congress by his sustained interest in the development of scientific atmosphere in the country, particularly among young generations. From 1947, his programme for inviting representatives from foreign societies and academies was included in the Science Congress. This trend still continues with the support of the Department of Science & Technology, Government of India.
