Data suggest that gliadin (a protein present in gluten) might play a role in the development of type 1 diabetes, but the mechanism is not fully understood.[26][45] Increased intestinal permeability caused by gluten and the subsequent loss of intestinal barrier function, which allows the passage of pro-inflammatory substances into the blood, may induce the autoimmune response in genetically predisposed individuals to type 1 diabetes.[6][45] There is evidence from experiments conducted in animal models that removal of gluten from the diet may prevent the onset type 1 diabetes[26][85] but there has been conflicting research in humans.[85]
