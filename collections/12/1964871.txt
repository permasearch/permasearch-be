Within the sonnet, the narrator spends time remembering and reflecting on sad memories of a dear friend. He grieves of his shortcomings and failures, while also remembering happier memories. The narrator uses legal metaphors throughout the sonnet to describe the sadness that he goes through when his friend is forever gone and only exists in his memories. Then in the final couplet, the narrator changes his tone about the failures, as if the losses are now merely gains for himself.
