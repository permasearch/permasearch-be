Bowser aspires to take over the Mushroom Kingdom and merge it with his own realm. He is infatuated with Princess Peach,[11][12][13] and routinely kidnaps her as part of his plans for domination.[14] Sometimes, he kidnaps Peach simply to lure Mario into a trap, but occasionally he hopes to marry her.
