C 60 undergoes six reversible, one-electron reductions to C6− 60, but oxidation is irreversible. The first reduction needs ≈1.0 V (Fc/Fc+), showing that C60 is a moderately effective electron acceptor. C 60 tends to avoid having double bonds in the pentagonal rings, which makes electron delocalization poor, and results in C 60 not being "superaromatic". C60 behaves very much like an electron deficient alkene and readily reacts with electron rich species.[18]
