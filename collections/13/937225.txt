Radio Corporation of America (RCA) followed suit, using AT&Tâ€™s network model. However, conflict resulted as RCA needed to lease phone lines from AT&T. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) took notice of this and charged AT&T with United States antitrust law violations. In 1926, AT&T sold off their broadcasting interests to RCA. RCA agreed to lease network connections from AT&T and for several decades AT&T made a profitable business in radio and television networking.[3]
