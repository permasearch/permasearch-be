Hawaii has a high potential for mass adoption of plug-in electric vehicles due to the limited driving range imposed by the island geographies, and its high fuel costs, with gasoline prices, as of September 2013[update], ranging between US$4.25 and US$5.00 a gallon.[278][279] The number of registered plug-in electric vehicles increased from 581 units in 2011, to 967 in 2012,[280] and reached 1,551 units in June 2013.[281] As of August 2014[update], a total of 2,821 plug-in highway legal plug-in electric cars have been registered in Hawaii.[282]
