Originally, he played the antagonist in the first two books, but in the third his purposes were revealed. In the first book, he had attempted to force Emily into defeating his father, the Elf King. In the third book, Emily saves him from the Elf King's guards when they attempted to arrest him, using a stunning staff to electrocute him. He tells Emily that his father is being possessed by something, and that he wanted to destroy whatever was controlling his dead body by destroying the amulet of the king. In the fifth book, they find out that it was the Voice. In the sixth book, Trellis becomes warmer to the crew of the Luna Moth, especially Luger, playing a game of Othello together and exchanging witty banter. Both did not know they were brothers until book three, since Gabilan stole their memories. Trellis starts trusting Emily after her step to save him in book 5, eventually developing a strong bond of trust with her and becoming close.
