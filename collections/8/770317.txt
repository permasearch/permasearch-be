The official RCCG website outlines its beliefs in the Bible and the Holy Trinity, that the Devil exists, that God formed man in his image, in repentance, in cleansing from sins by God's grace, in sanctification, water baptism, Holy Spirit baptism, restitution and that it is possible for God to heal without medicine (by His divine intervention e.g. through prayer). The church is a strong advocate of peace and holiness ("Follow peace with all [men], and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord. Hebrews 12:14 - KJV). The church forbids "worldliness" (such as reveling and lewd dancing) and rebellion against church authority. The church is also against debt to finance either the church or its activities. It encourages abstention from all evil and reverence to parents and constituted authorities.[9]
