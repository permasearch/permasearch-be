"Rock the Casbah" was musically written by the band's drummer Topper Headon, based on a piano part that he had been toying with.[6][7] Finding himself in the studio without his three bandmates, Headon progressively taped the drum, piano and bass parts, recording the bulk of the song's musical instrumentation himself.[6][8]
