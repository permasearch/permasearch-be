With the band's failure to collaborate resulting in no album being recorded,[39] Slash announced in October 1996 that he was no longer a part of Guns N' Roses.[40] Slash stated at the time "Axl and I have not been capable of seeing eye to eye on Guns N' Roses for some time. We tried to collaborate, but at this point, I'm no longer in the band."[41] Paul Tobias's inclusion in the band was another factor in Slash leaving, with Slash having both "creative and personal" differences with Tobias.[42] However, in his 2007 autobiography, Slash stated that his decision to leave the band was not based on artistic differences with Axl Rose, but on Rose's constant lateness to concerts, the alleged legal manipulation Rose used (since denied by Rose) to gain control of the band; and the departures of Steven Adler and Izzy Stradlin.[43]
