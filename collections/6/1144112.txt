The earlier of known records of commercial hunting of killer whales date to the 18th century in Japan. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the global whaling industry caught immense numbers of baleen and sperm whales, but largely ignored killer whales because of their limited amounts of recoverable oil, their smaller populations, and the difficulty of taking them.[166] Once the stocks of larger species were depleted, killer whales were targeted by commercial whalers in the mid-20th century. Between 1954 and 1997, Japan took 1,178 killer whales (although the Ministry of the Environment claims that there had been domestic catches of about 1,600 whales between late 1940s to 1960s[221]) and Norway took 987.[222] Over 3,000 killer whales were taken by Soviet whalers,[223] including an Antarctic catch of 916 in 1979â€“80 alone, prompting the International Whaling Commission to recommend a ban on commercial hunting of the species pending further research.[222] (Compare with the situation on land, Commercial hunting.) Today, no country carries out a substantial hunt, although Indonesia and Greenland permit small subsistence hunts (see Aboriginal whaling). Other than commercial hunts, killer whales were hunted along Japanese coasts out of public concern for potential conflicts with fisheries. Such cases include a semi-resident male-female pair in Akashi Strait and Harimanada being killed in the Seto Inland Sea in 1957,[224][225] the killing of five whales from a pod of 11 members that swam into Tokyo Bay in 1970,[226] and a catch record in southern Taiwan in the 1990s.[119][227]
