As of August 1, 2012, Fox was pursuing a sequel with Scott, Noomi Rapace, and Michael Fassbender involved, and was talking to new writers in case Lindelof did not return.[32] In December 2012, Lindelof ultimately chose not to work on the project.[33] Early on, Scott stated that the film would feature no xenomorphs, "The beast is done. Cooked."[34] However, Scott later made contradictory statements, confirming the xenomorphs' presence in the film.[35]
