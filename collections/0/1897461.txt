At approximately 11 pm on 20 August 1968,[55] Eastern Bloc armies from four Warsaw Pact countries – the Soviet Union, Bulgaria,[56] Poland and Hungary – invaded Czechoslovakia. That night, 250,000 Warsaw Pact troops and 2,000 tanks entered the country.[5] The total number of invading troops eventually reached 500,000.[6] Romania did not take part in the invasion,[57] nor did Albania, which subsequently withdrew from the Warsaw Pact over the matter.[58] The participation of the German Democratic Republic was cancelled just hours before the invasion.[1] The decision for the non-participation of the East German Army in the invasion was made on short notice by Brezhnev following requests by high-ranking Czechoslovak opponents of Dubcek who feared much larger Czechoslovak resistance if German troops were present on Czechoslovak territory, due to previous Czech experience with the German occupation of Czechoslovakia.[59]
