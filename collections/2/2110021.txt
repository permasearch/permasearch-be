Pliny the Elder also recorded the tale of a Roman general, Marcus Sergius, whose right hand was cut off while campaigning and had an iron hand made to hold his shield so that he could return to battle. A famous and quite refined[14] historical prosthetic arm was that of Götz von Berlichingen, made at the beginning of the 16th century.  The first confirmed use of a prosthetic device, however, is from 950–710 BC. In 2000, research pathologists discovered a mummy from this period buried in the Egyptian necropolis near ancient Thebes that possessed an artificial big toe.  This toe, consisting of wood and leather, exhibited evidence of use.  When reproduced by bio-mechanical engineers in 2011, researchers discovered that this ancient prosthetic enabled its wearer to walk both barefoot and in Egyptian style sandals.  Previously, the earliest discovered prosthetic was an artificial leg from Capua.[15]
