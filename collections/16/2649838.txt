When a file system is first initialized on a partition, it contains only a few small internal structures and is otherwise one contiguous block of empty space.[a] This means that the file system is able to place newly created files anywhere on the partition. For some time after creation, files can be laid out near-optimally. When the operating system and applications are installed or archives are unpacked, separate files end up occurring sequentially so related files are positioned close to each other.
