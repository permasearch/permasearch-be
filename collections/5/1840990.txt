The political terms "Left" and "Right" were coined during the French Revolution (1789â€“1799), referring to the seating arrangement in the Estates General: those who sat on the left generally opposed the monarchy and supported the revolution, including the creation of a republic and secularization,[6] while those on the right were supportive of the traditional institutions of the Old Regime. Use of the term "Left" became more prominent after the restoration of the French monarchy in 1815 when it was applied to the "Independents".[7] The word "wing" was appended to Left and Right in the late 19th century[8] usually with disparaging intent and "left-wing" was applied to those who were unorthodox in their religious or political views.
