Antigua was first settled by archaic age hunter-gatherer Amerindians called the Siboney or Ciboney.[6] Carbon dating has established the earliest settlements started around 3100 BC. They were succeeded by the ceramic age pre-Columbian Arawak-speaking Saladoid people who migrated from the lower Orinoco River.
