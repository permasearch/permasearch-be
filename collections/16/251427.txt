Europe and Asia are contiguous with each other and thus the exact boundary between them is not clearly defined, and often follows historical, political, and cultural definitions rather than geographical. This list uses the modern geographical definition thus excluding Armenia, Georgia and Cyprus, which are sometimes also considered part of Europe, the two Caucasus nations for political and cultural reasons, and Cyprus because all larger islands in the Mediterranean have historically been considered European, regardless of their proximity to the European mainland.
