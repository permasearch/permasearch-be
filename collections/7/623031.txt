On September 9, Boston Police Department officers went on strike at 5:45Â p.m.[21] Of the force's 1,544 officers and men, 1,117 (72%) failed to report for work.[1] Coolidge assigned 100 members of the state's Metropolitan Park Police Department to replace the striking officers, but 58 of them refused to participate and were suspended from their jobs. Despite assurances from Commissioner Curtis to Mayor Peters and Governor Coolidge, Boston had little police protection for the night of September 9. Volunteer replacements were still being organized and due to report the next morning.[21] Many of those who provided scab labor were students at Harvard University.[23]
