Universal contract star Joan Staley was known by Alan Rafkin from their work together on the sitcom Broadside. Normally a blonde, she had to wear a dark wig because the producers felt she was "too sexy" as a blonde (she was actually Playboy's "Miss November" 1958, but was photographed very modestly, being only partially nude) and the role called for a brunette. She wore the same wig previously worn by Claudia Cardinale in Blindfold (1966).[3] Al Checco, Knotts' Army-days comedy partner, had an uncredited appearance in the film.
