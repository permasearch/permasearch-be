The character of Paris was originally created for a three-episode guest arc by series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and executive producer Gavin Polone at the beginning of the show's first season to introduce the high pressures, competitiveness, and stress of Rory's transition from a small public high school in Stars Hollow to the elite institution of Chilton. This character was created for Weil after a strong audition for the role of Rory, which eventually went to Alexis Bledel.[6] Weil was known to Polone through her supporting role in the 1998 Kevin Bacon film Stir of Echoes, which was produced by Polone, and was under a talent holding deal with Warner Bros. at the time which saw her previously guest star on The West Wing and ER. Weil dyed her hair from brown to blonde for the part of Paris to highlight the contrast between Paris and Rory.[7] The character proved to be the ideal foil to Rory, and the role of Paris was expanded through the first season until Weil became a series regular in the second season.
