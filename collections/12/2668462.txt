The July 3 bombardment was likely the largest of the war,[16] with hundreds of cannons from both sides firing along the lines for one to two hours,[17] starting around 1 p.m. Confederate guns numbered between 150 and 170[18] and fired from a line over two miles (3 km) long, starting in the south at the Peach Orchard and running roughly parallel to the Emmitsburg Road. Confederate Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law wrote, "The cannonade in the center ... presented one of the most magnificent battle-scenes witnessed during the war. Looking up the valley towards Gettysburg, the hills on either side were capped with crowns of flame and smoke, as 300 guns, about equally divided between the two ridges, vomited their iron hail upon each other."[19]
