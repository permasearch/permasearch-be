Terminal E, originally called Terminal 4E, was occupied primarily by Delta Air Lines until Delta closed its hub in 2005 and retained only flights to its other hubs. Delta branded the terminal "Easy Street" and marketed this term to passengers.[53] Today, the terminal is used by all U.S.-based carriers at the airport other than Sun Country, and by Air Canada Express and WestJet USCBP precleared flights from Canada. Terminal E was formerly the only terminal at DFW in which American Airlines had no presence, but this changed after their acquisition of US Airways, when they took over that airline's gates.
