Another annual event is the regatta which has been held every year since 1909.[103] It takes place around the second week in August and involves rowing competitions on the River Stour and a travelling funfair sited on the adjacent town quay. A carnival procession and large firework display takes place at the weekend. The part of the quay by the priory is known as The Quomps and was conveyed to the town in 1911 by Lord Malmesbury.[104] A 19th-century bandstand situated in the Quomps was an anonymous gift to the town in 1938.[105] During the summer months it is used for free open-air concerts on Saturdays, one of the most popular being "Stompin' on the Quomps", a smooth jazz festival.[106] On Sunday afternoons brass bands often play there.
