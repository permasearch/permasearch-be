Some fiction caricatured the current gender hierarchy by describing a matriarchal alternative without advocating for it. According to Karin SchÃ¶npflug, "Gerd Brantenberg's Egalia's Daughters is a caricature of powered gender relations which have been completely reversed, with the female sex on the top and the male sex a degraded, oppressed group";[205] "gender inequality is expressed through power inversion"[206] and "all gender roles are reversed and women rule over a class of intimidated, effeminate men".[207] "Egalia is not a typical example of gender inequality in the sense that a vision of a desirable matriarchy is created; Egalia is more a caricature of male hegemony by twisting gender hierarchy but not really offering a 'better world.'"[207][208]
