During December 1969, in response to a motion by Sutton's attorneys, Farrell ruled that Sutton's good behavior in prison and his deteriorating health due to emphysema justified commutation of his sentence to time served.  At the hearing Sutton responded, "Thank you, your Honor. God bless you," and wept as he was led out of the court building.  During 1970, a separate 30-years-to-life sentence  given in Brooklyn during 1952 was also commuted on similar grounds, and he was released to parole.[7]
