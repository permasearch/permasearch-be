The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had conducted a limited review of the route and found no significant impact, but in March and April 2016 the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Interior, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation asked the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a formal Environmental Impact Assessment and issue an Environmental Impact Statement. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe filed suit against the Corps of Engineers in July, but the motion was denied.  In December, under President Barack Obama's administration the Corps of Engineers denied an easement for construction of the pipeline under the Missouri River. An environmental impact assessment was to be conducted by the Army Corps, but many protesters continued camping on the site, not considering the matter closed.[6][7][8] On January 24, 2017, newly elected President Donald Trump signed an executive order that reversed the Obama legislation and  advanced the construction of the pipeline under "terms and conditions to be negotiated, " expediting the environmental review that Trump described as an "incredibly cumbersome, long, horrible permitting process."[9][10]   On February 7, 2017, Trump authorized the Army Corps of Engineers to proceed, ending the environmental impact assessment and the associated public comment period.[11]  Following Trump's approval for the completion of the pipeline the number of protesters gradually decreased and on  February 23, 2017 the National Guard and law enforcement officers evicted those that remained.[12]  The pipeline was completed by April and its first oil was delivered on May 14, 2017.[13]
