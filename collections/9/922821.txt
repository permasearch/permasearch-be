Starting in 2014, the Aggies became LSU's final regular season opponent. Arkansas, which had been LSU's final regular season opponent from 1992 through 2013 (except in 2001 due to LSU's game vs. Auburn being rescheduled to the end of the regular season in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks) now plays Missouri the same weekend of the A&M-LSU game.
