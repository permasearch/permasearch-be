Fellow musicians also commented on the album's influence and legacy. Tour mate and friend of the band Kevin Devine reflected on the first time he heard the track "Jesus Christ", praising it as "the best song [Brand New] had ever written... emotionally, educationally, intellectually, structurally, in every way".[84] Labeling "Degausser" and "You Won't Know" as other album highlights, Devine referred to the bridge of "Not the Sun" as "[his] favorite minute of music in their catalog" and the album's legacy as "The Dark Side of the Moon but for emo", a comparison that he did not expect upon first listen.[84] Andy Hull, frontman of American indie rock band Manchester Orchestra, complimented Lacey on being "a very clever songwriter", while guitarist Mike Weiss of mewithoutYou compared the influence of The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me to that of Nirvana's Nevermind in how it "acted as sort of a pioneering watermark for musical genres that existed in our country", noting how it "broke the barrier [and]... destroyed that entire limitation, that boundary - and that is the importance of this record."[84] Dustin Kensrue, lead singer of the American post-hardcore band Thrice, included his rendition of "Jesus Christ" on his live covers album Thoughts That Float on A Different Blood, and introduced the song live as "by a band that has been a kindred spirit in the past years", with the song being "an example of some of that" during his December 16, 2015 concert in Santa Ana.[87] Pop singer Halsey has referred to Brand New and this album in particular as a major influence, once referencing the title of this album in her Instagram biography.[88]
