Federal Bureau of Investigation Director J. Edgar Hoover called the party "the greatest threat to the internal security of the country",[11][12][13] and he supervised an extensive counterintelligence program (COINTELPRO) of surveillance, infiltration, perjury, police harassment, and many other tactics designed to undermine Panther leadership, incriminate party members, discredit and criminalize the Party, and drain the organization of resources and manpower.
