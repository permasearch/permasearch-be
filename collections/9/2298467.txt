Yuvraj was picked in both Test and ODI squads for the Pakistan tour in January–February 2006. The first two Tests were drawn in which he batted only once, in the second Test, scoring 4. In the third Test at Karachi, he top-scored for India in both innings. After scoring 45 in the first innings, he went to score his second Test hundred in the second innings (122 runs from 144 balls). India lost the match by 341 runs and the series 1–0.[50] In the one-day series, he continued to be in sublime form. He scored a 28-ball 39 in the first ODI at Peshawar which Pakistan won by 7 runs by Duckworth–Lewis method.[51] He scored an unbeaten 82 in the second match at Rawalpindi taking India to an emphatic 7-wicket win,[52] before scoring an unbeaten 79 in the third game at Lahore and helping India successfully chase the target of 289.[53] In the low-scoring fourth match at Multan, he scored 37 as India took the series with a five-wicket victory.[54] In the fifth and the final ODI at Karachi, Yuvraj, batting at three, hit his sixth ODI century. His innings of 107* which came off 93 balls with 13 boundaries helped India comfortably chase down the target of 287 for the loss of only two wickets. He won the man of the match award for this innings and was also adjudged player of the series.[55]
