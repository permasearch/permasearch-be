The third set was the shortest of the final; Djokovic winning the third set 6–2 after breaking Murray twice in the set. He also took the fourth set 6–3 to level the match at two sets all. Thus, he was in a position where he could become the first man since Gastón Gaudio in 2004 to win a championship match after losing the first two sets. On that occasion, Gaudio won the 2004 French Open final over Guillermo Coria after losing the first set 6–0.
