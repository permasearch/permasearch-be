Many convenience shops offer food ready to eat, such as breakfast sandwiches and other breakfast food. Throughout Europe convenience shops now sell fresh French bread (or similar). A process of freezing parbaked bread allows easy shipment (often from France) and baking in-shop. Some shops have a delicatessen counter, offering custom-made sandwiches and baguettes. Others have racks offering fresh delivered or baked doughnuts from local doughnut shops. Some shops have a self-service microwave oven for heating purchased food.
