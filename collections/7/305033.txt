The only rider to win the Tour de France and an Olympic gold medal in the same year was Britain's Bradley Wiggins in 2012. In 2018, Wiggins was joined by Geraint Thomas as the only Tour de France champions to have won an Olympic gold medal in a velodrome; they were both on the team which won the Team Pursuit Gold Medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
