Horses are branded using both hot-iron and freeze branding.  Horses are often branded using a freeze brand as a way to denote ownership. Different ranches will usually have a unique brand that they mark their horses with. Freeze brands can also be used to denote breed in general, or to identify an animal with a specific breed registry. The  brand is usually located on a horseâ€™s haunches or neck.  All numbers are written using the International Alpha Angle Symbol because they cannot be changed or altered in any way. This is critical because it preserves the integrity of the original brand, making the mark unchangeable and the system reliable.[3]
