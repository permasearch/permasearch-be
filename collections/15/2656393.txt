In mid-1888, Crane became his brother Townley's assistant at a New Jersey shore news bureau, working there every summer until 1892.[29] Crane's first publication under his byline was an article on the explorer Henry M. Stanley's famous quest to find the Scottish missionary David Livingstone in Africa.  It appeared in the February 1890 Claverack College Vidette.[30]  Within a few months, Crane was persuaded by his family to forgo a military career and transfer to Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania, in order to pursue a mining engineering degree.[31]  He registered at Lafayette on September 12, and promptly became involved in extracurricular activities; he took up baseball again and joined the largest fraternity, Delta Upsilon. He also joined both rival literary societies, named for (George) Washington and (Benjamin) Franklin.[32]  Crane infrequently attended classes and ended the semester with grades for four of the seven courses he had taken.[33]
