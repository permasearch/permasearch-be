In 2013, BBC News reported that 4,000 "foreigners" would receive citizenship.[73] (The number was higher than usual because in 2012, there was no such round of citizenship distribution.) But the government said that only a third of Bedoons were eligible for naturalisation, and that the rest had destroyed documents identifying them as citizens of other nations.
