During the later elections of Reconstruction era, beginning in the 1870s, white Democrats used violence by paramilitary groups, as well as fraud, to suppress black Republican voters and turn Republicans out of office. After regaining control of the state legislatures, Democrats were alarmed by a late 19th-century alliance between Republicans and Populists that cost them some elections. In North Carolina, for example, the Wilmington Insurrection of 1898 (long called a race riot by whites) saw white Democrats launching a coup d'etat which overthrew the city government (the only coup of its kind in United States history), a duly elected biracial government headed by a white mayor; and widely attacked the black community, destroying lives and property. As a result, many blacks left the city permanently.
