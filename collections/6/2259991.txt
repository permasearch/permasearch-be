On October 2013, STI Health Professionals, Inc., a subsidiary of STI Education Systems Holdings, Inc. and operator of De Los Santos-STI, purchased Makati Medical Center College from Medical Doctors, Inc. through its sister school PWU. PWU was in a joint venture arrangement with STI at the time. That arrangement has since ended and PWU has sold Makati Medical Center College.
