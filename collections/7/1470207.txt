From 1954 to 1964, an alternate route US 40 was available especially during winter to avoid Donner Pass. Donner Pass, elevation 7,056 ft (2,151 m), might be closed in winter. This alternate route used Beckwourth Pass, elevation of 5,221 ft (1,591 m). Since Beckwourth Pass was nearly 2,000 ft (610 m) lower than Donner Pass, it could be kept open longer. ALT US 40 parted the main track of US 40 near Davis and ran north along what was then signed as U.S. Route 99W into Woodland. From Woodland, ALT US 40 ran north along California State Route 24 through Knights Landing and Robbins into Yuba City. Most of the section from Woodland to Yuba City is now signed as California State Route 113. From Yuba City, ALT US 40 ran east through Marysville, then north through Oroville. Continuing north and northeast, ALT US 40 reached Paxton, then turned south and southeast to Quincy and Beckwourth before crossing. East of Beckwourth Pass, ALT US 40 descended to meet U.S. Route 395 at what is now Hallelujah Junction. The section from Marysville to U.S. Route 395 was then still an extension of Route 24, but is now signed as California State Route 70, although much of the old highway was moved further west before Lake Oroville was dammed and flooded in 1968.
