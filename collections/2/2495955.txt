When     n   {\displaystyle n}   is odd,     f ( x )   {\displaystyle f(x)}  's asymptotic behavior reverses from positive     x   {\displaystyle x}   to negative     x   {\displaystyle x}  .  For     c > 0   {\displaystyle c>0}  ,     f ( x ) = c  x  n     {\displaystyle f(x)=cx^{n}}   will also tend towards positive infinity with increasing     x   {\displaystyle x}  , but towards negative infinity with decreasing     x   {\displaystyle x}  . All graphs from the family of odd power functions have the general shape of     y = c  x  3     {\displaystyle y=cx^{3}}  , flattening more in the middle as     n   {\displaystyle n}   increases and losing all flatness there in the straight line for     n = 1   {\displaystyle n=1}  . Functions with this kind of symmetry (    f ( − x ) = − f ( x )   {\displaystyle f(-x)=-f(x)}  ) are called odd functions.
