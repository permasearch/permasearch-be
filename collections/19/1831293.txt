In the Moro Rebellion, Moro Muslim Juramentados in suicide attacks continued to charge against American soldiers even after being shot. Panglima Hassan in the Hassan uprising was shot dozens of times before he went down. As a result, Americans elected to phase out revolvers with .38 caliber ammunition in favor of Colt .45 revolvers to continue their fight against the Moros.[74] Arrows, bayonets, guns, and Kris were used in often suicidal attacks by the Moros during their war with the Americans. Suicide attacks became more popular among Moros due to the overwhelming firepower of the Americans in conventional battles. Moro women took part in the resistance at the Battle of Bud Dajo against the American General Lenard Wood in 1906.[75] Barbed wire proved to be of no impediment since Moro Juramentado warriors managed to surge directly through it even as it ripped at their flesh and even as they were shot repeatedly with bullets. The Moros used barongs to inflict injuries upon American soldiers.[76] Moros under Jikiri managed to survive in a cave under machine gun fire and Colt gunfire.[44] Kris and Kampilan were used by Moros in fierce close quarter combat against the Americans.[77] Muskets were also used by the Moro.[78] The Moro employed bayonets at close range when shooting was not possible according to the American journal The Field Artillery Journal, Volume 32.[79] Americans were even charged at by Moros using spears.[44] Moros fought to the death against Americans armed with rifles and artillery while they themselves used only Kris at the crater battle.[80][81]
