In Australia, organic certification is performed by several organisations that are accredited by the Biosecurity[46] section of the Department of Agriculture (Australia), formerly the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, under the National Standard for Organic and Biodynamic Produce.[47]  All claims about the organic status of products sold in Australia are covered under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010.[48]
