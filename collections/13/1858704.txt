Construction of the frigates slowly continued until the 1796 announcement of the Treaty of Tripoli, which was witnessed by Algiers. In accordance with the clause in the Naval Act, construction of the frigates was to be discontinued. However, President Washington instead requested instructions from Congress on how to proceed. Several proposals circulated before a final decision was reached allowing Washington to complete two of the 44-gun and one of the 36-gun frigates.[49] The three frigates nearest to completion, United States, Constellation and Constitution, were chosen.[50] Construction of Chesapeake, Congress, and President was halted, and some of their construction materials were sold or placed in storage.[51]
