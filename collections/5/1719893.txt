Malina is the only major character from that series that has not previously appeared in either The Emperor's New Groove or Kronk's New Groove. She is Kuzco's good friend and love interest. However, he has a not-so-secret crush on her (he often calls her "a hottie hot hottie" or " the hottiest hot hottie in hottie-ville").
