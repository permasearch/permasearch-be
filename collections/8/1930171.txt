While typical Target locations are approximately 135,000 square feet (12,500 m2), the majority of "flexible format" CityTarget stores are roughly 80,000 square feet (7,400 m2). The first stores were opened in July 2012, in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Seattle;[32] the 160,000 square feet (15,000 m2) location in Boston is the largest CityTarget and opened in July 2015.[44] TargetExpress stores hover around 14,000 square feet (1,300 m2) to 21,000 square feet (2,000 m2); the first opened in Dinkytown near the University of Minnesota in July 2014.[45] Products in these flexible format properties are typically sold in smaller packages geared towards customers using public transportation. Locations built in college communities often carry an extended home department of apartment and dormitory furnishings.[46] In August 2015, Target announced that it would rename its nine CityTarget and five TargetExpress stores as Target beginning that October, deciding that "Big or small, our stores have one thing in common: they're all Target."[44] The first flexible format stores under the unified naming scheme opened later that month in Chicago, Rosslyn, San Diego, and San Francisco.[47] The company opened a 45,000 square foot store in the Tribeca neighborhood of New York in October 2016. Three other similar sized stores will open in Philadelphia, Cupertino and the area around Penn State University in October 2016.[3]
