These posters used a number of themes to encourage support for the war, including conservation, production, recruiting, home efforts and secrecy.[11] Posters were usually placed in areas without paid advertisements.[11] The most common areas were post offices, railroad stations, schools, restaurants and retail stores.[13] Smaller posters were printed for the windows of private homes and apartment buildings.[14] These were places where other propaganda media couldn't be used.[15]
