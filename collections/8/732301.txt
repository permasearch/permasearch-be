Mule spindles rest on a carriage that travels on a track a distance of 60 inches (1.5Â m), while drawing out and spinning the yarn. On the return trip, known as putting up,[20] as the carriage moves back to its original position, the newly spun yarn is wound onto the spindle in the form of a cone-shaped cop. As the mule spindle travels on its carriage, the roving which it spins is fed to it through rollers geared to revolve at different speeds to draw out the yarn.
