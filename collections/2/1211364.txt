Under the Philippine Commission, and then after the Philippine Legislature established a bicameral legislature, the American colonial government established cabinet offices appointed by the Governor-General of the Philippines, that continued up to the Commonwealth of the Philippines. The Executive power was wielded by the Governor-General of the Philippines. Among cabinet officials, Filipinos and Americans held various posts, except for that of Secretary of Public Instruction, which was reserved for an American, specifically, the Vice Governor-General.
