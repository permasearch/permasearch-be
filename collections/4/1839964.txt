The character of Wendy does not appear in the book version like the other main characters.[14] In an interview with Collider.com, MÃ¤dchen Amick revealed that Wendy was originally brought into the show as a guest for the pilot episode, but after it was filmed, Lifetime decided to make Wendy a permanent character.[15] Amick described her as a troublemaker who is "very loyal to her family."[15] Amick said that during the first week filming Witches of East East, she noticed that Wendy is quite similar to the character Serena from Bewitched, and thinks that Serena "is an inspiration for Wendy".[15]
