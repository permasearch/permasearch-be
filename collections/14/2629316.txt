Roy is very friendly with Jason and has his back, but his carefree personality has caused some friction, such as when he called the defeated reanimated corpses of Jason's All-Caste teachers and friends trash.[22] He also has a bit of a prideful streak, as he complains that he feels emasculated by Starfire's rescue of the team from a huge monster.[19] But he's also shown that he has a more serious side, and is well prepared for a fight, as he takes on and defeats Crux, an altered human that was able to defeat Starfire single-handedly. He's also shown a softer side - particularly around Koriand'r, one example being when he cradles her and wipes away her tears when she's hurt. However, he tells her that he would like to keep his carefree facade, saying that she shouldn't tell anyone, because it would hurt his reputation.[23]
