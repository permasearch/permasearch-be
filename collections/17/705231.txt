Davos is loyal to Stannis, due to the life and opportunities that Stannis knighting him has presented to Davos and his family. However, he sometimes disagrees with Stannis's methods. Davos is a devout believer in the Faith of the Seven, which puts him at odds with the red priestess Melisandre and the Queen's Men, who worship R'hllor. Davos tries to always be honest to Stannis, speaking his mind instead of saying what Stannis wants to hear.
