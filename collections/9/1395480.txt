Following Houston's loss to Utah, McGrady underwent arthroscopic surgery on both his left shoulder and left knee.[48] Early in the 2008â€“09 season, he missed 18 games, including a two-week stretch in January as his knee was not fully healed from his offseason surgery.[49] On February 24, he had microfracture surgery in Chicago, forcing him to miss the remainder of the year.[46][50] By then, his averages had declined to 15.6 points and 4.4 rebounds per game.[1] In a surprise turn of events, the Rockets qualified for the playoffs without McGrady and advanced to the second round, pushing the eventual-champion Los Angeles Lakers to seven games.[51]
