For this reason, regardless of management style, stallions must be treated as individuals and should only be handled by people who are experienced with horses and thus recognize and correct inappropriate behavior before it becomes a danger.[10] While some breeds are of a more gentle temperament than others, and individual stallions may be well-behaved enough to even be handled by inexperienced people for short periods of time, common sense must always be used.  Even the most gentle stallion has natural instincts that may overcome human training.  As a general rule, children should not handle stallions, particularly in a breeding environment.
