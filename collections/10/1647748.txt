During the latter part of 1991 and throughout 1992, Evangelista was seen on several different billboards for the fashion brand Kenar, in the center of Times Square.[72][73][74] The billboards were done in conjunction with Ads Against AIDS, which was a campaign created by the advertising industry to raise awareness about tackling the disease.[72][75] The most talked about and most controversial of those billboards was one that showed Evangelista seated among seven older Sicilian women.[76] It was said that the image, which got dubbed "Beauty and the Seven Beasts" by Richard Johnson in the New York Post,[77] promoted a negative depiction of Italian women.[76][78] Nonetheless, limited edition prints of the image were sold for $1,000 a piece, to benefit Ads Against AIDS.[76][79] Also, the image was chosen as one of the "20 most important fashion photographs ever" by the International Center of Photography.[80] Kenneth Zimmerman, president of Kenar, said of Evangelista, "She has increased our sales dramatically."[2] He further added, "Linda was our Michael Jordan. We chose her because we wanted a star, and of the four or five star models, she is number one."[48]
