The WHO estimates that diabetes resulted in 1.5 million deaths in 2012, making it the 8th leading cause of death.[1] However another 2.2 million deaths worldwide were attributable to high blood glucose and the increased risks of associated complications (e.g. heart disease, stroke, kidney failure), which often result in premature death and are often listed as the underlying cause on death certificates rather than diabetes.[1][7]
