On June 4, 1954, Republic Act (RA) No. 992, otherwise called the Revised Budget Act, was enacted providing for an enhanced role of the Budget Commission as the fiscal arm and budgeting adviser of the President.  The preparation of the budget was to include the aggregation of the programs of the different departments and agencies of the Government.  At this point, a performance budgeting system was introduced.
