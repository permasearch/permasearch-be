The song's lyrics were written in the autumn of 1988 as a homage to author Doris Lessing and singer Patti Smith, who had inspired Tim Booth. After experiencing success as part of the Madchester music scene, a new version was released in March 1991 that was shorter and with new lyrics. It reached number 2 in the Singles Chart, spending three weeks there. It was the 20th best-selling single of 1991 in the UK, one of the highest selling singles of the year not to reach number one.[1]
