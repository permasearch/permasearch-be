"Closer" by The Chainsmokers featuring Halsey was listed within the top 10 for the second year in a row, making it only the third song in history to achieve this, after Elton John's "Something About the Way You Look Tonight" / "Candle in the Wind 1997" and LeAnn Rimes' "How Do I Live", both of which were ranked in the top ten of the 1997 and 1998 lists.[citation needed]
