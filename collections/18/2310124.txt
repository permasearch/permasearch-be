In the next book, Shattered Sky, it is revealed that Darktail is actually Onestar's biological son. Onestar reveals that when he was still known as Onewhisker back in the old forest, he fell in love with a kittypet called Smoke. He refused to let her join WindClan when she revealed she was expecting his kits, partly because it wasn't the life for her and partly because he was afraid of what would happen to him if his Clan found out he'd mated with a kittypet. The only one of their litter to survive was Darktail, whom Onewhisker turned away for the same reason as his mother. This rejection caused Smoke to raise Darktail to hate his father, the Clans and their way of life.
