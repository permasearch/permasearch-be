In FIBA-sanctioned tournaments, defending team players are allowed to stay on the key for an unlimited amount of time. In American professional basketball, defending team players are also prohibited from staying in the key for more than three seconds, unless a player is directly guarding an offensive player. If a player surpasses that time, the defending team will be charged with a defensive three-second violation, which will result in a technical foul where the team with the ball shoots one free throw plus ball possession and a reset of the shot clock.[4] In all cases, the count resets if the shot hits the rim or if the player steps out of the lane.[8]
