The mesolimbic pathway and a specific set of the pathway's output neurons (i.e., D1-type medium spiny neurons within the nucleus accumbens) play a central role in the neurobiology of addiction.[6][7][8] It is also implicated in schizophrenia and depression.[18][19][20] Addiction, schizophrenia, and depression all involve distinct structural changes within the mesolimbic pathway.[18]
