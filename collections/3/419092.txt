A replica car, built by retired NYPD police Sergeant, Tony Garofalo, of Long Island, New York, was completed in June 2015 after a 5-year project build at a cost of over $100,000. The car is modelled in exacting detail to the original motion picture car, after Garofalo conducted a personal inspection of two original Chitty Chitty Bang Bang cars. Built on a vintage, road legal, 1914 Overland car, and a vintage Ford Model A Engine, the car features automated opening retractable wings and vintage brass adornments. All of the bright work featured is brass, aluminum, stainless steel and copper to prevent any corrosion over time. It is reported that over 90% of the car has been fabricated, although the original vintage chassis, drivetrain and rear axle have been retained, with an additional conversion to 12 volts. The car is finely detailed with all of the iconic brass features of the original movie car, including a vintage serpent snake horn from an antique Mercedes vehicle. Garofalo also owns the original Broadway Stage Production Chitty Chitty Bang Bang car featured in the U.S. Stage tour, as well as a costume worn by Dick Van Dyke in the film.[23][24]
