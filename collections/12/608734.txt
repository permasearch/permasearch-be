The plural forms are clitorises in English and clitorides in Latin. The Latin genitive is clitoridis, as in "glans clitoridis". In medical and sexological literature, the clitoris is sometimes referred to as "the female penis" or pseudo-penis,[11] and the term clitoris is commonly used to refer to the glans alone;[12] partially because of this, there have been various terms for the organ that have historically confused its anatomy (see below).
