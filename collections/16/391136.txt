A prank war between Max and Phoebe gets out of hand. At first Max dumps melted cheese and chocolate on Phoebe's head and transfers her bed into the school. Later, Phoebe tricks Max into dressing up as a hula dancer. Max reveals to Phoebe that the only reason he is evil is because he does not want to live in his sister's shadow and be second best so he would rather be best at being evil. Hank and Barb try a new parenting style by letting the children handle their own problems and Nora and Billy have a trash competition.
