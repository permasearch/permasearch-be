In contrast to prior governments, which emphasised divisions of caste and religion, Nitish Kumar's manifesto was based on economic development, curbs on crime and corruption and greater social equality for all sections of society. Since 2010, the government has confiscated the properties of corrupt officials and redeployed them as schools buildings.[88] Simultaneously they introduced Bihar Special Court Act to curb crime.[89] It has also legislated for a two-hour break on Fridays, including lunch, to enable Muslim employees to pray and thus cut down on post-lunch absenteeism by them.[90] The government has prohibited the sale and consumption of alcohol in the state since March 2016;[91] this ban has been linked to a drop in tourism to Bihar.[92]
