Neither team advanced to the post-season in 2006, but the 2006 World Series again featured teams from the American League Central and National League Central divisions, this time represented by the Detroit Tigers and the St. Louis Cardinals, respectively. The Cardinals won the World Series in five games, in which manager Tony La Russa became the second manager to win the World Series in both American and National leagues, previously managing the Oakland Athletics to the 1989 World Series championship. Both the White Sox and the Astros were in the Wild Card race until the final weeks of the season, with the White Sox finishing with 90 wins, the Astros with 82 wins. The White Sox made their first post-2005 playoff appearance in 2008, while the Astros would not return to the postseason until 2015, their third season as an American League team and would not return to the World Series until 2017, their fifth season as an American League team.
