On 8 March 2009, the song entered the UK Singles Chart at number 2, where it peaked, being beaten by Flo Rida's "Right Round" after being at number 1 in the midweek count, thus being the first Comic Relief single not to chart at number 1 in 14 years. However, it gave The Saturdays their highest chart placing at the time, outpeaking and outselling the original track, plus it marked their fourth consecutive top ten hit in the UK. The success of this single was later matched by "Forever Is Over" and beaten by "What About Us".
