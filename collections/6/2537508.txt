The Photographic Society of America (PSA) drew on their archives to stage Reconsidering The Family of Man during April and May 2012. They based the display on the concept of Steichen's original exhibit but concentrated on his sub-theme of the passage from birth to death. From the close to 5,000 photographs in the PSA collection, a selection of 50 was made for their show.One work in common was Ansel Adams' Mount Williamson from Manzanar which in The Family of Man was presented at mural scale, while the PSA used a vintage,11 "x 14" Adams print from their collection, displaying it wilh a first edition copy of The Family of Man publication opened to a double-page spread of Adams photograph.[60]
