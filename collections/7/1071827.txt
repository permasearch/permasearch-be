The main criticisms of the film were its narrative, particularly its changes from the source material, and lack of character development.[57][58] Forbes said the film suffered from "middle movie syndrome", claiming that it did not offer an introduction nor a finale.[59] The Wrap stated that, "it doesn't offer much plot or character development".[60] Stephen Kelly of Total Film said, "Scorch Trials ambitiously opens up its world with mixed results: gripping action, so-so script."[61] Walter Addiego of the San Francisco Chronicle said, "there's lots of eye candy, and the pace is fast, but somehow the movie falls short."[62]
