Later, some of the Fethry Studio Program stories were reprinted in the Wonderful World of Disney giveaway magazine published in 1969–1970 for Gulf Oil. From the 1970s to the 1990s, Fethry mostly appeared in European- and Brazilian-produced stories; in Brazil, he even had his own comic book title during the 1980s, which lasted 56 issues. More recently (2003–present), Fethry's modern Egmont and 1960s Kinney/Hubbard stories have been published in domestic American comics: Uncle Scrooge and Walt Disney's Comics and Stories.
