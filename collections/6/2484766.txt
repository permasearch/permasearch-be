Outside of these formal medical structures there were myriad other medical practitioners, often termed irregulars, plying a range of services and goods.[28] The eighteenth-century medical marketplace, a period often referred to as the "Golden Age of quackery",[29][n 3] was a highly pluralistic one that lacked a well-defined and policed division between "conventional" and "unconventional" medical practitioners.[31] In much of continental Europe legal remedies served to control at least the most egregious forms of "irregular" medical practice but the medical market in both Britain and American was less restrained through regulation.[32] Quackery in the period prior to modern medical professionalisation should not be considered equivalent to alternative medicine as those commonly deemed quacks were not peripheral figures by default nor did they necessarily promote oppositional and alternative medical systems. Indeed, the charge of 'quackery', which might allege medical incompetence, avarice or fraud, was levelled quite indiscriminately across the varied classes of medical practitioners be they regular medics, such as the hierarchical, corporate classes of physicians, surgeons and apothecaries in England, or irregulars such as nostrum mongers, bonesetters and local wise-women.[33] Commonly, however, quackery was associated with a growing medical entrepreneurship amongst both regular and irregular practitioners in the provision of goods and services along with associated techniques of advertisement and self-promotion in the medical marketplace.[34] The constituent features of the medical marketplace during the eighteenth century were the development of medical consumerism and a high degree of patient power and choice in the selection of treatments, the limited efficacy of available medical therapies,[35] and the absence of both medical professionalisation and enforced regulation of the market.[34]
