Direct current mains supplies are now only of historical interest in the UK but the colour coding was red for live and black for earthed (regardless of the actual polarity).  Hardly any loads were polarity sensitive when D.C. systems were introduced (principally incandescent lighting, heating systems or series D.C. motors) and it was considered more important to identify the live wire than the polarity.  In later years of D.C. supplies, however, much more equipment became sensitive to polarity, such as many domestic radios & television sets.  Where all three wires were available, the historical colour code was red (positive), black (middle) and white (negative).  The negative line changed to yellow in 1964, and then to blue in 1966.
