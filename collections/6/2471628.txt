The Mustang GT featured an all-aluminum 4.6 L 3-valve SOHC Modular V8 with variable camshaft timing and a more rugged Tremec TR-3650 transmission. The engine produces 300 hp (224 kW) @ 5750 rpm and 320 lb·ft (433 N·m) of torque @ 4500 rpm. The GT model was capable of performing a quarter-mile test in 13.8 seconds @ 99 MPH, with acceleration from zero to 60 MPH in 5.6 seconds.[25] The Mustang GT also came equipped with a limited slip differential complete with the same carbon-fiber clutch discs used in the 2003 to 2004 SVT Cobra and the 2007 Shelby GT500. The differential uses the 31-spline axles and the 8.8 in (224 mm) ring gear. The standard final drive ratio of 2005 and 2006 Mustang GTs with a manual transmission was 3.55:1. Since the 2007 model year, a 3.31:1 ratio final drive was standard with the 3.55:1 gearing available as a factory installed option. Automatic transmission-equipped models of all years come with 3.31:1 ratio.
