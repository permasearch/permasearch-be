Studying in some grandes écoles after passing the competitive exams is officially considered part of public service. Students generally pay low or no fees, and are paid monthly stipends by some institutions. They are committed to ten years of public service (including their study years). The  business schools typically charge higher fees. Economically disadvantaged students in grandes écoles may have access to grants and subsidies, just as at a public university.
