Billy took his brother Levi’s horse “Tip” and rode to Burlington Heights to warn the British. The British, who had recently themselves spied on the Americans, assumed Billy was a spy. After questioning him, Lieutenant-Colonel John Harvey decided he was not a spy. He realized that the password and Billy’s intimate knowledge of the countryside would help Harvey’s planned surprise attack on the American camp at night. He gave Billy a sword[3] and asked him to guide the troops. They left just before midnight, with Harvey in charge.
