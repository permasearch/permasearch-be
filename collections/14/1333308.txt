Among the most famous AFM actions was the 1942–44 musicians' strike, to pressure record companies to agree to a royalty system more beneficial to the musicians. This was sometimes called the "Petrillo ban", because James Petrillo was the newly elected head of the union.[10] Petrillo organized a second recording ban in 1948 (from January 1 to December 14), in response to the Taft–Hartley Act.
