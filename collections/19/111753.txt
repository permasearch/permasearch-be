The concept of "total war" in World War I, meant that food supplies had to be redirected towards the armed forces and, with German commerce being stopped by the British blockade, German civilians were forced to live in increasingly meager conditions. Food prices were first controlled. Bread rationing was introduced in 1915 and worked well; the cost of bread fell. Allen says there were no signs of starvation and states, "the sense of domestic catastrophe one gains from most accounts of food rationing in Germany is exaggerated."[19] However Howard argues that hundreds of thousands of civilians died from malnutritionâ€”usually from a typhus or a disease their weakened body could not resist. (Starvation itself rarely caused death.)[20] A 2014 study, derived from a recently discovered dataset on the heights and weights of German children between 1914-1924, found evidence that German children suffered from severe malnutrition during the blockade, with working-class children suffering the most.[21] The study furthermore found that German children quickly recovered after the war due to a massive international food aid program.[21]
