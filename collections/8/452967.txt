The operation then became known as "Red Wings II" and lasted approximately three more weeks,[1][2] during which time the bodies of the deceased SEALs and Army Special Operations aviators were recovered and the only surviving member of the initial team, Marcus Luttrell, was rescued.[6] While the goal of the operation was partially achieved, Shah regrouped in Pakistan and returned with more men and armament, aided by the notoriety he gained from the Red Wings ambush and helicopter shootdown. Several weeks later, Shah's group in Kunar Province was stricken to a point of inoperability and Shah was seriously wounded, during Operation Whalers in August 2005.[1][2][7]
