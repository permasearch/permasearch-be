Cystic fibrosis is the most common life-limiting autosomal recessive disease among people of European heritage.[124] In the United States, about 30,000 individuals have CF; most are diagnosed by six months of age. In Canada, about 4,000 people have CF.[125] Around 1 in 25 people of European descent, and one in 30 of Caucasian Americans,[126] is a carrier of a CF mutation. Although CF is less common in these groups, roughly one in 46 Hispanics, one in 65 Africans, and one in 90 Asians carry at least one abnormal CFTR gene.[127][128]  Ireland has the world's highest prevalence of CF, at one in 1353.[129]
