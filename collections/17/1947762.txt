In 1958, Ramakrishna Mission was started at the Palace of Khetri,[5] which was donated by Raja Ajit Singh's grandson, Raja Bahadur Sardar Singh. The palatial building has been named as "Vivekananda Smriti Mandir",[6] which houses marble statues of Raja Ajit Singh and Swami Vivekananda. The room at the topmost storey where Swamiji used to stay and had spiritual discourses with Raja Ajit Singhji, has been converted into a prayer room. Raja Ajit Singh of Khetri, was a great friend & disciple of Swami Vivekananda.It is said that the name Vivekananda was requested by the Maharaja to be accepted by Narendra,[7] the initial name of Swamiji.[8] Swami Vivekananda had stayed there three times (1891, 1893 and 1897) during his visits to Khetri. In his first visit to Khetri, Swami Vivekanada initially stayed elsewhere, which is unknown, and later on he moved to the Fateh Vilas( The palace, presently Vivekananda Smriti Mandir, Ramakrishna Mission, Khetri). During his second visit to Khetri he did stay here, in the above-mentioned room, but in his third visit to Khetri, he stayed in Sukh Mahal, near Fateh Vilas. He delivered his last discourse on Vedanta, in Khetri, was delivered in the space in front of Sukh Mahal. Swami Vivekananda started his journey to The Parliament of World's Religions, Chicago, United States of America from Fateh Vilas, Khetri on 10 May 1893. The centenary celebration of this particular day was performed by the local people of Khetri, with the help of Ramakrishna Mission, with emphatic fervor, on 10 May 1993. Rest of India celebrated this day on 31 May 1993, because Swamiji departed from Bombay(Mumbai) on 31 May 1893.
