The pre-merger United logo, commonly nicknamed the "tulip", was developed in the early 1970s after the airline commissioned designer Saul Bass to develop a new brand image.[112] The logo represented the airline's monogram as well as a modernized version of the airline's shield logo[113] which had been adopted in the 1930s, but fell out of use by the late 1960s. The ribbon-like rendering has also been said to symbolize the motion of flight.[114]
