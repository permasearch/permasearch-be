The Commercial Revolution ran from approximately the late 13th century through the 18th century,[3] with Walt Whitman Rostow saying the beginning is "arbitrarily" 1488, the year the first European sailed around the Cape of Good Hope.[4] Most historians, including scholars such as Angeliki Laiou, Robert S. Lopez, Irving W. Raymond, and Peter Spufford indicate that there was a commercial revolution of the 12th-13th centuries, or that it began at this point, rather than later.[5][6][7][8]
