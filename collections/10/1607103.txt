In molecular biology, repeat induced point-mutation or RIP is a process by which DNA accumulates G:C to A:T transition mutations. Genomic evidence indicates that RIP occurs or has occurred in a variety of fungi[23] while experimental evidence indicates that RIP is active in Neurospora crassa,[24] Podospora anserina,[25] Magnaporthe grisea,[26] Leptosphaeria maculans,[27] Gibberella zeae[28] and Nectria haematococca.[29] In Neurospora crassa, sequences mutated by RIP are often methylated de novo.[24]
