In colonial America, few regulations existed to control the use of land, due to the seemingly endless amounts of it. As society shifted from rural to urban, public land regulation became important, especially to city governments trying to control industry, commerce, and housing within their boundaries. The first zoning ordinance was passed in New York City in 1916,[4][5] and, by the 1930s, most states had adopted zoning laws.[6] In the 1970s, concerns about the environment and historic preservation led to further regulation.
