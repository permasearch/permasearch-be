There are also concerns that the water requirement for the solar plant to clean dust off panels and for turbine coolant may be detrimental to local populations in terms of the demand it will place on the local water supply.[53] An EU innovation supported project however resulted in the development of a silicone based film with a nano-dentrite structure on it. The film is fused on top of the solar panels and the nano-dentrite structure makes that sand, water, salt, bacteria, molds, etc. can't attach to the photovoltaic panels.[84] Opposed to this, studies point out the generation of fresh water by the solar thermal plants.[45] Furthermore, no significant amount of water is needed for cleaning and cooling, since alternative technologies can be used (dry cleaning, dry cooling[85]). However, dry cooling is more expensive, technologically challenging and less efficient than the water cooling currently planned. Plans for water desalination for cooling purposes are not part of the DESERTEC business plan or cost estimates as proposed.
