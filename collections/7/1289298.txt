Silva Zoldyck (シルバ＝ゾルディック, Shiruba Zorudikku) is Killua's father. A silent, pensive figure, Killua's interaction with him seems limited. He allows Killua to go along with Gon on their journey to find his father, but only because he sees it as a crucial step in his development as the head assassin of the Zoldyck Family.[ch. 42] During the auction in Yorknew City, Silva and Zeno are both hired by the Ten Dons to assassinate the Phantom Troupe, but withdraw from the job when their clients are killed due to a job taken by Illumi, Maha, and Kalluto.[ch. 100] This was Silva's second time fighting Chrollo Lucilfer,[ch. 99] and according to Killua, he previously killed an unknown member of the Phantom Troupe.[ch. 80] Silva later appears amid the assault on the Palace in East Gorteau, killing Cheetu on the way to pick up his father. Silva tied with Ging for fifteenth place in the series' first popularity poll,[3] and placed thirteenth in the second.[4]
