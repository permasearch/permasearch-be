Menander is considered to have been probably the most successful Indo-Greek king, and the conqueror of the largest territory.[143] The finds of his coins are the most numerous and the most widespread of all the Indo-Greek kings. Menander is also remembered in Buddhist literature, where he is called Milinda, and is described in the Milinda Panha as a convert to Buddhism:[144] he became an arhat[145] whose relics were enshrined in a manner reminiscent of the Buddha.[146][147] He also introduced a new coin type, with Athena Alkidemos ("Protector of the people") on the reverse, which was adopted by most of his successors in the East.[148]
