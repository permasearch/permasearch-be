The Florida Retirement System (FRS) Investment Plan was established by the Legislature to provide Floridaâ€™s public employees with a portable, flexible alternative to the FRS traditional defined benefit plan. Since opening its first employee account roughly nine years ago, the FRS Investment Plan has become one of the largest optional public-sector defined contribution retirement plans in the U.S.[31]
