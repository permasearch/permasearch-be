Urinalysis conducted after his loss to Anderson Silva showed Sonnen had an unallowably high testosterone/epitestosterone (T/E) ratio of 16.9:1 at the time of the fight. An average man has a T/E ratio of 1:1, and testing bodies may allow a ratio as high as 4:1 for athletes undergoing TRT treatment. In other words, Sonnen's T/E ratio was nearly 17 times than a normal man's and over four times the allowed maximum for an athlete.[28] He was fined $2,500 and suspended for one year (until September 2, 2011) by the California State Athletic Commission (CSAC).[29] His scheduled rematch with Silva was subsequently cancelled.[30][31]
