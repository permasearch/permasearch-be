In J.S. Bach's Art of Fugue, the first canon is at the octave, the second canon at the tenth, the third canon at the twelfth, and the fourth canon in augmentation and contrary motion.  Other exemplars can be found in the fugues in G minor and Bâ™­ major [external Shockwave movies] from Book II of Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier, both of which contain invertible counterpoint at the octave, tenth, and twelfth.
