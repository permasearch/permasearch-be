Although much progress has been made in high-energy, quantum, and astronomical physics, many everyday phenomena involving complexity,[85] chaos,[86] or turbulence[87] are still poorly understood. Complex problems that seem like they could be solved by a clever application of dynamics and mechanics remain unsolved; examples include the formation of sandpiles, nodes in trickling water, the shape of water droplets, mechanisms of surface tension catastrophes, and self-sorting in shaken heterogeneous collections.[88]
