A comma in subscripts and superscripts sometimes is omitted; it is also ambiguous notation. If it is written      T  m n k     {\displaystyle T_{mnk}}  , the reader should guess from the context, does it mean a single-index object, evaluated while the subscript is equal to product of variables     m   {\displaystyle m}  ,     n   {\displaystyle n}   and     k   {\displaystyle k}  , or it is indication to a trivalent tensor. The writing of      T  m n k     {\displaystyle T_{mnk}}   instead of      T  m , n , k     {\displaystyle T_{m,n,k}}   may mean that the writer either is stretched in space (for example, to reduce the publication fees) or aims to increase number of publications without considering readers. The same may apply to any other use of ambiguous notations.
