Captain John Francis Xavier McIntyre appears in the novels, the film (played by Elliott Gould), the M*A*S*H TV series (Wayne Rogers), and the Trapper John, M.D. series (Pernell Roberts). He is one of the main characters in the M*A*S*H TV series during the first three seasons, and the central character of the latter series. His nickname comes from an incident in which he was caught having sex with a woman in the lavatory aboard a Boston & Maine Railway train; who claimed in her defense that "he trapped me!"
