The following are characters who have worked with Omar Little on the HBO drama The Wire. Omar and his associates make their living robbing drug dealers. For the first three seasons, he mainly targets the Barksdale Organization. Later, he goes after the Stanfield Organization, culminating with a robbery of the entire New Day Co-Op. Omar himself never goes after any citizens or non-drug related people, nor do the rest of his crew who follow him. The others who work with Omar are often Baltimore stick-up artists whose motive for siding with Omar is the money associated with robbing stash houses. As Omar is gay, many other members of his crew are also of an LGBT background (Omar's boyfriends in addition to Kimmy and Tosha amongst others), while other members are of a heterosexual background and side with Omar due to his feared reputation among Baltimore drug dealers.
