The way found this page was another Wikipedia page that discussed the differences between Arianism and Orthodox Christianity. That article mentions the word eructation as one of the possible other reasons for Jesus Christ's birth. I can understand there not being a link like this to either page. And I don't really see the linkage between the two ideas and how this idea could have worked for anyone. Maybe the word in the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism is being misspelled or misquoted. An online historical time line led me to the whole story to begin with. â€”Preceding unsigned comment added by 68.113.210.175 (talk) 01:55, 29 September 2008 (UTC)
