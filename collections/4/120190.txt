The LS was the base model. It offered steel wheels with wheel covers (later alloy wheels), an AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD player, auxiliary input jack, and six speakers, keyless entry, air conditioning, cloth seating surfaces, and a choice of two front bucket or a single front bench seat. The LT was the mid-range model. It offered alloy wheels, MP3 playback capabilities, and optional front heated seats. The LTZ was the most luxurious model. It offered leather seating surfaces that were heated, an AM/FM stereo with six-disc CD/MP3 changer in the dash and a Bose eight-speaker premium sound system, a power sunroof, security system, and OnStar. The SS was the top-of-the-line model until 2009. It offered a 5.3 L V8 engine, leather-and-suede seating surfaces, eighteen-inch machined-finished alloy wheels, and SS badging (The 2006–09 model was the first Impala with a V8 engine since 1996). Due to its unpopularity, the SS trim was discontinued in 2009, leaving the LTZ as the top-of-the-line model for 2010 to be the most powerful, and for a shorter time in 2012–2013, the LS, LT, and LTZ trims were 300 horsepower, and also on the Impala Limited from 2014–2016.
