He's Just Not That into You is a 2009 American romantic comedy-drama film directed by Ken Kwapis, based on the 2004 self-help book of the same name by Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo, which in turn was inspired by a line of dialogue in Sex and the City. The film features an ensemble cast that includes Ben Affleck, Jennifer Aniston, Drew Barrymore, Jennifer Connelly, Kevin Connolly, Bradley Cooper, Ginnifer Goodwin, Scarlett Johansson, and Justin Long. The movie is set in Baltimore, and follows the story of nine different people and their varying romantic problems. Less of an ensemble comedy than a collection of interwoven stories, each of the characters has some degree of relationship with one or two others whether a crush, a date or a full-blown affair. Across the entire cast, Goodwin's character Gigi could be seen as the common thread. She is followed more closely than the other eight people and has a more developed storyline because she consistently misreads all of her romantic partners behaviors. She meets Alex, played by Long, who helps her to interpret signs given to her by her dates.
