Alfange served as head of the American Labor Party for several years in the late 1930s.[2] In 1942, he received the nomination for Governor of New York. Though he received the nomination, the American Labor Party only officially fielded a candidate after Sen. James Mead, the man they had backed for the Democratic nomination, lost to John J. Bennett, Jr. in the primary.[7] Mayor of New York City Fiorello La Guardia supported Alfange in this election.[8] Alfange finishing in third place[2] with 409,047 votes,[9][10] or about 17.7 percent of votes cast.[11] With this figure, Alfange garnered more votes than any other American Labor candidate ever had or would again in a state-wide election; these votes split the liberal vote and played a large role in Thomas E. Dewey's victory.[12]
