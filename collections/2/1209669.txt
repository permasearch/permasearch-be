Molecular studies have not unambiguously grouped them, possibly due to the paucity of key rare species such as Bentheuphausia amblyops in krill and Amphionides reynaudii in Eucarida. One study supports the monophyly of Eucarida (with basal Mysida),[15] another groups Euphausiacea with Mysida (the Schizopoda),[10] while yet another groups Euphausiacea with Hoplocarida.[16]
