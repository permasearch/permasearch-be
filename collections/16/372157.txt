In 1979, English blues singer Long John Baldry recorded a cover version of "You've Lost That Loving Feeling'" for his album Baldry's Out, the Jimmy Horowitz-produced disc which was Baldry's first recording in his newly adopted homeland of Canada. This version of the song is performed as a duet with Kathi McDonald,[81] who in singing the latter half of the first and second verse inverts the usual order. Released as a single, Baldry's "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'" charted at number 45 on the Canadian RPM singles chart, and spilled over into the US Billboard Hot 100 chart at number 89. The single also reached number 2 in Australia in 1980.[82] Bill Medley of the Righteous Brothers told Baldry that he liked their remake of the song better than his own.[83] Baldry had first recorded the song - as "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'" - for his 1966 album Looking at Long John. The Baldry/McDonald duet version of "You've Lost That Loving Feeling" also reached No. 37 in New Zealand.
