The RKO Building was the first structure to be completed, in September 1932,[81] followed by the Music Hall in December 1932[82][83] and the British Empire Building in April 1933.[84] The RCA Building's opening was delayed from May 1 to mid-May because of a controversy over Man at the Crossroads, a painting in the building's lobby, which was later covered up and removed.[85] A new street through the complex, Rockefeller Plaza, was constructed in stages between 1933[86] and 1937.[87] The complex's famed Christmas tree in the center of the plaza was erected for the first time in December 1933,[88] and the complex's Prometheus statue was constructed in May 1934.[89] By July 1934, the complex had leased 80% of the available space in the six buildings that were already opened.[90][91]
