The 1974 model year was essentially a repeat of 1973, but it was the last year for the Galaxie 500 name.[4] Ford elected to consolidate most of its full-size models under the popular LTD name for 1975, while reserving the base-model Custom 500 (which was below the Galaxie 500) nameplate for fleet buyers and private customers who insisted on the lowest-priced full-sized model possible. Power front disc brakes were standard.[33]
