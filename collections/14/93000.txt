Australia is a powerhouse in water-based sports, such as swimming and surfing.[332] The surf lifesaving movement originated in Australia, and the volunteer lifesaver is one of the country's icons.[333] Nationally, other popular sports include horse racing, basketball, and motor racing. The annual Melbourne Cup horse race and the Sydney to Hobart yacht race attract intense interest.[334] In 2016, the Australian Sports Commission revealed that swimming, cycling and soccer are the three most popular participation sports.[335][336]
