Polls that were conducted in 2006 showed an average of 37 percent approval ratings for Bush,[353] the lowest for any second-term president at that point of his term since Harry S. Truman in March 1951 (when Truman's approval rating was 28 percent),[346][354] which contributed to what Bush called the "thumping" of the Republican Party in the 2006 mid-term elections.[355] Throughout most of 2007, Bush's approval rating hovered in the mid-thirties;[356] the average for his entire second term was 37 percent, according to Gallup.[357]
