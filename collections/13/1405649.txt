On February 4, 1899, in the Battle of Manila, fighting broke out between the Filipino and American forces, beginning the Philippineâ€“American War. Aguinaldo immediately ordered "[t]hat peace and friendly relations with the Americans be broken and that the latter be treated as enemies".[8] In June 1899, the nascent First Philippine Republic formally declared war against the United States.[9][10]
