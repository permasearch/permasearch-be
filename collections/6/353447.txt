Dunder Mifflin Paper Company, Inc. is a fictional paper sales company featured in the American television series The Office. It is analogous to Wernham Hogg in the British original of the series, and Papiers Jennings and Cogirep in the French Canadian and French adaptations respectively.  Originally, the company was completely fictitious, but eventually, the brand was used to sell products at Staples and other office supply outlets.[1]
