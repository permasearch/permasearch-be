On March 5, 2013, it was announced during CMT's annual presentation attended by Viacom's top executives in New York City that CMT would be airing several new shows, including The Dirty South, that would premiere in late 2013.[11] On July 27, 2013, WBTW announced that The Dirty South would be filmed in Murrells Inlet, South Carolina. Some locals are against the idea, as the name "Dirty South" does not represent the area and could hurt the areas reputation, but others are in favor of the show or say they will have an open mind.[2][3][6] The series title was later changed to its current name, Party Down South.
