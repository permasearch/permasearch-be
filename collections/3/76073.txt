James I used Windsor Castle primarily as a base for hunting, one of his favourite pursuits, and for socialising with his friends.[141] Many of these occasions involved extensive drinking sessions, including one with Christian IV of Denmark in 1606 that became infamous across Europe for the resulting drunken behaviour of the two kings.[142] The absence of space at Windsor continued to prove problematic, with James' English and Scottish retinues often quarrelling over rooms.[142]
