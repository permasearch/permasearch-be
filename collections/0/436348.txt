Moretz has publicly supported LGBT equality.[47] She considers herself a feminist, and has turned down film roles which are overtly sexualized. She took on the role of a teenage prostitute in the 2014 film The Equalizer because her character "felt so real", rather than a mere "plot device".[48] In October 2014, Moretz was named one of the 25 Most Influential Teens of the year by Time magazine.[49]
