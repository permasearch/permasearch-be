Blue whales may be encountered (but rarely) on whale-watching cruises in the Gulf of Maine[165] and are the main attractions along the north shore of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and in the Saint Lawrence estuary.[149] Blue whales can also be seen off Southern California, starting as early as March and April, with the peak between July and September.[166] More whales have been observed close to shore along with fin whales.
