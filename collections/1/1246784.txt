The songs were influenced by a variety of artists, including Adam and the Ants ("Visit Colonel"), Taj Mahal ("Poison Finger"), and Pink Floyd's "The Scarecrow" ("Graveyard Drug Party"). "Ghost In The Trees" was adapted from "Putrifiers" by Yikes, one of Dwyer's previous bands. He would later allude to this work again with 2012's album Putrifiers II. "Block Of Ice" was heavily influenced by Red Krayola's song "Hurricane Fighter Plane" as well as Malcolm Mooney's work with Can.[6] "Block Of Ice" had also appeared on the album Deuteronomy by The Intelligence in 2007. The two bands had toured together, and The Intelligence recorded their cover of the song before John Dwyer had recorded a studio version with his own band.[9] Lars Finberg, the leader of The Intelligence, would later go on to join Thee Oh Sees as second drummer and second guitarist in 2011.
