Fletcher Christian began his naval career at a late age, joining the Royal Navy as a cabin boy when he was already seventeen years old (the average age for this position was between 12 to 15). He served for over a year on a third-rate frigate along with his future commander, William Bligh, who was posted as the ship's sixth lieutenant. Christian next became a Midshipman on the sixth-rate post ship HMS Eurydice and was made Master's Mate six months after the ship put to sea.  The muster rolls of HMSÂ Eurydice indicate Christian was signed on for a 21-month voyage to India. The ship's muster shows Christian's conduct was more than satisfactory because "some seven months out from England, he had been promoted from midshipman to master's mate".[6]
