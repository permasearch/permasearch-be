In mid-January, on orders from London, British Major General Henry Clinton and a small fleet set sail for the Carolinas with 1,500 men. Their objective was to join forces with additional troops arriving from Europe, and to take a port in the southern colonies for further military operations.[55] In early February a British raiding party crossed the ice and burned several farmhouses in Dorchester.[56]
