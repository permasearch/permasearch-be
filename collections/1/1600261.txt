An interreligious organization or interfaith organization is an organization that encourages dialogue and cooperation between the world's different religions. In 1893, the Parliament of the Worlds Religions held, in conjunction with the World Colombian Exposition, a conference  held in Chicago that is believed to be the first interfaith gathering of notable significance. In the century since, many local, national and international organizations have been founded.
