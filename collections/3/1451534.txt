Motivational techniques can be implemented to promote hearing conservation program compliance and the use of hearing protection. One suggestion is continued education at the workers' audiometric screening.[21] They should be asked to bring along their current hearing protection device to the screening.  If the results are normal and the inspection of the hearing protection device is good, praise can be given for following protocol.  If there is a shift in their hearing, instruction can be given again about the proper use of hearing protection and the importance of wearing them. Audiograms can be very useful in showing workers how noise can affect their hearing. One specific way to do this is to perform two hearing test on an employee on two different days.[21]  One day the hearing test will be after wearing hearing protection all day and the other will be after not wearing hearing protection for the day.  The difference can then be discussed with the worker and he/she has a tangible way to see how noise affects hearing.  Another technique is using "internal triggers" to motivate employees to comply to the hearing conservation program.[15]  If the individual already suffers from tinnitus and/or hearing loss they are probably more likely to use hearing protection because he/she does not want that problem to progress with noise exposure.  Finally, the hearing protection offered should be comfortable so the worker will wear it. It is suggested that workers have a variety of hearing protection devices available to them, including at least one type of earmuff and two different forms of earplugs, to fit the individual needs and wants of the workers.[21]
