Alignment in this portion was proposed to be at grade and to run parallel to Wardha road up to ROB and abutting railway line thereafter up-to proposed Car depot. But, while working on this modification of alignment, it was noticed that a very large number of properties were falling along the alignment due to sharp curve at the junction of Sahakar Nagar & 24-meter wide road and also at the junction of 24-meter wide road & Wardha Road. As acquiring of these properties will be very tough and may delay the whole project, hence to avoid all such situation, it was decided to take the alignment on Wardha Road only without going on Khamla Road. This decision changed the alignment, and it was decided that North-South Corridor will pass through Wardha Road after Congress Nagar Metro Station. After crossing existing intersection point of Wardha Road & Airport Road, it was decided that the alignment will be shifted to the MIHAN area and alignment in this portion would be at grade and will run parallel to Wardha road up to ROB and parallel to railway line thereafter up-to proposed Car depot. 14-meter wide stretch of land between the railway boundary line and the road near proposed Container Depot of Container Corporation of India Ltd. would be affected by this proposed alignment of the Metro Rail as the proposed alignment passes through this stretch of land. MADC land of area 73 Ha was available on the west side of railway line and south of existing flyover near Khapri station. Average width of this land was about 80 m and was about 1800 m long. This MADC land would be utilized for Car Depot. Similarly, Depot of East-West Corridor had also been shifted to SRPF Land near proposed Lokmanya Nagar Metro Station.[21]
