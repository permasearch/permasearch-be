In 1994, the provincial government purchased the entire right-of-way for the former PEIR from CN. Throughout the late 1990s, the provincial government in cooperation with the Trans-Canada Trail foundation and various community volunteers, worked to complete the Confederation Trail system.  Today 75% of total PEIR mileage is open as public recreation trails with the remaining 25% estimated to be opened over the next decade.[citation needed]
