The soreness is perceived as a dull, aching pain in the affected muscle, often combined with tenderness and stiffness. The pain is typically felt only when the muscle is stretched, contracted or put under pressure, not when it is at rest.[2]:63 This tenderness, a characteristic symptom of DOMS, is also referred to as "muscular mechanical hyperalgesia".[3]
