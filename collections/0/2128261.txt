Jorgun Bakusa (ジョーガン・バクサ, Jōgan Bakusa) and Balinbow Bakusa (バリンボー・バクサ, Barinbō Bakusa) are the towering, twin brothers of Team Dai-Gurren, piloting the two-faced Gunmen, Twin Boukun. The two are always hyped and normally speak in manly grunts and monosyllabic phrases. They sport differently coloured sunglasses, which can be used to tell one brother from the other—Jorgun wears red shades, while Balinbow sports blue ones. After the timeskip, the two were appointed Directors of the Public Affairs Department, in which they were responsible for the human population count. Jorgun and Balinbow are killed in the first deep space battle versus the Anti-Spirals, after saving Gimmy and Darry's lives. However, in the movie version, both of them survived while the above event of their deaths did not happen.
