In 2006, the Supercopa León was replaced by the new shape León.  The car is potentially faster than the WTCC version, as it features a turbocharged 2.0-litre engine, with over 221 kW (300 PS; 296 bhp), increased torque, the DSG gearbox, better aerodynamics (it includes the WTCC car's front and rear spoilers, plus a venturi tunnel under the car, instead of a flat bottom), and 18 inch wheels, instead of the mandatory 17 inch wheels from the WTCC.
