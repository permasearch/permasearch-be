Erin finally earns Michael's respect in "Scott's Tots" when she points out the benefit of the promise Michael could not fulfill to a group of underprivileged high school students. She eventually figures out Michael's idiosyncratic habits (such as having ants on a log served every day at 2:30 and being spun around in his desk chair until he is dizzy) and, unlike Pam, gladly accommodates them, she seems disappointed when Jim Halpert declines to continue them during his brief tenure as branch manager. She also tells Michael that she would like to be an accountant someday, even though she is bad at math.
