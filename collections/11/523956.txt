The Dubious Goals Committee has sometimes decided after a match that players have not scored hat-tricks because one of the goals was incorrectly credited to them. Southampton player Egil Østenstad was thought to have scored a hat-trick against Manchester United in 1996, but the committee ruled that one of the goals be credited as an own goal to United's Phil Neville.[6][7] Anelka's first goal for Manchester City in September 2002 was later credited as an own goal to Everton's Tomasz Radzinski.[8] Javier Hernández was denied a hat-trick against Aston Villa in November 2011 after the committee ruled his second goal was actually an own goal by Ron Vlaar.[9]
