In 2005, he began hosting the ABC reality series Dancing with the Stars, for ABC, where he had two former co-hostesses (Lisa Canning and Samantha Harris) before Brooke Burke, the winner of season 7, and later Erin Andrews, who finished in third place of season 10 took over the job. The show, modeled on the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing, proved to be a hit, and has now aired in over 90 countries in its various formats. His sharp sense of humor and good banter with the judges and cast members of Dancing with the Stars have helped to make him to become a big star again, so much so that in June 2010, ABC invited him back to his daytime roots for one day only as special guest moderator of "The View".
