In 784, the capital moved briefly to Nagaoka-kyō, then again in 794 to Heian-kyō (modern Kyoto), which remained the capital until 1868.[45] Political power within the court soon passed to the Fujiwara clan, a family of court nobles who grew increasingly close to the imperial family through intermarriage.[46] In 858, Fujiwara no Yoshifusa had himself declared sesshō ("regent") to the underage Emperor. His son Fujiwara no Mototsune created the office of kampaku, which could rule in the place of an adult reigning Emperor. Fujiwara no Michinaga, a skilled statesman who became kampaku in 996, governed during the height of the Fujiwara clan's power[47] and had four of his daughters married to Japanese Emperors.[46] The Fujiwara clan held on to power until 1086, when Emperor Shirakawa ceded the throne to his son Emperor Horikawa but continued to exercise political power, establishing the practice of cloistered rule,[48] by which the reigning Emperor would function as a figurehead while real power was held by a retired predecessor behind the scenes.[49]
