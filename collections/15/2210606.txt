In 2008, SEAT Deutschland announced the production of 55 units of the SEAT León Copa Edition.[21]  This limited edition is powered with 2.0 TFSI engine improved to 210 kilowatts (286 PS; 282 bhp) of maximum power, and 360 newton metres (266 lbf⋅ft).  Maximum speed is 255 kilometres per hour (158.4 mph) and 0-100 km/h (62.1 mph) time is 5.9 seconds.[22]  The suspension is an Eibach derived from the León Supercopa, and the brakes have been improved to cope with the enhanced performance from the uprated engine.  In addition, the car includes xenon HID headlights, 18 inch wheels and a spoiler with larger air intakes.[23]  The car colour is white with black stripes.
