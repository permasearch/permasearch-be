In the transverse direction, the swimmer has to compensate for the river flow by moving at a certain angle against the flow direction, in order to sustain his exact transverse direction of motion and to reach the other side of the river at the correct location. This diminishes his speed to        c  2   âˆ’  v  2       {\displaystyle {\sqrt {c^{2}-v^{2}}}}  , and gives the beam travel time      T  3     {\displaystyle T_{3}}   as mentioned above.
