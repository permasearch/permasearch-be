Barcelona contains sixty municipal parks, twelve of which are historic, five of which are thematic (botanical), forty-five of which are urban, and six of which are forest.[132] They range from vest-pocket parks to large recreation areas. The urban parks alone cover 10% of the city (549.7 ha or 1,358.3 acres).[53] The total park surface grows about 10 ha (25 acres) per year,[133] with a proportion of 18.1 square metres (195 sq ft) of park area per inhabitant.[134]
