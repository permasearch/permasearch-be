Let      x    {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} }   be an arbitrary real m-dimensional column vector of     A   {\displaystyle A}   such that     ‖  x  ‖ =  |  α  |    {\displaystyle \|\mathbf {x} \|=|\alpha |}   for a scalar α. If the algorithm is implemented using floating-point arithmetic, then α should get the opposite sign as the k-th coordinate of      x    {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} }  , where      x  k     {\displaystyle x_{k}}   is to be the pivot coordinate after which all entries are 0 in matrix A's final upper triangular form, to avoid loss of significance. In the complex case, set
