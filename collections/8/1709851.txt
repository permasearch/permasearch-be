On August 20, 2018, at the VMAs, a ten second long snippet of the song "My Blood" was played at the end of a commercial promoting the album. On August 27, 2018, a Twitter user leaked the full song onto his Twitter account in low quality, after they found that it could be played on their Apple HomePod. The leak was later confirmed real when the band made the song available on streaming services, as the album's fourth single.[16]
