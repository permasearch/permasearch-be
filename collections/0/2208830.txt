The Lord John series is a sequence of novels and shorter works that center on Lord John Grey, a recurring secondary character from the Outlander novels. The spin-off series currently consists of five novellas and three novels, which all take place between 1756 and 1761, during the events of Gabaldon's Voyager.[10][11] They can be generally categorized as historical mysteries, and the three novels are shorter and focus on fewer plot threads than the main Outlander books.[11] Several of the Lord John books have been released in audiobook form, read by Jeff Woodman.
