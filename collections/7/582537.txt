Anglican prayer beads, also known informally as the "Anglican Rosary," are a recent innovation created in the 1980s.[70] They consist of four "weeks" (the equivalent of a decade) of seven beads each. The weeks are separated from each other by single beads termed "cruciform beads." A variety of different prayers may be said, the most common being the Jesus Prayer.
