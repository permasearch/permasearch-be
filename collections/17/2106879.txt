Boyd Crowder (played by Walton Goggins) is a highly intelligent and charismatic career criminal who frequently comes into conflict with Raylan. Boyd and Raylan share a coal mining past which serves to connect the two more than they might admit, even as Boyds criminal operations continue to draw him into trouble with Raylan and the Marshals.
