The final scene of the series shows the entire family eating breakfast together after Frank breaks Marie's stove in an attempt to "work on it." Each character seems to emote an amalgam of their signature qualities as they sit and eat together, and with Ray at the center of the table, Debra tells Ray, "It's getting a little crowded in here," to which Ray responds, "Yeah, you know what? We need a bigger table."
