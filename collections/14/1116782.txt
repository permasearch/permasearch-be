Henri Matisse reduced the rendering of still-life objects even further to little more than bold, flat outlines filled with bright colours. He also simplifyied perspective and introducing multi-colour backgrounds.[64] In some of his still-life paintings, such as Still Life with Eggplants, his table of objects is nearly lost amidst the other colourful patterns filling the rest of the room.[65] Other exponents of Fauvism, such as Maurice de Vlaminck and Andr√© Derain, further explored pure colour and abstraction in their still life.
