To support the album, the project morphed into a full band, with Barker, DeLonge, and Kennedy. Barker invited his friend Anthony Celestino to play bass. He had initially wanted Alex Barreto, who was in the original Box Car Racer, to be a part of the "second version" of the band, but he could not get in touch with him.[4] They played their first four shows in April 2002.[43][37] The group commenced a full-scale tour behind the album in October 2002, with 22 North American shows supported by the Used[34] and H2O.[40]
