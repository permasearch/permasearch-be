Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch) and John (Martin Freeman) receive a visit from Henry Knight (Russell Tovey), who witnessed his father's death by a "gigantic hound" at Dartmoor 20 years ago. After years of therapy, Henry visited the site again, only to see the hound again, prompting his request for help. Though initially dismissive, Sherlock is soon interested by Henry's use of "hound" instead of "dog". Sherlock and John arrive in Dartmoor to find the hound is a local legend. They visit Baskerville, a nearby Ministry of Defence research base, using Mycroft's (Mark Gatiss) security pass. After Mycroft's credentials cause a security alert, Dr. Bob Frankland (Clive Mantle) vouches for Sherlock's identity, despite knowing the truth. Frankland says he was a friend of Henry's father and is concerned for Henry's well-being.
