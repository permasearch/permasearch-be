A turning point is a point at which the derivative changes sign.[2] A turning point may be either a relative maximum or a relative minimum (also known as local minimum and maximum). If the function is differentiable, then a turning point is a stationary point; however not all stationary points are turning points. If the function is twice differentiable, the stationary points that are not turning points are horizontal inflection points. For example, the function     x â†¦  x  3     {\displaystyle x\mapsto x^{3}}   has a stationary point at x=0, which is also an inflection point, but is not a turning point.[3]
