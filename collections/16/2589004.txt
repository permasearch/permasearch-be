If the medicine is prescribed heavily, they may seek to reward the individual through gifts.[10] The American Medical Association has published ethical guidelines for gifts from industry which include the tenet that physicians should not accept gifts if they are given in relation to the physicianâ€™s prescribing practices.[11] Doubtful cases include grants for traveling to medical conventions that double as tourist trips.
