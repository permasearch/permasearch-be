William brought over 11,212 horse and foot. William's cavalry and dragoons amounted to 3,660.[63] His artillery train contained 21 24-pounder cannon. Including the supply train, his force consisted of about 15,000 men,[64] compared to James's total forces of about 30,000.[65][66] He also brought 20,000 stand of arms to equip his English supporters.[55] The Dutch army was composed mostly of foreign mercenaries; there were Dutch, Scots, English, German, Swiss, and Swedish regiments, even Laplanders[50] as well as "200 Blacks brought from the Plantations of the Netherlands in America",[67] thus from the colony of Surinam. Many of the mercenaries were Catholic.[68] William had his personal guard regiment with him, the Dutch Blue Guards. In response to the threat James had raised five new regiments of foot and five of horse, as well as bringing in Scottish and Irish soldiers. Louis XIV also sent James 300,000 livres.[69]
