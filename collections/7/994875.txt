It is one of their best known hits, peaking at # 92 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #40 on the Mainstream Rock charts. Despite its success and unlike other of the band's hits, the song did not go on to be a live staple, appearing very rarely in concerts after their appearance at the 1993 Phoenix Festival,[1] where Billy Gould announced "this is the last time we'll ever play this song again" right before the song.[2] During Second Coming Tour the band picked up the song again and performed it at least once, at a concert in Rio de Janeiro in 2009. The song was performed at the Open'er Festival in 2014 for the first time since 2009. In a 2016 interview, Gould stated that; "That song sucks, let’s face it. I don’t know, we don’t groove on that one. Also, when you play it live, it just kind of gets boring".[3]
