Online music database Allmusic gave the soundtrack a positive review of four stars out of five stating "soundtracks to movies adapted from comic books are often marketing free-for-alls; promoting bands takes precedence over choosing songs that make sense for the film. However, nothing could be further from the truth for Scott Pilgrim vs. the World's music."[19] Drowned in Sound gave the album a rating of eight out of ten, writing that "with a soundtrack that captures the spirit of the comics with such fervency, conviction and discipline, Scott Pilgrim vs The World looks set to be a lot less dislikable than you might've hoped."[20] Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B rating, praising the song "Garbage Truck" as well as T.Rex's classic "Teenage Dream", and "By Your Side" by Beachwood Sparks.[21] Rolling Stone gave the album two and half stars out of five stating that Beck's and Broken Social Scene's contributions to the soundtrack were not strong and that "the charm of those songs fades outside the film".[22]
