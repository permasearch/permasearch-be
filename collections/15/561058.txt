Bill Cosby has criticised the current state of Black families being dominated by single-parent households. In a speech to the NAACP in 2004, Cosby said "“In the neighborhood that most of us grew up in, parenting is not going on". “You have the pile-up of these sweet beautiful things born by nature—raised by no one."[84]
