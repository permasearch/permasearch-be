The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) mandates that theatrical trailers be no longer than two minutes and thirty seconds.  Each major studio[clarification needed] is given one exception to this rule per year.[citation needed] Internet or home-video trailers have no time restrictions. Rating cards appear at the head of trailers in the United States which indicate how closely the trailer adheres to the MPAA's standards.[citation needed]
