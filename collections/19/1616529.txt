In The Rift trilogy, Toph encounters her father for the first time since the series,[18] though he refuses to acknowledge her as his daughter. Toph prevents others from being killed by debris falling from the mine collapsing,[19] including her father, who reconciles with her as she saves everyone. Following this, she passes out and has her students assist Aang in his battle against the spirit of Old Iron.[20]
