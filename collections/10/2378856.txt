The 1989 World Series was known as the "Earthquake Series", "Bay Bridge Series", and "Battle of the Bay", as both teams played against each other, and Oakland swept the Giants in a 4-game series.[16] However, the series is probably best known for the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake which struck on the day of Game 3.[17][18]
