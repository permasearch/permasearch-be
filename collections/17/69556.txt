Hydrogen peroxide has roles as a signalling molecule in the regulation of a wide variety of biological processes.[40] The compound is a major factor implicated in the free-radical theory of aging, based on how readily hydrogen peroxide can decompose into a hydroxyl radical and how superoxide radical byproducts of cellular metabolism can react with ambient water to form hydrogen peroxide.[41] These hydroxyl radicals in turn readily react with and damage vital cellular components, especially those of the mitochondria.[42][43][44] At least one study has also tried to link hydrogen peroxide production to cancer.[45] These studies have frequently been quoted in fraudulent treatment claims.[citation needed]
