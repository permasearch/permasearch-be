Goat meat from adults is often called chevon and cabrito, capretto, or kid when it is from young animals. While "goat" is usually the name for the meat found in common parlance, producers and marketers may prefer to use the French-derived word chevon (from chÃ¨vre), since market research in the United States suggests that "chevon" is more palatable to consumers than "goat meat".[1] Cabrito, a word of Spanish and Portuguese origin, refers specifically to young, milk-fed goat. In some parts of Asia, particularly India, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh; the word "mutton" is sometimes used to describe both goat and sheep meat, despite its more specific meaning (limited to the meat of adult sheep) in the UK, US, Australia and other English-speaking countries.[2][3]
