Vegans do not eat beef, pork, poultry, fowl, game, animal seafood, eggs, dairy, or any other animal products. Dietary vegans might use animal products in clothing (as leather, wool, and silk), toiletries, and similar. Ethical veganism extends not only to matters of food but also to the wearing or use of animal products, and rejects the commodification of animals altogether.[20]:62 The British Vegan Society will certify a product only if it is free of animal involvement as far as possible and practical, including animal testing,[146][147][148] but "recognises that it is not always possible to make a choice that avoids the use of animals".[149]
