The Ebola virus may be able to persist for more than 3 months in the semen after recovery, which could lead to infections via sexual intercourse.[4][54][55] Virus persistence in semen for over a year has been recorded in a national screening programme.[56] Ebola may also occur in the breast milk of women after recovery, and it is not known when it is safe to breastfeed again.[5] The virus was also found in the eye of one patient in 2014, two months after it was cleared from his blood.[57] Otherwise, people who have recovered are not infectious.[51]
