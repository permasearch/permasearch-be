The eurozone is represented politically by its finance ministers, known collectively as the Eurogroup, and is presided over by a president, currently MÃ¡rio Centeno. The finance ministers of the EU member states that use the euro meet a day before a meeting of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin) of the Council of the European Union. The Group is not an official Council formation but when the full EcoFin council votes on matters only affecting the eurozone, only Euro Group members are permitted to vote on it.[48][49][50]
