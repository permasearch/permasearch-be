Grant married Dyan Cannon on July 22, 1965, at friend Howard Hughes' Desert Inn in Las Vegas.[319] Their daughter, Jennifer, was born on February 26, 1966. Jennifer is Grant's only child.[320] He frequently called Jennifer his "best production".[321] He said of fatherhood: "My life changed the day Jennifer was born. I've come to think that the reason we're put on this earth is to procreate. To leave something behind. Not films, because you know that I don't think my films will last very long once I'm gone. But another human being. That's what's important."[322] Grant and Cannon divorced in March 1968.[323] On March 12 that month he was involved in a car accident on Long Island when a truck struck the side of his limousine. Grant was hospitalized for 17 days with three broken ribs and bruising.[324]
