Following the nomination of Amul Thapar to the Sixth Circuit, it was noted that Trump might try to season some of the candidates on his original lists with federal Circuit Court experience prior to another possible Supreme Court vacancy.[19] Later, Trump nominated Joan Larsen (Sixth Circuit), David Stras (Eighth Circuit), Allison Eid (Tenth Circuit), and Don Willett (Fifth Circuit) to the federal courts of appeals. Two of the new names added to the November 2017 list, Amy Coney Barrett (Seventh Circuit) and Kevin Newsom (Eleventh Circuit), had already been nominated to the federal courts of appeals by Trump and confirmed by the Senate.
