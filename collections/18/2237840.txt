The REASON instrument makes innovative use of radar sounding, altimetry, reflectometry, plasma and particles analyses. These investigations will use a dual-frequency radar emitting HF (9 MHz) and VHF (60 MHz) with concurrent shallow and deep sounding.[1][2][3] Both VHF and HF radiating elements are mounted on a single boom, reducing antenna mass. The mission plan also includes using REASON as a nadir altimeter capable of measuring tides to test ice shell and ocean hypotheses as well as characterizing roughness across the surface to identify potential landing sites for a future Europa Lander.[1]
