Ward comes home to what he terms a Louisa May Alcott scene of domesticity, pots simmering on the range, and June sewing a button on a suit coat that Wally intends to wear to a dance. After coming home from a fishing trip, Beaver and Richard, in turn, ruin Wally's suit, when Beaver drapes a jacket with fishbait-filled pockets, and, after it's been dry cleaned, when Richard spills leather oil on it. Eddie stops by and learns of the disaster. When Wally wants to dress for a dance (completely unaware of the accident), Eddie suggests they "go Tony Curtis" and wear sports jackets and slacks instead of their suits. Later, Ward suggests Beaver keep mum about Eddie's kindness in the incident because Eddie doesn't like others to know he can be a nice guy.
