Queensland's population has grown at an annual rate of ~2% since the 1970s, and to meet the commensurate increase in demand for electricity during this period the Callide B base load station (700MW) was commissioned in 1988, and the Stanwell Power Station (1448MW) in 1993. The growing use of air-conditioning increased the need for peak demand generating capacity, and gas turbines were commissioned at Barcaldine in 1995, Ballera (near Mt Isa) the following year, Mt Stuart (near Townsville) and Cannington (near Mt Isa) in 1998 and Roma in 1999, the same year the Koombooloomba Hydro-Electric Power Station (west of Cairns) was commissioned.
