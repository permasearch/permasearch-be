Writing early in the history of intermetallic compounds, the British metallurgist Cecil Desch observed that "certain non-metallic elements are capable of forming compounds of distinctly metallic character with metals, and these elements may therefore enter into the composition of alloys". He associated silicon, arsenic and tellurium, in particular, with the alloy-forming elements.[107] Phillips and Williams[108] suggested that compounds of silicon, germanium, arsenic and antimony with B metals, "are probably best classed as alloys".
