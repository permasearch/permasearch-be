Vegeta's quote "It's over 9000!", referring to Goku's new power level, has become an Internet meme and a popular catchphrase referring to a large number or great quantity. The line originates from episode 21 of the Ocean Productions English dub, "The Return of Goku", where Vegeta was voiced by Brian Drummond. It was altered from the original line, which was "over 8,000!" (8000以上だ…!, 8000 ijō da…!). Subsequent releases and dubs have used one of the two numbers.[110]
