During the three-day cycle, many non-player characters follow fixed schedules that Link can track using the Bomber's Notebook.[11] The notebook tracks the twenty characters in need of help,[11] such as a soldier to whom Link delivers medicine, and an engaged couple whom Link reunites. Blue bars on the notebook's timeline indicate when characters are available for interaction, and icons indicate that Link has received items, such as masks, from the characters.[11]
