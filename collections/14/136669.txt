In its early years, Ramos maintained continuity between his radio and television stations by signing an exclusive deal with the most well-known and influential actor/comedian/producer in Puerto Rico, Ramón Rivero – better known as Diplo – whose comedy show El Tremendo Hotel ("The Tremendous Hotel"), which was broadcast on WKAQ radio, was the most popular radio program in Puerto Rican broadcasting history. Rivero produced the first comedy/variety series for WKAQ-TV, "La Taberna India", and La Farándula Corona on YouTube, which helped to catapult the television station to the top of the ratings.
