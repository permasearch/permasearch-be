In the late 1990s parents complained about the amount of sugar and artificial flavourings in many children's fruit drinks,[16] which resulted in new regulations. The Um Bongo formula was changed around 2003 or 2004 to comply with the new rules. Most of the original ingredients were removed, with the drink being re-branded as "Um Bongo-100% juice", containing only bananas, orange and pineapple. In comparison, the original also contained apple, lemon, orange, pineapple, passion fruit, mandarin, apricot, guava and mango. New packaging for the product was also introduced by 2007, removing much reference to the Congo.[17]
