The 1875 Brooklyn Atlantics of the National Association finished at 2–42 (.045 percentage), but the status of the National Association as a major league has long been disputed. For comparison, the Atlantics' record projects to 7–155 under the current schedule, and Pythagorean expectation based on the Atlantics' results and the current 162 game schedule predicts a record of 13–149.
