Redirecting LIRR trains from Penn Station to Grand Central Terminal will free up track and platforms at Penn. The track connections resulting from the East Side Access project would theoretically allow Metro-North Railroad trains on the New Haven Line to be directed to Penn Station as part of a related project called Penn Station Access. Four new local Metro-North stations in the Bronx are planned as part of this project: at Co-op City, Morris Park, Parkchester, and Hunts Point.[124]
