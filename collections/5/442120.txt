The official music video, which features the band members in a gladiator-style battle, and a cameo from rapper Rick Ross, was released on October 17, 2014.[12] The video features strong Christian imagery and thematic elements, including a scene of a crucified figure, a cross in place of the "T" in the song title, the use of a sling against a "giant" (in reference to the Hebrew story of David and Goliath), and an angelic figure depicted as a human with white wings. The "giant" is portrayed by Canadian actor Jon Ambrose,[13] and the band's gladiator doubles were Simu Liu,[14] Ben Devries,[15] Sebastian Deery [16] and Paul Ebejer.[17]  "Centuries" was shot on-site at Fort Henry National Historic Site in Kingston, Ontario, Canada.[18] Prior to the release of an official music video, Fall Out Boy released a video for "Centuries" filmed in Chicago featuring the use of the mobile app Hyperlapse on September 8, 2014.[19][20]
