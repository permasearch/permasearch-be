Symmetry and beauty have a strong biological link that influences aesthetic preferences. It has been shown that humans tend to prefer art that contains symmetry, deeming it more beautiful.[46] Furthermore, symmetry directly correlates to the understanding of a face or artwork as beautiful.[47] The greater the symmetry within the work or the face, generally the more beautiful it appears to be.[47] Research on aesthetic preference for geometric forms and the fluent processing of symmetry sheds light on the role that symmetry plays in the overall aesthetic judgment and experience.
