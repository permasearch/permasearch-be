Jamaica spent its first ten years of independence under conservative governments, with its economy undergoing continuous growth.[20] However, as it had been throughout much of its history, the independent Jamaica was plagued by issues of class inequality. After the global economy underwent deterioration, the leftist PNP returned to power after the 1972 elections. Uncertain economic conditions troubled the country well into the 1980s.
