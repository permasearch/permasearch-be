Pyrolysis of coal produces polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are known carcinogens.[21] On the other hand, synthetic fuels produced by indirect coal liquefaction processes tend to be 'cleaner' than naturally occurring crudes, as heteroatom (e.g. sulfur) compounds are not synthesized or are excluded from the final product.
