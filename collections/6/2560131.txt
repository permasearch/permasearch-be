Apart from Leonardo, other prominent practitioners of sfumato included Correggio, Raphael and Giorgione. Raphael's Virgin of the Field is a famous example (look especially at her face). Students and followers of Leonardo (called Leonardeschi) also tried their hands at sfumato after Leonardo: artists such as Bernardino Luini and Funisi.[3]
