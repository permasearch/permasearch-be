A reunion occurred to record a new track for a special album commemorating Liverpool's 2008 "European Capital of Culture" event, where Michael McCartney and John Gorman represented The Scaffold in the Number One Concert in the 10,500-seater Echo Arena and received a standing ovation from the capacity audience. In 2009, the classic lineup was reunited in Ronnie Scott's London Jazz Club for a BBC TV programme, and in October 2010, they reconvened for a Gala Concert in Shanghai, to celebrate the end of the Liverpool Pavilion as part of the World Expo. They shared the concert with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, OMD and the Liverpool Chinese Children's Pagoda Orchestra.
