Modern French society is a melting pot.[32] From the middle of the 19th century, it experienced a high rate of inward migration and the government, defining France as an inclusive nation with universal values, advocated assimilation through which immigrants were expected to adhere to French values and cultural norms. Nowadays, while the government has let newcomers retain their distinctive cultures since the mid-1980s and requires from them a mere integration,[33] French citizens still equate their nationality with citizenship as does French law.[34]
