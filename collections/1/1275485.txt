The Stig is never shown talking on screen, although he does talk with celebrities off-camera while training them to drive around the track. Clarkson has joked that he is "not a very talkative chap".[3] When asked about his identity in a rare spoken interview for the show 'Veronica Vibes' of a Dutch channel, the Stig reportedly said, "I don't remember; my memory was erased when I got the job."[6] The Stig's muteness has extended to appearances in other media, such as the "Brain Stig" video released by the BBC on YouTube in 2009.[7][8]
