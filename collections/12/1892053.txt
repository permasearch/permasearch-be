As of Fall 2015, Rutgers offers a total of 11 fully online degree programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels.[60] An integral part of the institution's academic fabric, and a priority in the university's strategic development initiatives, these programs constitute, collectively, "Rutgers Online." Online degree programs at Rutgers must meet the same academic expectations, in terms of both teaching and learning outcomes, as traditional on-campus programs.
