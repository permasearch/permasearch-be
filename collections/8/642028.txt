The standard definition of a left shift is an absolute band form count greater than 700/microL.[3] There are competing explanations for the origin of the phrase "left shift," including the left-most button arrangement of early cell sorting machines[4][5] and a 1920s publication by Josef Arneth, containing a graph in which immature neutrophils, with fewer segments, shifted the median left.[6]
