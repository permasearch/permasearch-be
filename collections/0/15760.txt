Matthew "Matt" Camden (played by Barry Watson) (born 1980) is Annie and Eric's firstborn. In the beginning of the series, Matt is a junior in high school. Matt sacrifices his school time to help others; if they wished to remain anonymous, he would respect that and not even tell his father. During high school, he bounces from job to job, including tutor and Dairy Shack delivery driver. He is not always a star student, but he manages to graduate at the top of his class and get accepted for a White House internship in Washington, D.C. with First Lady Hillary Clinton. He returns to Glenoak for college, rooming with friend and fellow "P.K." John Hamilton. Matt's new uncle, Dr. Hank Hastings (who had actually delivered him), helps him get a job in the hospital cafeteria; during his time there, he decides to become a doctor. He ends up working at a women's clinic with Hank, beginning by helping save the life of a woman who could not get anyone but Matt to take her symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy seriously.
