"I Go to Pieces" has twice appeared on the Billboard C&W chart, the first time in 1988 when Dean Dillon took the song to a number 39 peak, the track being a single off Dillon's Slick Nickel album.  In 1990 an a cappella remake of "I Go to Pieces" by Southern Pacific reached number 31 C&W: the number had been a Southern Pacific concert staple since the band's 1984 inception before being recorded in the summer of 1989 for their January 1990 album release Country Line album with the track being issued as a single in February 1990 - the month of its composer Del Shannon's death - although it only gradually accrued support to reach the C&W Top 40 that May. Southern Pacific member Keith Knudsen would allege resistance to the band's version of "I Go to Pieces" from C&W radio: "ten or so big [C&W] stations...wouldn't even test it. We heard [program directors say] things like - 'Well, there's no music on it'...Or - 'Well, I liked it, but that's an old Pop song [so] we can't use it.' Meanwhile, on the stations that did play it, it was the most requested record that we ever had."[7]
