Nurmi broke 22 official world records on distances between 1500 m and 20Â km; a record in running.[13][115] He also set several more unofficial ones for a total of 58.[80] His indoor world records were all unofficial as the IAAF did not ratify indoor records until the 1980s.[13] Nurmi's record for most Olympic gold medals was matched by gymnast Larisa Latynina in 1964, swimmer Mark Spitz in 1972 and fellow track and field athlete Carl Lewis in 1996, and broken by swimmer Michael Phelps in 2008.[116] Nurmi's record for most medals in the Olympic Games stood until Edoardo Mangiarotti won his 13th medal in fencing in 1960.[117] Time selected Nurmi as the greatest Olympian of all time in 1996,[118] and IAAF named him among the first twelve athletes to be inducted into the IAAF Hall of Fame in 2012.[119]
