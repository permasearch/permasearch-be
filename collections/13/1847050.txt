On May 24, 1987, the N and R services switched terminals in Queens. As part of the reroute plan, Queens Plaza became the northern terminal for the G train on evenings, weekends and late nights.[17] Three years later, on September 30, 1990, G service was extended to 179th Street during late nights to replace the F, which terminated at 21st Streetâ€“Queensbridge.[18]
