The nabla is used in vector calculus as part of the names of three distinct differential operators:  the gradient (∇), the divergence (∇⋅), and the curl (∇×).  The last of these uses the cross product and thus makes sense only in three dimensions; the first two are fully general.  They were all originally studied in the context of the classical theory of electromagnetism, and contemporary university physics curricula typically treat the material using approximately the concepts and notation found in Gibbs and Wilson's Vector Analysis.
