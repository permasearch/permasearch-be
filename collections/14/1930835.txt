Nader often openly expressed his hope for Bush's victory over Gore, saying it "would mobilize us",[45] and that environmental and consumer regulatory agencies would fare better under Bush than Gore.[46] When asked which of the two he'd vote for if forced, Nader answered "Bush… If you want the parties to diverge from one another, have Bush win."[47] As to whether he would feel regret if he caused Gore's defeat, Nader replied "I would not — not at all. I’d rather have a provocateur than an anesthetizer in the White House."[48] On another occasion, Nader answered this question with: "No, not at all… There may be a cold shower for four years that would help the Democratic Party… It doesn’t matter who is in the White House."[46]
