While there is an identifiable mainstream within the Churches of Christ, there are also significant variations within the fellowship.[10]:212[21]:213[52]:31,32[53]:4[54]:1,2 The approach taken to restoring the New Testament church has focused on "methods and procedures" such as church organization, the form of worship, and how the church should function. As a result, most divisions among Churches of Christ have been the result of "methodological" disputes. These are meaningful to members of this movement because of the seriousness with which they take the goal of "restoring the form and structure of the primitive church".[10]:212
