In 1923, an employee of Williamson, John Glossinger, announced that he was going to make the Oh Henry! bar a national best seller.[citation needed] Company officials said that it was impossible and denied him the funds for an advertising campaign. Glossinger went into the streets and pasted stickers onto automobile bumpers saying merely "Oh Henry!" People became curious as to what an Oh Henry! was, and sales for the candy rose quickly.
