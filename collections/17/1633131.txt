Scipio Africanus had two sons. The elder Publius Cornelius Scipio was appointed an augur in 180 BC;[22] he never ran for office due to poor health.[23] The younger Lucius Cornelius Scipio became praetor in 174 BC,[24] and was expelled from the Senate by the censors.[25] The elder son Publius adopted his first cousin, his uncle Lucius Aemilius Paullus' second son, who received the name Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus.
