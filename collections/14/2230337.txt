Reviews for "Won't Go Home Without You" have been generally positive, although some were mixed. Robert Christgau gave a positive review on the album as well as the song, saying "The devilishly memorable "Won't Go Home Without You" combines confidence with affection rather than macho." Channel 4 called the song "[the] musical equivalent of a dog's fart at the dinner table" and gave it just one star out of a possible ten.[3] Digital Spy gave the song two stars out of five, calling the song's lyrics "as cold, functional and ruthlessly effective as a state-of-the-art refrigerator".[4]
