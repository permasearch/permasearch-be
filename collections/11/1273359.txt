The Inspiron 530s has the same design as the 530, but it is 41% slimmer. However, because of its design, it is not physically compatible with all desktop hardware, especially graphics cards (Dell only gives you the option of the ATI 2400 XT, which is not a high performance card). The case used in the 530s can accommodate one 5.25" optical drive, one external 3.5" drive (either a 1.44Â MB floppy or 19-in-1 card reader), and up to two standard 3.5" hard drives. The motherboard used in the 530s is the same as the motherboard used in the 530 edition, except for the fact that this motherboard only supports Dual Core processors, and not any members of the Standard Quad Core series like its twin,unless the motherboard is swapped to the DG33M03 motherboard used in the Inspiron 530,or a 65W TDP Core 2 Quad. While almost any low profile PCI-E x16 video card will physically fit in the 530s, the custom sized Delta 250W power supply that the 530s is equipped with may seriously limit the potential for using higher end cards,except if it is used in a different Standard ATX Case (Mid Tower and Full tower),then it is as capable as a 530 is (With the exception of the Case features in the standard 530).
