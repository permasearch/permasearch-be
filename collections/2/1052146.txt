In 1962, Blanche (Joan Crawford) and Jane (Bette Davis) are living together in Blanche's mansion, purchased with Blanche's movie earnings. Blanche now uses a wheelchair. By now, Jane has become a heavy alcoholic, mentally ill and treats Blanche with cruelty to punish her for stealing her spotlight.  Later, when Blanche informs Jane she will be selling the house, Jane's mental health begins to deteriorate further. During an argument, she removes the telephone from Blanche's bedroom, cutting Blanche off from the outside world. Later, Jane begins denying Blanche food, until she serves Blanche her dead parakeet on a platterâ€”and, at a later meal, a rat that she killed in the cellar.
