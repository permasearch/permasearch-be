Epilepsy occurs in a number of other animals including dogs and cats and is the most common brain disorder in dogs.[158] It is typically treated with anticonvulsants such as phenobarbital or bromide in dogs and phenobarbital in cats.[159] Imepitoin is also used in dogs.[160] While generalized seizures in horses are fairly easy to diagnose, it may be more difficult in non-generalized seizures and EEGs may be useful.[161]
