Billy Dukes of country music blog Taste of Country praised both singers' vocal performances as well as the equability of the duet, writing that "too often country duets leave one wanting more from the featured artist... but thatâ€™s not the case here." He described the song as "relatable, memorable and unforgettable."[6] Jon Freeman of Country Weekly similarly complimented the vocal pairing and declared the song a "clear standout" on the album.[12]
