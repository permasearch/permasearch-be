Amylose and amylopectin are both components of starch and polysaccharides made from D-glucose units. The big difference between the two is that amylose is linear because it only has αlpha-1,4-glycosidic bonds. Amylopectin on the other hand, is a branched polysaccharide because it has αlpha-1,4-glycosidic bonds with occasional αlpha-1,6-glycosidic bonds[23] approximately every 22 D-glucose units.[24] Glutinous rice is nearly 100%[25] composed of amylopectin (one of the two components that makes up starch) and almost completely lacks its counterpart, amylose, in its starch granules. A non-glutinous rice grain contains amylose at about 10-30% weight by weight and amylopectin at about 70-90% weight by weight.[23]
