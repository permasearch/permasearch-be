As 0870 numbers had been adopted on a large scale by public services, healthcare providers, banks, utilities and other companies, the relatively high cost of calling such numbers became a matter of public concern. By 2004,[55] the website saynoto0870.com had been established to help callers find alternative contact numbers for companies, and in 2005 BT suggested scrapping 0845 and 0870 numbers entirely.[56] BT believed the public were being misled about their call prices from other operators and Ofcom proposed removing revenue share from 0870 numbers and capping prices at less than "national rate"[57] - but such changes were delayed by several years.
