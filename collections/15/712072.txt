One week after the unveiling, Tesla said it had over 325,000 reservations.[12] Musk said that 5% of reservations correspond to the maximum of two vehicles allowed per customer, "suggesting low levels of speculation",[66] and that 93% of Model 3 reservations are from new buyers who do not currently own a Tesla.[49] The previous record for advance deposits on a car was the 1955 CitroÃ«n DS that had 80,000 deposits during the ten days of the Paris Auto Show, while the Model 3 had 232,000 reservations in two days.[11]
