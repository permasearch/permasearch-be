Fairfax County has multiple public transportation services, including the Washington Metro's Orange, Blue, Yellow, and Silver lines. The Silver line, which runs through the Tysons Corner and Reston areas of the county, opened in 2014 as the first new Washington Metro line since the Green Line opened in 1991.[67]
