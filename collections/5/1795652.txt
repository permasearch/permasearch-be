Different versions of the main characters inhabit other realities and dimensions. Other Ricks are mostly similar to the "main" Rick, though some have unique features which set them apart. Most other Mortys seen in the show are far more timid and weak-willed than the main Morty, an exception being "Evil Morty". They are all voiced by the same actors who voice the main versions of them.
