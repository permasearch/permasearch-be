SURF has later been shown to have similar performance to SIFT, while at the same time being much faster.[27] Other studies conclude that when speed is not critical, SIFT outperforms SURF.[12][28] Specifically, disregarding discretization effects the pure image descriptor in SIFT is significantly better than the pure image descriptor in SURF, whereas the scale-space extrema of the determinant of the Hessian underlying the pure interest point detector in SURF constitute significantly better interest points compared to the scale-space extrema of the Laplacian to which the interest point detector in SIFT constitutes a numerical approximation.[12]
