Gans studied turnout and voting patterns for more than three decades.[2] He co-founded and was director of the Center for the Study of the American Electorate, formerly housed at American University in Washington, D. C.[3] Gans was commonly sought out by major American publications as an expert on voting patterns and was sometimes called on by the US State Department's Foreign Press Center to brief foreign reporters during the runup to American elections.[4][5]
