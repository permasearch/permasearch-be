Between 1947 and 1951 each of the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations created its own national citizenship (the Irish Free State had done so in 1935, but was excluded from the Commonwealth in 1949 because it declared itself a republic). In 1948, the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the British Nationality Act 1948, which came into effect on 1 January 1949 and introduced the concept of Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies. The Canadian Citizenship Act 1946 came into effect on 1 January 1947. The Australian Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948 came into force on 26 January 1949. In all cases, the national citizenship co-existed with the continuing status of British subject.
