In 2011, Oprah Winfrey ended her talk show after a successful 25-year run. In order to fill the void, WEWS put The Dr. Oz Show (an Oprah spin-off), which was airing at 10 a.m., in the 4 p.m. time slot.[23] This left the 10 a.m. time slot open, which was eventually filled by the new Scripps-produced viral video program Right This Minute.
