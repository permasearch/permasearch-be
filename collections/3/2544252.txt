Micronutrients are consumed in smaller quantities and are present in plant tissue on the order of parts-per-million (ppm), ranging from 0.15 to 400 ppm DM, or less than 0.04% DM.[3][4]  These elements are often present at the active sites of enzymes that carry out the plant's metabolism.  Because these elements enable catalysts (enzymes) their impact far exceeds their weight percentage.
