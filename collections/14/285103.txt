From 1946 until his death, Stalin only gave three public speeches, two of which lasted only a few minutes.[628] The amount of written material that he produced also declined.[628] In 1950, Stalin issued the article "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics", which reflected his interest in questions of Russian nationhood.[629] In 1952, Stalin's last book, The Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR, was published. It sought to provide a guide to leading the country for after his death.[630] In October 1952, Stalin gave an hour and a half speech at the Central Committee plenum.[631] There, he emphasised what he regarded as leadership qualities necessary in the future and highlighted the weaknesses of various potential successors, particularly Molotov and Mikoyan.[632] In 1952, he also eliminated the Politburo and replaced it with a larger version which he called the Presidium.[633]
