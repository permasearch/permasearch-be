To date there isn't a technology based solution for iPhones. This is due to the application security sandbox approach Apple has implemented on the iOS operating system. An iPhone app does not have access to low level device interfaces, as a result an iPhone app cannot block or auto respond to a text message while a person is driving. However the SafeTexting Campaign has developed an iPhone app that detects if a person is driving and reminds them not to text and drive.[146]
