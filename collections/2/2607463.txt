Most soldering irons for electronics have interchangeable tips, also known as bits, that vary in size and shape for different types of work.[2] Pyramid tips with a triangular flat face and chisel tips with a wide flat face are useful for soldering sheet metal. Fine conical or tapered chisel tips are typically used for electronics work. Tips may be straight or have a bend. Concave or wicking tips with a chisel face with a concave well in the flat face to hold a small amount of solder are available.[5][6] Tip selection depends upon the type of work and access to the joint; soldering of 0.5mm pitch surface-mount ICs, for example, is quite different from soldering a through-hole connection to a large area. A concave tip well is said to help prevent bridging of closely spaced leads; different shapes are recommended to correct bridging that has occurred.[7] Due to patent restrictions not all manufacturers offer concave tips everywhere; in particular there are restrictions in the USA.[7]
