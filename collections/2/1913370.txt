The continuation of Eucharistic adoration is encouraged, but if continued after midnight should be done without outward solemnity.[25][26] In the Philippines and several other Catholic countries, the faithful will travel from church to church praying at each church's altar of repose in a practice known as Seven Churches Visitation or Visita Iglesia. The Blessed Sacrament remains in the temporary place until the Holy Communion part of the Good Friday liturgical service.
