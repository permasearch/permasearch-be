In March 2012, the character was rapidly aged, with Blake Hood cast to portray Kyle as an adult.[12][13][14][15] He was previously known for his role of Mark Driscott on The CW's 90210.[16] Hood debuted on April 27, 2012.[17][18] Hood was surprised at how fast the process of soap operas where, and also credited Peter Bergman (who plays his on-screen father, Jack) as being very "gracious" and kind to him, lending experience.[19] In March 2013, after a year in the role, Hood was let go and replaced with Hartley Sawyer.[20] The soap opera had issued a casting call for a character named "Connor Boyd" in January and, due to the character sounding very much like Kyle, Sawyer's casting was kept quiet.[21] Casting directors used a scene previously been performed by Noah Newman to recast the character.[22] Hood stated his ouster and replacement came as a shock to him.[22] Sawyer made his debut on April 24, 2013.[21]
