In 2000, when Netflix had just about 300,000 subscribers and relied on the U.S. Postal Service for the delivery of their DVDs, they were losing money and offered to be acquired by Blockbuster for $50 million. They proposed that Netflix, which would rename themselves Blockbuster, would handle the online business, while Blockbuster should take care of the DVDs, making them less dependent on U.S. Postal Service. But the offer was declined.[32][33]
