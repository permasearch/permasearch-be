The Mystery Spot is a visual illusionâ€“based tourist attraction near Santa Cruz, California, opened in 1939 by George Prather. [1] Visitors experience demonstrations that appear to defy gravity, on the short but steep uphill walk and inside a wooden building on the site. The Mystery Spot is a popular tourist attraction, and gained recognition as a roadside "gravity box" or "tilted house" illusion.[2] At this roadside attraction, the laws of gravity and physics seem to disappear as balls roll uphill and people lean over past their toes without tumbling over.[3]
