The Institute offers a four-year Doctoral programme, a two-year joint MA degree in Public Policy,[10] a 15.5-month MA in Development Studies with various Majors and postgraduate diploma programmes. The four-year Doctoral programme leads to an international recognised degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Development Studies. Within the Netherlands, ISS participates in the national doctoral research school CERES,[11] and within the Erasmus University in the Erasmus Graduate School of Social Sciences and the Humanities [12] With a strong focus on training in the theory and methods relevant to development studies, the MA Programme aims to equip graduates to apply new insights in policy analysis in a practical context, leading to a master's degree in Development Studies.[13] The ISS MA Degree in Development Studies is widely recognized, accredited by the Netherlands Flemish accreditation organisation NVAO and provides eligibility for entry to PhD programmes in the Netherlands and other countries worldwide. In 2010 the ISS Masters Programme received the 'internationalization as a distinctive quality feature' accreditation from the NVAO. Postgraduate diploma programmes are also offered catering to the needs of young and mid-career professionals who wish to deepen their knowledge in a particular field related to their research or occupation.[14] ISS also offers various joint programmes with academic partners all over the world. In some programmes students take part of the programme elsewhere and part of the programme at ISS in The Hague. In other programmes ISS staff travel to the partner institute for contribute to teaching. ISS admits a limited number of auditors who wish to attend only some of the courses in the MA Programme. In addition, for Dutch residents, a more flexible arrangement of the MA programme can be requested, spreading the programme over a longer period [15] All degrees are recognised internationally and by Dutch legislation on higher education.
