Team challenge: A group of Bollywood dancers performed for the teams. Then Chef Ramsay announced that today's theme would be Indian cuisine. Each team was presented with a tablet showing a list of four main ingredients next to a 15 puzzle showing fifteen other ingredients and an empty space. Roe and Aaron were selected by their teams to rearrange their puzzles to produce a desired list of ingredients for each main ingredient. To fill in the empty space, the chef who was assigned that main ingredient was able to select their choice from a given list of ingredients. The teams had 30 minutes to work, then presented their dishes to Ramsay and a guest judge, who gave the teams equal overall scores. To break the tie, they determined the single dish which had scored the highest. That dish was prepared by Jennifer, thereby giving the win to the red team.
