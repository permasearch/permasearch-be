The Crustodian (voiced by Rob Paulsen) is a machine built by the Underminer to lead his Giant Robot Factory in manufacturing the 100 giant robots known as the Gilgenbots. He is one of the bosses in the game. He appears to be a glass jar filled with pulsating energy, attached to a giant machine known as a Warkerbot.
