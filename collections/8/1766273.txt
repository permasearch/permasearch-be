The 16th Earl's only son died in infancy;[6] this does not fit with legend as it happened before John Talbot became Earl of Shrewsbury, and was not caused by a horse riding incident. The 16th Earl had 2 daughters, the youngest, Lady Gwendoline Catherine Talbot, died in 1840 aged only 22.[5] This fits with the legend's date range, but her death was not mysterious: she died of Scarlet fever in Rome.[5] Also 3 of Gwendoline's children died of measles shortly after their mother,[5] meaning the Earl had 4 deaths in his close family, not the single one described in the legend.
