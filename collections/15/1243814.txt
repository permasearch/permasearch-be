In 2014, it was reported that Good Kid, M.A.A.D City was being studied as a text in the freshman composition class of Georgia Regents University professor Adam Diehl, alongside other coming of age works such as the James Joyce novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Gwendolyn Brooks' Selected Poems, James Baldwin's short story Going to Meet the Man, and the John Singleton film Boyz n the Hood. The theme of the class was meant to "inspire students to find an outlet to bring some sanity to our own mad cityâ€“Augusta", Diehl told HipHopDX. "Lamar is the James Joyce of hip-hop", he said, "in the complexity of his storytelling, in his knowledge of the canon, and in his continuing focus on the city of his upbringing - Compton."[65]
