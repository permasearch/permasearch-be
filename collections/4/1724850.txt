That night, as Boycie and Abdul wait in the trailer of an unsuspecting Denzil's lorry in a car park, Del and Rodney arrive in the Trotter van. With Rodney standing watch, Del enters the trailer and receives the diamond payment briefcase from Boycie to take with him to Amsterdam. Boycie and Abdul leave, and Slater shows up, having received a call from a nearby resident. Del prepares to exit until he sees Slater searching the area, and hides under a tarpaulin at the far end of the trailer. He is not spotted, but Slater inadvertently locks him in the trailer, before Denzil arrives and drives off. In desperation, Rodney sets off in pursuit, eventually following Denzil to Hull. Back at the station, Slater orders that a watch be placed on Boycie and Abdul's movements, and has a discussion with Hoskins about the possible courier, with Slater mentioning that the Trotters have not been seen for a few days. Despite laughing off Hoskins' suggestion that the Trotters could be the couriers, Slater mentions that Del is more intelligent than he lets on and would know the ins and outs of the world.
