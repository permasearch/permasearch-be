Milk chugging, or the gallon challenge, is the process of consuming a large amount of milk within a set period of time. Although there are variations in procedure, the general parameters are that a person is given 60 minutes to drink one US gallon (3.8 l; 0.8 imp gal) of whole milk without vomiting. A gallon milk jug is a common size of milk container in the United States.
