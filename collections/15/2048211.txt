The Maid-Rite Sandwich Shop in Springfield still operates what it claims as the first U.S. drive-thru window.[67] The city is also known for its chili, or "chilli", as it is known in many chili shops throughout Sangamon County.[68] The unique spelling is said to have begun with the founder of the Dew Chilli Parlor in 1909, due to a spelling error in its sign.[69] Another interpretation is that the misspelling represented the "Ill" in the word Illinois.[69] In 1993, the Illinois state legislature adopted a resolution proclaiming Springfield the "Chilli Capital of the Civilized World."[68]
