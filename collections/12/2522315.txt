The genetic history of Europe has mostly been reconstructed from the modern populations of Europe, assuming genetic continuity.[when?] This is because it is far easier to retrieve DNA from living subjects than ancient human remains. However, a growing number of ancient mtDNA and Y-DNA analyses are available from both the historical and prehistoric periods. 2015 saw an exponential rise in the number of ancient DNA samples available.[37] From September 2014 to November 2015, the number of samples available went from 10 to 230.[37]
