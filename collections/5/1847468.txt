The 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries and caucuses between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders was largely a fight along ideological lines between the two. Hillary Clinton who referred to herself as a "progressive who gets things done", received substantial support from African Americans, older Americans, women, LGBT Americans, Latino Americans, and Jewish Americans; while Sanders, a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, received an overwhelming majority of support from millennials across the board. During the general election, Clinton campaigned to appeal to moderate Republicans, due to their rejection of the Republican candidate Donald Trump, backed by the ultra-conservative Alt-Right movement. One key area that Clinton ran to the left of Sanders on was gun control, with Clinton having a staunchly pro-gun control voting record in Congress while Sanders has been in favor of gun control but has not always voted for pro-gun control positions.
