In 1993, GÃ¼nter Dreyer discovered a "year label" of Narmer at Abydos, depicting the same event that is depicted on the Narmer Palette. In the First Dynasty, years were identified by the name of the king and an important event that occurred in that year. A "year label" was typically attached to a container of goods and included the name of the king, a description or representation of the event that identified the year, and a description of the attached goods. This year label shows that the Narmer Palette depicts an actual historical event.[29] Support for this conclusion (in addition to Dreyer) includes Wilkinson[30] and Davies & Friedman.[31] Although this interpretation of the year label is the dominant opinion among Egyptologists, there are exceptions including Baines[32] and Wengrow.[33]
