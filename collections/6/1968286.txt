Crouch signed a professional contract with Tottenham Hotspur on 2 July 1998, after having played for their youth team.[10] However, he did not make any appearances for their first team and was loaned out to other clubs, having brief spells at Dulwich Hamlet in the Isthmian League Premier Division and, in the summer of 2000, IFK Hässleholm in Sweden, where he played in the local fourth-highest division.[11] His move to Sweden came about when IFK Hässleholm sold Jon Jönsson to Tottenham for £70,000 and also agreed two loan deals for the Swedish club, that of Crouch and Alton Thelwell.[12]
