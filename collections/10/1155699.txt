A more obvious external change was the fitting of large crane-like davits, each powered by an electric motor and capable of launching six lifeboats which were housed in gantries; the ship was originally designed to have eight sets of gantry davits but only five were actually installed before she entered war service, with the difference being made up with boats launched by manually-operated Welin-type davits as on Titanic and Olympic.[6][7]
