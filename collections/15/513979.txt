There were varying regional traditions or 'schools' within Confucianism assigned to certain texts.[189] The two which caused most debate were New Texts and Old Texts traditions. The former represented works transmitted orally after the Qin book burning of 213 BCE, and the latter was newly discovered texts alleged by Kong Anguo, Liu Xin, and others to have been excavated from the walls of Kongzi's home, displayed archaic written characters, and thus were more authentic versions.[190] Although initially rejected, the Old Texts found acceptance at the courts of Emperor Ping (r. 1 BCE â€“ 5 CE) and Wang Mang, were rejected by Emperor Guangwu, and accepted once more by Emperor Zhang only to be rejected a third time by the following rulers.[191]
