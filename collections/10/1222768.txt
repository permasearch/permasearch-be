The fifth, Miss New York class—consisting of Miss New York, Gold Star Mother, and Mary Murray—was delivered in 1938.[224][251] They had the same width, length, and draft as Knickerbocker, with a gross tonnage of 2,126.[253] Gold Star Mother was decommissioned in 1969, to save money,[254][255] before being auctioned off in 1974.[254] Gold Star Mother's sister Mary Murray was retired in 1974 and sold at auction.[256] From 1982 through the mid-2000s,[257] it then sat as a floating wreck on the Raritan River, within view of the New Jersey Turnpike,[231] and was partially broken up for scrap in 2008.[258] The third sister ship, Miss New York, was decommissioned in 1975 and auctioned.[259] Miss New York was used as a restaurant for a while, but then sank.[227]
