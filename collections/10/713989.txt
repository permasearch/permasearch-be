In the Robert Rankin stories Hugo Rune, and others, are credited as practitioners of Dimac, described as the deadliest martial art known to man, described as being capable of disfiguring and dismembering the opponent with the slightest touch, or condemning the victim "to forever walk sideways in the manner of a crab". Rune himself claims to have been taught by Count Dante, and the character of Archroy later becomes a Dimac master himself, although he is initially prevented from taking revenge on Omalley as he was not provided with the book on defensive strategy.
