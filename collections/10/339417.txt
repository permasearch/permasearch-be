As everyone is recovering, they see a German bomb approaching the site. Jack returns to the Chula warship and uses it to tether the bomb and steer it away from Earth. The Doctor orders everyone to flee the area, setting the Chula medical ship to self-destruct to destroy the technical parts without changing the timeline. The Doctor proudly boasts that "everyone lives" as he and Rose return to the TARDIS, but learn that Jack is unable to stop the bomb or leave the ship, and is preparing to sacrifice himself. As Jack comes to terms, he discovers the TARDIS has materialized aboard his ship, and he joins the Doctor and Rose aboard it as they dance together in celebration.
