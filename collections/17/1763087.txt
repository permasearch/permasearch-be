According to author Charles Edward Banks, the Mayflower had fourteen officers consisting of the master, four mates, four quartermasters, surgeon, carpenter, cooper, cook, boatswain, gunner and about thirty-six men before the mast, making a total of fifty. Other authors in more recent times estimate a crew of about thirty. The entire crew stayed with the Mayflower in Plymouth through the winter of 1620â€“21. During that time, about half of the crew died. The crewmen that survived returned on the Mayflower which sailed for London on April 5, 1621.[38][39][40][41][42]
