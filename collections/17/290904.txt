In many North Indian communities such as Brahmins, Rajputs, Vaishyas, Jats, Yadavs, etc., everyone who is immediately associated with four surnames; own surname (that is father's surname), mother's maiden surname, paternal grandmother's maiden surname, maternal grandmother's maiden surname. These surnames are known as the candidate's gotra (lit. branch). Any two candidates who want to marry cannot have the common gotra. The marriage is allowed only when all these shakha are different for both the candidates. This automatically rules out closer cousin marriages. Cousin marriage is discouraged in the Telugu Brahmins in Andhra Pradesh, such as Gauda and Dravida Brahmins.
