Daniel Martinez claimed in a 1998 article in Experimental Gerontology that Hydra are biologically immortal.[11]  This publication has been widely cited as evidence that Hydra do not senesce (do not age), and that they are proof of the existence of non-senescing organisms generally. In 2010 Preston Estep published (also in Experimental Gerontology) a letter to the editor arguing that the Martinez data refute the hypothesis that Hydra do not senesce.[12]
