Ionising radiation occurs naturally but can also be artificially created.  Generally people can be exposed to radiation externally from radioactive material or internally by inhaling or ingesting radioactive substances.[11]  Exposure to electromagnetic rays such as x-rays and gamma rays can, depending on the time exposed, cause sterility, genetic defects, premature ageing and death.[12]
