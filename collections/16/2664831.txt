The albino red-fin shark or albino rainbow sharkminnow is a variety of rainbow shark with a white body and red/orange fins.[3][5][6] It closely resembles "normal" rainbow sharks in temperament and appearance, thus they share the same common names in the aquarium industry.[7] These have sometimes been referred to as E. munense, but that is a separate species that rarely enters the aquarium trade.[2][8][9] The rainbow shark is also one of the types of genetically modified, fluorescent fish known as GloFish.
