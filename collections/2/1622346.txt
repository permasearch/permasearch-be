The first player, who controls Mario, navigates the world map and selects stages.[33] Players return to the map screen if they all die before anybody respawns in the stage. If all players run out of lives and get a game over, they must use a "Continue" and restart over from their last save point with five lives left.[34] If a player dies, they re-emerge in the level encased in a bubble. They can resume play when another player breaks the bubble. A player can break the bubble by touching it, or by hitting it with a fireball, ice ball or Koopa shell.[9] Players can also voluntarily encase themselves inside the bubble by pressing the A button while a more skilled player traverses a difficult segment.[27] If every character in a co-op session enters a bubble at the same time (whether through death or by pressing the A button), they will lose the level and must restart.[32]
