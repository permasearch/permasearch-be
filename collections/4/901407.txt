The Bayeux tapestry is embroidered in crewel (wool yarn) on a tabby-woven linen ground 68.38 metres long and 0.5 metres wide (224.3 ft × 1.6 ft) and using two methods of stitching: outline or stem stitch for lettering and the outlines of figures, and couching or laid work for filling in figures.[10][11] Nine linen panels, between fourteen and three metres in length, were sewn together after each was embroidered and the joins were disguised with subsequent embroidery.[21] At the first join (start of scene 14) the borders do not line up properly but the technique was improved so that the later joins are practically invisible.[21] The design involved a broad central zone with narrow decorative borders top and bottom.[21] By inspecting the woollen threads behind the linen it is apparent all these aspects were embroidered together at a session and the awkward placing of the tituli is not due to them being added later.[21] Later generations have patched the hanging in numerous places and some of the embroidery (especially in the final scene) has been reworked.[21] The tapestry may well have maintained much of its original appearance—it now compares closely with a careful drawing made in 1730.[21]
