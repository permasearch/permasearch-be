Rarely, small amounts of air are sucked into the vein as a result of the negative Intra-thoracic pressure and insertion technique. Valved insertion devices can reduce this risk.[citation needed] An air embolism is the result of air bubbles obstructing a blood vessel. Air embolisms are a very infrequent complication related to central venous catheter removal. The threat of air embolism is minimized by proper CVC removal with Trendelenburg positioning.[20]
