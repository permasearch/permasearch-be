Heading into the 1990 season, the winner of the USC-Washington game had gone to the Rose Bowl in 10 of the previous 13 seasons. The 1990 match would continue that trend. Washington's All-Centennial team was introduced at halftime of the game, while two members of the historic team, Hugh McElhenny and Nesby Glasgow, delivered inspirational talks to the current players. On a bright, sunny day with the temperature reaching 92 degrees Fahrenheit, the crowd of 72,617 witnessed one of the most memorable games in program history.
