The best bet is to change the plot summary to state "the camera then slowly pans up to Eli's eyes" or something to that effect and leave it at that. A separate section can be included on reviewers' interpretations of the twist. So long as the section continues to use sources and avoid original research, it can be included. Leave the plot section to what is seen on screen and interpretations and themes to their own sections. This will hopefully prevent future back-and-forth edits on the plot section. Without sources about the twist, direct editors and IPs to IMDB message boards if they want to discuss it. --Happy editing! Nehrams2020 (talk â€¢ contrib) 04:22, 30 June 2010 (UTC)
