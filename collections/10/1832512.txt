An official, but non-binding, federal referendum on prohibition was held in 1898, with 51.3% voting for prohibition and 48.7% against, on a voter turnout of 44%. Prohibition had a majority in all provinces except Quebec, where a strong 81.2% voted against it. Despite this national electoral majority, Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier's government chose not to introduce a federal bill on prohibition, mindful of not only the strong antipathy in Quebec but that the majority in favour of Prohibition was so slight and turn-out so low that the government did not think it right to adopt the measure. As a result, Canadian prohibition was instead enacted through individual sets of laws passed by the provinces during the first twenty years of the 20th century.
