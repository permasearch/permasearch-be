Hayden Library is on Cady Mall in the center of the Tempe campus.[172] It opened in 1966 and is the largest library facility at ASU.[167] An expansion in 1989 created the subterranean entrance underneath Hayden Lawn and is attached to the above-ground portion of the original library. There are two floors underneath Hayden Lawn with a landmark known as the "Beacon of Knowledge" rising from the center. The underground library lights the beacon at night.
