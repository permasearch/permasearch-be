Nitrogen gas (N2) at concentrations of 98% or higher is also used effectively to kill insects in the grain through hypoxia.[18] However, carbon dioxide has an advantage in this respect, as it kills organisms through hypercarbia and hypoxia (depending on concentration), but it requires concentrations of above 35%,[19] or so. This makes carbon dioxide preferable for fumigation in situations where a hermetic seal cannot be maintained.
