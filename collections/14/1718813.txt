On April 22, 2007, a woman named Marcia Diana Valentine was found lying outside James and Bullock's home in Orange County, California. When James confronted the woman, she ran to her car, got behind the wheel, and tried to run over him. She was said to be an obsessed fan of Bullock.[125] Valentine was charged with one felony count each of aggravated assault and stalking. Bullock obtained a restraining order to bar Valentine from "contacting or coming near her home, family or work for three years".[126][127] Valentine pleaded not guilty to charges of aggravated assault and stalking.[128] She was subsequently convicted of stalking and sentenced to three years' probation.[129]
