Some coupés are "simply line-extenders two-door variants of family sedans", while others have significant differences to their four-door counterparts.[44] The AMC Matador coupé (1974-1978), had a distinct design and styling, sharing almost nothing with the 4-door versions.[45] Similarly, the Chrysler Sebring and Dodge Stratus coupés and sedans (late-1990 through 2000s), had little in common except their names, with the coupés engineered by Mitsubishi and built in Illinois, while the sedans were developed by Chrysler and built in Michigan.[46]
