Upwards of 8 in (20 cm) of snow fell across Georgia, with the highest totals confined to northern parts of the state. High winds downed trees and power lines, leaving approximately 66,000 people without power across the state.[93] A postal worker was killed when strong winds blew a large branch off a tree, crushing him in his car.[49] Snow fell as far south as Mobile, Alabama,[113] with additional flurries extending into Jacksonville and Gainesville along the Florida Panhandle late on January 22. Temperatures in Gainesville fell to 28 °F (−2 °C).[114]
