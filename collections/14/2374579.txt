A pure soul or Nafse Zakeyyah is one of the descendants of Husayn ibn Ali.[2][12] He will be murdered and is without any sin or crime.[1] According to many narrations, he is the envoy of Muhammad al-Mahdi to Mecca before his reappearance. When he will arrive to Mecca and say his message, the people of Mecca slay him around the Kaaba.[6]
