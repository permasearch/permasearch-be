Following Kelsey and Loveita's evictions, the HouseGuests hoped to take control in the Blast From the Past Head of Household competition. In this competition, HouseGuests were asked questions based on items contained in a time capsule given to the HouseGuests. The HouseGuest with the most points will be the new Head of Household. Tim was the winner. On Day 29, HouseGuests were given the task to play "Big Brother Says". HouseGuests must perform all tasks Big Brother gives them. The HouseGuests passed their task and earned a pizza party. Tim chose to hold a house meeting and revealed that his nominations would be based on a HouseGuests vote with the voting rules being adopted from his season of Big Brother Australia. Each HG had 5 nomination points (represented by Gummy Koalas from his HoH box) to give to 2 HouseGuests. Most of the HouseGuest voted according to Tim's rules but Dallas chose not to participate, leading to Dallas himself getting 5 Koala as a penalty. On Day 29, Tim nominated Dallas (who has received 30 Koalas) and Ramsey (who received 9 Koalas) for eviction. On Day 30, Tim, Dallas, and Ramsey chose Cassandra, Jared, and Mitch to play in the End of the Rainbow Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests had to roll their ball past the obstacles and up and over their rainbow and catch it on the other side. If a HouseGuest drops their ball, their counter will drop to zero. The first HouseGuest to roll their ball 300 times without dropping it will win the Power of Veto. Ramsey won the Power of Veto. On Day 32, Ramsey took himself off the block, and Tim named Maddy as the replacement nominee. On Day 33, Emmett surprised Kelsey and Loveita to give them the secret task to hide black and white poker chips throughout the House. The HouseGuests were then split into team to find their team's poker chips in ten minutes. The team who finds more poker chips will receive a reward, and the losing team will receive a punishment. The white team of Ramsey, Nick & Phil, Joel, Cassandra, and Raul won and received a cocktail party with Emmett and Tim. The black team of Dallas, Jared, Maddy, Mitch, and Nikki lost and were forced to clean the House. Despite Dallas receiving the most votes on the gummy koala poll, Tim changed his target to Maddy, hatching a plan to use his tie breaking vote to backdoor her. On Day 35, however, neither Nikki nor Ramsey sided with Tim, and as a result, Dallas was evicted by a 5-3 vote, with Cassandra, Joel, and Nick & Phil voting to evict Maddy.
