Rogue One received generally positive reviews, with praise for its acting, action sequences and darker tone, but was criticized for the lack of character development and the film's use of computer-generated imagery to recreate the likenesses of some actors. The film has grossed over $1 billion worldwide, making it the 22nd highest-grossing film of all time unadjusted for inflation, the second highest-grossing film of 2016, and the second highest-grossing film in the Star Wars franchise. It received two Academy Awards nominations for Best Sound Mixing and Best Visual Effects.[4]
