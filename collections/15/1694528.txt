Madec plans to report that Ben went mad, shot the prospector, and wandered off into the barren horizon alone. Madec is certain Ben cannot survive, as they are in a hot desert 45 miles from the nearest town, but just to make sure, he watches Ben from a distance, using the scope on his rifle. Ben finds enough water to survive until Madec shoots the barrel containing it. Trekking on, Ben hides in the semi-subterranean lair of the shot prospector Charlie whom he'd befriended in life, but Madec blows it up with the prospector's dynamite stash, although Ben manages to escape before it explodes with the 'treasure map' of Charlie, whom Ben vows will not die without justice.
