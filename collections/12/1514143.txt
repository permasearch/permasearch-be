Philip Johnson, who had first taken his inspiration from Le Corbusier,  also began to look beyond modernism for something new.  His AT&T Building (now 550 Madison Avenue) in New York, a modernist office tower with a neoclassical Chippendale pediment on top, like a piece of 18th century furniture, became an icon of post-modernism. Charles Moore created the exuberant Piazza d'Italia in New Orleans, Louisiana, a public square filled with recreated pieces of Italian renaissance architecture.
