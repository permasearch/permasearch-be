According to a 2007 article in Forbes magazine, Letterman earned US$40 million a year.[86] A 2009 article in The New York Times, however, said his salary was estimated at US$32 million per year.[87] In June 2009, Letterman's Worldwide Pants and CBS reached agreement to continue the Late Show until at least August 2012. The previous contract had been set to expire in 2010, and the two-year extension is shorter than the typical three-year contract period negotiated in the past.[87] Worldwide Pants agreed to lower its fee for the show, though it had remained a "solid moneymaker for CBS" under the previous contract.[87]
