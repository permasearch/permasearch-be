The designers go international! For the first time ever in Project Runway history, the designers retire sketching at 1407 for a day of sketching in Paris at the Eiffel tower! The designers also get a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to tour the Valentino atelier and showrooms, and are also invited to a private preview of Valentino's Couture show by creative directors Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pier Paolo Piccioli. With all of their newly acquired Parisian knowledge, the designers return to NYC to design a couture gown of their own that will hopefully secure their spot in the finale!
