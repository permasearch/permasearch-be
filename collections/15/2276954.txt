India is an agrarian country with around 70%  of its people depending directly or indirectly upon agriculture. Farmer suicides account for 11.2% of all suicides in India.[3] Activists and scholars have offered a number of conflicting reasons for farmer suicides, such as monsoon failure, high debt burdens, government policies, public mental health, personal issues and family problems.[4][5][6] There are also accusation of states manipulating the data on farmer suicides.[7]
