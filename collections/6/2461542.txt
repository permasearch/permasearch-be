The next decade ushered a cordial relationship between China and its maritime neighbours including the Philippines until 2011, when tensions have risen again after consecutive incidents occurred in the disputed territories. In 2012, a Philippine surveillance aircraft identify Chinese fishing vessels at the-then Philippine-controlled Scarborough Shoal, causing the Philippine Navy to deploy BRP Gregorio Del Pilar to the area. In response, China sends surveillance ships to warn the Navy to leave the area, claimed by both countries, prompting a standoff. The two nations eventually agreed to withdrew their deployed vessels as the arrival of the typhoon season draws near. [26] [27]
