This was the first episode of Black Mirror directed by a woman, Jodie Foster.[7] Foster was in control of casting the episode leading to the casting of her friend Rosemarie DeWitt as Marie, as the pair had met through Foster's wife Alexandra Hedison; this was only the second time Foster had worked with a friend as a director, after Mel Gibson in 2011 film The Beaver.[7] According to Brooker, Foster was chosen for the episode because as a former child actor, she would understand what it was like to grow up in the spotlight, as well as how to deal with the child actors during filming.[8][9] Netflix had also recommended Foster to Brooker, since she had previously directed episodes of their series Orange is the New Black and House of Cards; she provided a good amount of "grounded" feedback on the script prior to shooting, according to Brooker.[9] Foster also flew to London to help with the episode's editing alongside Brooker.[9]
