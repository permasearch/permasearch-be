Willandra Lakes is located in south-western New South Wales.  The lakes system, a remnant of the Lachlan River drainage pattern, is approximately 150 km long by 40 km wide and runs generally in a north-south direction from Lake Mulurulu in the north to Lake Pringle in the south. The approximate area is 600,000 hectares.  Parallel to the eastern shores, white sand and clay dunes rise 40 metres above the plain, while deep gullies have been cut through the lake shore deposits.  The landscape surrounding the system is one of low, parallel ridges of fine red sand.[4]
