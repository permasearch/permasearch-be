Nissan states the GT-R can reach a top speed of 315 km/h (196 mph),[33] Motor Trend recorded a top speed of 313.8 km/h (195.0 mph).[34] In tests the original production model was shown to be capable of achieving 0-97 km/h (60 mph) times as low as 2.7 seconds using "launch control".[citation needed] Owners expressed concern that duplicating the times achieved in these tests would void their factory warranty. Nissan's chief vehicle engineer Kazutoshi Mizuno has indicated that he has never used the term "launch control", which refers to the act of turning off vehicle dynamic control (VDC) and launching the car at around 4500 rpm.[35] However, Nissan's director of product planning John Wiener stated in an interview with Jay Leno that "we (Nissan) actually offer a 'launch mode'".[36] The GT-R user's manual states that turning off the VDC is only meant for escaping low-traction situations such as mud or snow. Nissan has re-programmed the 2010 model year GT-R to reduce the engine speed at launch to around 3,000-3,500 rpm with VDC enabled, which is meant to improve acceleration times. The new programming was also installed on old 2009 vehicles still in Nissan's inventory, and is available for existing 2009 vehicles.[37] The updated GT-R now has a launch mode called "R-Mode Start". The system allows a maximum of 4 consecutive hard launches before locking itself out, after which it can be unlocked by driving normally for 1.5 miles. The increased engine output of later models combined with the "R-Mode Start" has lowered the 0-97 km/h (60 mph) time to 2.7 seconds.[38] Motor Trend achieved a standing quarter-mile time of 11.6 s at 193.1 km/h (120.0 mph).[39] Autocar achieved a 0-160 km/h (100 mph) time of 8.5 seconds.[40]
