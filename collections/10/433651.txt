In an interview with Official Charts Company, Sigala said: "I'm really, really excited about it. The last few releases feel like they've been more collaborative – Craig David, Digital Farm Animals and the Hailee Steinfeld/Kato song – but this one feels more like my record, if you know what I mean. I'm so happy it's coming out - hopefully it'll be the first of many this year." When asked about how the collaboration came together, he said: "It was written with Bryn Christopher originally, who sang Sweet Lovin'. He'd pretty much written all the vocals and came to me with the idea for the song. We developed it from there and thought about getting Ella on it - we share the same manager. She helped us finish the song. The difficult thing with Bryn is he comes in with that crazy voice of his, so it's about finding someone to match that. Ella's one of the few people who can do that." In an interview with The List, he said: "We had planned to do a collaboration somewhere along the line, but we were just waiting for the right time and the right song."[2]
