The 2007 League Cup final was one of the most noted incidents. The game was marred by a fracas involving Frank Lampard, Cesc Fàbregas and others that resulted in yellow cards for the two and three other players sent off, the dismissal of Emmanuel Adebayor and incidents of Chelsea fans throwing celery at Arsenal players.[citation needed] This led the media to dub it the "Snarling Cup final".[citation needed]The match ended in a 2–1 victory for Chelsea.
