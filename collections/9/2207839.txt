Norwegian Air Shuttle is a low-cost airline operating from Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Spain and the United Kingdom. As of December 2012, it operates to 87 airports in 25 countries across three continents, from its operating bases. Norwegian was founded in 1993 as a regional airline to operate routes for Braathens SAFE in Western Norway.[1] It became a domestic, main-haul low-cost carrier from 1 September 2002, when it took into use Boeing 737-300.[2] In 2006, Norwegian Air Shuttle established its first non-Norwegian base at Warsaw Frédéric Chopin Airport in Poland.[3] A year later, Norwegian bought the Swedish low-cost carrier FlyNordic,[4] which was merged into Norwegian a year later.[5]
