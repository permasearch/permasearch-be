Local reporter Angenette Levy was interviewed after the series and said: "I did notice there were some parts of the state's theory, and some other things that weren't discussed in the documentary," but she also noted that it was a six-week trial with much evidence reviewed in court.[44] She said she was surprised that the trial, which she found compelling on many levels, had not received more national attention when it was being conducted. She found Dassey's conviction "tragic," as was Avery's wrongful conviction in 1985 but did not comment on the conviction in the Halbach case.[44][45] TV reporter Diana Alvear wrote on her blog that she believed Halbach's life and character deserved more coverage in the series.[46] Other local reporters said that the case still weighed on them nearly a decade after the trial.[45]
