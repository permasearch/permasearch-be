The bridge was built between June and November 1929 at a cost of $350,000, which was $100,000 over budget.[8] Adjusting for inflation, the cost to rebuild in the 2010s would be over $20 million.[6] The project was financed by Lon P. Piper, president of the Royal Gorge Bridge and Amusement Company of San Antonio, Texas. Piper hired George E. Cole as the Chief Engineer and the bridge was completed in about six months with no deaths or serious injuries.[6] The formal opening occurred on December 8, 1929. Piper agreed to a twenty-year lease of the gorge and surrounding land, which is owned by CaÃ±on City, paying a $1000 yearly fee to the city with a reduced fee of $500 in some years of hardship.[8]
