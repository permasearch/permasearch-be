She first recorded for Columbia Records in 1925, achieving a hit with "Dinah", which was voted a Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1998. (From her start at Columbia, the label split her records initially with the more bluesey songs issued on their 14000-D race series and her versions of popular songs on their regular popular series.) Soon after, she started working with Pearl Wright, and together they toured in the South. In 1924, Waters played at the Plantation Club on Broadway. She also toured with the Black Swan Dance Masters. With Earl Dancer, she joined what was called the "white time" Keith Vaudeville Circuit, a vaudeville circuit performing for white audiences and combined with screenings of silent movies. They received rave reviews in Chicago and earned the unheard-of salary of US$1,250 in 1928. In September 1926, Waters recorded "I'm Coming Virginia", composed by Donald Heywood with lyrics by Will Marion Cook. She is often wrongly attributed as the author. The following year, Waters first sang it in a production of Africana at Broadway's Dalyâ€™s Sixty-Third Street Theatre.[9] In 1929, Waters and Pearl Wright arranged the unreleased Harry Akst song "Am I Blue?", which then was used in the movie On with the Show and became a hit and her signature song.[10]
