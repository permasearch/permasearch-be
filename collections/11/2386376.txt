Jimmy McCulloch's stint with Small Faces only lasted for a few months in late 1977.[53] Shortly after leaving, he started a band called Wild Horses with Brian Robertson, Jimmy Bain and Kenney Jones.[72] He and Jones both left the band before they issued any recordings.[72] McCulloch then became a member of The Dukes, who issued one album in 1979.[53] That same year, McCulloch died at the age of twenty-six from a heroin overdose in his flat in Maida Vale.[53]
