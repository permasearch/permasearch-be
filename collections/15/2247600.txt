In a separate study by Gredlin and Bjorklund (2005), it was found that there are sex differences in object manipulation.  An experiment was performed by putting a desirable toy in an out-of-reach place but also giving the child 5 different tools he/she could use to help retrieve this object.  The children were put in these conditions and any decision they made was spontaneous and on their own; they were only given a hint after they had failed the task 5 times. The study's results showed that 77% of the boys used one of the tools to reach the toy, while only 31% of the girls used one of the tools.  This shows that boys are more likely to participate in object manipulation, and this may be because they spend more time in object-oriented play.  The study also found that girls spend more time in social play.  Evolution may play a role in this phenomenon; the differences in play styles between boys and girls manifest into adult behavior.[15]
