In a June 2016 interview, Kiedis opened up about his past relationships saying that there were years when he had over 100 sexual partners and stated “If I saw a pretty girl, I wanted to have her.” When asked about marriage and growing old and alone Kiedis responded by saying “Maybe it is because I never learned to live in a relationship and as silly one sounds, I do not understand women yet. They remain a mystery. I talked about this yesterday with a friend: do we focus on finding a person who fits with us, or will we remain single? I am open to both. If the right one comes – wonderful. If not, I accept what the universe has intended for me.”[94]
