The captain of a sailing ship seeks a course along which the winds can be expected to blow in the direction of travel.[4] During the Age of Sail, the pattern of prevailing winds made various points of the globe easy or difficult to access, and therefore had a direct effect on European empire-building and thus on modern political geography. For example, Manila galleons could not sail into the wind at all.[3]
