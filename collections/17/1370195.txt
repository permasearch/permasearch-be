Some computers use Goldschmidt's algorithm to simultaneously calculate       S     {\displaystyle {\sqrt {S}}}   and     1  /    S     {\displaystyle 1/{\sqrt {S}}}  . Goldschmidt's algorithm finds       S     {\displaystyle {\sqrt {S}}}   faster than Newton-Raphson iteration on a computer with a fused multiplyâ€“add instruction and either a pipelined floating point unit or two independent floating-point units.[10]
