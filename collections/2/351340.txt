Christine returned to Genoa City in July 2010, unsure whether to stay or go back to Washington, D.C. Her return also coincided with her anniversary to with ex-husband Paul Williams. They ended up making love, but Paul realized it was a mistake given that he was now in a relationship with Christine's old friend Nina Webster. Nina actually saw Christine and Paul kiss that night and quickly her romance with Paul was strained as was her friendship with Christine. Hurting their friendship even more was that Christine knew that the police detective Ronan Malloy was actually Nina's long-lost son. Ronan was actually FBI working undercover to expose some dirty cops that Nina's other son, Chance Chancellor was being blackmailed by. Eventually, Ronan shot and killed Chance just as Nina found out about their connection. Yet, a few weeks later it was learned that Chance faked his death and was now in the Witness Protection Agency where only Nina, Paul, Christine, Ronan, and Phillip Chancellor III know the truth about Chance.
