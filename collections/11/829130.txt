The vocalist later expressed surprise that Bates agreed to work with him again, since The Hell Not Hallelujah Tour saw relations between the two deteriorate to where Manson threatened the guitarist on-stage with a box-cutter knife.[14] Bates explained that the incident stemmed from Manson "breaking beer bottles so he could cut himself, but the shards of glass were hitting our drummer Gil. I got really pissed and told him to stop with the fucking glass.Â ... so he like, kicked a [bottle] and it hit me on stage and I'd just had enough. I said, 'What the fuck?'. So instead of the bottle, he pulls out a box cutter and says 'You want me to cut you open with this box cutter, Tyler Bates?' I said, 'You fucking come near me and I'll kill you with that box cutter!' And this is all happening on stage, you know?" Bates said that he found the experience to be funny, and that he renamed his publishing company to Box Cutter Music in reference to the incident.[15]
