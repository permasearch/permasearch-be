Development of Pokémon X and Y began in 2010.[22] Director Junichi Masuda revealed the three main themes of X and Y to be beauty, bonds, and evolution.[23] Beauty was the core focus and Masuda considered France to be a prime example of such; he sent a team to the country for study in 2011.[16] Flowers were integrated into many routes across the game for visual aesthetics, something not done in previous iterations of Pokémon, and for unique wild Pokémon encounters.[10] With the games taking place in a region based on France, design inspiration stemmed more from European culture.[17] The legendary trio of Xerneas, Yveltal, and Zygarde have their roots in Norse Mythology, for example.[24] More focus than usual was placed on giving new Pokémon unique elements for this generation.[22] The titles X and Y, representing the x-axis and y-axis—also reflecting different forms of thinking[25]—were chosen early in development.[26] The simplicity of the names was also related to the simultaneous worldwide release of the games.[25] Additionally, designers sought to make the Pokémon names the same in every country whenever possible. Masuda expressed that this effort proved exceptionally difficult as the names have to feel fitting to their physical appearance and not infringe upon any rights.[27]
