The passive margin in eastern Mexico is made up of a series of basins. These basins are mostly igneous or metamorphic rocks covered by sediments,[28] except in the Burgos Basin, where Cenozoic volcanism has occurred.[29] Much of the sediment is from erosion of the thrust belts west of the margin.[30]
