As a result of the battle, the Roman army, commanded by Marcus Atilius Regulus, landed in Africa and began ravaging the Carthaginian countryside.[49] The Siege of Aspis (or Clupea) was the first fighting on African land during the war. Regulus was next victorious at the Battle of Adys, forcing Carthage to sue for peace.[50] According to Polybius, the terms suggested were so heavy that Carthage decided they would be better off not under Roman rule. The negotiations failed but fortunately, for the Carthaginians, Xanthippus, a Spartan mercenary, returned to Carthage to reorganise its army.[33][51] Xanthippus defeated the Roman army and captured Regulus at the Battle of Tunis,[52][53] and then managed to cut off what remained of the Roman army from its base by re-establishing Carthaginian naval supremacy.[54][55]
