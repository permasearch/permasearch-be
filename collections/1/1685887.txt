In 1857, Cayley introduced matrix notation, which allows for a harmonization and simplification of linear maps. Around the same time, Grassmann studied the barycentric calculus initiated by Möbius. He envisaged sets of abstract objects endowed with operations.[9] In his work, the concepts of linear independence and dimension, as well as scalar products, are present. In fact, Grassmann's 1844 work extended a vector space of n dimensions to one of 2n dimensions by consideration of 2-vectors     u ∧ v   {\displaystyle u\wedge v}   and 3-vectors     u ∧ v ∧ w   {\displaystyle u\wedge v\wedge w}   called multivectors. This extension, called multilinear algebra, is governed by the rules of exterior algebra. Peano was the first to give the modern definition of vector spaces and linear maps in 1888.[10]
