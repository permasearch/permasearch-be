St Chad's Church was the mother church of the ancient ecclesiastical parish and was founded before 1170, possibly on a Saxon site. Much of the current building is the result of late Victorian restoration. A local legend relates that the site was chosen by spirits and fairies as on several occasions stone for the church building was moved from near the river to the hill on which St. Chad's stands. The church is accessed from the town below by a flight of 124 steps.[46] The town stocks (no longer in use) are in the churchyard.
