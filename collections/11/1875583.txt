The WSL consists of nineteen member clubs and the season is currently played over the summer months.[18] Initially the league was described as professional, with the top four players on each team being paid an annual salary in excess of Â£20,000.[19] However, in November 2010 it was confirmed that the WSL will be semi-professional, with only a "handful" of top players full-time.[20] Clubs' annual wage bills will be approximately one-tenth of those in the American WPS.[20] The FA envisage that the league will become fully professional in future, should it prove successful.[21]
