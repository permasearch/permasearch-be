The name was popular in the US during the 1980s and early 1990sâ€”between 1980 and 1991 the number of babies named Tiffany born each year exceeded 10,000, peaking at 18,361 in 1988.[2] Its popularity is probably due to the movie Breakfast at Tiffany's, alluding to the jeweler Tiffany & Co., rather than the feast of Epiphany.[3][4][5]
