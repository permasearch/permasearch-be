In September 1986, during a telephone conversation with his uncle, Presiding Bishop J. O. Patterson expressed a desire to see his nephew return to active membership in the Church of God in Christ.[citation needed] As a result of that conversation, the Presiding Bishop had Gilbert Patterson’s name added to the General Board’s agenda for the Convocation of 1986. Many board members had waited for this day, hoping for Patterson’s return. Board members such as O. T. Jones Jr., F. D. Washington, J. D. Husband, LeRoy Anderson and C. D. Owens were supporters; the most vocal was Patterson’s lifelong friend, Bishop Chandler D. Owens (who had not yielded to pressure to break ties with Patterson). During the November 1986 General Board meeting, the board voted 11–0 to invite Patterson to return to active ministry in the Church of God in Christ as a Jurisdictional Bishop in Memphis. The meeting was chaired by Bishop L.H. Ford, in the presiding bishop's absence. Therefore, the general board's November 1986 action was not executed by Bishop J. O. Patterson Sr. until January 29, 1988 at the Bishops' Conference in Jacksonville, Florida.
