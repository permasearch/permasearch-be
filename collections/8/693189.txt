Thrust is provided by four Rolls-Royce Mermaid azimuth thruster type podded propulsion units,[45][46] each featuring one forward-facing low-vibration propeller with separately bolted blades. The forward pair of thrusters is fixed, but the aft pair can swivel through 360Â°, removing the need for a rudder.[14] The Queen Mary 2 is the first quadruple-propeller passenger ship completed since the SS France in 1961.[47] Queen Mary 2 carries eight spare blades on the foredeck, immediately forward of the bridge screen.
