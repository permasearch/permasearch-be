Bill Kuchman of Popculturology noted that the episode supports the theory that Ted is telling his children this story because The Mother is dead in the year 2030, drawing parallels between "Vesuvius" and "The Time Travelers." "When 'The Time Travelers' aired, there was a lot of discussion over what that soliloquy meant. Was The Mother dead? Was Ted dead? After seeing 'Vesuvius,' one of the theories certainly has a lot more weight now," Kuchman wrote. "Sure, maybe Ted’s speech in 'The Time Travelers' and the ending of 'Vesuvius' have nothing to do with each other, but is that really the most likely case? ... I originally nixed both the 'The Mother is dead' and 'Ted is dead' theories, citing Occam's razor. The simplest explanation is often the correct explanation, and back then that was the case. If I’m sticking to Occam’s Razor still, it's now a lot harder to debunk the 'The Mother is dead' theory."[3]
