On April 13, 1926, Lindbergh executed the Post Office Department's Oath of Mail Messengers,[31] and two days later he opened service on the new route. Twice combinations of bad weather, equipment failure, and fuel exhaustion forced him to bail out on night approach to Chicago;[32][33] both times he reached the ground without serious injury and immediately set about ensuring his cargo was located and sent on with minimum delay.[33][34] In mid-February 1927 he left for San Diego, California, to oversee design and construction of the Spirit of St. Louis.[35]
