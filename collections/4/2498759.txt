Several studies have looked at the effect of no-fault divorce on divorce rates in the United States. The studies typically find an increase in the short-term rate, but little long-term casual relationship. The most frequent explanation given is that the older laws were ineffective and not followed anyway, though there are some differing viewpoints.[8][9] Economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers, based on findings in their research, argue that domestic violence and female suicide decline in states that legalize no-fault divorce.[10] Specifically, they report that "states that adopted no-fault divorce experienced a decrease of 8 to 16 percent in wives' suicide rates and a 30 percent decline in domestic violence."[11] They also argue that their research proves that there is no permanent effect of no-fault divorce laws on divorce rates.[10]
