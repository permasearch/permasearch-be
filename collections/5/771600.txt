Viruses are by far the most abundant biological entities on Earth and they outnumber all the others put together.[129] They infect all types of cellular life including animals, plants, bacteria and fungi.[3] However, different types of viruses can infect only a limited range of hosts and many are species-specific. Some, such as smallpox virus for example, can infect only one species – in this case humans,[130] and are said to have a narrow host range. Other viruses, such as rabies virus, can infect different species of mammals and are said to have a broad range.[131] The viruses that infect plants are harmless to animals, and most viruses that infect other animals are harmless to humans.[132] The host range of some bacteriophages is limited to a single strain of bacteria and they can be used to trace the source of outbreaks of infections by a method called phage typing.[133]
