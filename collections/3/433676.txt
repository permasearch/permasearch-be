Bolton Wanderers are another team guilty of "Doing a Leeds", after enjoying a successful stint in the Premier League under Sam Allardyce, which culminated in qualifying for both the 2006-2007 and 2007-08 UEFA Cup, reaching the last 16 in the latter, which included a draw and a victory against Atlético Madrid, and draws against Bayern Munich,and Sporting Lisbon. After Allardyce's departure, the club began a steady decline, with relegation battles being a regular feature. Owen Coyle led Bolton on a successful cup campaign of the 2010-2011 FA Cup, reaching the semi-final stage where Stoke City despatched The Trotters 5-0. This began a rapid decline that ultimately led to relegation on the last day of the 2011-12 season. The club mounted a late charge for the playoffs in 2012-13 season, falling just short after a final day 2-2 draw to Blackpool at home. Since then, the club announced debts of £172.9m in 2015[22] and were relegated to League One in 2016.[23]
