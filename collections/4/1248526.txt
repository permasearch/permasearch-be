The Abbasids used Alexandria, Damietta, Aden and Siraf as entry ports to India and China.[66] Merchants arriving from India in the port city of Aden paid tribute in form of musk, camphor, ambergris and sandalwood to Ibn Ziyad, the sultan of Yemen.[66] Moluccan products shipped across the ports of Arabia to the Near East passed through the ports of India and Sri Lanka.[67] Indian exports of spices find mention in the works of Ibn Khurdadhbeh (850 CE), al-Ghafiqi (1150), Ishak bin Imaran (907) and Al Kalkashandi (14th century).[67] After reaching either the Indian or the Sri Lankan ports, spices were sometimes shipped to East Africa, where they were used for many purposes, including burial rites.[67]
