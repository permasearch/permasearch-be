Titan begins with a slow U-turn out of the station then a climbs up a 245-foot (75 m) hill. At the crest of the hill the train drops 255-foot (78 m) into a 120-foot (37 m) underground tunnel. Immediately after the tunnel, riders are taken through a large turnaround. Following the turnaround, riders encounter a large camel back that provides significant airtime. The train subsequently enters a 540 degree upwards helix which leads to the mid-course brake run. Off the midcourse brakes, the trains maneuver a left hand drop, leading into an overbanked turn. Then followed by a 570 degree downward helix with a camera installed for souvenir photos. Afterwards, the trains navigate a banked turn to the left and then another to the right. After this, the trains enters the final brake run and returns to the station.[2]
