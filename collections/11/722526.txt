Python does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations, and, according to Guido van Rossum, it never will.[62][63] However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided in 2.5, by extending Python's generators.[64] Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5, it is possible to pass information back into a generator function, and from Python 3.3, the information can be passed through multiple stack levels.[65]
