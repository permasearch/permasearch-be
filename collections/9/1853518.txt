In what would become a trend in the series, controversy swirled around the contest.  By all accounts, the playing surface had been a muddy mess.  Some Gators claimed that the home team had watered down the field in an effort to slow down the speedy Gator stars, including halfbacks Red Bethea, Carl Brumbaugh and Royce Goodbread; fullback Rainey Cawthon, quarterback Clyde Crabtree, end Dutch Stanley, and Florida's first-ever first-team All-American, end Dale Van Sickel[7]  The Vols protested that the sloppy conditions were simply the result of heavy rain the night before the game.[8]
