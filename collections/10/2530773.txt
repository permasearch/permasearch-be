The iHeartRadio Music Awards is a music awards show that celebrates music heard throughout the year across iHeartMedia radio stations nationwide and on iHeartRadio, iHeartMedia's digital music platform.[2] Founded by iHeartRadio in 2014, the event recognizes the most popular artists and music over the past year. Winners are chosen per cumulative performance data, while the public is able to vote in several categories.[3] The inaugural event was held on May 1, 2014 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. Its first two years were broadcast live on NBC, and since 2015 it is simulcast on TBS, TNT and truTV.[4][5][6] The fifth annual iHeartRadio Music Awards were held on March 11, 2018 at The Forum. The trophy is manufactured by the New York firm Society Awards.
