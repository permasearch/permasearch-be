Stolen bases were not officially noted in a baseball game's summary until 1886, and it was not until 1888 that it officially earned a place in the box score.[1]  The modern rule for stolen bases was adopted in 1898.[1]  While some sources do not include stolen base records before 1898 because they are difficult to compare to the era after 1898, as the sourcing on this list indicates, Major League Baseball continues to recognize them.[2]
