Water deliveries through the East Branch averaged 995,000 acre⋅ft (1.227 km3) per year from 1995 through 2012.[41] The East Branch principally provides water for cities and farms in the Inland Empire, Orange County, and other areas south of Los Angeles. Through Lake Perris, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California receives a large portion of its water from the SWP.[42] Water is also supplied to the San Diego Aqueduct through a connection from Perris to Lake Skinner, further south.[43]
