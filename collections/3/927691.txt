As Mr. Incredible and Frozone travel across the collapsing station following their defeat of the Crustodian and the destruction of the Factory, they encounter Dug, who agrees to help them save the captive scientists. Upon finding the right floor, Dug refuses to go further, insisting that he stay in his station. Before the supers part ways with him, he tells them that his aiding them has had adverse effects upon the Corrupterator that would have shut it down, a process the Underminer never knew how to reverse.
