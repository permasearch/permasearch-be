Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue featured Lana, Cheryl, and Pam in a spread for their March 2016 issue to promote the comedy's seventh season, while a 2014 Esquire advertisement presents Sterling in ready-to-wear from Ermenegildo Zegna and Saint Laurent.[163][164] Similarly, to promote Kingsman: The Golden Circle (2017), Fox released an animated short film featuring Sterling's encounter with Eggsy Unwin.[165][166]
