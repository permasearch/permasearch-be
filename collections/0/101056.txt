In July 2016, the NCAA announced that it had approved the Ivy League to test an experimental kickoff rule in conference play in the 2016 season. Under this rule, kickoffs will be taken from the 40-yard line instead of the 35, and touchbacks will be marked at the 20-yard line instead of the 25. The rule will be re-evaluated in February 2017.[4]
