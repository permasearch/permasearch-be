Doha is located on the central-east portion of Qatar, bordered by the Persian Gulf on its coast. Its elevation is 10 m (33 ft).[58] Doha is highly urbanized. Land reclamation off the coast has added 400 hectares of land and 30 km of coastline.[59] Half of the 22 km² of surface area which Hamad International Airport was constructed on was reclaimed land.[60] The geology of Doha is primarily composed of weathered unconformity on the top of the Eocene period Dammam Formation, forming dolomitic limestone.[61]
