The dictionary definition of British Isles is that it is a geographical term that refers to the whole of Ireland and Great Britain as well as the surrounding islands. It is sometimes incorrectly used as if identical to the UK;[citation needed] or to refer to Great Britain and the surrounding islands, excluding the island of Ireland entirely.[43][44][45] The BBC and The Times have style guides that mandate the dictionary definition but occasional misuse can be found on their web sites.[46][47]
