In restrictive lung disease, the FEV1 and FVC are equally reduced due to fibrosis or other lung pathology (not obstructive pathology). Thus, the FEV1/FVC ratio should be approximately normal, or even increased due to decrease of a greater magnitude in FVC as compared to FEV1 (because of the decreased compliance associated with the presence of fibrosis in some pathological conditions).[4]
