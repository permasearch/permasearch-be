Fuel economy was originally estimated at 30 mpg‑US (7.8 L/100 km) city and 37 mpg‑US (6.4 L/100 km) highway for the 2005 model year, but was later changed to 28 mpg‑US (8.4 L/100 km) city, 35 mpg‑US (6.7 L/100 km) highway, after Honda's addition of standard moonroof and spare tire during the 2006 model year. This change bumped the car to a higher weight class for United States Environmental Protection Agency mileage testing. The 2006 model has also been rated an AT-PZEV vehicle. AT-PZEV (Advanced Technology-Partial Zero Emissions Vehicle) is an emissions standard created by the California Air Resources Board. 2005 model year Accord Hybrids were rated LEVII-ULEV by the California Air Resources board and Tier2, Bin5 by the EPA.
