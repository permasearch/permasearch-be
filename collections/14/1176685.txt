Dr. No had its worldwide premiere at the London Pavilion, on 5 October 1962, expanding to the rest of the United Kingdom three days later.[85] The North American premiere on 8 May 1963 was more low-profile, with 450 cinemas in Midwest and Southwest regions.[86] On 29 May it opened in both Los Angeles and New York City â€“ in the former as a double-bill with The Young and the Brave[85] and the latter in United Artists' "Premiere Showcase" treatment, screening in 84 screens across the city to avoid the costly Broadway cinemas.[82]
