The 1990 World Cup in Italy was to be Robson's last tournament in charge, having decided before it began that he would not be extending his contract, and would be returning to club football with PSV. The competition turned out to be England's best since 1966; after a slow start in the group stage where they played all their group stage matches in the city of Cagliari on the island of Sardinia (at the British government's request), England managed narrow wins after extra-time over Belgium in Bologna and Cameroon in Naples during the team's first 2 knockout round matches, before being beaten in Turin on penalties by West Germany (the eventual winners of the tournament) in the semi-finals after drawing 1â€“1, with Stuart Pearce and Chris Waddle failing from the spot.[16]
