Starfish are widespread in the oceans, but are only occasionally used as food. There may be good reason for this: the bodies of numerous species are dominated by bony ossicles, and the body wall of many species contains saponins, which have an unpleasant taste,[71] and others contain tetrodotoxins which are poisonous.[133] Some species that prey on bivalve molluscs can transmit paralytic shellfish poisoning.[134] Georg Eberhard Rumpf found few starfish being used for food in the Indonesian archipelago, other than as bait in fish traps, but on the island of "Huamobel"  [sic] the people cut them up, squeeze out the "black blood" and cook them with sour tamarind leaves; after resting the pieces for a day or two, they remove the outer skin and cook them in coconut milk.[127] Starfish are sometimes eaten in China,[135] Japan[136][137] and in Micronesia.[138]
