In Romania, a similar recipe is called colțunași,[10] in Transylvania and Bukovina called piroști and in Moldova called chiroște.[24] Colţunaşi is often a dessert filled with jam (usually plum), fresh sour cherries[25] or cottage cheese, or savory, filled with dill seasoned cheese (telemea or urdă), mashed potatoes or chopped meat. The dough is made with wheat flour and the colțunași are boiled in salted water,[26] pan-fried in oil or baked in the oven.
