The redesigned 2013 model year Lincoln MKZ hybrid also experienced somewhat stronger sales during 2013. In July 2013, Ford announced that for the 2014 model year MKZ hybrid it would increase the share of production allocated to the hybrid version, from 20% for the 2013 model year to 40% of the 2014 model year. The Lincoln MKZ Hybrid is popular among consumers in part because it has the same base price as the non-hybrid MKZ.[115]
