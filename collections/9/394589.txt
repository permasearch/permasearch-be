After the battle, Clary is introduced to the group of teens, who identify themselves as Shadowhunters, a race of humans who are physically enhanced with angel blood, who secretly protect humanity from demons. When her mother Jocelyn goes missing, Clary learns that the event is connected to the conflict between the Shadowhunters and their enemies. She then enters the Shadowhunter fold, using her newly revealed mystical abilities to assist the group while attempting to find her mother. In the process, she falls in love with fellow Shadowhunter Jace/Jonathan Herondale.
