Transformation #5: Zits's Father, Zits's father is a homeless Indian on the streets of Tacoma. As his father, Zits learns that his father endured physical and emotional abuse as a child; after failing to kill an animal on an unsuccessful hunt, Zits's Grandfather forces his son to repeat the lines "I ain't worth shit" over and over again. Haunted by this memory outside the room where Zits is being born, his father he runs away and abandons Zits. He carries a photo of five-year-old Zits with him at all times.
