Alfred Leete, one of Caxton's illustrators, designed the now-famous image as a cover illustration for the 5 September 1914 issue of London Opinion, a popular weekly magazine, taking cues from Field's earlier recruiting advertisement.[6][7]  At the time, the magazine had a circulation of 300,000.[8] In response to requests for reproductions, the magazine offered postcard-sized copies for sale. The Parliamentary Recruiting Committee obtained permission to use the design in poster form.[9] A similar poster used the words "YOUR COUNTRY NEEDS YOU".[10]
