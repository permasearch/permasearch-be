The law pertaining to domesticated elephants is the Beast of Burden Act 2482 B.E. (1939).[16] This act classifies elephants as draught animals along with horses, donkeys, and oxen. It allows domesticated elephants to be treated as private property. This act has no additional measures for animal welfare protection.[5] The Wild Animal Reservation and Protection Act, B.E. 2535 (1992)[17] protects wild elephants, but excludes registered draught animals.[2]
