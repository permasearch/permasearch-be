Delphine LaLaurie (portrayed by Kathy Bates) is based on the true-life New Orleans socialite from the 1830s, infamous for killing and torturing her slaves. To punish Delphine for disfiguring the houseboy, Bastien, the voodoo priestess Marie Laveau tricks Delphine into drinking a potion of eternal life and buries her alive. Delphine is re-discovered by Nan and a war rekindles between the voodoo tribe and the witches when Fiona digs Delphine up and houses her to use as a bargaining chip against Laveau. Delphine is immortal because of Marie Laveau's potion and cannot die. Delphine is a complex, dualistic character, at once pitiable and monstrous. Arrogant and proud, she's also practical and willing to get her hands dirty. She truly loves her family, but is willing to torture them to keep them from disobeying her. In the Academy, Delphine is required to be Queenie's slave and the two form a tentatively fond relationship. Queenie's betrayal smashes Delphine's trust and inclinations to attempt atonement for her racist ways, and Delphine again takes up her murderous hobbies when tempted. Delphine longs for death, but her personal hell is being locked in a cage in her torture attic, just out of reach of her daughters, and forced to watch her African-American enemy torture her children in front of her, without being able to help. For her performance, Bates was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress on Television and the Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actress â€“ Series, Miniseries or Television Film, and won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie.
