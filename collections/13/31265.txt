Overall, the Second Army contingent consisted of 83,115 men, 61,715 of them British.[13] The nominally British air and naval support units included a large number of personnel from Allied nations, including several RAF squadrons manned almost exclusively by overseas air crew. For example, the Australian contribution to the operation included a regular Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) squadron, nine Article XV squadrons, and hundreds of personnel posted to RAF units and RN warships.[76] The RAF supplied two-thirds of the aircraft involved in the invasion.[77]
