As a Marxist, Stalin believed in an inevitable class war between the world's proletariat and bourgeoise.[668] He believed that the working classes would prove successful in this struggle and would establish a dictatorship of the proletariat,[668] regarding the Soviet Union as an example of such a state.[669] He also believed that this proletarian state would need to introduce repressive measures to ensure the full crushing of the propertied classes,[670] and thus the class war would intensify with the advance of socialism.[671] The new state would then be able to ensure that all citizens had access to work, food, shelter, healthcare, and education, with the wastefulness of capitalism eliminated by a new, standardised economic system.[672] According to Sandle, Stalin was "committed to the creation of a society that was industrialized, collectivized, centrally planned and technologically advanced."[673]
