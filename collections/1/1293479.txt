Fishers are generalist predators. Although their primary prey is snowshoe hares and porcupines, they are also known to supplement their diet with insects, nuts, berries, and mushrooms. Since they are solitary hunters, their choice of prey is limited by their size. Analyses of stomach contents and scat have found evidence of birds, small mammals, and even moose and deerâ€”the latter two indicating that they are not averse to eating carrion. Fishers have been seen to feed on deer carcasses.[18] While the behavior is not common, fishers have been known to kill larger animals, such as wild turkey, bobcat, and lynx.[19][20][21]
