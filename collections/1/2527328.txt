As a matter of fact, the above relation between     V   {\displaystyle V}   and     I   {\displaystyle I}   is established by superposition of some particular configurations. Now, the uniqueness theorem guarantees that the result is general. To be specific, there is one and only one value of     V   {\displaystyle V}   once the value of     I   {\displaystyle I}   is given. In other words, the above relation holds true independent of what the "black box" is plugged to.
