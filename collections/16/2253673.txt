In early 2011, Djokovic became the primary challenge for Nadal after beating him in Indian Wells and Miami back-to-back.[44][91] As the clay season began, Djokovic's winning streak continued as he beat Nadal for the first time on clay in Madrid, ending Nadal's second streak of 37 straight wins on clay.[92] As such, Djokovic became the second man in tennis history after Roger Federer to ever defeat Rafael Nadal in a clay final.[93] Djokovic beat Nadal again a week later in Rome.[94] Djokovic was a legitimate contender going into the 2011 French Open and was perceived by many tennis analysts as capable of dethroning Nadal.[95] Djokovic and Federer met in the semifinals, where Federer's win put an end to Djokovic's best opportunity to win the French Open.[9] Djokovic had been on a 43-match winning streak, including four straight wins over Rafael Nadal up to that point.[96] Federer's win also prevented Djokovic from winning the Calendar Grand Slam.[97]
