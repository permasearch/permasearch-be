This equation is very useful but is only accurate when gas molecules are small compared to the distances between them and rebound elastically off each other. Gases behave most like ideal gases at low pressures and high temperatures.[3] At moderately high pressures, attractive interactions between molecules reduce the pressure compared to the ideal gas law; and at very  high pressures, the sizes of the molecules are no longer negligible and repulsive forces between molecules increases the pressure. At low temperatures, molecules are more likely to stick together instead of rebounding elastically.[4]
