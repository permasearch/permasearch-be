Vietnamese cà phê sữa đá or "iced milk coffee", is made with a dark roast, often with chicory, brewed with a small metal Vietnamese drip filter into a cup containing sweetened condensed milk. The condensed milk and coffee are stirred together and then poured over ice. Ca phe sua nong (Vietnamese: 'cà phê sữa nóng') – literally, "hot milk coffee" – excludes the ice.
