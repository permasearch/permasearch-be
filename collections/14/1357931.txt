Of her quotable comments, Alice's most famous found its way to a pillow on her settee: "If you can't say something good about someone, sit right here by me."[35] To Senator Joseph McCarthy, who had jokingly remarked at a party "Here's my blind date. I am going to call you Alice," she sarcastically said "Senator McCarthy, you are not going to call me Alice. The truckman, the trashman and the policeman on my block may call me Alice, but you may not."[36] She informed President Lyndon B. Johnson that she wore wide-brimmed hats so he couldn't kiss her.[29] When a well-known Washington senator was discovered to have been having an affair with a young woman less than half his age, she quipped, "You can't make a souffl√© rise twice."[37] She said in a 60 Minutes interview with Eric Sevareid, televised on February 17, 1974, that she was a hedonist.[38]
