With most key first team players having refused to transfer to the new company, a very different Rangers team lined up for the first league match in Third Division. Despite this, Rangers secured a comfortable 5–1 victory over East Stirlingshire in front of a crowd of 49,118, a world record for a football match in a fourth tier league.[88][n 1] Away from home, Rangers started their league campaign with three successive draws before losing 1–0 to Stirling Albion, at the time the bottom club.[90] Rangers were defeated in the third round of the Scottish Challenge Cup by Queen of the South at Ibrox,[91] in the quarter-finals of the Scottish League Cup at home to Inverness Caledonian Thistle[92] and in the fifth round of the Scottish Cup by Dundee United.[93] Rangers beat their own new record against Queens Park with an attendance of 49,463[94] and again against Stirling Albion with an attendance of 49,913.[95] Rangers clinched the Third Division title on 30 March after a goalless draw at Montrose.
