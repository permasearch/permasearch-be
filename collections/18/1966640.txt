The judiciary of the Upper Tribunal comprises Judges and other Members. Senior legally qualified members of former tribunals (now abolished and transferred into the First-tier and Upper Tribunals) became Judges of the Upper Tribunal when their jurisdiction was transferred, whilst some lay members (generally experts in the subject matter of the former tribunal) became other Members. New Judges and Members are appointed by the Judicial Appointments Commission.[7]
