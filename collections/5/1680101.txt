This season's episodes were produced in a process similar to those of the previous seasons. Each episode was outlined in two-to-three pages that contained the necessary plot information.[19] These outlines were then handed to storyboard artists, who created full storyboards.[20] Design and coloring were done in Burbank, California, and animation was handled overseas in South Korea by Rough Draft Korea and Saerom Animation.[21][22][23] Kirsten Lepore directed the episode "Bad Jubies", which was animated via stop motion, continuing a tradition from the previous two seasons of using a guest animator for an episode.[24] Lepore had previously animated the short stop-motion tag for Frederator Studios, the series' production company.[25] There was a sneak peek of "Bad Jubies" at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival on June 19, 2015, several months before the season's premiere.[26]
