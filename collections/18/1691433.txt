After the end of the war, the obstruction was investigated by the survey ship HMAS Lachlan.[2] She arrived over the area in June 1947, and after several runs in the locality using anti-submarine instruments and echo sounder, found what appeared to be a patch of shoal water at six fathoms (11 m) surrounded by soundings from twelve to fourteen fathoms (22 to 26 m).[2][4][verification needed] Lachlan steamed over the area several times and found that the object was about 300 feet (91Â m) long and probably the wreck of a fair-sized steamer, possibly lying on her side. The only ship that had been reported missing in those waters was Yongala. The Navy did nothing to follow up the find.[4]
