By 2009, Carl still lives in the house, stubbornly holding out while the neighborhood homes are torn down and replaced by skyscrapers. When he accidentally injures a construction worker, the court deems him a public menace, ordering him to move to a retirement home. However, Carl resolves to keep his promise to Ellie by turning his house into a makeshift airship, using thousands of helium balloons. Russell, a young "Wilderness Explorer" who visited Carl in his effort to earn his final merit badge, for assisting the elderly, becomes an accidental stowaway.
