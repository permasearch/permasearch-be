Principal photography began in June 1984 in several locations throughout Los Angeles, California. The fictional address of the house that appears in the film is 1428 Elm Street; the actual house is a private home located in Los Angeles on 1428 North Genesee Avenue.[27][28] During production, over 500 gallons of fake blood were used for the special effects production.[29] For the famous blood geyser sequence, the filmmakers used the same revolving room set that was used for Tina's death.
