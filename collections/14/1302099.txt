The back wall of the stage had two or three doors on the main level, with a curtained inner stage in the centre (although not all scholars agree about the existence of this supposed "inner below"),[36] and a balcony above it. The doors entered into the "tiring house"[37] (backstage area) where the actors dressed and awaited their entrances. The floors above may have been used as storage for costumes and props and management offices.[38] The balcony housed the musicians and could also be used for scenes requiring an upper space, such as the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet. Rush matting covered the stage, although this may only have been used if the setting of the play demanded it.[23]
