Clostridium difficile infection is spread by bacterial spores found within feces.[1] Surfaces may become contaminated with the spores with further spread occurring via the hands of healthcare workers.[1] Risk factors for infection include antibiotic or proton pump inhibitors use, hospitalization, other health problems, and older age.[1] Diagnosis is by stool culture or testing for the bacteria's DNA or toxins.[1] If a person tests positive but has no symptoms, the condition is known as C. difficile colonization rather than an infection.[1]
