South Africa has rich coal deposits concentrated in the north-east of the country and as such the majority of South Africa's coal-fired plants are located in the Mpumalanga province. Around 77% of South Africa's energy needs are directly derived from coal[9] and 81% of all coal consumed domestically goes towards electricity production.[10] Historically this has given South Africa access to cheap electricity, but it is also one of the leading reasons that the country is in the top 20 list of carbon dioxide emitting countries.[11][12][13]
