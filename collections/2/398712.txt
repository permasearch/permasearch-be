At the end of its mission, the Cassini spacecraft executed the "Grand Finale" of its mission: a number of risky passes through the gaps between Saturn and Saturn's inner rings.[4][5] The purpose of this phase was to maximize Cassini's scientific outcome before the spacecraft was disposed.[14] The atmospheric entry of Cassini ended the mission, but analyses of the returned data will continue for many years.
