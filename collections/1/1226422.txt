Many Miami players go on to play in the National Football League.[5] The school holds multiple NFL draft related records: most first-round draft picks in a two-year period (11, 2003–2004); most first-round draft picks in a three-year period (15, 2002–2004); and most first-round picks in a four-year period (19, 2001–2004).[410] From 1995 through 2008, Miami set an NFL Draft record by having at least one player selected in the first round of 14 consecutive drafts.[5] The Hurricanes once had a streak of 149 consecutive regular season weeks where a former Hurricane scored a touchdown in an NFL game; the streak started in Week 15 of the 2002 NFL regular season and ended in Week 11 of the 2011 season. During the streak, 33 different former Hurricanes scored touchdowns and a total of 661 touchdowns were scored.[411] Setting a new record for most players from one school, eleven former Hurricanes were selected to the 2010 Pro Bowl, which happened to take place at Miami's Sun Life Stadium.[412]
