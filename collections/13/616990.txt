The main campus is located in the rural Township of Langley, British Columbia, occupying 157 acres (0.64Â km2) on the edge of historic Fort Langley. Fort Langley, a former fur-trade post of the Hudson's Bay Company, was the first capital of British Columbia when the Colony of Vancouver Island and the Colony of British Columbia were united under Governor Sir James Douglas in 1858.[64] There is a residence hall on campus named in honour of Douglas. The campus is situated about 45 minutes southeast from Vancouver and about 2 hours north from Seattle.
