An edited instrumental version of The Pretenders' “My City Was Gone” has been Limbaugh's theme song since the start of his show. Briefly in 1999, Limbaugh stopped playing the song after a "cease and desist" order was issued by EMI. After the song's writer, Chrissie Hynde, said in a radio interview she did not mind the use of the song, an agreement was reached with EMI. The show airs live on weekdays from noon to 3 p.m. Eastern time. A limited, and decreasing, number of stations (such as WHO in Des Moines) air it on tape delay. The program normally originates from Limbaugh's studios near his home in Palm Beach County, Florida, where Limbaugh has lived since 1996.[2] WJNO, Limbaugh's affiliate in Palm Beach County, serves as the de facto flagship station. In the early years of the program, it normally originated from the studios of WABC in New York City (the program's original flagship station), which as of 2013 still served as the home to some of the program's staff and broadcast facilities. As of late 2013, his show is now heard in the New York market on iHeartMedia's (parent of Premiere Networks) WOR-AM.[3] Limbaugh stated in 2009 that he avoids New York as much as possible due to that state's high taxes and that he, at the time, spent an average of 15 days in the state, usually to keep updated with his staff and as a backup in the event of a hurricane (in the latter case, he was seeking an alternative location).[4] Despite Limbaugh's physical location in Florida, WABC introduced Limbaugh with Johnny Donovan's announcement: "Broadcasting from high atop the WABC broadcast center, overlooking Madison Square Garden in midtown Manhattan, this is New York City‘s most listened to talk radio host: Rush Limbaugh."[5] Limbaugh announced he would officially sever his ties with WABC at the end of 2013. Limbaugh also produces a "Morning Update", a 90-second monologue recorded after the show that airs on many of Limbaugh's stations the next morning.
