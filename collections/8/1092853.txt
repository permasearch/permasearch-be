Magistrates were elected officials, serving as representatives of the people for the conduct of public business.[79] There were two broad categories of magistrates, the ordinary magistrates such as the consuls, products of the republican constitution, and the extraordinary magistrates such as the dictators, remnants of the monarchial constitution and reserved primarily for emergencies.[79] Each magistrate held potestas, the authority to exercise the office's powers conferred by custom or statute.[80] The most powerful magistrates, such as the extraordinary magistrates, consuls, and praetors, held a kind of authority known as imperium, the authority to command in a military or judicial sense.[81]
