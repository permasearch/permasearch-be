Internationally, where it is marketed as Salazar's Revenge in many countries, the film was released day-and-date with its North American debut in 54 markets (91% of its total marketplace, except Japan, where it debuted on July 1).[172] Preliminary reports had the film opening to $150–175 million, but possibly overperforming depending on major markets, most notably China.[159][173] While its Chinese run benefited from the Dragon Boat Festival—a lucrative moviegoing period—from May 28–30 as well as from International Children's Day (June 1),[174][175] the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing had a deteriorating effect on certain European markets, and eased moviegoing admissions across the continent over the film's opening weekend.[176] From Wednesday to Friday, it registered an opening of $208.8 million. Around $14 million of that came from IMAX screenings, the second-biggest international IMAX opening in May only after Captain America: Civil War.[153] Similar to its US plunge, it earned $73.8 million in its second weekend, thus, falling in second place behind Wonder Woman.[177]
