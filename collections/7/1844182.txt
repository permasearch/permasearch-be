In 1958, NYSDPW acquired the right-of-way for the highway. From Seaford north to the Southern State Parkway near Plainedge, the right-of-way followed the alignment of Seamans Neck Road, then an uninterrupted local road extending from Merrick Road in Seaford north to NY 107 and Union Avenue in Plainedge. Also in 1958, the Nassau County Department of Public Works signed over 100 county highways around the county. According to the 1959 Master Plan for the county by the public works department, Seamans Neck Road was initially designated as CR 191, but only from Merrick Road to the proposed interchange between the expressway and NY 105, where Seamans Neck Road would meet the new highway.[9] The CR 191 designation was eventually eliminated.[12]
