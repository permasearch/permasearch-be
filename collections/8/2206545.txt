Burnley were one of the most progressive clubs around in the 1950s to the early 1970s under the reign of chairman Bob Lord.[20] They were one of the first teams to build a training ground next to the stadium, while every other team still trained in their own stadium, and the Turf Moor club used innovative training methods.[20] Among other things, this resulted in an excellent youth team. Nearly all members of the 1959–60 Division 1 winning team had played in the Burnley youth team.[21] Lord also pioneered the short-lived 'Football Specials'.[22] 'The Clarets' were also the first to let a manager decide about the transfer policy.[21] After the 1959–60 title winning season finished, Burnley went to the United States to participate in the inaugural international football tournament in North-America, the International Soccer League.[23]
