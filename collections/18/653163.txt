Australia is the lowest, flattest, and oldest continental landmass on Earth[4] and it has had a relatively stable geological history. Geological forces such as tectonic uplift of mountain ranges or clashes between tectonic plates occurred mainly in Australia's early history, when it was still a part of Gondwana. Its highest peak is Mount Kosciuszko at 2,228 metres (7,310Â ft), which is relatively low in comparison to the highest mountains on other continents. Erosion has heavily weathered Australia's surface.
