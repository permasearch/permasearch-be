In response to the legislation, Government Senator Jim Walsh put forward a party motion to counter the bill.[65][67] The Irish Times reported that around 30 unidentified backbenchers had signed the motion.[68] One anonymous Senator was quoted as claiming that the motion "would have considerable support from the more conservative sections of the parliamentary party".[67] Taoiseach Brian Cowen, responded by insisting that the registration of same-sex couples would not interfere with the constitutional status of marriage. Cowen noted that the bill had been drawn up in close consultation with the Attorney General and had been included in the programme for the Government.[69] The motion was referred to the parliamentary party's justice committee on 1 July 2008 but a Fianna FÃ¡il spokesperson was quoted as saying that there was "broad support" within the party for the legislation, while the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform Dermot Ahern reaffirmed the constitutional compatibility of the law.[70]
