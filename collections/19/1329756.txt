By 1982, Thorson's increasing drug abuse and Liberace's interest in younger men, including dancer Cary James (Boyd Holbrook), creates a rift that ultimately destroys their relationship.  When Liberace begins visiting pornographic peep shows and suggests that they each see other people, Thorson becomes upset.  Thorson retains an attorney to seek his financial share of the property by suing Liberace for over $100,000,000 in palimony.  As a result, Liberace ends their formal partnership and involves himself with his most recent, and much younger, "assistant".  In 1984, Thorson's palimony lawsuit starts where he gives details about his five-year romance with the entertainer, while Liberace flatly denies any sexual relationship.
