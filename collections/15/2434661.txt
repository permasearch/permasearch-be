If, on the other hand, the capillaries are very leaky, and tissues are therefore retaining both water and protein, then diuretics can do more harm than good.[14] They will cause the kidneys to remove fluid more rapidly from the blood while at the same time the protein in the tissue spaces will be drawing fluid from the blood into the tissues. The result can be dehydration of the blood. Over time, the use of diuretics can aggravate water retention of this type, as the body will learn to hold on to water in an attempt to avoid becoming dehydrated.[15]
