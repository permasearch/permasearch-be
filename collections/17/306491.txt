In 991 the Vikings sacked Ipswich, and their fleet made landfall near Maldon in Essex.[115] The Danes demanded that the English pay a ransom, but the English commander Byrhtnoth refused; he was killed in the ensuing Battle of Maldon, and the English were easily defeated.[115] From then on the Vikings seem to have raided anywhere at will; they were contemptuous of the lack of resistance from the English. Even the Alfredian systems of burhs failed.[116] Ã†thelred seems to have just hidden, out of range of the raiders.[116]
