When Will is named to a national blue-ribbon panel on the arts in Washington, DC, early in the fourth season, he expects Emma to come with him, but Emma is very reluctant to do so: she doesn't want to leave her job for several months while he's away. They ultimately agree that Emma will stay behind and the two will reunite on weekends.[19] They also agree to get married when Will returns, but the stress of planning a big wedding proves too much for Emma, and she leaves the church before the ceremony begins.[20] She and Will eventually reconcile, and the two finally get married in the choir room with the glee club as witnesses in "All or Nothing", after New Directions win Regionals.[21] Following their marriage, the couple decide to have children, but are unable to conceive for several months. They are desperately trying to do so in the fifth season's tenth episode "Trio", and are caught having sex in the school by Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter). At the end of the episode, Emma reveals to Will that she is pregnant.[22] In "Opening Night" Emma gives birth to a boy, Daniel Finn Schuester. During the final season, in the episode Transitioning, she convinces a torn Will to choose what's best for him, to stay at Vocal Adrenaline with a promising salary and facility but unhappy or to stop. In a parallel episode to the Pilot, 2009, she is aware and concerned with Kurt's depression and consults with his father about it and also convince Will to stay with the Glee Club as the kids still needs him and that it what makes him happy. In the series finale, "Dreams Come True", she is now living happily with the newly promoted Will as the principal and in the future they have more kids together. She appears at the McKinley's auditorium rededication to Finn Hudson and enjoys the final performance of the New Directions. She is visibly shocked when Will and Terri hug and together with all of the Glee Cast take a final bow.
