On New Year's Day 2007, and again on New Year's Eve, UK television station Channel 4 dedicated an entire evening to the Monty Python phenomenon, during which an hour-long documentary was broadcast called The Secret Life of Brian about the making of The Life of Brian and the controversy that was caused by its release. The Pythons featured in the documentary and reflected upon the events that surrounded the film. This was followed by a screening of the film itself.[8] The documentary (in a slightly extended form) was one of the special features on the 2007 DVD re-release â€“ the "Immaculate Edition", also the first Python release on Blu-ray.
