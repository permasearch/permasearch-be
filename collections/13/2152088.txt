TSS is caused by bacteria of either the Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus type.[1] Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) is sometimes referred to as toxic shock-like syndrome (TSLS).[1] The underlying mechanism involves the production of superantigens during an invasive streptococcus infection or a localized staphylococcus infection.[1] Risk factors for the staphylococcal type include the use of very absorbent tampons and skin lesions in young children.[1] Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms.[1]
