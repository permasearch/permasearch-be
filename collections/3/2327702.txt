On 6 May 1997, Owen scored on his Liverpool debut against Wimbledon at Selhurst Park.[18] Liverpool were league title challengers to Manchester United but their failure to beat Wimbledon in the penultimate game of the league season handed the championship to United. The Liverpool Echo wrote, "[Only] Michael Owen could emerge with any credit from a performance that mocked Anfield's rich traditions."[18] Owen, who had come on as a substitute in the second half, "[breathed] new life into the Reds' championship corpse," and "began [Liverpool's] best spell of the night",[18] but was ultimately not able to salvage a win.[18] The Liverpool Echo stated, "It was a debut marked in the grand manner."[18]
