Caller ID spoofing remains legal in Canada, and has recently become so prevalent that the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre has "add[ed] an automated message about [the practice] to their fraud-reporting hotline".[20] The CRTC estimates that 40% of the complaints they receive regarding unsolicited calls involve spoofing.[21] The agency advises Canadians to file complaints regarding such calls,[22] provides a list of protection options for dealing with them on its website,[23] and, from July through December 2015, held a public consultation to identify "technical solutions" to address the issue.[21][23][24]
