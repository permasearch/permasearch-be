During the trial, defense attorney Don West implied that the language Martin had allegedly used was evidence that Martin had introduced race into the confrontation.[291] State's Witness 8, Rachel Jeantel, testified that Martin, during his telephone conversation with her just prior to the shooting, had referred to Zimmerman as a "creepy-ass cracker".[291][292] On cross-examination, West asked Jeantel, "So it was racial, but it was because Trayvon Martin put race in this?" and "You don't think that 'creepy ass cracker' is a racial comment?"[293] Jeantel replied that she believed race was involved because Martin was being followed by a white man, not because Martin had called Zimmerman a "creepy-ass cracker."[130][294] She said that people in her community call white people "cracker" and she did not find the term offensive.[292][295][296] Jeantel also testified that Martin, during his telephone conversation, referred to Zimmerman as a "nigga."[138] Jeantel said that Martin's use of the word "nigga" to describe Zimmerman was "slang"[297] when asked by lead prosecutor Bernie De La Rionda.
