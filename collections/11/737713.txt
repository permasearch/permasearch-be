Mathematically, the parallel projection of the point     ( x , y , z )   {\displaystyle (x,y,z)}   on the     x y   {\displaystyle xy}  -plane gives     ( x + a z , y + b z , 0 )   {\displaystyle (x+az,y+bz,0)}  . The constants     a   {\displaystyle a}   and     b   {\displaystyle b}   uniquely specify a parallel projection. When     a = b = 0   {\displaystyle a=b=0}  , the projection is said to be "orthographic" or "orthogonal". Otherwise, it is "oblique". The constants     a   {\displaystyle a}   and     b   {\displaystyle b}   are not necessarily less than 1, and as a consequence lengths measured on an oblique projection may be either larger or shorter than they were in space. In a general oblique projection, spheres of the space are projected as ellipses on the drawing plane, and not as circles as you would expect them from an orthogonal projection.
