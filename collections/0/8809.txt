Creatine synthesis primarily occurs in the liver and kidneys.[3][4] On average, it is produced endogenously at an estimated rate of about 8.3 mmol or 1 gram per day in young adults.[4][5] Creatine is also obtained through the diet at a rate of about 1 gram per day from an omnivorous diet.[4][6] Most of the human body's total creatine and phosphocreatine stores are found in skeletal muscle, while the remainder is distributed in the blood, brain, and other tissues.[5][6]
