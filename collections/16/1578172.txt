Thomas wrote every song on Matchbox 20's debut album, Yourself or Someone Like You.[12] It was released in October 1996,[10]  on the same day that Lava Records folded.[13]  The album sold only 600 copies in its first week.[12]  The band toured extensively, trying to attract notice.  Radio stations were slow to adopt their first single, "Long Day".[10] Thomas and his bandmates were convinced they were soon to be dropped from their contract.  Their manager was also worried, and yelled at them to get serious about their performances.[4]
