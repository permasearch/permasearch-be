Although the two teams played each other, the games were played at each team's home field on an alternating basis. That made it difficult for fans of the road team to travel en masse. TSU head coach Bill Thomas and JSU head coach W.C. Gorden discussed the possibility of playing annually at a neutral site in Memphis, which was roughly equidistant from both campuses. Doing so could benefit both schools by enhancing the rivalry and bringing in more dollars. Both schools have a large alumni base in the Memphis metro area.
