In the winning German team, Miroslav Klose, who had become the top scorer in World Cup history in the semi-final victory over Brazil, became one of the very few players ever to have won gold, silver and bronze medals in the World Cup (bronze in 2006 and 2010, silver in 2002 and gold in 2014), joining a club with earlier German players like Franz Beckenbauer,[6] Sepp Maier[7][8] and Wolfgang Overath[9] (1966â€“1974), as well as Italian Franco Baresi (1982-1994).
