Recent research has considered a wider range of 19th century sources than had been possible by 20th-century writers.[37] The evidence from these sources suggests that even in the mid-1830s the genre was still developing, which shifts the period of the rise and flourishing of shanties to a bit later than was previously accepted. The general silence of the historical record on modern shanties until as late as the 1840s,[62] even as shipping shifted to the even faster clipper ships, suggests that they may not have come into widespread use until the middle of the century. They received a boost from the heavy emigrant movement of gold rushes in California and Australia. Popular shanties of the 1850s included "A Hundred Years Ago,"[63] "One More Day,"[64] "Santiana,"[65] "Haul on the Bowline,"[66] "Across the Western Ocean,"[66] and especially "Stormalong."[66]
