Effervescent or carbon tablets are tablets which are designed to dissolve in water, and release carbon dioxide.[1][2][3]In the 17th and 18th centuries, scientists began uncovering the chemical make-up and physiological benefits of various salts such as Glauber's salt and Epsom salts.[4] These salts were found in mineral springs, which, since the Roman Empire,[5][6][7][7] had been used as health spas, where people would go to bathe in, and drink, mineral-rich waters for their health.[4] These developments led to attempts to replicate the salt mixtures found in these naturally occurring mineral waters using off-the-shelf ingredients.[4] Mixing these kinds of salts — especially carbonates and tartrates — with flavorings like lemon into an effervescent compound with citric or tartaric acid proved especially popular and set off a craze for the new "fruit salts".[4]Effervescent tablets have been used as products of the pharmaceutical and dietary industries for over two centuries.[4]
