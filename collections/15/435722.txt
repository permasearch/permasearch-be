Not to be confused with the female snow leopard of the same name, Mei Ling is a female fox (vixen) and an antagonist exclusive to Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness. A rogue Kung Fu master with skills that rival Shifu's, Mei Ling was also Shifu's love interest for an unspecified amount of time (much to Po's disbelief when she tells him). Falling in love after their first confrontation, they quickly entered a relationship. However, Shifu broke off the relationship after Mei Ling refused to stop using her Kung Fu to steal.
