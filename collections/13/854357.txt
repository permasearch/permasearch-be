The rule was born out of a game between the Knicks and the Chicago Bulls on January 15, 1990 at Madison Square Garden.  The game was tied at 106 with one-tenth of a second left in regulation and the Knicks in possession.  During a time-out called by the Knicks, both teams prepared for what was seen as the only possible way the Knicks could win in regulation: an alley oop tap-in from out of bounds by Patrick Ewing.
