The gang notice that local youths have strangely stopped getting drunk, taking drugs, or having sex. Apparently, this is caused by a cult-like organisation called "Virtue", run by Rachel, a mysterious girl with a commanding storm-based power of suggestion. Nathan confronts Rachel with a gun, while invisible Simon appears on the rooftop and pushes her over the side. Although her death lifts her influence over everyone, she manages to partially grab hold of Nathan who also falls and is impaled on the iron fence below. The episode ends with Nathan regaining consciousness in his coffin, overjoyed upon discovering his power is immortality, when he realises that he is buried alive.
