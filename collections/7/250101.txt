Del has just seen the film Wall Street for about the fourth time and decided the upwardly-mobile lifestyle is for him. The camel-hair coat is out, and in comes a smart new image. Green mackintosh, mobile phone, filofax, aluminium briefcase, but the yellow van remains. Del even wants to buy the flat off the council and sell it for a fast buck. Rodney, meanwhile, has decided to complete a computing diploma course at the Adult Education Centre. It is there that he meets a girl called Cassandra, who returns his raincoat to him (Del wrote Rodney's name in the raincoat). Del and Trig ditch The Nags Head in favour of propping up a wine bar. As Del accidentally falls through the bar hatch, Rodney and the boys head to a club, where Rodney amazes the others by dancing with Cassandra. She gives him a lift home, where he pretends to live in a big house in the posh King's Avenue. As they say goodbye, he is caught waving to the unknown occupants of the posh house. As he walks home, a rainstorm starts.
