Samuel Prescott (August 19, 1751 â€“ c. 1777) was a Massachusetts Patriot during the American Revolutionary War.  He is best remembered for his role in Paul Revere's "midnight ride" to warn the townspeople of Concord of the impending British army move to capture guns and gunpowder kept there at the beginning of the American Revolution.  He was the only participant in the ride to reach Concord.[1]
