Lake Burley Griffin was deliberately designed so that the orientation of the components was related to various topographical landmarks in Canberra.[117][118] The lakes stretch from east to west and divided the city in two; a land axis perpendicular to the central basin stretches from Capital Hill—the eventual location of the new Parliament House on a mound on the southern side—north northeast across the central basin to the northern banks along Anzac Parade to the Australian War Memorial.[66] This was designed so that looking from Capital Hill, the War Memorial stood directly at the foot of Mount Ainslie. At the southwestern end of the land axis was Bimberi Peak,[118] the highest mountain in the ACT, approximately 52 km (32 mi) south west of Canberra.[97]
