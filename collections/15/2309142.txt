Repo! opened in a very limited release on November 7, 2008, on seven screens in Pasadena, Chicago, Mobile, Charlotte, Kansas City, Toronto and Ottawa. The film initially received mixed to negative reviews, but gained a cult following similar to The Rocky Horror Picture Show, managing even to fill theaters worldwide with costumed fans performing Shadowcast versions of the movie, which Smith and Zdunich often visit to meet fans.
