The second phase of extermination began in July 1942, when the new gas chambers were built of brick and mortar on a lightweight foundation,[25] thus enabling the facility to "process" Jews of the two largest agglomerations nearby including the Krak贸w and the Lw贸w Ghettos. The wooden gas chambers were dismantled. The new building 24 m long and 10 m wide had six gas chambers, insulated with the cement walls.[23] It could handle over 1,000 victims at a time. The design was soon imitated by the other two Operation Reinhard extermination camps: Sobibor and Treblinka.[10]
