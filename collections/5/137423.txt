Sinatra developed an interest in music, particularly big band jazz, at a young age.[35] He listened to Gene Austin, Rudy Vall√©e, Russ Colombo, and Bob Eberly, and "idolized" Bing Crosby.[36] Sinatra's maternal uncle, Domenico, gave him a ukulele for his 15th birthday, and he began performing at family gatherings.[37] Sinatra attended David E. Rue Jr. High School from 1928,[38] and A. J. Demarest High School in 1931, where he arranged bands for school dances.[37] He left without graduating, having attended only 47 days before being expelled for "general rowdiness".[39] To please his mother, he enrolled at Drake Business School, but departed after 11 months.[37] Dolly found Sinatra work as a delivery boy at the Jersey Observer newspaper, where his godfather Frank Garrick worked,[f] and after that, Sinatra was a riveter at the Tietjen and Lang shipyard.[41] He performed in local Hoboken social clubs such as The Cat's Meow and The Comedy Club, and sang for free on radio stations such as WAAT in Jersey City.[42] In New York, Sinatra found jobs singing for his supper or for cigarettes.[37] To improve his speech, he began taking elocution lessons for a dollar each from vocal coach John Quinlan, who was one of the first people to notice his impressive vocal range.[43]
