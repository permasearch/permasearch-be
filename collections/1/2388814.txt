Applying the same geometric mean technique to 16:9 and 4:3 approximately yields the 14:9 (    1.55   5 ¯     {\textstyle 1.55{\overline {5}}}  ...) aspect ratio, which is likewise used as a compromise between these ratios.[11] In this case 14:9 is exactly the arithmetic mean of     16 : 9   {\textstyle 16:9}   and     4 : 3 = 12 : 9   {\textstyle 4:3=12:9}  , since 14 is the average of 16 and 12, while the precise geometric mean is         16 9   ×   4 3     ≈ 1.5396 ≈ 13.8 : 9 ,   {\textstyle {\sqrt {{\frac {16}{9}}\times {\frac {4}{3}}}}\approx 1.5396\approx 13.8:9,}   but the two different means, arithmetic and geometric, are approximately equal because both numbers are sufficiently close to each other (a difference of less than 2%).
