Wilkos often gets into close confrontations with guests by not letting them sit if he is overly disgusted with them, yelling in their faces, physically intimidating them, and even challenging them to hit him, but avoids physical contact with them unless necessary to defend himself or other guests.[8] When a presumably guilty guest begins to explain their actions in greater detail, Wilkos will often ignore and shout over the top of them.[9] When guests get aggressive, Wilkos has threatened them with arrest.[10] When guests flee backstage to try to get away from Wilkos, he often follows them and continues the confrontations.[11] Almost always, when Wilkos has had enough of a particular guest's antics, he will eject the guest off the stage by yelling "Get the hell off my stage!," "Get off my stage!," "Get your ass off my stage!," or "Get the fuck off my stage!", and with increasing frequency, will have them forcibly removed from the studio as well. On rare occasions, Wilkos would even throw guests out of the building.[12] At times, when Wilkos is at his calmest depending on how the guests conduct themselves on the show, he will kindly ask the guests to "walk off the stage."
