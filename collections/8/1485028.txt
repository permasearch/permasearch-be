The tournament was originally scheduled for China from 23 September to 11 October. On 3 May 2003, FIFA announced move the tournament from China because of the 2003 SARS outbreak in China. At the same time the FIFA announced that the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup would be awarded to China.[2][3] On 26 May 2003, FIFA announced the United States would host the tournament. Because the United States had hosted the 1999 World Cup, it was thought the United States could best organize the tournament in the little time remaining before the October scheduled start. In addition, women's soccer boosters in the United States hoped that interest generated by the tournament would save the U.S. women's professional league, the Women's United Soccer Association, from folding.[4]
