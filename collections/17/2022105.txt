Radio station WNYT was formed shortly after NYIT opened its Old Westbury campus in the mid-1960s, operating from studios located in Education Hall. The student-run station has alternately broadcast on campus via carrier current and closed circuit connections, and during the 1970s and early 1980s, it served as the audio for Cablevisionâ€™s on-screen program guide. Today, WNYT is heard online, with Internet-based programming via RealAudio.
