The Julia C. Hester House serves as a settlement house and community center.[90] As of 1979 it offers youth activities and community services, and it is a part of the United Fund.[5] It was originally known as Houston Negro Community Center of the Fifth Ward, but it received its current name before its opening. A biracial committee established the center in 1943 to improve the education, health, and welfare of Fifth Ward residents. It originally used rented facilities on Lyons Avenue, before moving into a $150,000 building on Solo Street in 1949; the center has occupied the Solo Street building since then.[90] West wrote that in the Fifth Ward the Hester House "is as much an institution as Wheatley High."[5]
