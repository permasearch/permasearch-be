Larvae hibernate over the winter in small cells in the soil, emerging in the spring when soil temperatures rise again.[11] Within 4–6 weeks of breaking hibernation, the larvae will pupate and then emerge as adults. Most of the beetles' life is spent as a larva, with only 30–45 days spent as an adult. Adults feed on leaf material above ground, using pheromones to attract other beetles and overwhelm plants, skeletonizing leaves from the top of the plant downward. The aggregation of beetles will alternate daily between mating, eating, and laying eggs. An adult female may lay as many as 40–60 eggs in her lifetime.[11]
