The Manson Family was a desert commune and cult[1][2] formed in California in the late 1960s. Led by Charles Manson, the group consisted of approximately 100 of his followers who lived an unconventional lifestyle with habitual use of hallucinogenic drugs.[3] Most of the group members were young women from middle-class backgrounds, many of whom were radicalised by Manson's teachings and drawn by hippie culture and communal living.[4]
