Along with the classification of post-concussion symptoms, the symptoms can also be described as immediate and delayed.[7] The immediate symptoms are experienced immediately after a concussion such as: memory loss, disorientation, and poor balance.[7] Delayed symptoms are experienced in the later stages and include sleeping disorders and behavioral changes. Both immediate and delayed symptoms can continue for long periods of time and have a negative impact on recovery.[7] According to research, 20-25% of individuals who have sustained a concussion experienced chronic, delayed symptoms.[7]
