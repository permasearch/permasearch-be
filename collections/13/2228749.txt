The Mexican government has worked to improve the Mexican Riviera destination as well as public safety, driving a return of consumer demand. In 2016, the Port of San Diego's cruise business began an expected rebound, with a 50 percent increase in calls, largely driven by growth in business for Holland America Cruise Line and Disney Cruise Lines. The number of calls grew from 68 in the 2014-2015 season to 102 in the 2015-2016 season.
