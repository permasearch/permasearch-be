A critical review of 14 cases where VAN claimed 10 successes showed only one case where an earthquake occurred within the prediction parameters.[174] The VAN predictions not only fail to do better than chance, but show "a much better association with the events which occurred before them", according to Mulargia and Gasperini.[175] Other early reviews found that the VAN results, when evaluated by definite parameters, were statistically significant.[176][177] Both positive and negative views on VAN predictions from this period were summarized in the 1996 book "A Critical Review of VAN" edited by Sir James Lighthill[178] and in a debate issue presented by the journal Geophysical Research Letters that was focused on the statistical significance of the VAN method.[179][180] VAN had the opportunity to reply to their critics in those review publications.[181] In 2011, the ICEF reviewed the 1996 debate, and concluded that the optimistic SES prediction capability claimed by VAN could not be validated.[182]
