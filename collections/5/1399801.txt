Ramsay has a group of men-at-arms companions called the Bastard's Boys (though never within their or Ramsay's hearing), who follow him although their true allegiance lies with Lord Roose to spy on Ramsay.  Ramsay is a depraved sadist renowned for his savage cruelty: he tortures prisoners and enthusiastically engages in the forbidden old Bolton custom of flaying captured enemies alive.  He openly enjoys having young peasant women stripped naked and released into the forests, before hunting them down with feral dogs.  After raping the victims first, he would give a quick death to women who give him "good sport" then flays their corpses, and likes to "honor" them by name his dogs after the victims he enjoys most.  The women who do not give him good sport are raped and then flayed alive.  The skins of his kills are brought back to Dreadfort as gruesome trophies, and the bodies of the victims are fed to his dogs.
