The song is now better known in England as the club anthem of West Ham United, a London-based football club. It was adopted by West Ham's supporters in the late 1920s and is now one of the most recognisable club anthems in English football along with the similarly adopted "You'll Never Walk Alone", "Blue Moon" , "Blue is the Colour" and "Blaydon Races".
