The CHMSL is generally required to illuminate steadily and not permitted to flash,[83][84] though US regulators granted Mercedes-Benz a temporary, 24-month exemption in January 2006 to the steady-light requirement so as to evaluate whether a flashing CHMSL provides an emergency stop signal that effectively reduces the likelihood of a crash.[85]
