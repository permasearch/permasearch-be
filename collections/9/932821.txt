For RBCs, type O negative blood is considered a "universal donor" as recipients with types A, B, or AB can almost always receive O negative blood safely.  Type AB positive is considered a "universal recipient" because they can receive the other ABO/Rh types safely.  These are not truly universal, as other red cell antigens can further complicate transfusions.
