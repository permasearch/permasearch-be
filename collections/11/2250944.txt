Some claim that the Panamanian people overwhelmingly supported the invasion.[51] According to a CBS poll, 92% of Panamanian adults supported the U.S. incursion, and 76% wished that U.S. forces had invaded in October during the coup.[51] However, others dispute this finding, asserting that the Panamanian surveys were conducted in wealthy, English-speaking neighborhoods in Panama City, among Panamanians most likely to support U.S. actions.[52] Human Rights Watch described the reaction of the civilian population to the invasion as "generally sympathetic".[53] According to Robert Pastor, a former U.S. national security advisor, 74% of Americans polled approved of the action.[51]
