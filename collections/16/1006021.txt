The conversion to a base      b  2     {\displaystyle b_{2}}   of an integer n represented in base      b  1     {\displaystyle b_{1}}   can be done by a succession of Euclidean divisions by      b  2   :   {\displaystyle b_{2}:}   the right-most digit in base      b  2     {\displaystyle b_{2}}   is the remainder of the division of n by      b  2   ;   {\displaystyle b_{2};}   the second right-most digit is the remainder of the division of the quotient by      b  2   ,   {\displaystyle b_{2},}   and so on. More precisely, the kth digit from the right is the remainder of the division by      b  2     {\displaystyle b_{2}}   of the (kâˆ’1)th quotient.
