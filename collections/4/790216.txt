Brine treatment systems are typically optimized to either reduce the volume of the final discharge for more economic disposal (as disposal costs are often based on volume) or maximize the recovery of fresh water or salts.  Brine treatment systems may also be optimized to reduce electricity consumption, chemical usage, or physical footprint.
