After supporting A Day to Remember in the UK and Europe in January and February 2017,[13] the band entered the recording studio to track their next album.[12] Recording took place in Los Angeles, California[14] with producer Mike Green. Green was assisted by engineers Will McCoy and Colin Schwanke.[15] Thorpe-Evans called Green "a proper musical genius", saying he was "super focused – like a laser – and it made us feel really professional".[8] Green helped push the band on structuring their songs. Barlow mentioned that they had "a tendency to ramble in our songwriting; he stripped that back and he really made us think about every part of our songs."[16]
