The Bayeux Tapestry (UK: /baɪˈjɜːr/, US: /bɑːˈjuː, beɪ-/; French: Tapisserie de Bayeux, IPA: [tapisʁi də bajø], or La telle du conquest; Latin: Tapete Baiocense) is an embroidered cloth nearly 70 metres (230 ft) long and 50 centimetres (20 in) tall,[1][2][3] which depicts the events leading up to the Norman conquest of England concerning William, Duke of Normandy, and Harold, Earl of Wessex, later King of England, and culminating in the Battle of Hastings. It is thought to date to the 11th century, within a few years after the battle. It tells the story from the point of view of the conquering Normans.
