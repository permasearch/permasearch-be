The vision of the Final Solution – wrote Christopher Browning – had crystallised in the minds of the Nazi leadership during a five-week period, from 18 September to 25 October 1941. It coincided with the German victories on the Eastern Front which yielded over 500,000 new POWs near Moscow.[12] During this time, the concept of Hitler's Lebensraum was redefined. Different methods of industrialized killing were tested and the sites of the extermination camps were selected.[13]
