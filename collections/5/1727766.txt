In 1933, a record 42 cars started the 500. For 1934, a maximum fuel consumption limit was imposed, 45 US gal (37 imp gal; 170 l).[18] It became 42.5 US gal (35.4 imp gal; 161 l) in 1935 and 37.5 US gal (31.2 imp gal; 142 l) in 1936.[18] When the limits resulted in several top competitors running out of fuel in the closing stages, the limits were abandoned,[18] though the use of pump gasoline was still mandatory.[18]
