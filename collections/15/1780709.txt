Keep in mind that an encyclopedia is intended to be a starting point for serious research, not an endpoint.  Though many casual inquiries will be satisfied merely by referring to Wikipedia, you will learn more by accessing the print and online resources we reference.  We encourage you to verify our content by using independent sources.  We also invite you to contribute back by fixing any errors you may find and adding relevant material that will be of interest to future researchers.
