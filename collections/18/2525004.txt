More precisely, let M be a surface in three-dimensional Euclidean space, and p a point on M.  A normal plane through p is a plane passing through the point p containing the normal vector to M.  Through each (unit) tangent vector to M at p, there passes a normal plane PX which cuts out a curve in M.  That curve has a certain curvature κX when regarded as a curve inside PX.  Provided not all κX are equal, there is some unit vector X1 for which k1 = κX1 is as large as possible, and another unit vector X2 for which k2 = κX2 is as small as possible.  Euler's theorem asserts that X1 and X2 are perpendicular and that, moreover, if X is any vector making an angle θ with X1, then
