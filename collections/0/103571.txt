The ninth track "The Feeling" "touches on questioning the overwhelming and emotional rush of falling in love,"[40] with Bieber and Halsey asking themselves: "Am I in love or am I in love with the feeling?."[52] "Life Is Worth Living" finds Bieber "mull[ing] redemption and forgiveness [...] saying that you can crucify him but 'only God can judge me'." [53] According to one of its songwriters, Jason Boyd, "[It's a] positive record that says life is worth living, we're supposed to live. We're supposed to be here. [...] People making mistakes, learning from them, and not letting that be it, but say, 'You know what? I'm not gonna do that again. Life is worth living, I'm not just gonna give up just because I fell. I'm gonna try harder because my life is worth it.' It just has such a positive meaning, I feel like it's gonna save a lot of lives."[16] "Where Are Ãœ Now" "talks about caring and praying for an ex who didn't return the favor,"[52] "Children" has a social consciousness message and "advocates for making the world a better place for its youngest residents"[52] and was unfavorably compared to Michael Jackson's tracks "Man In the Mirror and "Earth Song".[43][51][54][55][56] The title track, "Purpose", "recounts a time that he was at the end of his rope, but God blessed him with purpose."[53] It ends with a "lengthy voiceover" thoughts about God.[52] "Get Used To It" has "euphemisms about blooming flowers and exploding fireworks," "We Are" features Nas in lines about serendipity and doing yoga," "Trust" talks about "still believing in love",[39] and "All In It" "reflects on trusting God to fill him up inside" and has a spoken outro where he declares that "God is perfect and he never disappoints, so I just get my recognition from Him and give Him my recognition."[52]
