Another major cause of physicians and other healthcare providers treating patients in ways unsupported by the evidence is that these healthcare providers are subject to the same cognitive biases as all other humans. They may reject the evidence because they have a vivid memory of a rare but shocking outcome (the availability heuristic), such as a patient dying after refusing treatment.[81] They may overtreat to "do something" or to address a patient's emotional needs.[81] They may worry about malpractice charges based on a discrepancy between what the patient expects and what the evidence recommends.[81] They may also overtreat or provide ineffective treatments because the treatment feels biologically plausible.[81]
