Populus trichocarpa, the  black cottonwood,[1] western balsam-poplar[2] or California poplar, is a  deciduous broadleaf tree species native to western North America. It is used for timber, and is notable as a model organism in plant biology. A high-coverage genome sequence was published in 2006 and was the first tree genome to be sequenced. Assembly of the genome is particularly difficult due to the tetraploidy of the species. However, long-read Pacbio sequencing enabled the assembly of all scaffolds in 2018.
