The Al-Khalid (Urdu: الخالد ٹینک‬‎—Al-Xālid Ṫaiŋk, pronounced [əl-ˈxɑːlɪd̪ ʈæːŋk] literally "The Eternal Tank") is a main battle tank jointly developed by Pakistan and China during the 1990s, based on the Chinese Type 90-IIM tank.[7] The original prototype was developed by China North Industries Corporation (Norinco) under the name MBT-2000, and Norinco also offer the tank for export under that name.  Around 310 Al Khalid MBTs had been produced by 2014.[8] The Bangladesh Army ordered 44 MBT-2000s from China in 2011.[9][10] The Norinco-made MBT-2000 is also used by the Royal Moroccan Army.[11] It was trialled by the Peruvian Army for possible acquisition, but was not purchased due to financial problems.[1][12]
