During the "Red Terror - White Terror" days 1976 - 1979 he was one of the outspoken "Apostles" of change that nonetheless decried the blood shed others in the leftist movements believed were not only unavoidable but necessary. His vehemence against violence resulted in a newspaper article in which he suggested those thirsty for blood may be better served drinking their wive's menustral flow. Though this comment garnered him the ill-will of those who urged bloodshed and violence there is no indication that it led to anything more than his being sidelined for his immodesty.
