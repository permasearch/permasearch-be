After her return to Melbourne, Giovinazzo, decided to resume her studies and focus more explicitly on the film industry and, in particular, writing and directing. She enrolled in a Bachelor of Film and Television degree at Swinburne University of Technology.[1] While at film school, she was often called upon to act in films under the direction of fellow students. As this progressed, she developed an interest in the craft of acting. After the completion of her degree, she decided to focus on developing her acting skills, and took night classes at a number of private acting schools in Melbourne, Howard Fine and 16th Street, among others.[2]
