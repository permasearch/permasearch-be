The new unicameral Legislature met for the first time in 1937. Though the name of the body is formally the "Nebraska Legislature", during the first session the Legislature adopted a resolution formally giving members the title of "senator." In Nebraska, the Legislature is also often known as "the Unicameral."[6]
