The match statistics followed a similar pattern to those at the 2008 Wimbledon final, with Federer having a lower first serve percentage against Nadal (51% compared to 64%) and again he couldn't be as clinical on break point opportunities with only 31% break points converted for Federer whereas Nadal converted 43% of his break points. However, the total points by each player proved even closer than that at the aforementioned Wimbledon final, as Federer won one more point than Nadal (174 to 173) yet still lost this final.[6]
