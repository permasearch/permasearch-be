Installing a single side pond will save 1/3 of the water, whereas three side ponds will save 60% of the water: the first 1/5 of the water goes into the top pond, the 2nd 1/5 into the middle pond, the 3rd 1/5 into the bottom pond â€“ and 2/5 is wasted at each passage (assuming the area of each pond equals the area of the lock). The formula for     n   {\displaystyle n}   side ponds of optimal altitude and depth, with area of each pond,      a  p     {\displaystyle a_{p}}  , and area of the lock,      a  l     {\displaystyle a_{l}}  , is:
