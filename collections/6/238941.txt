Exploitative competition, also referred to as resource competition, is a form of competition in which one species consumes and either reduces or more efficiently uses a shared limiting resource and therefore depletes the availability of the resource for the other species.[2] Thus, it is an indirect interaction because the competing species interact via a shared resource.
