In 2007, Tesco acquired the Malaysian operation of the wholesaler Makro, which was then rebranded as Tesco Extra and provides products for local retailers. There has been plans to relaunch all its stores in Malaysia to Tesco Extra. Besides giving the store a contemporary design and a brighter look, the new Tesco Extra brand features a shop-in-shop concept with an optic shop, pharmacy, bistro and phone shop. Till date, 7 out of the 52 outlets have been rebranded to the new format namely: Tesco Extra Mutiara Damansara, Tesco Extra Bandar Bukit Puchong, Tesco Extra Ara Damansara, Tesco Extra Seberang Jaya, Tesco Extra Desa Tebrau, Tesco Extra Bandar Bukit Tinggi in Klang, Tesco Extra Mutiara Rini and Tesco Extra Ipoh Garden.
