The Gator Bowl is one of Jacksonville's annual sports highlights. However, the event was once associated with a tragedy. In the early morning of December 29, 1963, the Hotel Roosevelt in downtown Jacksonville caught fire after a post-Gator Bowl party in the ballroom.[4] It was later determined that the party was not the cause of the fire, and that the timing was a coincidence. The fire resulted in 22 deaths.[5]
