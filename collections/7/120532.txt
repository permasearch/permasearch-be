Following the 2016 U.S. presidential election, which Donald Trump won on a campaign of building a border wall and renegotiating NAFTA, Mexican President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto cancelled a visit to the United States.[87] The cancellation came after President Trump signed an executive order on January 25, 2017 calling for the immediate construction of a wall on the United States/Mexican border.[88] As of the end of May 2017, Congress has not appropriated funding for a wall, and no further wall construction has started beyond what was already planned during the Obama administration.[89]
