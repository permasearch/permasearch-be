Disruptive behavior problems are the leading reason for children’s referrals to mental health professionals.[14] and PCIT was first created to target these behaviors.[1] Results from a randomized controlled trial examining the efficacy of PCIT on clinic referred children with diagnoses of Oppositional Defiant Disorder indicated that compared to the waitlist control group, parents interacted more positively with their children and were more successful at gaining compliance.[15] Additionally, parents in the treatment group reported decreased parenting stress and more control. Parents also reported significant improvements in their child’s behavior following treatment.[15]
