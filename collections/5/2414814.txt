The book tells the story of Burns' imprisonment on a chain gang in Georgia in the 1920s, his subsequent escape, and the furor that developed. The story was first published in January 1932, serialized  in True Detective Mysteries magazine.[1] Later that year, Burns' story was made into the motion picture I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang, starring Paul Muni. The book and movie were both credited with helping to reform deplorable conditions on Deep South chain gangs under Governor Ellis Arnall in 1943.
