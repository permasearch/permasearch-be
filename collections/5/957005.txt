Finally, GIZ also hosts the Eschborn Dialogue, a two-day event that offers international experts a forum to exchange knowledge and experiences on a given topic in international cooperation (e.g. "World in motion: mobility, migration, digital change" in 2014 or "Raw materials and resources: growth, values, competition" in 2013). The Eschborn Dialogue has been organized each year since 1988.[25]
