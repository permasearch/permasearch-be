The following is a list of episodes for the anime series Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's (遊戯王ファイブディーズ, Yūgiō Faibu Dīzu), which began airing in Japan on April 2, 2008. The series is currently licensed for release in North America by Konami. However, only 31 episodes from seasons 4 and 5 were dubbed into English by 4Kids Entertainment due to low ratings, pressure to air Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal, and an ongoing lawsuit from TV Tokyo.[1]
