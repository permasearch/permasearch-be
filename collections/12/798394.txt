During the Japanese forced occupation, which began in 1910, Japanese was made the official language of Korea. However, Hangul was still taught in Korean-established schools built after the annexation and Korean was written in a mixed Hanja-Hangul script, where most lexical roots were written in Hanja and grammatical forms in Hangul. and Japan banned earlier Korean literature from the public schooling, which became mandatory for children.
