Another version of airline scheduling is finding the minimum needed crews to perform all the flights. In order to find an answer to this problem, a bipartite graph G' = (A ∪ B, E) is created where each flight has a copy in set A and set B. If the same plane can perform flight j after flight i, i∈A is connected to j∈B. A matching in G' induces a schedule for F and obviously maximum bipartite matching in this graph produces an airline schedule with minimum number of crews.[15] As it is mentioned in the Application part of this article, the maximum cardinality bipartite matching is an application of maximum flow problem.
