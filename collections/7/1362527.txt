The Mitākṣarā, along with the Dāyabhāga, became an influential source for British Courts in India.  The Mitākṣarā was influential throughout the majority of India, except in Bengal and Assam, where the Dāyabhāga prevailed as an authority for law.  The British were interested in administering law in India, but they wanted to administer the law that already existed to the people.  Thus, they searched for a text that could be used to help solve disputes among the people of India in manners which were already customary in the sub continent.  These disputes often involved property rights or inheritance issues.  Thus, the first translation of the Mitākṣarā was by Colebrooke in 1810,[11] and it was only this section of the text that gave the British insight on how to deal with inheritance issues.  At that point, the Mitākṣarā held the status of a legislative text because it was used as a direct resource regarding inheritance in the courts of law in most of India.
