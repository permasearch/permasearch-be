After the national anthems, the New Zealand players performed their traditional haka as the French team stared back and then advanced towards them in a V-shaped formation before fanning out into a straight line.[5] The French had decided to meet the haka in this fashion on Sunday morning, and French captain Thierry Dusautoir stated that "it was a great moment".[6] They were later fined Â£2,500 by the IRB for crossing the half-way line,[7] a decision that was labeled "pedantic" and the "final insult".[8]
