Dennis Nedry is one of the main human antagonists in the novel and film. In the novel, he is described as an obese and messy computer scientist. Nedry works for Hammond as the system's programmer and is in charge of networking Jurassic Park's computers. Although he was not given any details about InGen's operation, Nedry was expected to fix numerous bugs and issues without understanding the ultimate goal. After InGen blackmails him to make changes to the system without further payment, he makes a deal with Dodgson of Biosyn to steal several dinosaur embryos for $1.5 million, and is provided an embryo transfer device disguised as a shaving cream container. In order to steal the embryos, he shuts down the park's security systems, including several electric fences surrounding select dinosaur paddocks. He intended to steal embryos from a secure lab, drive them through the park to a waiting agent at the dock, and return to his post before being noticed. Although it was only meant to be temporary, he crashes his Jeep and is subsequently blinded and killed by a Dilophosaurus because an unexpected storm causes him to miss crucial road signs. In the novel, his body is later found by Muldoon and Gennaro. Although Nedry's pride in his knowledge of complex computer systems made him feel more important than the other workers, Lex (film)/Tim (novel) is later able to navigate the system easily in order to restore power to the visitor's center.[jp 10]
