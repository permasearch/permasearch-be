There were several defects with the organization of the Joseon-era Korean military defense system.[116] One example was a policy that stated that local officers could not individually respond to a foreign invasion outside of their jurisdiction until a higher ranking general, appointed by the King's court, arrived with a newly mobilized army.[116] This arrangement was highly inefficient since the nearby forces would remain stationary until the mobile border commander arrived on the scene and took control.[116] Secondly, as the appointed general often came from an outside region, he was likely to be unfamiliar with the natural environment, the available technology, and manpower of the invaded region.[116] Finally, as a main army was never maintained, new and ill-trained recruits conscripted during war constituted a significant part of the army.[116]
