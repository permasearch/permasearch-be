After some territorial disputes, war broke out between Stefan Nemanja, Grand prince of RaÅ¡ka, and the city of Dubrovnik, at that time under Norman suzerainty. In 1185, Nemanja attacked the city and laid siege to it,[32] but a Ragusan counter-attack drove Nemanja's forces back. According to chronicles from Dubrovnik, which are accepted by most historians, the siege ultimately failed.[Note 4][32] How much help Dubrovnik received from the Normans while repelling the siege is also not known exactly.[32]
