Hillary Clinton assumed the office of Secretary of State on January 21, 2009. In mid-November 2008, President-elect Obama and Clinton discussed the possibility of her serving as U.S. Secretary of State in his administration,[20] along with rumored nominees such as Bill Richardson, John Kerry, Sam Nunn and Chuck Hagel[21] and on November 21, reports indicated that she had accepted the position.[22] Clinton was floated in emails by Obama transition officials as a possible secretary of health and human services.[23] On December 1, President-elect Obama formally announced that Clinton would be his nominee for Secretary of State.[24] Clinton said she was reluctant to leave the Senate, but that the new position represented a "difficult and exciting adventure".[24] The appointment required a Saxbe fix, as Clinton was then a member of the United States Senate.[25] As part of the nomination, Clinton's husband, former president Bill Clinton, agreed to accept a number of conditions and restrictions regarding his ongoing activities and fundraising efforts for the Clinton Presidential Center and Clinton Global Initiative.[26]
