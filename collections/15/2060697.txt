Earlier investigative work published in 2000 by a team led by British virologist, John Oxford[4] of St Bartholomew's Hospital and the Royal London Hospital, suggested that a principal British troop staging camp in Ã‰taples, France was at the center of the 1918 flu pandemic or at least a significant precursor virus to it. There had been a mysterious respiratory infection at the military base during the winter of 1915-16.[5]
