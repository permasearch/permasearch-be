The first single, "Game of Thrones", was inspired by the soundtrack for the HBO series, which Josh Page called "the perfect subject matter to justify an epic opera performance."[37] Since its theme had no lyrics, Page adapted High Valyrian text from Game of Thrones and set it to the music composed by Ramin Djawadi.[14] The video for the single was shot over two days' time at Sands Point on Long Island,[26] and self-released by Forte in February 2015.[38] It was a top-five hit on YouTube's "Just-Released Music Videos" list in March.[39] When the video was shared by the official Game of Thrones Twitter account, Page said, "it knocked the air out of me."[37]
