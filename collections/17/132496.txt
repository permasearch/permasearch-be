Extreme events, such as droughts and floods, are forecast to increase as climate change and global warming takes hold.[60] Ranging from overnight floods to gradually worsening droughts, these will have a range of effects on the agricultural sector.  According to the Climate & Development Knowledge Network report Managing Climate Extremes and Disasters in the Agriculture Sectors: Lessons from the IPCC SREX Report, the effects will include changing productivity and livelihood patterns, economic losses, and effects on infrastructure, markets and food security. Food security in future will be linked to our ability to adapt agricultural systems to extreme events.  An example of a shifting weather pattern would be a rise in temperatures.  As temperatures rise due to climate change there is a risk of a diminished food supply due to heat damage.[61]
