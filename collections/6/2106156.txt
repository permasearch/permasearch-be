In 1901, the team played its first game, losing to Livingstone College. The team played only one game during the 1901 season and did not field another team until 1906.[2] In the program's early years, the team would sporadically field teams, having periods between 1907â€“1911; 1913; and 1917 where there was no team. Due to the outbreak of World War I, the school did not field a team, but resumed play once again in 1919 competing against neighboring Bennett College.[3] It wasn't until 1923, that A&T's first coach of record, L.P. Byarm, would come along to lead the team.[4]
