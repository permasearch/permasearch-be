In April 2009, Sonakshi Sinha signed for her debut role.[13] Salman had seen her at a function engaging in dancing and offered her the role.[10] Speaking about it, she said that she had lost a weight of 30Â kg over two years to prepare for her character of a village girl by "a combination of proper diet and vigorous exercise". She added that she had been "observing people and trying to pick up nuances" as a step of further preparation.[14] Malaika Arora, who had performed a few item numbers in her career, most notably in Dil Se.., was confirmed to do the same in the film. This was the first of its kind in her home production.[15]
