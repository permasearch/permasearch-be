In 2016 official CSO figures indicated that the economic recovery had led to 26.3% growth in GDP in 2015 and 18.7% growth in GNP.[114] There was a suggestion that the accounting practices of multinationals (including shallow or shell companies) contributed to the figures.[115][116] Some economists described the 26.3% figure as "meaningless" and "farcical".[115][117]
