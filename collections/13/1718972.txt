The Deathly Hallows are three magical objects that are the focus of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows â€“ an unbeatable wand, a stone to bring the dead to life, and a cloak of invisibility. When owned by one person, they are said to give mastery over death. The objects are generally remembered only as part of a wizard's fairy tale called The Tale of the Three Brothers, and have become mythological over time, but a small number of wizards including Dumbledore still believe in their existence and seek them. According to Rowling, the story about how these objects came into existence is based upon Geoffrey Chaucer's The Pardoner's Tale.[2]
