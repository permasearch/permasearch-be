FOX Sports Sun shares the broadcast rights to the aforementioned professional sports teams with Fox Sports Florida. As the two regional networks are commonly owned, events from any team/conference in which Fox Sports Sun and Fox Sports Florida broadcasts are able to air on either channel depending on the start time of each team's respective games (particularly with the Marlins and Rays, since both teams routinely play at concurring start times).
