The North Sea is Europe's main fishery accounting for over 5% of international commercial fish caught.[1] Fishing in the North Sea is concentrated in the southern part of the coastal waters. The main method of fishing is trawling.[142] In 1995, the total volume of fish and shellfish caught in the North Sea was approximately 3.5 million tonnes.[143] Besides fish, it is estimated that one million tonnes of unmarketable by-catch is caught and discarded each year.[144]
