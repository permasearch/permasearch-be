Quarterback Garrett Gilbert was named the starter for the Longhorns August 29 in their season opening against Rice University. However, on September 12, it was announced that Gilbert was being moved to the second-string quarterback behind Case McCoy and David Ash who would be sharing the starting position for the duration of the season. On September 20, it was announced that Gilbert underwent successful surgery on his shoulder and will be out the remainder of the season. Knowing that his future in Austin looked bleak, Gilbert sought an unconditional release, which was granted to him on October 5.[33] Gilbert finished his degree at Texas before moving to Southern Methodist University in Dallas to continue his football career.
