In 2014, Dinklage starred in the comedy horror film Knights of Badassdom opposite Ryan Kwanten and Steve Zahn. The film is about three best friends that go to the woods and reenact a live action Dungeons & Dragons role play, when they mistakenly conjure up a demon from Hell.[73] The same year, he played the villain Bolivar Trask in the superhero film X-Men: Days of Future Past.[74] The movie was the sixth highest-grossing film of 2014 with global revenues of $747.9 million.[75] In preparation for his role, Dinklage stated that he did not want to approach the character necessarily as a villain, saying that Trask "actually sees what he's doing as a good thing."[76] He also voiced the AI Ghost in the 2014 video game Destiny,[77] but was replaced by Nolan North in August 2015.[78]
