In the 19th century, microbiologists such as Louis Pasteur and Jules Francois Joubert observed antagonism between some bacteria and discussed the merits of controlling these interactions in medicine.[4] In 1928, Alexander Fleming became the first to discover a natural antimicrobial fungus known as Penicillium rubens and named the extracted substance penicillin which in 1942 was successfully used to treat a Streptococcus infection.[5]
