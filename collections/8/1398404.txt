In Nicaragua, American diplomats quietly favored rebel forces under Juan Estrada against the government of President, José Santos Zelaya, who wanted to revoke commercial concessions granted to American companies.[43] Secretary Knox was reportedly a major stockholder in one of the companies that would be hurt by such a move.[44] The country was in debt to several foreign powers, and the U.S. was unwilling to have it (along with its alternate canal route) fall into the hands of Europeans. Zelaya's elected successor, José Madriz, could not put down the rebellion as U.S. forces interfered, and in August 1910, Estrada's forces took Managua, the capital. The U.S. had Nicaragua accept a loan, and sent officials to ensure it was repaid from government revenues. The country remained unstable, and after another coup in 1911 and more disturbances in 1912, Taft sent troops; though most were soon withdrawn, some remained as late as 1933.[45][46]
