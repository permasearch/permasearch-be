Sapphire 'Saph' Fox, (played by Saffron Coomber), was a resident of "Elm Tree House" during all three series of "Tracy Beaker Returns", although due to a busy schedule, the character only appeared on a recurring basis during the third series. Coomber did not return for the Tracy Beaker Returns spin-off, The Dumping Ground. Sapphire is tall and of mixed race. She has long (it is shorter in series 2) dark-brown curly hair and often wears large earrings, and her character is a guide and an older sister to most of the children, notably Harry Jones (Phillip Graham Scott). She attends college as of the third series. She can be motherly and overprotective to Harry, but also hides many secrets. During the third series she gets her own flat, but due to a flood she finds herself moving back to Elm Tree House and sharing with Elektra. She is sixteen on her last appearance.
