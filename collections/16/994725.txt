UTF-8 has been the dominant character encoding for the World Wide Web since 2009, and as of November 2017 accounts for 90.3% of all Web pages. (The next-most popular multibyte encodings, Shift JIS and GB 2312, have 0.8% and 0.6% respectively).[7][8][6] The Internet Mail Consortium (IMC) recommended that all e-mail programs be able to display and create mail using UTF-8,[9] and the W3C recommends UTF-8 as the default encoding in XML and HTML.[10]
