Kushina successfully delivers Naruto but their celebration comes short when Tobi suddenly appears, killing both Taji and Biwako and holding the newborn hostage. Though Minato quickly saves Naruto, Tobi succeeds in freeing the Nine Tails and taking control of the Tailed Beast with his Sharingan. Tobi then tries to eliminate Kushina, but she is quickly saved by Minato and left with her son as the Fourth Hokage pursues the masked ninja, who summons the Nine Tails to attack Konoha. As Minato arrives in Konoha and warps away the Nine Tails' Tailed Beast Bomb, Tobi engages Minato in a battle of teleportation until Minato cleverly defeats his opponent with his Rasengan and applies the contract seal to remove control of the Nine Tails.
