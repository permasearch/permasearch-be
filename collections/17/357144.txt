Another possible alternative is a yeast-based coproduct of bioethanol production, proteinaceous fermentation biomass. Substituting such products for engineered feed can result in equal (sometimes enhanced) growth in fish.[80] With its increasing availability, this would address the problems of rising costs for buying hatchery fish feed.
