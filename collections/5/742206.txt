This rate gives demographers an idea of how a certain country's population is growing. RNI excludes in-migration and out-migration, giving an indication of population growth based only on births and deaths. RNI can indicate what stage of the Demographic Transition Model (DTM) a country is in. Trends in RNI can predict a country's economic stability, level of development, and other things.[2]
