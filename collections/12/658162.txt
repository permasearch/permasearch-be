In North America, Ghost in the Shell opened alongside The Boss Baby and The Zookeeper's Wife, and was projected to gross around $25 million from 3,440 theaters in its opening weekend.[44] It made $1.8 million from Thursday night previews and $7.7 million on Friday. It opened to a less-than-expected $19 million, finishing third at the box office behind The Boss Baby and Beauty and the Beast. Deadline.com attributed the poor opening to below-average critical reviews, an unclear marketing campaign, and no social media presence by Johansson.[45] In its second weekend the film grossed $7.4 million, dropping 60.4% and finishing 5th at the box office.[46]
