Before 2005, fossil findings indicated that grasses evolved around 55 million years ago. Recent findings of grass-like phytoliths in Cretaceous dinosaur coprolites have pushed this date back to 66 million years ago.[10][11] In 2011, revised dating of the origins of the rice tribe Oryzeae suggested a date as early as 107 to 129 Mya.[12] A multituberculate mammal with "grass-eating" adaptations seems to suggest that grasses were already around at 120 mya.[13][dubious â€“ discuss]
