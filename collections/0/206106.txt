Michigan's athletic director appointed Lloyd Carr as interim head coach for the 1995 season. Carr became the permanent head coach after an 8–2 start and Michigan finished his first season at 9–4.[19][69] Carr had similar success in his second season, going 8–4 and earning a trip to the 1997 Outback Bowl.[19] Carr returned a strong squad for the 1997 season, led by cornerback and punt returner Charles Woodson. Michigan went undefeated in 1997, with the defense smothering opponents; the only team to score more than 16 points on Michigan that year were the Iowa Hawkeyes.[17][19] Overall, the Michigan defense only allowed 9.5 points per game and ended the season ranked No. 1 in the AP Poll, giving Michigan its first national championship since 1948 with a victory in the 1998 Rose Bowl.[17][33] For his efforts, Woodson won the Heisman Trophy and was selected 4th overall in the 1998 NFL Draft by the Oakland Raiders.[70]
