The Twelfth Amendment mandates that the Congress assemble in joint session to count the electoral votes and declare the winners of the election.[1] The session is ordinarily required to take place on January 6 in the calendar year immediately following the meetings of the presidential electors.[2] The Twentieth Amendment now provides that the newly elected Congress declares the winner of the election. Until 1936, the outgoing Congress counted the electoral votes.
