On September 27, the Phillies came into Pittsburgh for a four-game series against the Pirates. The Phillies were ahead by 6 games with seven games left: four against the Pirates and the last three against the Cardinals.[92] The Phillies won the opener, 6–4, and with the Florida Marlins winning at home against the second place Montréal Expos, 3–1, clinched at least a tie for first place in the division.[95] The next day, the Phillies were trailing 4–3 after giving up three runs in the sixth, but with a six-run seventh inning, capped by Mariano Duncan's grand slam home run, they won their first division title since winning the 1983 National League pennant.[96][97][98] Outfielder Wes Chamberlain ended all the references to 1964,  screaming, "It's 1993, baby! It ain't 1964. Where are all those ghosts now?"[96][97] Many Phillies fans had made the cross-state trip to Pittsburgh to see their team clinch and after the game, manager Jim Fregosi threw his cap to them as he walked off the field.[99] Although Fregosi won the American League West title as manager of the California Angels in 1979, he said that 1993 was "the most gratifying year I have ever spent in baseball. It's just great. There's nothing like that. I'm just so proud of these guys. They've been great all year long."[96]
