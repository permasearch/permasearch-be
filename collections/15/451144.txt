In Italy, which was united by liberals and radicals (risorgimento), liberals not conservatives emerged as the party of the Right.[82] In the Netherlands, conservatives merged into a new Christian democratic party in 1980.[83] In Austria, Germany, Portugal and Spain, conservatism was transformed into and incorporated into fascism or the far right.[84] In 1940, all Japanese parties were merged into a single fascist party. Following the war, Japanese conservatives briefly returned to politics but were largely purged from public office.[85]
