The Passenger Movement Charge (PMC) is an excise tax levied by the Australian government on all passengers departing on international flights or maritime transport.[14] The PMC replaced the departure tax in 1995 and was initially described as a charge to partially offset the cost to government of the provision of passenger facilitation at airports, principally customs, immigration and quarantine functions. It is classified by the International Air Transport Association as a departure tax, rather than an airport charge, as its revenue does not directly contribute to passenger processing at airports or sea ports.
