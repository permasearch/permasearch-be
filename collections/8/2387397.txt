A few major changes were made this season. The show was moved back to New York, after being housed in Los Angeles since cycle 4. The number of contestants was also increased to 14, after being maintained at 13 since cycle 5. Finally, the judging panel, unchanged since cycle 5, was also altered; Twiggy was replaced by Czech model Paulina Porizkova due to the former's scheduling conflicts.[1]
