Following the successful opening of the CRB in 1923, public discussion of contraception became more commonplace, and the term "birth control" became firmly established in the nation's vernacular.[99] Of the hundreds of references to birth control in magazines and newspapers of the 1920s, more than two-thirds were favorable.[100] The availability of contraception signaled the end of the stricter morality of the Victorian era, and ushered in the emergence of a more sexually permissive society.[100] Other factors that contributed to the new sexual norms included increased mobility brought by the automobile, anonymous urban lifestyles, and post-war euphoria.[100] Sociologists who surveyed women in Muncie, Indiana in 1925 found that all the upper class women approved of birth control, and more than 80 percent of the working class women approved.[101] The birth rate in America declined 20 percent between 1920 and 1930, primarily due to increased use of birth control.[102]
