Persecution of the Jews by the Nazi occupation government, particularly in the urban areas, began immediately after the commencement of the occupation. In the first year and a half, the Germans confined themselves to stripping the Jews of their property, herding them into ghettos (approximately 400 were established beginning in October 1939) and putting them into forced labor in war-related industries.[165] Thousands of Jews survived by managing to stay outside the ghettos.[48] During this period, a Jewish so-called community leadership, Judenrat, was required by the Germans in every town with a substantial Jewish population and was able to some extent to bargain with the Germans.[165] Already during this initial stage tens of thousands of Jews died because of factors such as overcrowding, disease and starvation.[166] Others survived, supported by the Jewish social self-help agency and the informal trading and smuggling of food and necessities into the ghettos.[167]
