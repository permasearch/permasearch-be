One important piece of advice Yamamoto gave Kurosawa was that a good director needed to master screenwriting.[20] Kurosawa soon realized that the potential earnings from his scripts were much higher than what he was paid as an assistant director.[21] Kurosawa would later write or co-write all of his own films. He also frequently wrote screenplays for other directors such as for the antiwar film director Satsuo Yamamoto's film, A Triumph of Wings (Tsubasa no gaika, 1942). This outside scriptwriting would serve Kurosawa as a lucrative sideline lasting well into the 1960s, long after he became world-famous.[22][23]
