With Gemma in hiding, Unser returns to Charming with a plan to retire and turn the police department over to Deputy Chief David Hale.  However, Hale's death at Half-Sack's funeral forces Unser to stay on as Charming's Chief of Police.  The actions at Half-Sack's funeral plant seeds of doubt in Unser's mind regarding the SOA and their place in Charming.  Having seized upon these doubts, Hale then approaches Unser, telling him SAMCRO can no longer keep violence out of Charming, and he would support Charming Police if Unser would support Hale in Charming's mayoral race.  Unser later confronts Clay Morrow about his fears and doubts, advising that knowing Charming would be protected allowed Unser to sleep at night, despite knowing he had been overlooking SAMCRO's illegal activities; however, Unser is no longer sure SAMCRO can keep up their end of the deal.  Clay assures Unser that the MC could keep peace in Charming, but when Earnst Darby informs Hale that he'd witnessed SAMCRO selling illegal medication at a clinic near Charming, a raid on SAMCRO's headquarters is quickly organized, and Unser does not tip off the club (Darby told Hale he believed that SAMCRO was probably stashing OxyContin at their headquarters, although what he actually witnessed was HIV medication being sold to the clinic).
