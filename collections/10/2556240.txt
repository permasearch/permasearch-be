The stunt can be dangerous, as there is a risk of gagging on the cinnamon, especially if it forms a clump and clogs one's airways. Accidental inhalation of cinnamon can seriously damage the lungs[3] by causing inflammation and leading to infection.[9] The usual result of this stunt is "a coughing, gagging fit involving clouds of cinnamon" which "leaves some people gasping for air".[9] Sometimes those performing the stunt may gag, choke or cough and accidentally exhale the cinnamon through their noses, coating their skin and mucous membranes in cinnamon.[10] As cinnamon is rich in the compound cinnamaldehyde, the challenge often results in considerable irritation, discomfort, burning, or itching of the affected nasal tissue and nostrils. On YouTube, people have been seen "coughing, choking and lunging for water, usually as friends watch and laugh."[11] Vomiting is also known to have occurred.[11]
