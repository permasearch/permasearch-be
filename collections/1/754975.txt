Devon White (Devon Abner) is an office worker in Supplier Relations. He was an office employee who sat across from Creed (who was directly responsible for getting Devon fired, to save his own job). Devon (dressed as a hobo) was reluctantly laid off by Michael on "Halloween", and took it badly, smashing a pumpkin on Michael's car in retaliation. The episode marks his only dialogue in front of the camera. When Michael later receives a $3,000 Christmas bonus because Dunder Mifflin saved money through downsizing, he considers calling Devon to thank him, saying "some good came of it."
