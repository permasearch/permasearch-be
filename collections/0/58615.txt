An elevator with a counterbalance approximates an ideal Atwood machine and thereby relieves the driving motor from the load of holding the elevator cab â€” it has to overcome only weight difference and inertia of the two masses. The same principle is used for funicular railways with two connected railway cars on inclined tracks, and for the elevators on the Eiffel Tower which counterbalance each other. Ski lifts are another example, where the gondolas move on a closed (continuous) pulley system up and down the mountain. The ski lift is similar to the counter-weighted elevator, but with a constraining force provided by the cable in the vertical dimension thereby achieving work in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions. Boat lifts [3] are another type of counter-weighted elevator system approximating an Atwood machine.
