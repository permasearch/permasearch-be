Additionally, Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, winners of the Academy Award for Best Original Song for writing the lyrics for "City of Stars" in La La Land, were the authors of another song written for the episode, "Runnin' Home to You", which was performed by Gustin. Kreisberg commented, "Benj and Justin are the premiere songwriting duo of our time... To have them be a part of our musical episode is beyond our wildest expectations. We hope everyone falls in love with the song they wrote for us as much as we did."[10]
