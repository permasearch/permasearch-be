PSLV C29 lifted off from the First Launch Pad (FLP) of SDSC SHAR at 18:00 hrs [IST] on 16 December 2015. It successfully deployed six satellites it carried with gross weight of 624Â kg. After fourth stage engines were cut off primary payload TeLEOS-1 was injected in orbit at about 18 min 12 seconds after lift-off. This was followed by the deployment of other five satellites, namely Kent Ridge-1, VELOX-C1, VELOX-II, Galassia and Athenoxat-1 in quick succession in the subsequent three minutes.[172] 67 minutes into flight fourth stage re-ignition capability was demonstrated successfully by firing its engines for duration of nearly five seconds. This capability would enable multiple satellite deployment in varying orbits on same flight.[86]
