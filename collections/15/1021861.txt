Carol invites the new pastor and his wife for lunch after church one Sunday. Frank worries because he feels like he is being watched by an informant to God. He nervously promises the pastor that he'll go to church the next Sunday; the Lambert children are upset because a big Packers game will be on! Frank drags them all to church, but J.T. sneaks up to the attic to watch the game with the pastor's son (Eric Balfour) after the sermon starts. When Al and Brendan attempt to follow J.T.'s lead, Frank realizes something is up and makes them tell him where J.T. is. When Frank goes upstairs to find his son, he gets into the game and ends up falling through the old floorboards, landing right behind the pastor. Cody and his friends Slasher (Donald Gibb) and Death attend church as well.
