Helen Eileen Brandmeir was born in 1930 in Seattle, Washington. Her father owned a lumber mill, which came under severe stress during the Great Depression.  Helen would later describe how her observations of her father would shape her personality, and in particular how it would teach her to value independence and problem-solving.[1]
