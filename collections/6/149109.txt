"The first inversion of the triad is considered, by many, preferable to root position. The second inversion of the triad is unusual. Some theorists forbid its use." (Gardner 1918, 48-9) "VII occurs most often in its first inversion." (Goldman 1965, 72) "The chord of the sub-tonic is almost never used except in its first inversion." (Root 1872, 315) "Like II [iio] in minor, it occurs rarely in fundamental position. When represented by its first inversion it often stands between I and I6." (Forte 1979, 122)
