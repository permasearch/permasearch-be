The main attack upon the RAF's defences was code-named Adlerangriff ("Eagle Attack"). Intelligence reports gave GÃ¶ring the impression that the RAF was almost defeated, and raids would attract British fighters for the Luftwaffe to shoot down.[129] The strategy agreed on 6 August was to destroy RAF Fighter Command across the south of England in four days, then bombing of military and economic targets was to systematically extend up to the Midlands until daylight attacks could proceed unhindered over the whole of Britain, culminating in a major bombing attack on London.[130][208]
