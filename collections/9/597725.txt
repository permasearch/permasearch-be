The gang goes to Wanko's Warehouse for an 80%-off sale, but they find out it does not start until the next morning. Jade suggests that they all hide out in the store overnight so they can be the first ones there and avoid the long lines. However, the security system gets turned on, leaving them trapped in an aisle by laser beams. Robbie is able to get under the beams and tries to turn off the alarms, but stumbles upon two burglars. Meanwhile, Jade complains that she is hungry and Cat walks through the laser beams to get her a sandwich but accidentally sets off the alarm. They all run outside, covering their heads with tubs, and manage to get away unseen by the security cameras.
