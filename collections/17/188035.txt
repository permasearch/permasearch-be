On 6 May 2008 plans were announced for the Craig Bellamy Foundation in Sierra Leone.[106] Bellamy first visited the formerly war-torn West African country in 2007 and has subsequently invested Â£1.4m of his own money[107] to build a not-for-profit football academy in the Western Area Rural District village of Tombo where 32 boys receive an international standard education and elite-level football coaching for free. By positioning football alongside education[108] the Craig Bellamy Foundation hopes to produce well-rounded young men with bright futures both on and off the pitch.[109]
