The song is a moderate up-tempo describing a young male named Bobby, who lives in a lower-class community with rather difficult economical issues. Bobby is an aspiring young singer and musician whose lifelong dream is to have a successful career in the music business; however, people in his community beg to differ and advise Bobby to instead choose a more realistic source of income, as they believe a career in music is not a good option; Bobby ignores their advice and continues his quest to pursue his dreams and prove all of the nonbelievers wrong. A decade passes before Bobby finally achieves those dreams; he is now the most successful recording artist (presumably in country music) with a top concert tour and number-one radio singles to his credit. Bobby subsequently performs a homecoming concert at the height of his career; and during his performance, he happens to hear a singing voice coming from the front row of the audience, which is revealed to be another young male who has the exact same dreams and ambitions that Bobby once had long ago.
