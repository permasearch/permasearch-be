In January 2016, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred indicated that the National League might adopt the DH for the 2017 season when a new collective bargaining agreement is created after the current one expires on December 31, 2016.[11] However, he later backtracked on this statement to say that he does not see unification coming any time soon.[12] Accordingly, the DH rule was not adopted by the National League for 2017.
