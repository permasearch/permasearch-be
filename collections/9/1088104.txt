Historically, as of 1600, the tribes living in Pennsylvania were the Algonquian Lenape (also Delaware), the Iroquoian Susquehannock & Petun (also Tionontati, Kentatentonga, Tobacco, Wenro) [19] and the presumably Siouan Monongahela Culture, who may have been the same as a little known tribe called the Calicua, or Cali.[20] Other tribes who entered the region during the colonial era were the Trockwae,[21] Tutelo, Saponi, Shawnee, Nanticoke, Conoy Piscataway, Iroquois Confederacyâ€”possibly among others.[22][23][24][25]
