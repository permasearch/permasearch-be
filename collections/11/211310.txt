Te Papa was designed by Jasmax Architects[19] and built by Fletcher Construction.[20] The 36,000 square metre building had cost NZ$300 million by its opening in 1998. Earthquake strengthening of the Cable Street building was achieved through the New Zealand-developed technology of base isolation[21] â€“ essentially seating the entire building on supports made from lead, steel and rubber that slow down the effect of an earthquake.
