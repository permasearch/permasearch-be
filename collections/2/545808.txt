Martial artists often address their teachers as sensei. Junior and senior students are organized via a senpai/k≈çhai system. Also in some systems of karate, O-Sensei is the title of the (deceased) head of the style. This is how the founder of Aikido, Morihei Ueshiba is often referred to by practitioners of that art. The 'O' prefix itself, translating roughly as "great[er]" or "major," is also an honorific.
