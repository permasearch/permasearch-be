Left with few options and little hope of victory, the inhabitants of Planet X powered up their ultimate weapon: a Death Star-like planetary cannon, in order to wipe out the transformers on Giant Planet. Unfortunately, the cannon was too powerful for them to control and the result destroyed their world. The survivors, including Soundwave and Sideways, were scattered all across their universe, and were eventually thrown into the Transformers' proper universe. Believing Giant Planet to be at fault for their home planet's destruction, the various Transformers plotted revenge against them. In addition, the Giant Planet Transformers also felt at least partially responsible for Planet X's annihilation. This created their custom of building cities and then abandoning them, which became a perpetual, planet-wide act of penance. Eventually, Sideways and Soundwave managed to return to Giant Planet, and sought the Cyber Planet Keys in order to exact their revenge.
