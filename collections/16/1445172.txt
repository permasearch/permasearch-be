Colonel Anderson, having failed to attract his former slaves back, sold the land for a pittance to try to get out of debt.[3] Two years later he was dead at the age of 44.[3] Prior to 2006, historian Raymond Winbush tracked down the living relatives of the Colonel in Big Spring, reporting that they "are still angry at Jordan for not coming back," knowing that the plantation was in serious disrepair after the war.[3]
