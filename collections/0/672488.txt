Anyone wishing to sell a vehicle that is over four years old must first have a smog check performed. It is the sellerâ€™s responsibility to get the smog certificate prior to the sale. If the vehicle is registered in California and was acquired from a spouse, domestic partner, sibling, child, parent, grandparent, or grandchild it is exempt.[4]
