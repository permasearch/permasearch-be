In 2018 Bahrain has a per capita GDP of US$25,546.[6] Bahrain has the Persian Gulf's first "post-oil" economy.[7] Since the late 20th century, Bahrain has heavily invested in the banking and tourism sectors.[8]  The country's capital, Manama, is home to many large financial institutions. Bahrain has a high Human Development Index (ranked 48th in the world) and was recognised by the World Bank as a high income economy. Bahrain has expanded its industrial capacity to include aluminum production and signed a Free Trade Agreement with the United States in an effort to expand its export base. Bahrain has also positioned itself as a strong player in Islamic banking in an effort to expand beyond resource exports and into a greater role in the international service industry.[9]
