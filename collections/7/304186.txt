Cameron Hayes, a member of the True IRA, offers SAMCRO a free shipment of guns if they will carry out a hit on Brenan Hefner, the man who killed his cousin Michael McKeavey. Jax, Bobby and Opie then go to the hotel room, where he sees his African American mistress. Opie is supposed to shoot him when he leaves the room, but freezes and Bobby steps in and shoots him at close range with a silenced pistol.[13]
