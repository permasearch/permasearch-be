On 9 October 2010, the Ugandan newspaper Rolling Stone published a front-page article titled "100 Pictures of Uganda's Top Homos Leak" that listed the names, addresses, and photographs of 100 homosexuals alongside a yellow banner that read "Hang Them".[81] The paper also alleged that homosexuals aimed to recruit Ugandan children. This publication attracted international attention and criticism from human rights organisations, such as Amnesty International,[82] No Peace Without Justice[83] and the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association.[84] According to gay rights activists, many Ugandans have been attacked since the publication.[85] On 27 January 2011, gay rights activist David Kato was murdered.[86]
