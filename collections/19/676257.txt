The character and Ridley's performance have received critical acclaim. Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal proclaimed that Rey is "a woman warrior with the stylish ferocity of a kung-fu star", praising "the verve [Ridley] must have been born with plus the skill she must have acquired as a young actress coming up in England", later adding "It's hard to imagine what the movie—and the sequels to come—might have been if they'd cast the wrong person, but here Daisy Ridley is in all her unassuming glory, and all's right with the galaxy".[40] Adam Howard of MSNBC stated that "one of the most pleasant surprises of the film has been the strength of its lead female character", adding that some have likened Rey to a "new feminist icon".[41] Relatedly, Emily Rome of HitFix argued that Rey is "everything we wanted in a Star Wars female character", praising her for being a character that is "independent, skilled, scrappy, tough, and doesn't need saving".[42] In a personal essay, Nicole Sperling of Entertainment Weekly wrote about her daughters feeling empowered after viewing the film, stating, "They never commented on how pretty Rey is. They never had to flinch because Rey was a sexual object to some man in power. They just felt strong. Equal".[43]
