Scottish scientist James Clerk Maxwell was particularly influentialâ€”his discoveries ushered in the era of modern physics.[62] His most prominent achievement was to formulate a set of equations that described electricity, magnetism, and optics as manifestations of the same phenomenon, namely the electromagnetic field.[63] The unification of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves and was the basis for the future development of radio technology by Hughes, Marconi and others.[64]
