"You Don't Love Me (No, No, No)" is a song by Jamaican recording artist Dawn Penn from her debut studio album, No, No, No (1994). The song's lyrics are credited to Penn, Bo Diddley and Willie Cobbs, and production was handled by Steely and Clevie. Penn recorded a song in 1967 called "You Don't Love Me", which incorporates elements of the music and lyrics of Cobbs' 1960 song "You Don't Love Me". The Cobbs song was, in turn, based on Diddley's 1955 song "She's Fine, She's Mine". Thus, both are credited as songwriters on Penn's recording. In 1994, after a 17-year break from the music industry, she re-recorded a dancehall version of the song retitled "You Don't Love Me (No, No, No)".
