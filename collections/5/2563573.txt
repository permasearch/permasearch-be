Count "Drac" Dracula (voiced by Adam Sandler in the films, David Berni in the TV series) is based on the Count Dracula of lore. Although he is a vampire, he has no cravings for human blood, saying that he drinks a blood substitute and "you can't tell the difference". He also dislikes people implying he says "Bleh bleh bleh" all the time, as he only ever says it to state that he doesn't say it.
