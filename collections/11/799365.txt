On May 16, 2017, ABC chief Channing Dungey announced at ABC's upfront presentation that the network had given a straight-to-series order for a second Grey's Anatomy spin-off. Stacy McKee, a long-term Grey's writer and executive producer, will serve as showrunner and executive producer, with Shonda Rhimes and Betsy Beers also serving as executive producers. The series, which would be set in a Seattle firehouse, would follow the lives of a group of firefighters.[20] The order consisted of 10 episodes.[2] When announcing the series, Dungey said, "No one can interweave the jeopardy firefighters face in the line of duty with the drama in their personal lives quite like Shonda, and Grey's signature Seattle setting is the perfect backdrop for this exciting spinoff."[21] Patrick Moran, president at ABC Studios, added that "We talked [with Shonda] about the elements of Grey's Anatomy that seem to resonate with the audience — emotional storytelling, deep human connection, a high-stakes environment and strong and empowered women — and those elements will carry over to the spinoff."[22] In July 2017, Paris Barclay signed on to the series as producing director and executive producer.[23] In January 2018, it was announced that Ellen Pompeo had renewed her contract to portray Meredith Grey through season 16 of Grey's, in addition to becoming a producer on the show and a co-executive producer on the spin-off.[24] Later that month, ABC announced that the series would be titled Station 19.[25]
