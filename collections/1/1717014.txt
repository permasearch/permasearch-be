Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy gave the song 3 out of 5 stars, saying "this track doesn't live up to the hype surrounding its singer, but the choppy guitars and whooshing synths have a certain charm."[5] In his review for MusicOMH, Darren Harvey called "Hot n Cold" a "Tiffany-style '80s pop number".[6] ChartAttack noted the "frenetic dance-pop" of the track.[7] In a less positive review, Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine criticized the song, saying "Perry confuses political incorrectness with being subversive on tracks like "Hot n Cold," in which she, in the process of skewering guys who change their minds 'like girls change clothes,' just winds up sounding mildly sexist."[10] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times compared the song to "U + Ur Hand" by Pink, which was also produced by Dr. Luke, saying that it does not share the latter's "passion".[11] Lizzie Ennever of BBC felt the track was not "the most single-worthy song".[12] The Guardian wrote that the song "didn't seem to capture the public's imagination" the way her previous single "I Kissed a Girl" did.[13] The song was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards,[14] but lost to Beyonc√©'s "Halo".[15]
