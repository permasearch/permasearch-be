The rise of theological modernism in the latter 19th and early 20th centuries also greatly affected Baptists.[75] The Landmark movement, already mentioned, has been described as a reaction among Southern Baptists in the United States against incipient modernism .[76] In England, Charles Haddon Spurgeon fought against modernistic views of the Scripture in the Downgrade Controversy and severed his church from the Baptist Union as a result.[77][78][79]
