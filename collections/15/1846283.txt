On October 15, 2010, Bose released the AE2 circumaural (termed "around-ear" by Bose). Connection is through a detachable cord that connects to the left side of the headphones. The foam on the original headband from the original AE1 Triport has been replaced with a synthetic leather and the earpieces rotate flat for improved storage, similar to the QuietComfort models.
