Under Austrian rule the territory of today's province of South Tyrol was called südliches Tirol or Deutschsüdtirol,[13] but was occasionally also referred to as Mitteltirol, i.e. Middle Tyrol, due to its geographic position,[14] while Südtirol (Italian: Tirolo meridionale), i.e. South Tyrol, indicated mostly today's province of Trentino.[15] Trentino was also called Welschtirol ("Romance Tyrol", Italian: Tirolo italiano) or Welschsüdtirol ("Romance South Tyrol", Italian: Tirolo meridionale italiano). Sometimes Südtirol also indicated the whole of the Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol region.
