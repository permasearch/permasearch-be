Fr. Columba served as prior until 1967, when he departed for missionary work in Africa, and was succeeded in his post by Fr. Luke. The St. Louis Priory, as it then was, became independent of Ampleforth in 1973, and was elevated to an abbey in 1989.[6] At this time, Fr. Luke Rigby was elected as the first Abbot of Saint Louis Abbey.[7] He was in turn succeeded by Fr. Thomas Frerking, OSB, a Rhodes Scholar, former Headmaster of the Priory School and Thomist scholar, who was elected to serve as Abbot on July 12, 1995.[8]
