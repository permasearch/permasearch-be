Wind erosion is a major geomorphological force, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. It is also a major source of land degradation, evaporation, desertification, harmful airborne dust, and crop damageâ€”especially after being increased far above natural rates by human activities such as deforestation, urbanization, and agriculture.[37][38]
