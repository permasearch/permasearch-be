Jaguar unveiled a modern revival of the 1968 E-Type series 1.5 roadster with an all-electric, zero-emission powertrain in September 2017. The vehicle has a 40 kWH battery-powered electric motor and can accelerate to 60 mph in 5.5 seconds.[30] On a full charge, the vehicle has a range of 168 miles (270km).[31] The battery pack is designed to fit in the space occupied by the original six-cylinder motor without any modifications, and will fit in any model Jaguar using the same motor. The electric motor replaces the original transmission.
