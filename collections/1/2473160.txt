The ruined Adina Mosque (1374â€“75) is very large, which is unusual in Bengal, with a barrel vaulted central hall flanked by hypostyle areas. The heavy rainfall in Bengal necessitated large roofed spaces, and the nine-domed mosque, which allowed a large area to be covered, was more popular there than anywhere else.
