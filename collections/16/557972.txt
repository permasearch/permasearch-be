In May, after some persuasion from Liz, a reluctant Steve agrees to sell his share of The Rovers to a company called "Travis Limited", who, is actually Tony. Tony then persuades Liz to sell her share to Travis Ltd, in order to start a new life in Spain. However, Carla steps in and offers to buy Liz's share, so Michelle no longer has to worry about being kicked out of their home, and Liz accepts as Carla promises to keep Steve and Michelle as the pub managers. Liz then learns about Tony and Tracy's affair so she stops the sale. In May 2015, Steve and Michelle finally marry. In late 2015, Liz persuades Tony to give their relationship another go but only does this to make him sign The Rovers over to Steve. Once he has done this, she dumps Tony in front of the whole pub and he leaves, humiliated. Michelle is overjoyed, because The Rovers is hers again.
