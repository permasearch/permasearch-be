The game was not quite over at this point. Since the ball was placed on the one-yard line, Brady had to take the snap in the end zone. If he took a knee or the Patriots otherwise failed to advance the ball beyond the goal line, this would be a safety, awarding Seattle two points and forcing the Patriots to kick the ball back to the Seahawks. Seattle would then have one time out and about 18 seconds to advance the ball into field goal range with the chance to win. However, the Patriots took a time out then held the ball as the play clock ran in the attempt to draw a Seattle defense player across the line of scrimmage. Had it run out, the delay of game penalty would have merely moved the ball back half the distance to the goal.
