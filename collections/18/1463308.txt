The decline of marriage in Japan, as fewer people marry and do so later in life, is a widely cited explanation for the plummeting birth rate.[28][29][30][31] Although the total fertility rate has dropped since the 1970s (to 1.43 in 2013[32]), birth statistics for married women have remained fairly constant (at around 2.1) and most married couples have two or more children. Economic factors, such as the cost of raising a child, work-family conflicts, and insufficient housing, are the most common reasons for young mothers (under 34) to have fewer children than desired. The number of single-child or childless couples has increased since 2002 (to 23.3 percent in 2010) even as the desire for larger families remains the same.[33] Only 2% of births occur outside of marriage[34] (compared to 30-60% in Europe and North America) due to social taboos, legal pressure, and financial hurdles.[31] Half of Japan's single mothers live below the poverty line, among the highest for OECD countries.[35][36][37][38]
