HELOC loans became very popular in the United States in the early 2000s, in part because interest paid is typically deductible under federal and many state income tax laws.[citation needed] This effectively reduced the cost of borrowing funds and offered an attractive tax incentive over traditional methods of borrowing such as credit cards. Another reason for the popularity of HELOCs is their flexibility, both in terms of borrowing and repaying on a schedule determined by the borrower. Furthermore, HELOC loans' popularity may also stem from their having a better image than a "second mortgage," a term which can more directly imply an undesirable level of debt.[5] However, within the lending industry itself, a HELOC is categorized as a second mortgage.
