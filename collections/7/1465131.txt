After three weeks, Vernon grew tired of his "self-indulgent, lazy behavior" and began forming song ideas.[7] He had an idea for a song and brought inside his musical equipment, which consisted of several guitars, microphones, and an old-model Macintosh with ProTools LE.[7][17] Shortly before exiting Raleigh, he had developed song ideas but ceased working on them in his depression.[10] He began recording songs and layering his vocals atop more vocals, imitating a choir.[11] He sang in falsetto, which he had first tried with his previous band.[2] He gained freedom in singing in a higher register, feeling he accessed "painful melodies" unattainable in his previous work.[10] He further manipulated his recorded vocals using the software Auto-Tune.[2] Soon, he began developing more songs, which were worked on in 12-hour "bursts" of productivity.[18] "I would work for 14 hours a day and start to feel a little insane," he later commented.[19] The work was "labor-intensive," as he often merged over a minimum of eight tracks of vocals on each song.[17] He likened the singularity of the process to his teenage years, where he worked alone with an eight-track.[10] According to Vernon, days were hazy and began to run together for him.[9] He would wake each morning at sunrise, due to the light reflecting from the snow.[20] To help repair his 1964 Sears Silvertone guitar, he traded venison in the nearby town.[21] By February, with winter drawing to a close, Vernon emerged from the cabin with nine songs. He left still feeling physically sick from the infection, nor did he feel "renewed" from his creative catharsis.[10] He spent additional time in Raleigh recording brass on "For Emma."[17]
