An individual can be a hawk in some cases and a dove in others.[6] For example, Janet Yellen was described as a hawk during the economic boom of the 1990s, but was usually described as a dove when she was nominated to Chair the Federal Reserve.[7] Additionally, the label of "hawk" and "dove" may be applied differently depending on the point of view.[8]
