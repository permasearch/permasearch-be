Studebaker had enjoyed earlier success and was the first independent automaker to produce an overhead valve V8 engine,[9] a 232.6 cubic inch, 120Â hp unit, the first low-priced V8. The company's peak year was 1950, when it produced and sold 329,884 units.[10] Studebaker struggled during the first half of the decade. The cars had styling ahead of their time but were overpriced when compared to the offerings of the Big Three. Low sales and financial difficulties led to a merger with Packard in 1954, itself in financial trouble.[10] The new company, Studebaker-Packard Corporation, retired the Packard name in July 1958,[11][12] but continued marketing automobiles under the Studebaker name until 1966.[13]
