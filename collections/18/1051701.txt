The plan and exact dimensions of the temple have been heavily debated.[20] Five different plans of the temple have been published following recent excavations on the Capitoline Hill that revealed portions of the archaic foundations.[21] According to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the same plan and foundations were used for later rebuildings of the temple,[22] but there is disagreement over what the dimensions he mentions referred to (the building itself or the podium).
