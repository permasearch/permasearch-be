A ring around Haumea, a dwarf planet and resonant Kuiper belt member, was revealed by a stellar occultation observed on 21 January 2017. This makes it the first trans-Neptunian object found to have a ring system.[26][27] The ring has a radius of about 2,287 km, a width of ~70 km and an opacity of 0.5.[27] The ring plane coincides with Haumea’s equator and the orbit of its larger, outer moon Hi’iaka[27] (which has a semimajor axis of ~25,657 km). The ring is close to the 3:1 resonance with Haumea's rotation, which is located at a radius of 2,285 ± 8 km.[27] It is well within Haumea's Roche limit, which would lie at a radius of about 4,400 km if Haumea were spherical (being nonspherical pushes the limit out farther).[27]
