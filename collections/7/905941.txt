Most recently, food scientists have turned to supercritical carbon dioxide as a means of decaffeination. Developed by Kurt Zosel, a scientist of the Max Planck Institute, it uses CO2, heated and pressurized above its critical point, to extract caffeine[3] and could be useful going forward because it circumvents the use of other solvents and their possible effects entirely.
