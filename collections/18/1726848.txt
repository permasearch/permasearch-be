Praise, My Soul, the King of Heaven is a Christian hymn. Its text, which draws from Psalm 103, was written by Anglican divine (clergyman) Henry Francis Lyte.[1] The hymn is frequently sung in the United Kingdom and was used in the 1947 royal wedding of H.R.H. the Princess Elizabeth, now Queen Elizabeth II, and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.[1]
