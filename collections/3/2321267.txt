Soyinka wrote the play in Cambridge, where he was a fellow at Churchill College during his political exile from Nigeria.[2] He has also written a preface to the play, explaining what he sees as the greatest misconceptions in understanding it. In particular, he says that the play should not be considered as "clash of cultures."[2] Rather, the play demonstrates the need for interaction between African and European cultures, as per Soyinka's post-Biafran cultural philosophy.[3]
