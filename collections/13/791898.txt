Ray Park reprises his role from The Phantom Menace as Darth Maul, with Sam Witwer providing the voice,[7] reprising his role from the animated series, The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels.[8] Maul is revealed to be the master of the crime syndicate: Crimson Dawn, to which crime lord Dryden Vos answers. Qi'ra tells Maul that Vos and his men were killed by Tobias Beckett and his accomplices, but neglects to name Han Solo and Chewbacca. Maul commands her to meet with him on Dathomir and warns her that they will work more closely from now on, igniting his lightsaber.
