Roberta also helps Diego break free of León's toxic influence and orchestrates Diego's mother Mabel's return from abroad. León forced Mabel to abandon their house and their son, and Roberta secretly works to bring Mabel back to Diego's life. When Roberta tells him what she has done, he's stunned and demands her reasons for it. Roberta finally admits that she did it because she loves him, and they make up for good. During the graduation after-party, Roberta and Diego discuss their nervousness about sex, with Diego anxious because Roberta's supposedly more experienced than he is (he has some experience, but she has dated more than he has). Roberta shyly admits she's a virgin, and the couple happily decides to take their time before that step.
