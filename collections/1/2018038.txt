Mexican laws state that tequila can only be produced in the state of Jalisco and limited municipalities in the states of Guanajuato, Michoac√°n, Nayarit, and Tamaulipas.[4] Tequila is recognized as a Mexican designation of origin product in more than 40 countries.[5] It is protected through NAFTA in Canada and the United States,[6] through bilateral agreements with individual countries such as Japan and Israel,[6] and has been a protected designation of origin product in the constituent countries of the European Union since 1997.[6]
