In 2008, the NCAA announced that Tropicana Field would be host to a postseason college bowl game, bringing football to the dome.[60] The game, initially called the St. Petersburg Bowl for two playings (2008–2009), was known as the Beef 'O' Brady's Bowl for four playings (2010–2013), reverted to its original name for three playings (2014–2016), and in 2017 was renamed the Gasparilla Bowl. However, in 2018, the owners stated that the bowl had been moved to Raymond James Stadium.[61]
