IronPython is implemented on top of the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR), a library running on top of the Common Language Infrastructure that provides dynamic typing and dynamic method dispatch, among other things, for dynamic languages.[8] The DLR is part of the .NET Framework 4.0 and is also a part of Mono since version 2.4 from 2009.[9] The DLR can also be used as a library on older CLI implementations.
