On May 7, Justin Verlander took a perfect game against the Toronto Blue Jays into the 8th inning. After a walk to J. P. Arencibia, Verlander coaxed a double-play grounder and went on to the 9th inning to complete his second career no-hitter by facing the minimum 27 batters. It was the seventh no-hitter in Tigers history.[139] On August 27, Verlander defeated the Minnesota Twins, 6â€“4, to become the first Tiger since Bill Gullickson in 1991 to win 20 games in a season.  Verlander also became the first major league pitcher since Curt Schilling in 2002 to reach 20 wins before the end of August.[140]
