Homer Norton was hired away from Centenary to replace Bell in 1934.[15] A&M enjoyed great successes under Norton. The 1939 Texas A&M team went 11–0, beating Tulane in the Sugar Bowl, and was named a national champion.[16] Norton's record at Texas A&M was 82–53–9, giving him the second most wins of any coach in Texas A&M Aggies football history.[16] Among the many stars that Norton developed were John Kimbrough and Joe Routt.[17] Norton was fired in 1947 when his team went 3–6–1 and lost to archrival University of Texas for the eighth straight year.[18]
