The main technical challenge of OTEC is to generate significant amounts of power efficiently from small temperature differences.  It is still considered an emerging technology. Early OTEC systems were 1 to 3 percent thermally efficient, well below the theoretical maximum 6 and 7 percent for this temperature difference.[35]  Modern designs allow performance approaching the theoretical maximum Carnot efficiency.
