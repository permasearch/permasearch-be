The Shia, Ahmadiyya, and Sunni agree on the essential details for the performance and practice of these acts,[5][6] but the Shia do not refer to them by the same name (see Ancillaries of the Faith, for the Twelvers, and Seven pillars of Ismailism). They make up Muslim life, prayer, concern for the needy, self-purification, and the pilgrimage,[7][8] if one is able.[9]
