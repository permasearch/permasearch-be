The "Kingdom of Cambodia" is the official English name of the country. The English "Cambodia" is an anglicisation of the French "Cambodge", which in turn is the French transliteration of the Khmer Kampuchea. Kampuchea is the shortened alternative to the country's official name in Khmer, Preah Reacheanachak Kampuchea (Khmer: ព្រះរាជាណាចក្រកម្ពុជា). The Khmer endonym Kampuchea derives from the Sanskrit name Kambojadeśa (कम्बोजदेश), composed of देश, desa ("land of" or "country of") and कम्बोज, Kambojas, which alludes to the foundation myths of the first ancient Khmer kingdom.[20]
