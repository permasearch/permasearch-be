In Stephen George’s article “The Emotional Content of Cruelty”, he writes that Cathy embodies hatred and fear, which he argues are the main motivators behind human cruelty.[15] He writes that Cathy fears losing control in any way; for example, she refuses to drink because alcohol brings out her true nature. Her method of controlling her environment comes in the form of paranoia, which is manifested by her desire to manipulate men sexually.[15] The hatred she feels in effect subdues her fear so that she feels superior to those she manipulates.[15]
