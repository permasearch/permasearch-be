When Rome waged war again on Carthage about 50 years later, the Carthaginians had little power and could not defeat the by-then very aged Masinissa in Africa. They did, however, organize a defense of their home city which, after an extended siege, was captured and completely destroyed in 146 BC. Only 55,000 survived.[9]
