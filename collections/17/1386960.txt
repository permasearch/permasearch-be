The Dry Tortugas are the western extension of an arcuate chain of Pleistocene reef and oolitic limestone islands, with the eastern limit in the vicinity of Miami.  These Florida Keys are the surface expression of the 6Â km thick southern Florida carbonate platform, which has been accumulating sediments since the Early Cretaceous.  Two stratigraphic units are exposed at the surface, the Key Largo Limestone and the Miami Limestone.  The Key Largo Limestone are reefs up to 60 m thick, parallel to the shelf edge, consisting of hermatypic corals and calcarenites.  The Miami Limestone is less than 15 m thick, and in general, is found behind the Key Largo Limestone reef, but overlies it in the western extent of the keys.  It consists of a bryozoan facies and an oolitic facies and represents a subtidal shoal.  Additionally, excellent examples of Holocene carbonate-sand deposits are found in the Dry Tortugas, consisting mainly of disarticulated Halimeda plates.  Between the Dry Tortugas and Key West is a 12 m thick example of these sand deposits, known as "the quicksands".[11]
