By mid-September 2008, WaMu's share price had closed as low as $2.00. It had been worth over $30.00 in September 2007, and had briefly traded as high as $45 in the previous year.[183] While WaMu publicly insisted it could stay independent, earlier in the month it had quietly hired Goldman Sachs to identify potential bidders. However, several deadlines passed without anyone submitting a bid.[16] At the same time, WaMu suffered a massive run (mostly via electronic banking over the internet and wire transfer[citation needed]); customers pulled out $16.7 billion in deposits in a ten-day span.[184]
