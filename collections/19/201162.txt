Each tribe lost their stack at least once, but Yawa and Levu won the challenge, sending Soko to tribal council once again. Ryan and Chrissy were torn between voting out JP or Ali; Chrissy did not trust Ali, but recognized JP as a physical threat. At Tribal Council, the tribe discussed the impending merge and how JPâ€™s laidback approach to strategy has made him tough to read. In the end, Ryan and Chrissy voted against Ali, sending her home.
