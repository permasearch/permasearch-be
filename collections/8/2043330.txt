In the "rails to trails" program, much of the Missouri track line has been adapted for use as the Katy Trail State Park, including a spur to Columbia, a Missouri State Park which runs along the Missouri River for the major portion of its route. In downtown Dallas, a 3.5-mile (6Â km) long section called the Katy Trail is being converted into a multi-use trail linking White Rock Lake to the American Airlines Center.
