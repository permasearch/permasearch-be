For fans who are more interested in other codes of football, within their sporting community, the use of the word 'football' may refer to their own code. However even within such sporting communities an unqualified mention of 'football' would usually be a reference to association football.[34] In its heartlands, rugby league is referred to as either "football" or just "league".[34]
