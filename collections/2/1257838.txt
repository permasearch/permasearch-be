Sydney-based progressive rock band Galadriel achieved minor success in the early 1970s, and continue to have a cult following around the world due to a revived interest in 1960s and 1970s Australian rock. Rare copies of their first album are much sought-after, particularly in Germany where they were signed to the local Polydor label in 1971. Singer John 'Spider' Sholten later joined the touring company of singer-songwriter Ross Ryan as stage manager and general comic relief for Ross during his performances.
