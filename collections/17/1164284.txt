The leg's Detour was a choice between Foot or Hoof. In Foot, teams had to find a large, well-known statue of a foot at Palazzo dei Conservatori, using a provided picture that contained the entire statue. In Hoof, teams were given a partial picture of another, more obscure statue. The statue was a mounted horse at Altare della Patria, but teams only received a picture of its hoof. However, if teams completed this task, they would find a line of taxis waiting for them.
