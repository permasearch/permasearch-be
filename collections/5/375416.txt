In a great number of cases, I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer act—I understand that Dr. Oppenheimer acted—in a way which was for me was exceedingly hard to understand. I thoroughly disagreed with him in numerous issues and his actions frankly appeared to me confused and complicated.

In this very limited sense I would like to express a feeling that I would feel personally more secure if public matters would rest in other hands.[148]
