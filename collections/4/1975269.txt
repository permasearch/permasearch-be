Proximity of the peninsula to the Gulf Stream leads to unusually high temperatures in winter, resulting in significant temperature variations between land and the Barents Sea and in fluctuating temperatures during high winds.[8] Cyclones are typical during the cold seasons, while the warm seasons are characterized by anticyclones.[8] Monsoon winds are common in most areas, with south and southwesterly winds prevailing in winter months and with somewhat more pronounced easterly winds in summer.[8] Strong storm winds blow for 80–120 days a year.[8] The waters of the Murman Coast remain warm enough to remain ice-free even in winter.[9]
