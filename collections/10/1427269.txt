Cuba has prohibited smoking in most workplaces, removed cigarette machines and made it illegal to sell tobacco products near schools since February 2005.[57] The ban included prohibiting smoking in closed public spaces, public transport, educational, health and sporting institutions. However, the ban was not very effective as a study revealed that more than 50% of the population are being exposed to smoking in daily life. In 2014, Cuban authorities said that they are working on passing further anti-smoking legislation. Such legislation will prevent the sale of cigarettes to people under the age of eighteen. The new legislation will also require tobacco companies to add graphic warnings on the packaging.[58]
