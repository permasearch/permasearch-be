Many personality characteristics were found to be reliably associated with leadership emergence.[68] The list include, but is not limited to following (list organized in alphabetical order): assertiveness, authenticity, Big Five personality factors, birth order, character strengths, dominance, emotional intelligence, gender identity, intelligence, narcissism, self-efficacy for leadership, self-monitoring and social motivation.[68] Leadership emergence is the idea that people born with specific characteristics become leaders, and those without these characteristics do not become leaders.  People like Mahatma Gandhi, Abraham Lincoln, and Nelson Mandela all share traits that an average person does not.  This includes people who choose to participate in leadership roles, as opposed to those who do not.  Research indicates that up to 30% of leader emergence has a genetic basis.[69] There is no current research indicating that there is a “leadership gene”, instead we inherit certain traits that might influence our decision to seek leadership.  Both anecdotal, and empirical evidence support a stable relationship between specific traits and leadership behavior.[70] Using a large international sample researchers found that there are three factors that motivate leaders; affective identity (enjoyment of leading), non-calculative (leading earns reinforcement), and social-normative (sense of obligation).[71]
