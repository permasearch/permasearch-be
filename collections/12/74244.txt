During July 2017, to mark Canada's 150th Birthday, Tim Hortons held a special one month "Roll Up The Rim to Win" campaign. The cups were white, with a Maple Leaf in red, and clip-art of fireworks. Losing cups had "HAPPY CANADA 150th / JOYEUX 150e DU CANADA." instead of the usual "Please Play Again".
