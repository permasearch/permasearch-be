The Acts of John, an apocryphal Gnostic work thought to have been composed around the late 2nd century, paints a rich, full narrative about John that was profoundly influential on later sources. Here we find the first explicit identification with the son of Zebedee, the story of the attempted execution by boiling oil also reported by Tertullian,[83] the manner of Johnâ€™s natural death, and a great deal more.[84] From the 3rd century onward, legends about John abound, with little hope of untangling any truth from the fiction.
