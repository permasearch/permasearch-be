In New Jersey, drivers are allowed to flash their headlights to warn approaching drivers about a speed trap ahead.[44] In 1999, The Superior Court of New Jersey Appellate Division held that a statute limiting how far high beams may project is not violated when a motorist flashes his or her high beams to warn oncoming motorists of radar. The Court also concluded that a stop by a police officer based upon high beam flashing is also improper.[45]
