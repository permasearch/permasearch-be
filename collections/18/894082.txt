A translation proxy is a proxy server that is used to localize a website experience for different markets.  Traffic from global audiences is routed through the translation proxy to the source website.  As visitors browse the proxied site, requests go back to the source site where pages are rendered.  Original language content in the response is replaced by translated content as it passes back through the proxy.  The translations used in a translation proxy can be either machine translation, human translation, or a combination of machine and human translation. Different translation proxy implementations have different capabilities.  Some allow further customization of the source site for local audiences such as excluding source content or substituting source content with original local content.
