Langerhans cells are dendritic cells (antigen-presenting immune cells) of the skin and mucosa, and contain organelles called Birbeck granules. They are present in all layers of the epidermis and are most prominent in the stratum spinosum.[2] They also occur in the papillary dermis, particularly around blood vessels,[2] as well as in the mucosa of the mouth, foreskin, and vagina.[3] They can be found in other tissues, such as lymph nodes, particularly in association with the condition Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH).
