There is none like God, O Jeshurun (i.e., Israel) who rides through the heavens to your help ... he subdues the ancient gods, shatters the forces of old ... so Israel lives in safety, untroubled is Jacob's abode ... Your enemies shall come fawning to you, and you shall tread on their backs. (Deuteronomy 33:26â€“29)
