Tracy is happy that Tina has been hospitalised, as she hated her. When Tina dies, however, she is slightly more sympathetic. Tracy believes that Carla murdered Tina, but Rob tries to persuade her that Peter killed her. When Rob begins acting strangely, Tracy is concerned and he begins to push her out of his life. Rob confesses to Carla that it was he who killed Tina, not Peter, who has now been sentenced to life in prison for her murder. Carla is unsure of what to do but the following morning she sees how upset Peter's family is and calls the police. Rob then runs from the scene, leaving Tracy devastated. Tracy believes it is Carla's fault for not keeping quiet, and attacks her as the police arrive. She is then questioned by the police for providing a false alibi for Rob, as she had previously told them they were together at her house at the time of Tina's murder, to cover up the fact that she was really buying stolen goods from Tony. Tracy confesses to giving a false alibi, but still will not believe Rob is the murderer. The next day, Rob calls her from a B&B, admits to killing Tina but claims he did it to keep them both out of jail. He tells Tracy he is running out of money and Tracy agrees to bring some to him, which she takes out of their wedding cards. Tracy and Rob meet, she gives him the money but upon saying goodbye decides she wants to go on the run with him. They plan for her to collect their things and meet the following evening. She meets Rob and he says they have to get away quickly, but Tracy cries and tells him she is sorry. She has called the police and told them where he would be, as she realised she could not leave Amy, and knew as well that she did not want to be in prison again. Rob is shocked and devastated, telling her she had a choice, and she could have chosen him. He is led away by police, leaving a sobbing Tracy behind. Tracy later reveals to Ken that she believes it is Carla's fault that Rob murdered Tina.
