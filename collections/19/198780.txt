The Armed Forces Day (Chinese: 軍人節) is celebrated in the Republic of China on the western Pacific island of Taiwan (formerly called Formosa when under Japanese occupation), on 3 September, on the same day as their Victory over Japan Day (1945). Pursuant to Article 5 of the Order to Implement Commemoration Days and Holidays (紀念日及節日實施辦法), the Ministry of National Defense (國防部) determines how to allow a day off for the military personnel. This is not a public holiday in the Republic of China on Taiwan, but relevant institutions, groups, and schools may hold celebrating activities.[33]
