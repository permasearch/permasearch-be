In some places and circumstances,  public alcohol consumption is accepted. This includes such cities as New Orleans, Las Vegas, Indianapolis, certain college campuses, and around sporting events â€“ notably at a tailgate party. Open containers of alcohol are often concealed in public, traditionally inside a brown paper bag, though this does not make them legal in jurisdictions where they are outlawed. If a law enforcement officer can detect that alcohol is being consumed, the violator may be cited or arrested.[39]
