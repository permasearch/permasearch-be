A driver's license is issued by each state's DMV, which is required to drive.[5] Each state's DMV also issues a nearly-identical "non-driver identification card" to identify persons who are unable or do not want to drive, which is typically treated like a driver's license for all purposes, except for proving that a person has the right to drive.
