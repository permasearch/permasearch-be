The states of the "old Northwest" are now called the "East North Central States" by the United States Census Bureau and the "Great Lakes region" is also a popular term. The states just west of the Mississippi River and the Great Plains states are called the "West North Central States" by the Census Bureau.[citation needed] Some entities in the Midwest are still referred to as "Northwest" due to historical reasons (for example, Northwestern University in Illinois).[citation needed]
