Here r is the magnitude (the modulus, also called the absolute value) of the number whose root is to be taken; if the number can be written as a+bi then     r =    a  2   +  b  2       {\displaystyle r={\sqrt {a^{2}+b^{2}}}}  . Also,     θ   {\displaystyle \theta }   is the angle formed as one pivots on the origin counterclockwise from the positive horizontal axis to a ray going from the origin to the number; it has the properties that     cos ⁡ θ = a  /  r ,   {\displaystyle \cos \theta =a/r,}       sin ⁡ θ = b  /  r ,   {\displaystyle \sin \theta =b/r,}   and     tan ⁡ θ = b  /  a .   {\displaystyle \tan \theta =b/a.}
