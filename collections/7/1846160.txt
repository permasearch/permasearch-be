In 1784, the area was included within the Trans-Appalachian region, as defined by Thomas Jefferson in his proposal to the Continental Congress to use the territory for the development of future states to be admitted to the Union. Jefferson proposed that the existing states surrender their respective claims to the region in order for its development to take place under national authority. One of the most contentious issues was whether or not slavery would be allowed in the area. At a time when northern states were abolishing slavery and individual manumissions were high, northern representatives wanted to prohibit its expansion.
