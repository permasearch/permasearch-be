In major centres, the first four digits specify the CCA (Call Collection Area, also known as an "exchange"), and the remaining digits specify a number at that exchange, up to 10,000 of which may be connected. Smaller Exchanges in more remote areas may be specified by five or six "local" digits, meaning that no more than 1,000 or 100 numbers respectively could be connected to such exchanges.
