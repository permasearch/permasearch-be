How much wood would a woodchuck chuck is an American English-language tongue-twister.[1][2] The woodchuck from the Algonquian word "wejack" is a kind of marmot regionally called a groundhog.[3] The complete beginning of the tongue-twister usually goes: "How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?"[1][2] The tongue-twister relies primarily on alliteration to achieve its effects, with five "w" sounds interspersed among five "ch" sounds.[4]
