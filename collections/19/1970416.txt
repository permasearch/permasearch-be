Unlike previous Nintendo home consoles, the Switch is region-free, allowing players to use cartridges or downloaded content from any part of the world, though Nintendo recommends using the appropriate regional eShop for digital purposes for obtaining the best post-purchase support if needed.[77][108] Nintendo opted to go region-free to reduce the amount of workload and cost to both themselves and developers in having to manage two or more regional certification processes and different ROM cartridge production pathways for those regions.[176] Further, eShop purchases, while still tied to the Nintendo Account, are not tied to the specific Switch console, as was the case for previous Nintendo hardware. Once the user re-registers their account to a Switch, they have access to download all previous purchases; however, a user can only have their account registered on one console at a time, and downloaded software tied to an account cannot be used if that account is not registered to the device.[158] The Switch does not support optical discs and is not backwards compatible with the 3DS and Wii U game media.[177] The Switch is not backwards compatible with other digital titles from previous consoles.[108] The console will not have games from older Nintendo systems branded under the Virtual Console name as with consoles like the Wii, but Nintendo will still provide these games through other distribution means, such as part of the Online service membership benefits or through the eShop.[178][179] Kimishima said that the Switch is powerful enough to emulate titles from previous Nintendo consoles, but currently does not support controllers or controller emulation for these titles.[15]
