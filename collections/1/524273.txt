Continuous monitoring systems can examine 100% of transactions and data processed in different applications and databases. The continuous monitoring systems can test for inconsistencies, duplication, errors, policy violations, missing approvals, incomplete data, dollar or volume limit errors, or other possible breakdowns in internal controls. Testing can be done for processes like payroll, sales order processing, purchasing and payables processing including travel and entertainment expenses and purchasing cards, and inventory transactions.
