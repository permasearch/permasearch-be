Kamakura's Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gū is now only a Shinto shrine but, before the Shinto and Buddhism Separation Order (神仏判然令) of 1868, its name was Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gū-ji (鶴岡八幡宮寺, Tsurugaoka Hachiman Shrine Temple) and it was also a Buddhist temple, one of the oldest of the city.[14] The temple and the city were built with Feng Shui in mind.[15] The present location was carefully chosen as the most propitious after consulting a diviner because it had a mountain to the north (the Hokuzan (北山)), a river to the east (the Namerikawa) and a great road to the west (the Kotō Kaidō (古東街道)), and was open to the south (on Sagami Bay).[15] Each direction was protected by a god: Genbu guarded the north, Seiryū the east, Byakko the west and Suzaku the south.[15] The willows near the ponds and the catalpas next to the Museum of Modern Art represent respectively Seiryū and Byakko.[15]
