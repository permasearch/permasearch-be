Other NGO members, instead of withdrawing support, have critically evaluated FSC’s performance and made recommendations to improve the credibility of the organization. These include Greenpeace International, whose 2008 report ‘Holding the line with FSC’ focused on controversial certificates and ways forward.[54] A revised version of the report was released in 2011, which concluded that some progress had been made. But it also identified ongoing weaknesses, including lack of guidance on HCVFs and activities in controversial areas like the Congo Basin and problems with the Controlled Wood label, the Chain of Custody system and logo integrity. The report concluded with 10 immediate changes needed to "restore FSC’s credibility".[55] To improve its process for tracking FSC certified products and maintaining the veracity of FSC claims, FSC is currently developing an Online Claims Platform (http://claims-forum.fsc.org/) and is pursuing opportunities for fiber testing. Chamber-balanced Working Groups have been established to strengthen the Controlled Wood system and the Chain of Custody standard, and options are being pursued to address the performance of certification bodies.
