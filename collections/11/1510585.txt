London Heathrow Airport is Europe's busiest airport in terms of passenger traffic and the Dublin-London route was once the busiest air route in Europe,[72] and it remains the busiest route out of Heathrow. The English Channel and the southern North Sea are the busiest seaways in the world.[73] The Channel Tunnel, opened in 1994, links Great Britain to France and is the second-longest rail tunnel in the world.
