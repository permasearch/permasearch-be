Quatermain is buried beside his son in Kenya. The surviving League members recall how a witch doctor had blessed Quatermain for saving his village, promising that Africa would never let him die. The remaining League members depart agreeing to continue using their powers for good in the new century. Then the witch doctor arrives, performing a ritual that summons an unnatural storm, with a bolt of lightning ambiguously striking the rifle Sawyer left on Quatermain's grave.
