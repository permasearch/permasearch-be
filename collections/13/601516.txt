The Supreme Court was established on 1 October 2009 and assumed the former judicial functions of the House of Lords, which were removed by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, and the twelve Lords of Appeal in Ordinary became judges of the Supreme Court,[18] except for Lord Scott of Foscote, who retired the day before the Court began business, and Lord Neuberger, who resigned to become Master of the Rolls.[19] The former Master of the Rolls, Lord Clarke, became a judge of the Supreme Court on its first day, the first Justice directly appointed to the Court,[20] and Sir John Dyson was appointed on 13 April 2010, the first Justice not to be a peer.
