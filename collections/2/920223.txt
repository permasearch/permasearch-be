The Sphynx hairlessness is produced by the same gene as the Devon Rex phenotype. Moreover, it was found that the curly coat of Selkirk Rex cats is also associated with this gene.[17] In detail the gene encodes Keratin 71 (KRT71) and is responsible for the keratinization of the hair follicle. The Sphynx mutation leads to a complete loss-of-function where the structure of the hair is damaged so that i.e. the hair can be formed but is easily dislodged. In the Devon Rex mutation a residual activity of the protein still exists.[18] The Selkirk Rex allele (sadr) is dominant over the wild type gene, which is dominant over the Devon Rex allele (re) and the Sphynx (hr) which forms an allelic series ofÂ : KRT71SADRE > KRT71+ > KRT71re > KRT71hr.[17]
