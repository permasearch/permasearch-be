Economists attribute much growth to reforms in the product markets. According to the OECD, only four EU-15 countries have less regulated product markets (UK, Ireland, Denmark and Sweden) and only one has less regulated financial markets (Denmark). Nordic countries were pioneers in liberalizing energy, postal, and other markets in Europe.[126] The legal system is clear and business bureaucracy less than most countries.[127] Property rights are well protected and contractual agreements are strictly honoured.[127] Finland is rated the least corrupt country in the world in the Corruption Perceptions Index[131] and 13th in the Ease of doing business index. This indicates exceptional ease in cross-border trading (5th), contract enforcement (7th), business closure (5th), tax payment (83rd), and low worker hardship (127th).[132]
