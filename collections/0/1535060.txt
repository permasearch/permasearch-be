In 1975, Tony Tan Caktiong and his family opened a Magnolia Ice Cream parlor in Cubao, Quezon City.[6][7] In 1978, he and his siblings engaged the services of a management consultant, Manuel C. Lumba, who shifted the business focus from ice cream to hot dogs after his studies showed a much larger market waiting to be served.[6] Lumba was Tan's last business and management mentor.
