As of April 2017 with the conclusion of Bates Motel, the network officially removed scripted series from its programming strategy and will focus exclusively on non-fiction programming (leaving scripted series to sister networks such as History and Lifetime). The network cited the strength of recent series such as 60 Days In, Live PD, as well as the documentary series Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath, and its planned revival of Biography as a limited series of documentaries across A&E's channels.[5]
