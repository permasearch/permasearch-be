The monomyth concept has been very popular in American literary studies and writing guides since at least the 1970s. Christopher Vogler, a Hollywood film producer and writer, created a 7-page company memo, A Practical Guide to The Hero With a Thousand Faces,[17] based on Campbell's work. Vogler's memo was later developed into the late 1990s book, The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure For Writers. George Lucas' Star Wars (1977) was notably classified as monomyth almost as soon as it came out.[18] Numerous other works of popular fiction have been forwarded as examples of the monomyth template, including Spenser's The Fairie Queene,[19] Melville's Moby Dick,[20] Charlotte BrontÃ«'s Jane Eyre,[21] works by Charles Dickens, Faulkner, Maugham, J. D. Salinger,[22] Hemingway,[23] Mark Twain,[24] W. B. Yeats,[25] C. S. Lewis,[26] and J. R. R. Tolkien,[27] Seamus Heaney[28] and Stephen King,[29] among numerous others.
