After his election Francis stated, "Here too, it helps me to think of the name of Francis [of Assisi], who teaches us profound respect for the whole of creation and the protection of our environment, which all too often, instead of using for the good, we exploit greedily, to one another's detriment.".[277] At the University of Molise he described environmental concerns as a great contemporary challenge and voiced opposition to deforestation. He believes that development should respect what Christians see as creation, and that exploiting the earth is sinful.[278] Francis told the Second International Conference on Nutrition, held in Rome by the Food and Agriculture Organization,[279] that a lack of protection for the ecology may generate problems.[280] Francis plans a meeting with leaders of main religions to increase awareness of the state of the climate.[281]
