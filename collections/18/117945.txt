The rapidity of the early conquests has received various explanations.[24] Contemporary Christian writers conceived them as God's punishment visited on their fellow Christians for their sins.[25] Early Muslim historians viewed them as a reflection of religious zeal of the conquerors and evidence of divine favor.[26] The theory that the conquests are explainable as an Arab migration triggered by economic pressures enjoyed popularity early in the 20th century, but has largely fallen out of favor among historians, especially those who distinguish the migration from the conquests that preceded and enabled it.[27]
