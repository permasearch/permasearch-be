The referendum was resolved in the negative, defeating the long-held Labor policy to abolish the Council.[1] The referendum, while defeated, sparked discussion on future reform of the then-half-appointed Council, culminating in the full democratisation of the chamber in 1978 by the Neville Wran Labor Government. Since these reforms removed many of the arguments against the upper house, another question on abolition is unlikely.
