Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003)[1] is a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court. The Court struck down the sodomy law in Texas in a 6â€“3 decision and, by extension, invalidated sodomy laws in 13 other states, making same-sex sexual activity legal in every U.S. state and territory. The Court, with a five-justice majority, overturned its previous ruling on the same issue in the 1986 case Bowers v. Hardwick, where it upheld a challenged Georgia statute and did not find a constitutional protection of sexual privacy.
