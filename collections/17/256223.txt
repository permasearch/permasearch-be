Facilitated diffusion may be achieved as a consequence of charge gradients in addition to concentration gradients. Plant cells create an unequal distribution of charge across their plasma membrane by actively taking up or excluding ions. Active transport of protons by H+ ATPases[4] alters membrane potential allowing for facilitated passive transport of particular ions such as Potassium [5] down their charge gradient through high affinity transporters and channels.
