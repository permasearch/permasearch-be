Each season begins with the "Blind Auditions," where coaches form their team of artists (8 in season 1, 12 in season 2 and seasons 4-14, and 16 in season 3) whom they mentor through the remainder of the season. The coaches' chairs are faced towards the audience during artists' performances; those interested in an artist press their button, which turns their chair towards the artist and illuminates the bottom of the chair to read "I want you." At the conclusion of the performance, an artist either defaults to the only coach who turned around, or selects his or her coach if more than one coach expresses interest.[5] In the 14th season, a new twist called "Block" is featured, which allows one coach to block another coach from getting a contestants.
