Before 1987, world music had a following but it was still difficult for interested parties to sell their music to the larger music stores.[citation needed] Although specialist music stores had been important in developing the genre over many years, the record companies, broadcasters and journalists had been finding it difficult to build a following because the music, itself, seemed too scarce. However, they were aware that the jazz and classical markets had developed a crossover audience. They decided the best way forward would be a collective strategy to bring the music to a wider audience.[citation needed]
