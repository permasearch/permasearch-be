In economics, it is thought that if humans are rational and free to make their own decisions, then they would behave according to rational choice theory.[22]:368â€“370 Rational choice theory says that a person consistently makes choices that lead to the best situation for himself or herself, taking into account all available considerations including costs and benefits; the rationality of these considerations is from the point of view of the person himself, so a decision is not irrational just because someone else finds it questionable.
