Richard Watterson (voiced by Dan Russell) is an anthropomorphic pink rabbit. He is Gumball, Darwin and Anais' father. Being a stay-at-home dad, he spends most of his time sleeping, eating, watching TV and playing video games. He was named "the laziest person in Elmore" since 1983,[11] and has a large appetite and is a voracious eater. Richard often serves as a third-wheel to his sons' misadventures and cares deeply for his family despite his lethargic nature. He can be very naive at some times and may be called "dumb" or similar words by other characters throughout the series. In the episode "The Job" it appears that Richard can't hold a job or else the universe will be destroyed which is why he must remain unemployed. He may be the same age as Nicole (late 30s/mid 40s), as he went to school with her.
