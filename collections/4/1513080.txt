Bassist and vocalist Marco Hietala describes the style of the band's music as "melodic symphonic metal;"[112] though this is not a view shared by all members of the group,[113] including band composer Tuomas Holopainen,[114] who describes the band as simply symphonic metal.[115] Some critics find that the band had a gothic sound since their debut.[116] The music of Nightwish had been "distinguished by the operatic voice" of soprano Tarja Turunen,[117] a "charismatic frontwoman with a powerful voice". Critics observed that her vocals became less operatic with the release of Once.[118] Following the departure of Tarja Turunen from the group, Nightwish left behind the "signature operatic vocals" of their earlier albums.[118]
