The series' editor at MF Bunko J, Ikemoto Masahito, first became aware of the web novel in April 2013, when it began to appear on his Twitter feed.[5]  He was immediately impressed by the series' use of Return by Death, and how it was a "depressing, yet surprising, twist on the fantasy genre", and began working with Nagatsuki to adapt the series into a light novel.[5][6]  Most light novels are around 250 pages in length, but Nagatsuki submitted a manuscript of more than 1,000 pages for the first novel, forcing Ikemoto to edit it heavily.[6]  While Nagatsuki wanted to engage in worldbuilding early on, Ikemoto felt that it was more necessary to make the readers feel engaged with the characters.  He ended up rearranging the story so that parts focusing on the world and its lore were pushed back to the third arc of the series.[6]
