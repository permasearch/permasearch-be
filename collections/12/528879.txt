Interest in hold 'em outside of Nevada began to grow in the 1980s as well. Although California had legal card rooms offering draw poker, Texas hold 'em was deemed to be prohibited under a statute that made illegal the (now unheard of) game "stud-horse". But in 1988 Texas hold 'em was declared legally distinct from stud-horse in Tibbetts v. Van De Kamp.[13] Almost immediately card rooms across the state offered Texas hold 'em.[14] (It is often presumed that this decision ruled that hold 'em was a game of skill,[15] but the distinction between skill and chance has never entered into California jurisprudence regarding poker.[16]) After a trip to Las Vegas, bookmakers Terry Rogers and Liam Flood introduced the game to European card players in the early 1980s.[citation needed]
