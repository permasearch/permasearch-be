The pilot episode received poor results from test audiences.[19] Parker later conceded that regarding the language, he and Stone felt pressure to live up to their previous two shorts and "tried to push thingsÂ ... maybe further than we should [have]."[21] In contrast, they allowed subsequent episodes to "be more natural",[22] focusing more on making fun of topics considered taboo "without just throwing a bunch of dirty words in there."[21] After the poor results from the test audience, Comedy Central executives were unsure whether they wanted to order additional episodes after "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe". However, when buzz began to generate on the Internet about the two original shorts, the network commissioned Parker and Stone to write one more episode without committing to a full series until they had seen the script. While working on the 1997 film Orgazmo, Parker and Stone wrote the script for what would later become the episode "Weight Gain 4000". The duo sought to give Comedy Central executives an idea of how the series would be and how each episode could differ from the others. The network liked the script, and when Parker and Stone refused to write another script before signing off on at least six episodes, the executives agreed to commit to a series.[19]
