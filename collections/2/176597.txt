In January 2015, The CW president Mark Pedowitz announced the intention to do a Flash/Arrow crossover every season,[171] and The CW announced that an animated web-series, Vixen, featuring the DC heroine of the same name and set in the universe of Arrow and The Flash, would be debuting on CW Seed in late 2015.[172] The character is expected to make a live-action appearance on Arrow and/or The Flash as well.[173] The next month, it was reported that a spin-off series, which is described as a superhero team-up show, was in discussion by The CW for a possible 2015â€“16 midseason release. Berlanti and Kreisberg would executive produce alongside Guggenheim and Sarah Schechter. The potential series would be headlined by several recurring characters from both Arrow and The Flash, with the potential for other Arrow/Flash characters to cross over to the new series as well.[174][175] In May 2015, The CW officially picked up the series, titled DC's Legends of Tomorrow.[176]
