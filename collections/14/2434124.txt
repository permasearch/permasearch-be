While development in the area today includes numerous residential communities and commercial sites along the major roadways into town, many of the older structures from its past remain within the town limits. The Victorian, Craftsman, and Colonial Revival homes constructed in the late 19th century and early 20th century are contributing structures to the Fuquay Springs Historic District, while the downtown shops and businesses are part of the Varina Commercial Historic District. Area landmarks located in these districts include the Ben-Wiley Hotel, the Ballentine-Spence House, and the Dr. Wiley S. Cozart House, built across the street from the springs by the original owner and proprietor of the Ben Wiley. The springs are now contained in a small park developed on the site in 1945 which was handed over to the town in 1998 to maintain as a historic park. Mr. Lexie McLean owned and operated McLean's Grocery on Academy Street for many years. Mr McLean was a community leader and considered a major factor in the growth and development of the Fuquay-Varina area. Mr. Edward N. Farnell was the principal of the Fuquay Spring High School from 1952 through 1967. Mr. Farnell was an important community leader and educator; many of his students went on to become community and state leaders.
