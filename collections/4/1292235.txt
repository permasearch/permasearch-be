The film has had a mostly positive critical response focusing on the stylish small town vibe and suspense without gore.  Writing in the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert stated: "Lady in White, like most good films, depends more on style and tone than it does on story, and after awhile [sic] it's the whole insidious atmosphere of the film that begins to envelop us."[3] New York Times critic Caryn James mostly praised the film, but pointed out that: "the heavy-handed subplot about 60's racism loads the film with more social weight than it can carry. And most damaging, we guess who the murderer is very near the film's beginning."[4] Lady in White maintains a 67% "Fresh" rating on Rotten Tomatoes.[5]
