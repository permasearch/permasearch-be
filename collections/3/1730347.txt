Electric edge trimmers have the advantage of being very light, easy to maneuver and easy-to-operate devices. However, the length of power cord that can be deployed across the ground limits them, and they are usually less powerful and robust than the gasoline-engine ones. Electric machines normally are limited to 2.5 mm (0.098 in) maximum diameter nylon because of their lower power output (400 to about 1200 watts). Recently there are electric string trimmers that offer the same performance as gasoline-powered trimmers. Battery-powered units are to be recharged after each use. The recharge time is typically several hours long; some models offer a quick-charge option that cuts charging time to between 30 minutes and 2 hours, or a removable battery pack so the user can have more than one battery ready to swap out when the first one runs down.
