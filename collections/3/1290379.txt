While Fear of Cancer Recurrence (FCR) can be adaptive at low levels, high levels of FCR require psychological treatment. At present, there are no psychometrically sound measures of FCR, which makes research into the effectiveness of treatment protocols difficult to interpret.[31] Treatments that are being investigated include: cognitive-behavioural therapy,[32] Meta-cognitive therapy[33] and Cognitive-existential group therapy[34] and exercise.[35]
