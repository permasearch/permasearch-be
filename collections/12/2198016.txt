In the second half of the 18th century, the Native Americans living near Milwaukee played a role in all the major European wars on the American continent. During the French and Indian War, a group of "Ojibwas and Pottawattamies from the far [Lake] Michigan" (i.e., the area from Milwaukee to Green Bay) joined the French-Canadian Daniel Li√©nard de Beaujeu at the Battle of the Monongahela.[13] In the American Revolutionary War, the Native Americans around Milwaukee were some of the few groups allied with the United States.[14]
