It is widely appreciated that sexual selection could drive speciation in many clades, independently of natural selection.[30] However the term “speciation”, in this context, tends to be used in two different, but not mutually exclusive senses. The first and most commonly used sense refers to the “birth” of new species. That is, the splitting of an existing species into two separate species, or the budding off of a new species from a parent species, both driven by a biological "fashion fad" (a preference for a feature, or features, in one or both sexes, that do not necessarily have any adaptive qualities).[30][31][32][33] In the second sense, "speciation" refers the wide-spread tendency of sexual creatures to be grouped into clearly defined species,[34][35] rather than forming a continuum of phenotypes both in time and space - which would be the more obvious or logical consequence of natural selection. This was indeed recognized by Darwin as problematic, and included in his On the Origin of Species (1859), under the heading "Difficulties with the Theory".[36] There are several suggestions as to how mate choice might play a significant role in resolving Darwin’s dilemma.[35][37][38][39][40][41]
