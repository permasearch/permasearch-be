In addition to in Boston and in the various Chinatowns in the New York metropolitan area within New York City and Long Island, several bus line companies also link to the Chinatowns of Edison, New Jersey; Cherry Hill Mall; Philadelphia; Washington, D.C.; Baltimore; Atlanta; and to the casinos of Atlantic City.[4][23] Buses also go to Ohio, Michigan, Rhode Island, Virginia, and Florida.[23] However, Chinatown buses also stop at smaller, predominately non-Chinese areas such as in North Carolina and South Carolina.[4] On the West Coast, buses link the Chinatowns of the San Francisco Bay Area; Los Angeles Chinatown and the San Gabriel Valley; and Las Vegas' Chinatown and casinos. In the I-5 corridor in California, similar services are found in the Hispanic community and provide transportation to/from Baja California in Mexico.[citation needed] Often, the Chinatown bus lines enable Chinese immigrants, mainly restaurant workers, to be transported cheaply along the coasts.[28] In total, the buses travel within 24 U.S. states and Canada.[4]
