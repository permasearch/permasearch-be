On 5 September 1776, the Marine Committee apportioned a uniform for the Continental Marines. The uniform regulations specified that standard uniform was a short green coat with white trim facings (lapels, cuffs, and coat lining),[55] and a high leather collar to protect against cutlass slashes and to keep a man's head erect, leading to the nickname "leatherneck";[32] complemented by a white waistcoat, white or buff short breeches, woolen stockings, and a short black gaiter. Marine officers wore small cocked hats, and a single epaulette;[2] and the enlisted men sported round black hats with the brim pinned on one side.[5] The adoption of green coats and round hats probably reflects the constraints of availability, for both of the uniform attire were used by the Philadelphia Associators.[56] It wasn't until the year 1777 that the Marines entirely appeared in uniform in numbers.[44] Though legend attributes the green color to the traditional color of riflemen, Continental Marines mostly carried muskets. More likely, green cloth was simply plentiful in Philadelphia, and it served to distinguish Marines from the blue of the Army and Navy or the red of the British.[57] Also, Sam Nicholas's hunting club wore green uniforms, hence his recommendation was for green.[58] Notably, Marines aboard USSÂ Bonhomme Richard wore red,[55] though they were mostly Irish soldiers of the French Army.[2]
