Japan distinguishes between party advertisements and candidate advertisements. There are few restrictions on political advertisements made by parties. One restriction is that party advertisements cannot mention specific candidates.[17] Candidate advertisements have greater limitations and are paid for by the government. Candidates are not allowed to purchase their own advertisements. The number and type of candidate advertisements are also limited, including the size of newspaper advertisements, and length of television and radio advertisements.[18] Japanese election law discourages negative campaign advertising directed at other candidates, parties, or political organizations.[19] Campaign advertisements can only be broadcast during the two-week official campaign period and are closely monitored for violations of election law.
