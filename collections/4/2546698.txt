The most important casting decision was that of the host, the only human character in the show. The host's role was to empower and challenge the show's young viewers, to help increase their self-esteem, and to strongly connect with them through the television screen. The producers originally wanted a female host,[20] but after months of research and over 1,000 auditions, they hired actor/performer Steve Burns based on the strength of his audition.[1][20] Burns received the strongest and most enthusiastic response in tests with preschoolers.[21] Johnson said that what made Burns a great children's TV host was that "he didn't want to be a children's host ... He loved kids, but he didn't want to make a career out of it."[22] Burns remained on Blue's Clues for seven years and was in over 100 episodes before he left.[23][13] Burns himself stated, "I knew I wasn't gonna be doing children's television all my life, mostly because I refused to lose my hair on a kid's TV show, and it was happenin'—fast."[13]
