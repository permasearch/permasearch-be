At 10:10 a.m., Nedeljko Čabrinović bombed Franz Ferdinand's motorcade as it approached the Čumuria bridge.[8] Twenty people were wounded, but Franz Ferdinand was unhurt.[9] The bomb thrower had been instructed in Belgrade by Serbian Major Voja Tankosić to take potassium cyanide to prevent his capture.[10] Čabrinović swallowed the cyanide, but it only sickened him. The Sarajevo police arrested Čabrinović and brought him to the police first aid post.[11] Investigator Judge Leo Pfeffer was at the police station and was immediately assigned to investigate.[12] Before the investigation got far, news arrived that Gavrilo Princip had shot and killed Franz Ferdinand and Sophie while they were on their way to visit the wounded in the hospital.[12] Princip took his cyanide, but the cyanide had the same effect on Princip as it had on Čabrinović. The police arrested Princip, and he too was brought to the first aid post.[12] Within 45 minutes of the shooting, Princip began telling his story to Pfeffer.[13]
