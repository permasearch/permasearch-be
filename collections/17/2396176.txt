In Heathenry, moral and ethical views are based on the perceived ethics of Iron Age and Early Medieval Northwestern Europe,[91] in particular the actions of heroic figures who appear in Old Norse sagas.[92] Evoking a life-affirming ethos,[93] Heathen ethics focus on the ideals of honor, courage, integrity, hospitality, and hard work, and strongly emphasize loyalty to family.[94] It is common for practitioners to be expected to keep their word, particularly sworn oaths.[95] There is thus a strong individualist ethos focused around personal responsibility,[96] and a common motto within the Heathen community is that "We are our deeds".[97] Most Heathens reject the concept of sin and believe that guilt is a destructive rather than useful concept.[98]
