Audience response of the targeted family demographic to the musical has been generally positive.[50] Critics gave the show a mixed response, with some praising it,[51] and some calling it "less than witty"[52] and "bloated".[53] Ben Brantley of the New York Times was especially critical, saying that the "charm-free" musical is "stripped of the movieâ€™s generation-crossing appeal. Coherence of plot, endearing quirks of character, even the melodious wit of the original score (supplemented by new, substandard songs...) have been swallowed by an unfocused spectacle."[54] Time Magazine, however, commented, "It was one of the most ravishing things I have ever seen on a Broadway stage."[55]
