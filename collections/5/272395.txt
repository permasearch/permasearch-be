Queensland had plunged into an economic crisis after the separation of Queensland from New South Wales in 1859. This had led to severe unemployment with a peak in 1866. Gold was being mined in the state but the number of men involved was only small. On 8 January 1867 the Queensland Government offered a Â£3,000 reward for the discovery of more payable goldfields in the state. As a direct result 1867 saw new goldrushes.[178]
