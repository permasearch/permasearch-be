A low-intensity double-slit experiment was first performed by G. I. Taylor in 1909,[18] by reducing the level of incident light until photon emission/absorption events were mostly non overlapping.  A double-slit experiment was not performed with anything other than light until 1961, when Claus Jönsson of the University of Tübingen performed it with electron beams.[19][20] In 1974, the Italian physicists Pier Giorgio Merli, Gian Franco Missiroli, and Giulio Pozzi repeated the experiment using single electrons and biprism (instead of slits), showing that each electron interferes with itself as predicted by quantum theory.[21][22] In 2002, the single-electron version of the experiment was voted "the most beautiful experiment" by readers of Physics World.[23]
