A Special Edition DVD was released in October 2012,[17] featuring much improved picture restoration, especially of episodes two and three. The quality of the NTSC material was improved by combining colour from the Reverse Standards Conversion with geometrically-corrected picture information from the remastered black and white film recordings, and then applying VidFIRE to restore the smooth 'video look'. The Special Edition adds various new 'extras', including the complete, unedited version of the surviving studio recording.[18]
