There are two versions of the cover. The first has Adam and the Ants across the top of the sleeve and the later version just Adam Ant. This is probably due to the confusion around the timing of Adam going solo, particularly as the song was performed by three fifths of the bandâ€”Adam, Marco and Merrick (Hughes).[6]
