As part of the God of War franchise's tenth anniversary, Kratos appeared in the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita versions of Shovel Knight (released April 21, 2015), where he is a secret boss battle.[43][44] His next guest appearance brought him back to the world of LittleBigPlanet in LittleBigPlanet 3 as a new Sackboy costume in his Fear Kratos form, along with Sackboy costumes of Zeus, Hercules, Poseidon, and Athena, and a costume of Hades for new character Toggle. The costumes' release coincided with the release of God of War III Remastered on PlayStation 4 in July 2015.[45] A costume of Kratos as well as God of War custom decorations were included in the "Crafted Edition" of Tearaway Unfolded, which released on PlayStation 4 on September 8, 2015.[46] TC Carson provided Kratos' voice in all of his guest appearances,[33][37][47][48] except for LittleBigPlanet, ModNation Racers, LittleBigPlanet 3, and Tearaway Unfolded where the character is only a costume, and in Shovel Knight which only has text dialogue.
