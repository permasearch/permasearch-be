The Verge's Sean O'Kane stated in an op-ed that the episode "Adam Ruins Going Green" misrepresented a report on electric cars by Slate magazine. He writes, "But the biggest problem is that, when Conover makes this crucial argument in the video, he cites a piece written by Slate's senior technology writer Will Oremus in 2013 â€” a piece that's more about the difficulty of parsing all this information than it is about how electric cars might be dirty. What's more, Oremus spends a large chunk of his article explaining that how 'clean' your electric car is will vary depending on where you live, because different parts of the country use different percentages of these fuel sources to generate electricity."[11]
