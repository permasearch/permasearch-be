Historically Kuala Lumpur was a predominantly Chinese city, with the Kuala Lumpur of 1872 beside the Klang River described by Frank Swettenham as a "purely Chinese village", although a Malay stockade already existed at Bukit Nanas at that time. By 1875, after the Selangor Civil War had ended, Swettenham noted Malay quarters near the Chinese area in a sketch map he had drawn, and there were said to be 1,000 Chinese and 700 Malays in the town in this period (many of the Malays may have settled in Kuala Lumpur after the war).[24] More recently the Bumiputra component of the city has increased substantially and they are now the dominant group. Large number of Malays were originally from the other islands of Malay Archipelago â€“ Sumatrans such as the Mandailings, the Minangkabaus, Javanese, and Buginese began arriving in Kuala Lumpur in the 19th century, while the Acehnese arrived in the late 20th century.[109] Many Pahang Malays who fought in the Selangor Civil War in 1873 also chose to settle in Selangor after the war. The population of Kuala Lumpur was estimated to be around three thousand in 1880 when it was made the capital of Selangor.[110] In the following decade which saw the rebuilding of the town it showed considerable increase with a large influx of immigrants, due in large part to the construction of a railway line in 1886 connecting Kuala Lumpur and Klang.[26]
