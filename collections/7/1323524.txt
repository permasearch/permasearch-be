Levesque is a fan of the band Motörhead (which has performed three different entrance themes for Triple H over his career), and was good friends with lead singer Lemmy.[228] To pay homage to both Lemmy and the band, Levesque wore Lemmy-inspired facial hair during a large portion of his career.[229] After Lemmy died on December 28, 2015, Levesque attended his funeral on January 9, 2016, where he spoke about the gift of sound that Lemmy and Motörhead have given to him and the friendship they had over the years.[230]
