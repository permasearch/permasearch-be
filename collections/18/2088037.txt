In July 1972 the then UK Minister for Transport Industries, John Peyton announced that 86 miles (138Â km) of UK motorway particularly prone to fog would benefit from lighting in a project which "should be" completed by 1973.[10] Sections to be illuminated included the M1 between Junctions 3 and 14, and between Junctions 16 and 24.[10] In August 2011, the Highways Agency announced that despite being converted to Smart Motorway status, the lights will be switched off on stretches of the motorway between Junctions 10 (Luton) and 15 (Northampton) without affecting road user safety. The motorway junctions and their approaches, and a section of the M1 on either side of Junction 11 (north Luton), would have lighting columns replaced and remain lit. All lighting columns from Junctions 10 to 14 have now been removed completely, apart from some slip roads.[11]
