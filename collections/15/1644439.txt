The plastic section modulus is used to calculate the plastic moment, Mp, or full capacity of a cross-section. The two terms are related by the yield strength of the material in question, Fy, by Mp=Fy*Z. Plastic section modulus and elastic section modulus are related by a shape factor which can be denoted by 'k', used for an indication of capacity beyond elastic limit of material. This could be shown mathematically with the formulaÂ :-
