The late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, stated in a speech on 10 November 2005 to supporters in Caracas that he was saddened that "the president of a people like the Mexicans lets himself become the puppy dog of the empire", as well as appearing on his weekly talk show Al√≥ Presidente three days later, where he stated that the Mexican president was "bleeding from his wounds" and warned Fox to not "mess" with him, lest Fox "get stung".[3][4] Mexico's demand of an apology was unanswered by the Venezuelan government, and both countries pulled their respective ambassadors within two days of the talk show statement, starting the 2005 Mexico and Venezuela diplomatic crisis.[5][6]
