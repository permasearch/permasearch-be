It's exactly a month after "A" framed the girls for Alison's murder. Spencer rejects Toby and the gift he made her, Caleb returns to Hanna, and Ezra and Aria reveal their relationship to Aria's parents. The relationship between Aria, Emily, Hanna, and Spencer changes following their arrest. Spencer and Emily fight to trick 'A' into  believing that the girls were falling apart. The girls fool "A" into believing that they know something which was hidden in Alison's box that Jason gave to Aria. Emily meets "A" and shows them an empty box, making the girls' charade known to "A". "A" attacks Emily and tries to stab her with a nearby tool, but Aria and Spencer show up and corner them before they are able to use it. "A" shatters the glass from the ceiling by throwing up a pot and makes a run for it. As "A" exits the greenhouse they were in, Hanna pulls up, and "A" is hit by her car. The girls chase after "A," but lose them and, just when Spencer declares they have nothing, they notice "A's" cell phone lying on the ground.
