The sixth point of the treaty directly questions the degree of independence of Nepal. The fact that any differences between Nepal and Sikkim will be "referred to the arbitration of the East India Company" sees Nepal as a semi-independent or a vassal state or tributary of the British empire. The seventh point also limits the Foreign policy of Nepal. The eighth point also is  due attention as the term "Resident Minister" is used, and not "ambassador".
