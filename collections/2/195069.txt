Despite the growing tension, Haynes remained a member and Betts returned.[117] Their third post-reunion record, Where It All Begins (1994), was recorded entirely live.[117] "The Allman Brothers was a year-by-year thing. There was no indication that it was capable of staying together for years to come. We all looked at it as each tour could be the last one, and there was no reason to think otherwise," said Haynes.[118] The band continued to tour with greater frequency, attracting younger generations with their headlining of the H.O.R.D.E. Festival.[82][118] The group were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1995; Allman was severely inebriated and could not make it through his acceptance speech.[119] Seeing the ceremony broadcast on television later, Allman was mortified, providing a catalyst for his final, successful attempt to quit alcohol and substance abuse. During the 1996 run at the Beacon, turmoil came to a breaking point between Allman and Betts, nearly causing a cancellation of a show and causing another band breakup.[120] "We were upstairs in our dressing rooms [...] Iâ€™m sitting there thinking, 'This is it. This is how it finally ends,'" said Trucks.[121] Haynes and Woody left to focus on Gov't Mule, feeling as though a break was imminent with the Allman Brothers Band.[122][123]
