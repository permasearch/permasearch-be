Levi's performance has garnered widespread acclaim from critics, who enjoyed the actor's comedic delivery and singing voice.[76] Praising the directors' decision to "[bypass] big-name stars in favor of lesser-known talent", TV Guide described Levi's performance as "charming, roguish, and, well, generic enough".[77] Similarly, Mike Scott of The Times-Picayune wrote that Levi "comes off as an exaggerated, narcissistic version of the rascally Tory Belleci from TV's MythBusters", complimenting the fact that "the cast's names are less than household stature".[78] Rafer Guzman of Newsday described Levi's performance as "terrific".[79] ABC Online appreciated the fact that "the voices of the hero and heroine were not recognisable", concluding, "Zachary Levi and Mandy Moore ... do a really good job on the voices".[80] Dustin Hucks of Film School Rejects wrote that Levi "creates a significant amount of range and emotion with his voice that truly makes the suave thief with a heart of gold Flynn pop on the screen". Hucks went on to call Flynn "one the better [Disney heroes] that have come out of the Disney stable in quite a while".[81] Mathew DeKinder of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch appreciated the comedy in Levi's "quick-tongued delivery",[82] while Rolling Stone'sPeter Travers wrote that the actor "does a nice job" as Flynn.[83] James Luxford of The National wrote that both Levi and Moore "adeptly flesh out what could have been basic characters",[84] while Digital Spy's Simon Reynolds described Levi as "excellent as the rogueish hero".[85] Stephen Whitty of The Star-Ledger called Levi "a surprisingly perfect choice for the self-mocking Flynn".[86] Also pleasantly surprised, David Nusair of About.com wrote that "Levi effortlessly captures the character's transformation from a vain (yet charismatic) rogue to a compassionate love interest".[87] Praising the actor's singing voice, Jim Vejvoda of IGN described it as "impressive".[88]
