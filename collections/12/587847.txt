On Day 1, the original ten housemates - Bubble, Amma, Helen, Narinder, Stuart, Dean, Brian, Penny, Paul and Elizabeth - entered the house. During the first night, the housemates were informed by Big Brother that the Den had been unlocked, and they could now enter it. Upon entering, they found a dummy and a note, stating that an eleventh housemate would enter shortly after the first eviction. The public then learned that they could vote for either Anne, Josh, or Natasha to enter the game. On Day 2, they were given their first weekly task. They were required to build a fire in the backyard by noon, and had to keep it lit for a consecutive 120 hours - five days. The fire had to be watched by two or more housemates at all times. They wagered 30% of their weekly budget on the task. On Day 5, the group failed the task as Helen left Elizabeth alone with the fire. They were informed of their loss a few days later. On Day 6, Helen celebrated her 23rd birthday in the house. She was given the choice of two presents: either taking a Gucci handbag and shoes or taking a party for the house. She decided to take the party for the house, which they had later that night.
