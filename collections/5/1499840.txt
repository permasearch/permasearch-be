Much more "by the book" than her partner, Detective Garibaldi, and very defensive of her police practices. Made advances on the married Captain Furillo, who politely declined a romantic relationship. Chief Daniels became infatuated with her in Season 5 after reviewing a videotape of her being undressed by a predatory dentist; when Mayo rebuffed his advances, Daniels tried to have her kicked off the force, until Furillo intervened. Returned to Midtown at the beginning of Season 6.
