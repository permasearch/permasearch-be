The story was later attributed to the Irish author Oliver Goldsmith, though this is disputed. Because Goldsmith frequently wrote for pay, and because of his copious fiction in essays (e.g., The Bee and Citizen of the World), the attribution to Goldsmith is plausible. Washington Irving was one supporter of Goldsmith's authoring the book; he said: "Several quaint little tales introduced in Goldsmith's Essays show that he had a turn for this species of mock history; and the advertisement and title-page bear the stamp of his sly and playful humor."[5] However, the book has also been attributed to Newbery himself and to Giles Jones, a friend of Newbery's.[6] "Booksellers" (publishers) such as Newbery would frequently pay authors for anonymous work, and no certain evidence of attribution has emerged.[citation needed]
