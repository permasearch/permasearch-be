Prince Louis intended to land in the south of England in May 1216, and John assembled a naval force to intercept him.[211] Unfortunately for John, his fleet was dispersed by bad storms and Louis landed unopposed in Kent.[211] John hesitated and decided not to attack Louis immediately, either due to the risks of open battle or over concerns about the loyalty of his own men.[211] Louis and the rebel barons advanced west and John retreated, spending the summer reorganising his defences across the rest of the kingdom.[215] John saw several of his military household desert to the rebels, including his half-brother, William LongespÃ©e. By the end of the summer the rebels had regained the south-east of England and parts of the north.[215]
