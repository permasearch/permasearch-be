The format of the 1970s revivals were essentially unchanged from the original series, though celebrity secrets, rather than challenges to the panel (whose members changed weekly), did return. Richard Dawson served as a regular panelist on both versions in the 1970s, and Henry Morgan appeared as a panelist a few times as well.
