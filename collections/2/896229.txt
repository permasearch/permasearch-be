Typically the outfit of choice for Matt is a blue-and-white plaid sport coat, a white dress shirt, a solid green necktie, black Horn-rimmed glasses, too-tight khakis, a wrist watch, dress shoes and has well-groomed blond hair. In prison, he dons blue jeans and a denim shirt with the inmate number "3307" while retaining his watch, glasses and a crucifix necklace (he also mentions a "homemade tattoo of a van down by the river"). While working as a mall Santa, he wears a stereotypical Santa outfit, complete with black snow boots.
