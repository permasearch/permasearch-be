The fourth season received mixed reviews. The season earned a strong critical start, with praise given to the action scenes and Neal McDonough's performance as Damien Darhk. However, the second half of the season received increasingly negative reviews for its mundane flashbacks, lack of narrative focus, and formulaic season finale.[89] Ryan Fleming, of Deadbeatspanel.com noted that Arrow was "honoring the comics, but it isn't beholden to them. Characters... have been introduced, but they aren't exact replicas of their comic counterparts. Instead, the characters tend to be loosely connected."[90] Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter noted the presence of the character Thea "Speedy" Queen as one of the larger departures from the comics in the series, as well as the character's early willingness to kill.[91] Comic Book Resources's Kevin Melrose has also noted the series tendency to have loose connections to the source material.[92]
