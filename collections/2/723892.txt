The theory of spontaneous generation was proposed by Aristotle,[73] who compiled and expanded the work of prior natural philosophers and the various ancient explanations of the appearance of organisms; it held sway for two millennia. It was decisively dispelled by the experiments of Louis Pasteur in 1859, who expanded upon the investigations of predecessors such as Francesco Redi.[74][75] Disproof of the traditional ideas of spontaneous generation is no longer controversial among biologists.[76][77][78]
