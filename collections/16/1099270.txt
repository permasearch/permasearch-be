In 2009, Eli, Peyton, and Archie Manning co-authored a children's book entitled Family Huddle, which describes in simple text and pictures how the three Manning brothers played football as young boys (Scholastic Press; illustrations by Jim Madsen). In 2010, Eli Manning appeared in a commercial to raise awareness for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, in wake of the catastrophe.[citation needed]
