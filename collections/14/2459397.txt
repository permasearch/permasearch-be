Thiazide diuretics also increase calcium reabsorption at the distal tubule. By lowering the sodium concentration in the tubule epithelial cells, thiazides indirectly increase the activity of the basolateral Na+/Ca2+ antiporter. This facilitates the transport of Ca2+ from the epithelial cells into the renal interstitium. This movement of Ca2+, in turn, decreases the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, which allows more Ca2+ to diffuse from the lumen of the tubules into epithelial cells via apical Ca2+-selective channels (TRPV5). In other words, less Ca2+ in the cell increases the driving force for reabsorption from the lumen.[17]
