Prior to and after the onset of the Troubles the UVF carried out armed robberies.[120][121] This activity has been described as its preferred source of funds in the early 1970s,[122] and it continued into the 2000s with the UVF in Co Londonderry being active.[114] Members were disciplined after they carried out an unsanctioned theft of £8 million of paintings from an estate in Co Wicklow in April 1974.[123] Like the IRA, the UVF also operated black taxi services,[124][125][126] a scheme believed to have generated £100,000 annually for the organisation.[120] The UVF has also been involved in the extortion of legitimate businesses, although to a lesser extent than the UDA,[127] and was described in the fifth IMC report as being involved in organised crime.[128] In 2002 the House of Commons Northern Ireland Affairs Committee estimated the UVF's annual running costs at £1–2 million per year, against an annual fundraising capability of £1.5 million.[129]
