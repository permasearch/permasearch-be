Lee Marek and "Marek's Kid Scientists" performed the Diet Coke and Mentos experiment on the Late Show with David Letterman in 1999.[4][6][12] In March 2002, Steve Spangler, a science educator, did the demonstration on KUSA-TV, an NBC affiliate, in Denver, Colorado.[13] The Diet Coke and Mentos geyser experiment became an internet sensation in September 2005. The experiment became a subject of the television show MythBusters in 2006.[12][14] Spangler signed a licensing agreement with Perfetti Van Melle, the maker of Mentos, after inventing an apparatus aimed to make it easier to drop the Mentos into the bottle and produce a large soda geyser.[15] Amazing Toys, Spangler's toy company, released the Geyser Tube toys in February 2007.[16] In October 2010, a Guinness World Record of 2,865 simultaneous geysers was set at an event organized by Perfetti Van Melle at the SM Mall of Asia Complex, in Manila, Philippines.[17] This record was afterwards beaten in November 2014 by another event organized by Perfetti Van Melle and Chupa Chups in Le√≥n, Guanajuato, Mexico, where 4,334 Mentos and soda fountains were set off simultaneously.[18]
