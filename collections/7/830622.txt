Young birds were often captured and kept in menageries both in India and in Europe in former times. They were also successfully bred in captivity early in the 17th century by Emperor Jehangir[89] who also noted that the eggs were laid with an interval of two days and that incubation period was 34 days.[7] They were also bred in zoos in Europe and the United States in the early 1930s.[50][90]
