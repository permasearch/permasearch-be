South Canara was a district under the British empire which included the present Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, Kasaragod districts and Aminidivi islands.[8][9] Canara district was bifurcated in 1859 to form North Canara and South Canara.[10] Dakshina Kannada became a district of Mysore State in 1956 which later was renamed Karnataka in 1973. Kasaragod became a district of Kerala during the Re-organization of States and Aminidivi islands later became a part of Lakshadweep.[11] The Udupi district was formed from the northern taluks of Dakshina Kannada in 1997.[12] Later, the Karnataka Government, for the purpose of administration, split the greater Dakshina Kannada district into Udupi and present day Dakshina Kannada districts on 15 August 1997.[13] Three taluks of the former district — Udupi, Karkala and Kundapura — formed the new Udupi district.[14]
