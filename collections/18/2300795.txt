Ireland banned smoking in early 2004 in pubs and clubs. In March 2006, a law was introduced to forbid smoking in all enclosed public places in Scotland. Wales followed suit in April 2007, with England introducing the ban in July 2007.[35] Pub landlords had raised concerns prior to the implementation of the law that a smoking ban would have a negative impact on sales.[36] After two years, the impact of the ban was mixed; some pubs suffered declining sales, while others developed their food sales.[37] The Wetherspoon pub chain reported in June 2009 that profits were at the top end of expectations;[38] however, Scottish & Newcastle's takeover by Carlsberg and Heineken was reported in January 2008 as partly the result of its weakness following falling sales due to the ban.[39] Similar bans are applied in Australian pubs with smoking only allowed in designated areas.
