According to historian Mark Johnston, "the killing of unarmed Japanese was common" and Australian command tried to put pressure on troops to actually take prisoners, but the troops proved reluctant.[85] When prisoners were indeed taken "it often proved difficult to prevent them from killing captured Japanese before they could be interrogated".[86] According to Johnston, as a consequence of this type of behavior, "Some Japanese soldiers were almost certainly deterred from surrendering to Australians".[86]
