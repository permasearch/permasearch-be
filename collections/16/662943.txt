Shaw's and Star Market are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Boise, Idahoâ€“based Albertsons. The combined chain has the largest base of stores that operate in New England, but is the third-largest behind Quincy, Massachusetts-based Stop & Shop and Scarborough, Maine-based Hannaford Brothers Company; Hannaford operates stores in New York while Stop & Shop's operations extend into New Jersey; only Shaw's does business solely in New England.
