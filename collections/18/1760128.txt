The Constitution of China (simplified Chinese: 中华人民共和国宪法; traditional Chinese: 中華人民共和國憲法; pinyin: Zhōnghuá Rénmín Gònghéguó Xiànfǎ) is nominally the supreme law within the People's Republic of China. The current version was adopted by the 5th National People's Congress on December 4, 1982, with further revisions in 1988, 1993, 1999, and 2004. Three previous state constitutions—those of 1954, 1975, and 1978—were superseded in turn. The current constitution is China's twelfth constitution since 1911.[1] See a timeline of all previous constitutions and amendments here. The Constitution has five sections which are the preamble, general principles, fundamental rights and duties of citizens, structure of the state (which includes such state organs as the National People's Congress, the State Council, the Local People's Congress and Local People's Governments and the People's Courts and the People's Procuratorates), the national flag and the emblems of the state.
