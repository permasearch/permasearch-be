The episode is written by David North and directed by Dennis Smith. Before the finale aired, then executive producer Shane Brennan stated that it would be "jaw-dropping" and "stunning" and that the impact of the episode's events would "send shockwaves" through NCIS. He further elaborated, "We filmed a secret ending, and those pages were only in one copy of the script. People will see the finale and say, 'I know what's going to happen next in the first episode back.' Wrong. You don't know what's going to happen. People will go, 'Am I really seeing that? What just happened?' It really is exciting. I promised that with [the Season 5 finale] 'Judgment Day,' and I think we delivered. It is very much in that vein."[4]
