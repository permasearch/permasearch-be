Compared to its predecessors, Escape dwelt more heavily on themes of racial conflict, which became a primary focus through the rest of the series.[35] The film opened on May 21, 1971, less than a year after Beneath. It was well received by critics.[36] From this point critics began seeing the films less as independent units and more as installments in a greater work; Cinefantastique editor Frederick S. Clarke wrote that the burgeoning series had "the promise of being the first epic of filmed science fiction."[37] It also performed well at the box office, though not as strongly as its predecessors. Fox ordered a third sequel.[38]
