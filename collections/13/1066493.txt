Cruella's Car' is a 1920s England vehicle owned by Cruella De Vil, though it originally belonged to Isaac Heller during his brief stay in her world. There is also a car that resembles Cruella's car in the Land Without Magic. The exterior of the car is black and white, with a red carpeted interior; the rear of the vehicle, which as has a red carpet layout, has a truck with a spare tire compartment attached. The licence plate reads "DEV IL". A duplicate version of the 1920s England vehicle is seen in the Underworld, also owned by Cruella.
