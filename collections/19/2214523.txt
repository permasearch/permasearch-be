Dell XPS Towers were released in July 2016. Three systems were introduced: the XPS Tower, XPS Tower VR, and the XPS Tower Special Edition. All systems are introduced with 6th-generation (Skylake) i5 and i7 CPUs, at least 8Â GB of DDR4 memory, and are designed with an easy to open chassis for simple expandability. One of the main differences from the 8900 is that now the m.2 connector supports 4 PCE-E lanes instead of 1. The VR and Special Edition meet and exceed the minimum recommended specifications for running virtual reality and the Special Edition passed testing for the Oculus Ready and HTC Vive Optimized certification programs.[4]
