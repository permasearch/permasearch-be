The name caribou comes, through the French, from the Mi'kmaq xalibu or Qalipu meaning "the one who paws".[21] Marc Lescarbot in his publication in French,[22] used the term "caribou." Silas Tertius Rand translated the Mi'kmaq word Kaleboo as "caribou" in his Mi'kmaq-English.[23][24] The Gwichâ€™in people have over two dozen distinct caribou-related words.[18] In Inuktitut, spoken in the eastern Arctic, the caribou is known by the name "tuktu".[25]
