Scott grew up in one of Dr. Evil's lairs while Dr. Evil was still frozen. Once Dr. Evil returned and learned that he had a son, he tried to bond with Scott, but Scott was resentful that his father was absent for so long. While Dr. Evil is an over-the-top villain with gratuitously elaborate schemes for world domination, Scott is a reasonably intelligent young man with common sense and his own interests, which do not necessarily align with his fathers dreams for him. For example, when Scott expresses interest in becoming a vet, his father suggests hopefully, "An evil vet?" (Scott: "No! Maybe like work in a petting zoo." Dr. Evil: "An evil petting zoo?")
