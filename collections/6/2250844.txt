The corticospinal tract is a white matter motor pathway starting at the cortex that terminates on motor neurons and interneurons in the spinal cord, controlling movements of the limbs and trunk.[1] There are more than 1 million neurons in the corticospinal tract, and they become myelinated usually in the first two years of life.
