From the mid to the late 20th century, a party realignment took place, with white conservatives joining the Republican Party. Until then Southern Democrats controlled the politics of southern states and established white supremacy. As Congressional apportionment of seats was based on the total population, the Southern white Democrats, the Southern bloc, had tremendous legislative power for decades. Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment could have been used to reduce Congressional representation for states that denied suffrage on racial grounds, but this provision was not enforced. Opponents of the Southern bloc could not overcome their political power.[4]
