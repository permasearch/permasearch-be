Sean Finnerty (Donal Logue) - Initially in the city lines as a laborer. In the later seasons, he owns and operates The Red Boot Bar with his brother Eddie. A Red Boot Pub dartboard can be found in the Finnerty household in the livingroom. Father of three (later four) kids, Sean also deals with his judgmental father, his irresponsible brother, and the head nun/principal at his children's school, Sister Helen. Sean is often getting into trouble with his irresponsible brother. His nickname for Claudia is baby. In many episodes he is depicted as a hothead and he has a lot of difficulty parenting, on account of the fact that he was only eighteen when Lily was born. He is also shown in many episodes to be a skilled guitar player, with him and Eddie having been in a band together in their youth.
