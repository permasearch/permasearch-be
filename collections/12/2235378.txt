David Denby of The New Yorker stated that the character of Lisbeth Salander clearly accounts for a large part of the novels' success.[19] Deirdre Donahue of USA Today referred to Salander as "one of the most startling, engaging and sometimes perplexing heroines in recent memory."[20] The New York Times's David Kamp called her "one of the most original characters in a thriller to come along in a while."[21] Likewise, Muriel Dobbin from The Washington Times dubbed her one of the most fascinating characters to emerge in crime fiction in years; "Her remoteness and her capacity for anger and violence are in contrast with a desperate vulnerability that she reveals only to the most unlikely of people."[22]
