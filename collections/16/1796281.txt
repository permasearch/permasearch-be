Safe sex commonly involves the use of condoms (also known as male condoms), but female condoms, which give women more control during the safe sex practice, may also be used; both condoms keep semen from coming in contact with the vagina, which can help prevent unwanted pregnancy.[108][109] There is, however, little research on whether female condoms are as effective as male condoms at preventing STIs,[109] and they are slightly less effective than male condoms at preventing pregnancy, which may be due to the female condom not fitting as tightly as the male condom or because it can slip into the vagina and spill semen.[110]
