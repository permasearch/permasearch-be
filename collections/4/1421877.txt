Acorn worms are dioecious, having separate biological sexes, although at least some species are also capable of asexual reproduction. They have paired gonads, which lie close to the pharynx and release the gametes through a small pore near to the gill slits. The female lays a large number of eggs embedded in a gelatinous mass of mucus, which are then externally fertilized by the male before water currents break up the mass and disperse the individual eggs.[12]
