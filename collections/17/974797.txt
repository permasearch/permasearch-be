After leaving downtown Mount Vernon, the freeway intersects SR 538, which serves the Skagit Valley College and Clear Lake (via SR 9). After the interchange, the highway crosses the Skagit River, where part of the bridge collapsed on May 23, 2013, leaving a gap in the highway until a temporary bailey bridge span was built and opened on June 19. In September it was replaced with a more permanent span. On the other side of the river it continues north through Burlington. After passing the Cascade Mall, I-5 intersects SR 20, which goes west to Anacortes (via SR 20 Spur), Deception Pass, Whidbey Island, and Discovery Bay and SR 20 goes east to Okanogan, Omak, and Newport.[44] The freeway also intersects SR 11, which serves Edison, Bow, Samish Island, and Bellingham.
