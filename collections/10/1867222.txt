"Take Me Home", the final single released from the album, is often considered to be one of Collins's most well-known songs, and has been a part of all of his tours since The No Jacket Required World Tour. It reached number seven on the US Billboard charts, and number 19 on the UK charts.[35] The song was not slated for a single release, but the label decided to do so after it became an airplay hit on several US radio stations who decided to play the track.[36] "Take Me Home" also got a video where Collins sung in various locations around the world.[16]
