On 14 April 1912, Olympic, now under the command of Herbert James Haddock, was on a return trip from New York. Wireless operator Ernest James Moore[57] received the distress call from Titanic, when she was approximately 500 nautical miles (930 km; 580 mi) west by south of Titanic's location.[58] Haddock calculated a new course, ordered the ship's engines to be set to full power and headed to assist in the rescue.[59]
