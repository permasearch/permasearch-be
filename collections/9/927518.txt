Apart from hosting Barcelona, Camp Nou is home to the Catalan team.[13] The stadium is frequently used for other football events. The European Cup final between Milan and Steaua București was held on 24 May 1989, with the Italian club winning 4–0.[14] Camp Nou hosted part of the football competition, including the final, in the 1992 Summer Olympics.[15] In preparation for these matches, two additional tiers of seating were installed over the previous roof-line.[16]
