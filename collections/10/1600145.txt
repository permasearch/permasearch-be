Michigan's personal income tax is set to a flat rate of 4.25%. In addition, 22Â cities impose income taxes; rates are set at 1% for residents and 0.5% for non-residents in all but four cities.[119] Michigan's state sales tax is 6%, though items such as food and medication are exempted from sales tax. Property taxes are assessed on the local level, but every property owner's local assessment contributes six mills (a rate of $6 per $1000 of property value) to the statutory State Education Tax. Property taxes are appealable to local boards of review and need the approval of the local electorate to exceed millage rates prescribed by state law and local charters. In 2011, the state repealed its business tax and replaced it with a 6% corporate income tax which substantially reduced taxes on business.[120][121] Article IX of the Constitution of the State of Michigan also provides limitations on how much the state can tax.
