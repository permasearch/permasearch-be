VidCon 2016 was held from June 23-25 at the Anaheim Convention Center.[21] The convention announced plans to tighten security at its events in the wake of singer Christina Grimmie's shooting and the Orlando nightclub massacre. Security measures included the addition of metal detectors, enhancing the number of security officers and banning informal meet-and-greets between community members and YouTubers after panels.
