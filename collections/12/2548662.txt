Radiation Pathology is study of the interaction between human tissues and radiation, as well as the problems and diseases that can arise from the use of radiation. When human tissue is exposed to radiation, it can be genetically altered and deformed; in turn, this could lead to a variety of illnesses that could be minor or deadly.[17]
