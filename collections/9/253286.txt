Following the IAU decision, Kenyon D. Wilson composed a trombone quintet piece titled "Songs of Distant Earth".[40] The title comes from Arthur C. Clarke's novel of the same name. The composition contains five movements, each named after one of the five known dwarf planets, Eris, Pluto, Haumea, Makemake, and Ceres.
