Sections 4 and 10 allows courts to issue a declaration of incompatibility where it is impossible to use section 3 to interpret primary or subordinate legislation to be compatible with the articles of the European Convention of Human Rights, which are also part of the Human Rights Act.[9] In these cases, interpretation to comply may conflict with legislative intent.[10] It is considered a measure of last resort. A range of superior courts can issue a declaration of incompatibility.[9]
