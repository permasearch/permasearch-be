In 1984 they claimed there was a "one-to-one correspondence" between SES and earthquakes[69] – that is, that "every sizable EQ is preceded by an SES and inversely every SES is always followed by an EQ the magnitude and the epicenter of which can be reliably predicted"[70] – the SES appearing between 6 and 115 hours before the earthquake. As proof of their method they claimed a series of successful predictions.[71]
