In 1994, ABC canceled America's Funniest People after four seasons due to declining ratings and had to decide what to do with the Sunday night 7:30 p.m. Eastern slot that was now left vacant. After trying out the short-lived sitcom On Our Own in the 7:30 p.m. slot after AFHV during the 1994–95 season,[18] ABC then later chose to expand America's Funniest Home Videos to one hour with back-to-back airings, with that week's new episode being shown in the first half-hour, followed by a repeat from a previous season to fill the remaining time. On February 1, 1996, another spinoff of AFHV debuted called World's Funniest Videos;[19] which was taped at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Florida; this series was also hosted by Coulier, along with actress Eva LaRue. Paired with a weekly version of the popular Before They Were Stars specials on Thursday nights, World's Funniest Videos focused on funny and amazing home videos from around the world.[20] However, due to low ratings, ABC put it on hiatus a few weeks after its debut,[21] before cancelling the series outright after only one season and burning off the remaining episodes that summer. For Saget's final season on AFHV, two new episodes would be shown.
