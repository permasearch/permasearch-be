This album marked the first appearance of Mike Shoun, the drummer that joined the band following the departure of previous drummer, Patrick Mullins. Shoun's arrival marked a change in the band's sound. John Dwyer noted that his style "brought it up to a more party thing".[5] The change in style can be observed in Thee Hounds of Foggy Notion, which was recorded prior to the creation of The Master's Bedroom Is Worth Spending a Night In (both were released in 2008). The songs "Block of Ice" and "Ghost In The Trees" appear on both releases, but the latter performances on The Master's Bedroom... are faster and more rock-oriented. "Two Drummers Disappear" also features Chris Woodhouse as second drummer.[6] Woodhouse was the mix engineer for the twelve of the songs on the album that were recorded in San Francisco. The remaining three tracks, "Graveyard Drug Party", "Maria Stacks", and "You Will See This Dog Before You Die", were recorded in New York City with mix engineers Dave Sitek (of TV on the Radio) and Chris Moore. Jigmae Baer was the drummer for these three tracks, rather than Mike Shoun.[7][8]
