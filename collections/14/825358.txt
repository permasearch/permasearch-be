Before Katrina’s landfall in 2005, the economy of New Orleans relied heavily on its usefulness and income derived from being a port city. The population grew and the economy peaked in the late 19th century. However, in the recent years, after rapid industrialization and the development of faster methods of transporting goods, the economy of New Orleans has been in a steady decline.[90] As a result, New Orleans came to rely on three major industries for economic revenue: transportation, entertainment, and public services.[91] However, after Katrina’s landfall, these sectors, including the overall economy, were reduced and heavily affected by the natural disaster.
