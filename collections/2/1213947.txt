Many people wonder where the Xs came from, and how were they ever used on beer.  In truth, the three Xs are actually a quality rating system.  The system was initially used in Europe during the 16th Century.  As European royalty traveled their lands and visited neighboring counties, a royal courier was sent ahead of the official party.  The courier’s job was to sample beer at inns along the way.  If the beer was only average, the courier would mark the inn’s sign or door with a single X.  If the inn’s beer was deemed good, the sign or door would receive two Xs.  A mark on an inn of three Xs meant that the beer inside was excellent, and a must-stop for the royal court as they passed through.
