Other Native American legends tell of some Chippewa parents who came to the pool seeking names for their newborn sons or daughters. They supposedly found names like Satu (darling), Kakushika (big eye), Natukoro (lovely flower) and We-shi (little fish) in the sounds of the rippling water.[5] Still other legends say the Chippewa Native Americans had even attributed special healing powers to the spring waters.[5]
