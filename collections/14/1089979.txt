Upon opening of the ascus, ascospores may be dispersed by the wind, while in some cases the spores are forcibly ejected form the ascus; certain species have evolved spore cannons, which can eject ascospores up to 30Â cm. away. When the spores reach a suitable substrate, they germinate, form new hyphae, which restarts the fungal life cycle.
