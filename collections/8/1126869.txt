Berlioz met Estelle Fornier – the object of his childhood affections – in Lyon for the first time in 40 years, and began a regular correspondence with her.[4] Berlioz soon realized that he still longed for her, and eventually she had to inform him that as a married woman there was no possibility that they could become closer than friends.[65] By 1865, an initial printing of 1200 copies of his Mémoires was completed. A few copies were distributed amongst his friends, but the bulk were, slightly morbidly, stored in his office at the Paris Conservatoire, to be sold upon his death.[11] He traveled to Vienna in December 1866, where he was invited to conduct the first complete performance of La damnation de Faust; the music was generally successful, but was reviled by critics. In 1867 Berlioz's son Louis, a merchant shipping captain, died[12] of yellow fever[17] in Havana.[15] After learning this, Berlioz burnt a large number of documents and other mementos which he had accumulated during his life,[4] keeping only a conducting baton given to him by Mendelssohn and a guitar given to him by Paganini.[15] He then wrote his will. The intestinal pains had been gradually increasing, and had now spread to his stomach, and whole days were passed in agony. At times he experienced spasms in the street so intense that he could barely move.[66] Later that year he embarked on his second concert tour of Russia, which would also be his last of any kind. The tour was extremely lucrative for him, so much so that Berlioz turned down an offer of 100,000 francs from American Steinway to perform in New York.[39] In Saint Petersburg, Berlioz experienced a special pleasure at performing with the "first-rate" orchestra of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory.[39] He returned to Paris in 1868, exhausted, with his health damaged due to the Russian winter.[15] He immediately traveled to Nice to recuperate in the Mediterranean climate, but slipped on some rocks by the sea shore, possibly due to a stroke, and had to return to Paris, where he lived as an invalid.[15] In August 1868, he made his last trip to Grenoble where he lived with his sister and her family. Invited by Mayor Jean Vendre during three days of festivities for the inauguration of a statue of Napoleon, he presided at a music festival.[67]
