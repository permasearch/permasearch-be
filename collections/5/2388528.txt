Ancient references to the pattern of even and odd numbers in the Lo Shu appear in the I Ching; however, the earliest unequivocal appearance of the Lo Shu in the form of a magic square dates to the early 12th century.[12] Legends dating from as early as 650 BC tell the story of the Lo Shu (洛書) or "scroll of the river Lo".[10] According to the legend, there was at one time in ancient China a huge flood. While the great king Yu was trying to channel the water out to sea, a turtle emerged from it with a curious pattern on its shell: a 3×3 grid in which circular dots of numbers were arranged, such that the sum of the numbers in each row, column and diagonal was the same: 15. According to the legend, thereafter people were able to use this pattern in a certain way to control the river and protect themselves from floods.
