On February 28, 1681, Charles II granted a land charter[42] to William Penn to repay a debt of £16,000[43] (around £2,100,000 in 2008, adjusting for retail inflation)[44] owed to William's father, Admiral William Penn. This was one of the largest land grants to an individual in history.[45] The King named it Pennsylvania (literally "Penn's Woods") in honor of the Admiral. Penn, the son, who wanted it to be called New Wales, and then Sylvania (from the Latin silva: "forest, woods"), was embarrassed at the change, fearing that people would think he had named it after himself, but King Charles would not rename the grant.[46] Penn established a government with two innovations that were much copied in the New World: the county commission and freedom of religious conviction.[45]
