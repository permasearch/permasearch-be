The main symbol of the monarchy is the sovereign herself,[165] described as "the personal expression of the Crown in Canada,"[236] and her image is thus used to signify Canadian sovereignty and government authorityâ€”her effigy, for instance, appearing on currency, and her portrait in government buildings.[131] The sovereign is further both mentioned in and the subject of songs, loyal toasts, and salutes.[237] A royal cypher, appearing on buildings and official seals, or a crown, seen on provincial and national coats of arms, as well as police force and Canadian Forces regimental and maritime badges and rank insignia, is also used to illustrate the monarchy as the locus of authority,[238] the latter without referring to any specific monarch.
