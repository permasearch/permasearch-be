When measurement variables are employed in interactions, it is often desirable to work with centered versions, where the variable's mean (or some other reasonably central value) is set as zero. Centering makes the main effects in interaction models more interpretable. The coefficient a in the equation above, for example, represents the effect of x1 when x2 equals zero. Centering can also reduce problems with multicollinearity.
