Members of the church donate fast offerings on Fast Sunday and at other times for the purpose of helping those who are poor or financially struggling. The bishop will meet with a family, or the head(s) of a family to determine whether and how much help they need from the church. The church strongly encourages its members to be self-reliant, so these meetings will usually include a plan on how to get the family back on its own feet. This welfare program is not only available to members of the church, but to any needy members of the community. On a general church scale, the church engages in humanitarian efforts which provides money and supplies to assist victims of natural disasters. All of these services are paid for by charitable donations and are run by volunteer workers. $104.9 million of aid was given in 2007. As of AprilÂ 2010[update] there are 8,500 welfare service missionaries serving in the church.[154]
