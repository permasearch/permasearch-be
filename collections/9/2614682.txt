The work ethic was particularly strong in the Bradshaw household. Bradshaw spent his early childhood in Camanche, Iowa, where he set forth the goal to play professional football.[6] When he was a teenager, Bradshaw returned with his family, including his brothers, to Shreveport.[7] There, he attended Woodlawn High School, played under assistant coach A. L. Williams, and led the Knights to the 1965 AAA High School Championship game. His team then lost to the Sulphur Golden Tornadoes 12–9. While at Woodlawn, he set a national record for throwing the javelin 245 feet (74.68 m).[8] His exploits earned him a spot in the Sports Illustrated feature Faces In The Crowd. Bradshaw's successor as Woodlawn's starting quarterback was another future NFL standout, Joe Ferguson of the Buffalo Bills. Bradshaw's Steelers would defeat Ferguson's Bills in a 1974 divisional playoff game.
