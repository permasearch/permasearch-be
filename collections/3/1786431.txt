During World War II, St. Louis was the location of a large ammunition factory and the Curtiss-Wright aircraft factory.[181] Area factories also produced uniforms and footwear, K-rations, and chemicals and medicines.[182] The uranium used in the Manhattan Project was refined in St. Louis by Mallinckrodt Chemical Company starting in 1942, and several atomic bomb scientists had ties to St. Louis, including Arthur Compton.[183] At the start of the war, many German, Italian, and Japanese St. Louisans were interrogated or arrested, while the FBI investigated charges of sedition in the area.[181][184] Residents engaged in civil defense drills and supported the war effort with scrap drives and war bond purchases.[185][186] St. Louis produced several notable soldiers in the war, including Edward O'Hare, who grew up in St. Louis and won the Medal of Honor for combat in the Pacific.[187] St. Louis also was home to Wendell O. Pruitt, an African-American pilot who shot down three enemy aircraft and destroyed multiple ground targets in June 1944.[188]
