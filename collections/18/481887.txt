The Trump Organization agreed to turn the Old Post Office building into a 260-room[139][141][142] hotel (although some sources said there would be 267 rooms,[143] some said 270,[121][144] some said 271,[122][145] and others 275[140]). Many of the rooms would have 25-foot (7.6 m) high ceilings,[145] although most ceilings would be 14-to-16-foot (4.3 to 4.9 m) high.[122][146] The average room was expected to be 600 square feet (56 m2) in size,[122][146] and the hotel would have a higher percentage of suites and larger-than-average rooms to draw corporate executive and diplomats.[147]
