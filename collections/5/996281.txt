This model of Evolution was used on the film 2 Fast 2 Furious as the car driven by the late Paul Walker. He drove a yellow Evolution 7 which was lightly modified performance wise but heavily modified when it comes to the aesthetics. However, one of the producers claimed that they used a 2001 Mitsubishi Lancer Ralliart edition instead of an Evo as the car used for production and stunt scenes.
