As part of a large group of legislation passed during the Progressive Era in the early 1900s, U.S. Congress established the United States Tariff Commission in 1916, which had a purpose to apply scientific principles to the study of tariffs and to assist in recommending appropriate tariff levels.[16] Frank Taussig, then an Economics professor at Harvard University, was named the U.S. Tariff Commission's very first Chairman.[16] The first offices of the U.S. Tariff Commission were located at 1322 New York Avenue, Washington D.C.[16] Also in 1921, the U.S. Tariff Commission moved to the Old Post Office Building at 7th and E Street NW.[16]
