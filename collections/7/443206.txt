John Lasseter announced that Cars 3 would include a tribute to Doc. McQueen's crash in the teaser was a reference to Doc's accident and he often recalled pieces of advice that Doc gave him in flashbacks. Lightning went to Doc's old trainer, Smokey in Thomasville, Georgia for help and watched movies of Doc's old races for inspiration. Smokey also explained that training Lightning, not racing, was the most enjoyable part of Doc's life. At the end, Lightning adopted Doc's old racing colors and painted "The Fabulous Lightning McQueen" on himself in honor of Doc, "The Fabulous Hudson Hornet." Lightning's bumper also read, "For Doc Hudson." Cruz Ramirez, a trainer who subsequently started a racing career of her own took on Doc's old number 51 as a second tribute.
