The knights regroup and are joined by Sir Gawain, Sir Ector, and Sir Bors, and a group of monks led by Brother Maynard. They encounter Tim the Enchanter, who points them to caves where the location of the grail is written. To enter the caves, the group must defeat the Rabbit of Caerbannog. After the rabbit kills Gawain, Ector and Bors during a failed attack, Brother Maynard provides the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, which Arthur uses to kill the rabbit. The knights enter the cave and find an inscription written by Joseph of Arimathea, which states that the Grail can be found in the "Castle of Aarrgh". The group is attacked by the Legendary Black Beast of Aarrgh, which devours Brother Maynard. Arthur and his knights escape when the beast's animator suffers a fatal heart attack.
