Missionaries such as Francis Xavier of Spain (who pushed for the Goa Inquisition in India) as well as other Jesuits, Augustinians, Franciscans and Dominicans went to Asia and the Far East. In the social and cultural spheres, the European colonial rule produced dire consequences. In the first place it adversely affected the religions of the local people because the local people were encouraged by the Western missionaries to embrace Christianity by offering them certain material benefits. As a result, Christianity soon (though not always the majority) became a thriving religion in many Asian and African countries.[18]
