The angel makes arrangements to send Sanjay back to earth, but his body has already been cremated. Then, the angel takes him to the house of Tarun Kumar, Sanjay's lookalike, who should have been originally killed instead of Sanjay. Tarun has been murdered just seconds before by his own brother (Prem Chopra). Sanjay learns that Tarun is a criminal and his brother wants to usurp his money. Now, it is up to Sanjay and his guardian to turn the tides and make up the loss.
