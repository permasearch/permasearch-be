When Ashram decides to leave Lodoss for good and seek a new land where they can find peace, Pirotess goes with him. She has strong affections for Ashram and is very loyal to him. The two may be in love (as it is certainly hinted upon). She sacrificed herself to save Ashram in the OVA against the powerful dragon Shooting Star, and Ashram was visibly distressed, embracing her intimately. When they reach Crystania, Pirotess is forced to seek out a solution after Ashram is placed into stasis by one of the god beasts of Crystania.
