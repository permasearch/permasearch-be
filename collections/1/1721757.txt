In Hasidic philosophy parallels are drawn between the redemption from exile and the personal redemption achieved when a person refines his character traits, although there is no source for this in the Talmud. Rather the Messianic redemption is linked to observing Shabbat,[31] Jewish prayer,[32] and the promise of redemption for those looking toward Mount Zion,[33] the last being the original cultural source of 'Zionism'. As such, the original intent of Zionism was the redemption process by which the Land of Israel that has been pledged to the Israelites[34] is reclaimed, accomplished through a payment of the debt owed to God[33] as a fulfillment of the conditions set out in the Torah.
