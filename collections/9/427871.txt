In 1492 Christopher Columbus's after-discovery for Spain of the New World, which he believed to be Asia, led to disputes between the Spanish and Portuguese.[27] These were eventually settled by the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494, which divided the world outside of Europe in an exclusive duopoly between the Portuguese and the Spanish along a north-south meridian 370 leagues, or 970 miles (1,560Â km), west of the Cape Verde islands.[28] However, as it was not possible at the time to correctly measure longitude, the exact boundary was disputed by the two countries until 1777.[29]
