The median preoptic nucleus and the subfornical organ receive signals of decreased volume [clarification needed] and increased osmolite concentration. Finally, the signals are received in cortex areas of the forebrain[4] where ultimately the conscious craving arises. The subfornical organ and the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis contribute to regulating the overall bodily fluid balance by signalling to the hypothalamus to form vasopressin, which is later released by the pituitary gland.[additional citation needed]
