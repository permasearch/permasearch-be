In 2012, during the halftime show for Super Bowl XLVI, rapper M.I.A. pointed up her middle finger during her performance. That incident drew comparisons with the exposure of Janet Jackson's breast in the Super Bowl halftime show eight years prior. The Associated Press asserted that people learned what M.I.A. did only when reports surfaced in the media and quoted TV critic James Poniewozik: "I had no idea she even did it until NBC issued an apology for it."[147] NBC blurred the entire screen albeit a second too late to obscure M.I.A. giving the finger.[148] The NFL ultimately sued M.I.A. for US$1.5 million on breach of contract grounds.[8] The lawsuit was settled in August 2014 and the terms of the settlement remained private.[149] As an indication of the reduced level of complaints, only 222 complaints were filed over the incident.[150]
