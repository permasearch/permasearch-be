Clumsy Pete: Clumsy Pete appeared once, in the episode 'The Jungle Games.' During spear throwing, he failed miserably, causing Xixi to state that King Joey should have put in Efficient Charlie. During harpoon shooting, Clover and Crimson get in a fight, causing them to get eliminated and give the round to Clumsy Pete and the rats by default. But while Clumsy Pete mumbled about which button it is to shoot, he hit his own leg. He was out for the Jungle Games and was never seen or mentioned again.
