The events that led to the collapse of the First Coalition were exhaustively chronicled by almost all of the major participants,[286] (although Asquith himself was a notable exception), and have been minutely studied by historians in the 100 years since.[287] Although many of the accounts and studies differ in detail, and present a somewhat confusing picture overall, the outline is clear. As R. J. Q. Adams wrote; "The Prime Minister depended upon [a] majority [in] Parliament. The faith of that majority in Asquith's leadership had been shaken and the appearance of a logical alternative destroyed him."[288][289][290]
