In the 1962–63 NBA season, Gottlieb sold the Warriors franchise for $850,000 (equal to about $6.88 million today)[note 1] to a group of businessmen led by Marty Simmons from San Francisco, and the team relocated to become the San Francisco Warriors under a new coach, Bob Feerick.[51] This also meant, however, that the team broke apart, as Paul Arizin chose to retire rather than move away from his family and his job at IBM in Philadelphia, and Tom Gola was homesick, requesting a trade to the lowly New York Knicks halfway through the season.[52] With both secondary scorers gone, Chamberlain continued his array of statistical feats, averaging 44.8 points and 24.3 rebounds per game that year.[43] Despite his individual success, the Warriors lost 49 of their 80 games and missed the playoffs.[53]
