Under Fred Jelinek's lead, IBM created a voice activated typewriter called Tangora, which could handle a 20,000 word vocabulary by the mid 1980s.[19] Jelinek's statistical approach put less emphasis on emulating the way the human brain processes and understands speech in favor of using statistical modeling techniques like HMMs. (Jelinek's group independently discovered the application of HMMs to speech.[18]) This was controversial with linguists since HMMs are too simplistic to account for many common features of human languages.[20] However, the HMM proved to be a highly useful way for modeling speech and replaced dynamic time warping to become the dominant speech recognition algorithm in the 1980s.[21] IBM had a few competitors including Dragon Systems founded by James and Janet M. Baker in 1982.[22] The 1980s also saw the introduction of the n-gram language model. Katz introduced the back-off model in 1987, which allowed language models to use multiple length n-grams. During the same time, also CSELT was using HMM (the diphonies were studied since 1980) to recognize language like Italian.[23][24][25] At the same time, CSELT led a series of European projects (Esprit I, II), and summarized the state-of-the-art in a book, later (2013) reprinted.[26]
