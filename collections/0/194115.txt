In addition to its large-scale grid-connected solar PV initiative, India is developing off-grid solar power for local energy needs.[18] Solar products have increasingly helped to meet rural needs; by the end of 2015 just under one million solar lanterns were sold in the country, reducing the need for kerosene.[19] That year, 118,700 solar home lighting systems were installed and 46,655 solar street lighting installations were provided under a national program;[19] just over 1.4 million solar cookers were distributed in India.[19]
