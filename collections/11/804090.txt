Prior to World War I, the Kingdom of Hungary had four car manufacturer companies. These were: the Ganz company[66][67] in Budapest, RÁBA Automobile[68] in Győr, MÁG (later Magomobil)[69][70] in Budapest, and MARTA (Hungarian Automobile Joint-stock Company Arad)[71] in Arad. Hungarian car production started in 1900. Automotive factories in the Kingdom of Hungary manufactured motorcycles, cars, taxicabs, trucks and buses.[citation needed]
