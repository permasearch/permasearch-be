In 1985, Peter Mandelson was appointed as the Labour Party's director of communication. Previously, he had worked in television broadcasting and helped the party become increasingly effective at communication and more concerned with its media image, especially with non-partisans.[60] Mandelson headed the Campaigns and Communications Directorate (established in 1985) and initiated the Shadow Communications Agency. He oversaw Labour's relationship with the media and believed in the importance of the agenda-setting role of the press. He felt that the agenda of the press (broadsheets in particular) would influence important political broadcasters.[61] In government, Mandelson was appointed minister without portfolio to co-ordinate the various government departments.[62] In 1998, accused of financial impropriety, he resigned as a cabinet minister.[63]
