PETA has used some unorthodox methods to make its point. Moments after being crowned, Miss Rodeo America 2000 had a chocolate tofu 'cow pie' pushed in her face by a PETA member. PETA President, Ingrid Newkirk, said in a statement that Miss Rodeo America should relinquish her crown for promoting cruelty to animals. "Now that she's got pie on her face, we hope Miss Rodeo America will find a little compassion in her heart," Newkirk said. The pageant is held in conjunction with the National Finals Rodeo, an event PETA annually protests against, claiming the sport exploits animals.[24]
