A hypothetically perfect antipode flight would be Tangier Ibn Battouta Airport, Morocco (IATA: TNG) to Whangarei Aerodrome, New Zealand (IATA: WRE), whose designated locators are 10,800 nautical miles (20,001 km) apart,[16] the maximum possible distance, but their actual runways cross in projection. However, with only a length of 3599 ft, Whangarei's runway is too short to accommodate any current (as of 2015[update]) commercial jet airliner, especially one with the required range. Traveling between them would presently need at least three plane changes, e.g. Paris–Los Angeles–Auckland. Taipei and Asuncion are 19,912 km apart; Santiago and Xian are 19,897 km apart; Madrid and Auckland are 19,590 km apart; Buenos Aires and Beijing are 19,260 km apart; Johannesburg and Honolulu are 19,188 km apart; New York City and Perth are 18,700 km apart.[citation needed]
