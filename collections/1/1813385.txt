Terminal A opened in 1998 with 275,000 sq ft (25,500 m2) of floor space and twelve gates, able to accommodate an expansion to 22 gates.[6] The food court in Terminal A was remodeled in 2014–15 in an effort to bring a similar customer experience with unique-to-Sacramento restaurants as provided in Terminal B.[28][29] Future expansion at Terminal A may include conversion to an airside concourse and the addition of a second automated people mover.[24]
