In addition, the DDR also supported the Palestine Liberation Organization among the rest of the Arab states fighting against Israel. In 1974, the DDR government recognized the PLO as the "sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people".[65] The PLO declared the Palestinian state on 15 November 1988 during the First Intifada and the DDR recognized the state prior to reunification (The FRG continues to have relations with the PLO).[66][citation needed]
