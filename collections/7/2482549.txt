Robert Buan held the position of Athletics' broadcasting manager from 1995 to ~ 2006. He also hosted the "Extra Innings" postgame radio talk show, which fans called to talk about the A's with Buan or a guest. The show often emanated from the stadium or in a studio, and certain select ones were broadcast from local bars or restaurants before a live audience. He also did Internet-only play-by-play of spring training games. He was succeeded by Chris Townsend and Rick Tittle.
