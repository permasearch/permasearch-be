For the 1982 album Chicago 16, the band worked with composers from outside the group for the first time, and Foster brought in studio musicians for some tracks (including the core members of Toto),[59] and used new technology (such as synthesizers) to "update" and streamline the sound, further pushing back the horn section, and in some cases not even using them at all. The band did return to the charts with the Cetera-sung ballad "Hard to Say I'm Sorry/Get Away", which is featured in the soundtrack of the Daryl Hannah film Summer Lovers.[60] Co-written by Cetera and David Foster, "Hard to Say I'm Sorry" was the group's second single to reach No. 1 on the Hot 100 chart[12] and brought them a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.[21] Chicago 16 reached both gold and platinum status during the year of its release,[37] and went to number nine on the Billboard 200 album chart.[11]
