In 2005, Shona Seifert and Thomas Early, two former directors of Ogilvy & Mather, were convicted of one count of conspiring to defraud the government and nine counts of filing false claims for Ogilvy over-billing advertising work done for the United States Office of National Drug Control Policy account. The agency was hired by the ONDCP in 1998 to create anti-drug ads aimed at adolescents.[50] At the time, it was the largest social marketing contract in history.[51] Ogilvy & Mather repaid $1.8 million to the government to settle a civil suit based on the same billing issues.[52][53][54]
