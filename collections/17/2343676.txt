Coach Charlie Bachman led the Gators to national recognition, taking over as head coach in 1928. Bachman, who coached Tom Sebring at Kansas State, attended Notre Dame from 1914 to 1916; an All-American guard for the Fighting Irish football team in 1916, he was a disciple of Knute Rockne.[note 17] Bachman's 1928 and 1929 Gator squads finished 8–1 and 8–2, respectively, the Gators' highest season-win totals for thirty-two years.[83] Both seasons included the first defeats of the Georgia Bulldogs.
