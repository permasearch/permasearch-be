The International Alliance for the Control of Scabies was started in 2012,[44][52][53] and brings together over 70 researchers, clinicians, and public-health experts from more than 15 different countries. It has managed to bring the global health implications of scabies to the attention of the World Health Organization.[44] Consequently, the WHO has included scabies on its official list of neglected tropical diseases and other neglected conditions.[54]
