Pro-BUS Congressman John C. Calhoun argued forcefully that the federal government had a constitutional obligation to regulate bank credit as part of the national money supply.[39] In January 1816, he introduced a bill of incorporation in the House of Representatives for a government bank.[40] The measure was passed by Congress and signed by President James Madison in April 1816.[41][42]
