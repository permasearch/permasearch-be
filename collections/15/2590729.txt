The protein produced by the Menkes gene is responsible for transporting copper across the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) mucosa and the bloodâ€“brain barrier.[8][98] Mutational defects in the gene encoding the copper ATPase cause copper to remain trapped in the lining of the small intestine. Hence, copper cannot be pumped out of the intestinal cells and into the blood for transport to the liver and consequently to rest of the body.[98][99] The disease therefore resembles a severe nutritional copper deficiency despite adequate ingestion of copper.
