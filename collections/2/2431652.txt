Lauryn Hill and Pras first met at Columbia High School, in South Orange, New Jersey. Pras, Lauryn, and a mutual friend named Marcy formed a musical trio called Tyme; Pras' cousin, Wyclef Jean, joined the trio and Marcy left soon after in 1990.[2] The moniker Tranzlator Crew refers to the name of their band at the time, which included Johnny Wise on drums, T Boss (Jerry) on bass guitar, and Leon (DJ).[3] In 1993, after some gigs and recorded demos, the trio signed to Ruffhouse, distributed through Columbia Records.[4] The trio's name was later changed to Fugees, which was purposely taken from a word often used derogatorily to refer to Haitian-Americans (refugee).[5] Refugee Camp, while a name sometimes credited to the trio, also refers to a number of artists affiliated with them, and particularly Jean.
