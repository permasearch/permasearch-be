Public expenditure is spending made by the government of a country on collective needs and wants such as pension, provision, infrastructure, etc.[1] Until the 19th century, public expenditure was limited as laissez faire philosophies believed that money left in private hands could bring better returns. In the 20th century, John Maynard Keynes argued the role of public expenditure in determining levels of income and distribution in the economy. Since then government expenditures has shown an increasing trend.
