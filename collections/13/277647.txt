The game then snaps back to the initial jump off, taking place hours before the Normandy Landings. Baker, along with the rest of the squad is preparing to disembark from the C-47, when the plane is hit by anti-aircraft fire. Baker is thrown from the plane, although losing his kit in the drop he manages to land safely. Managing to find Mac, the pair search for the others, eventually finding Leggett and superior Lt. Col. Cole. Despite being way off course, the group led by Mac destroy several Flak 38 anti-aircraft guns using satchel explosives. By morning, more of the squad has managed to find one another, including BAR gunner Corporal Joseph 'Red' Hartsock, who Mac delegates to Baker to clear an important road leading to Utah Beach. After fighting their way through several German soldiers, as well as a mortar team, Baker and Hartsock link up with Allen and Garnett, two other members of their squad. Using a Browning .30 caliber machine gun, the four troops defend against a counterattack from the beach and succeed in securing Exit 4, a way off Utah beach, for the 4th Infantry Division.
