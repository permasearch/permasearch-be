The album was one of the first recorded on 48 tracks, using two synchronised 24 track Studer A80s at Advision Studios in London. It was engineered by Geoff Young, who brought the recordings together with only a 16 track desk. He later worked with George Michael to record "Last Christmas" and "Careless Whisper" using the same studio and equipment.
