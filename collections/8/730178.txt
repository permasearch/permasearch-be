Although unbeaten and No.Â 2 Notre Dame posted its 25th consecutive victory of the Naval Academy, coach Lou Holtz was not happy.[17]  "We couldn't control the line of scrimmage," Holtz said after the victory.[17] "We couldn't throw consistently, we weren't mentally alert and that's my fault. Our offensive line got beat up, we couldn't run inside. We weren't good enough to beat them inside. We're not a very good team right now. We feel fortunate to win."[17] Favored to beat Navy by five touchdowns, the Irish dropped five passes, lost two fumbles, shanked a punt for a mere 10 yds., and got whistled for having twelve men on the field - all before winning the game 22-7.[18]  The Midshipmen fumbled on their second play from scrimmage and six plays later Notre Dame led 7-0 on a 10-yard touchdown pass from Rice to Derek Brown, before a crowd of 54,926 at Memorial Stadium.[19]  Rodney Culver and Ryan Mihalko ran for touchdowns as Notre Dame opened up a 22-0 lead early in the third quarter en route to reaching an 8-0 record for the first time since 1973.[17]  One positive Lou Holtz saw was the play of the defense.[17]  "Our defense played really well, but was on the field too long."[17]  Notre Dame amassed 396 total yards and held Navy to 192 yards, the lowest for an Irish opponent this year.[17]
