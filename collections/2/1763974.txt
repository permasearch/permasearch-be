Mexico was one of the first Latin American countries to promote railway development,[117] and the network covers 30,952 km (19,233 mi).[227] The Secretary of Communications and Transport of Mexico proposed a high-speed rail link that will transport its passengers from Mexico City to Guadalajara, Jalisco.[228][229] The train, which will travel at 300 kilometres per hour (190 miles per hour),[230] will allow passengers to travel from Mexico City to Guadalajara in just 2 hours.[230] The whole project was projected to cost 240 billion pesos, or about 25 billion US$[228] and is being paid for jointly by the Mexican government and the local private sector including the wealthiest man in the world, Mexico's billionaire business tycoon Carlos Slim.[231] The government of the state of Yucatán is also funding the construction of a high speed line connecting the cities of Cozumel to Mérida and Chichen Itza and Cancún.[232]
