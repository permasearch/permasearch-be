However, when summoned to talk to a former fellow prisoner, Saga learns that Susanne Winter was not acting alone. In the meantime, Henrik is trying to rebuild his relationship with Astrid. Brian unexpectedly comes to visit them one evening to celebrate. When Henrik turns around, Brian stands up from his wheelchair and attacks him. He ties up Henrik and Astrid, and asks Henrik to watch as he shoots Astrid. Henrik refuses, so Brian shoots her in the leg and says he will continue to maim her until Henrik opens his eyes. A gunshot is heard and Henrik sees that Brian has been shot dead by Saga.
