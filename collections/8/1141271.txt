Government guidelines published by the Department for Communities and Local Government (as it then were) suggest that an energy performance certificate is not required to be given where the tenancy is for an individual room as the tenancy would not be for a building or a building unit designed or altered for separate use.[21] It is unclear if lack of an energy performance certificate in such a tenancy would invalidate a section 21 notice.[14]
