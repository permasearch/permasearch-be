Lexus introduced a new design language known as "L-finesse" in the mid-2000s with its LF series concepts and the 2006 Lexus GS.[196][197] L-finesse is represented by three Japanese kanji characters which translate as "Intriguing Elegance, Incisive Simplicity, and Seamless Anticipation".[197] Design characteristics, including a fastback profile, lower-set grille,[198] and the use of both convex and concave surfaces,[198] are derived from Japanese cultural motifs (e.g. the phrase kirikaeshi in arrowhead shapes).[199] While earlier Lexus models were criticized for reserved and derivative styling, and often mistaken for understated domestic market cars,[198] automotive design analyses described L-finesse as adding a distinctive nature and embrace of Japanese design identity.[196][197] Opinions varied for L-finesse's debut on the GS; Sports Car International's analysis praised the vehicle's in-person appearance;[200] Automobile Magazine criticized the daring of its forward styling,[201] and compared subsequent rival models for design similarities.[202] In 2012, the arrival of the redesigned fourth generation Lexus GS featured the introduction of a spindle-shaped grille design, intended to be used on all forthcoming Lexus models.[137] L-finesse exhibitions were presented at Milan's Salone del Mobile from 2005 through 2009.[203]
