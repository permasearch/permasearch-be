τ   {\displaystyle \tau }  , called the dispersion parameter, typically is known and is usually related to the variance of the distribution. The functions     h (  y  , τ )   {\displaystyle h(\mathbf {y} ,\tau )}  ,      b  (  θ  )   {\displaystyle \mathbf {b} ({\boldsymbol {\theta }})}  ,      T  ( y )   {\displaystyle \mathbf {T} (y)}  ,     A (  θ  )   {\displaystyle A({\boldsymbol {\theta }})}  , and     d ( τ )   {\displaystyle d(\tau )}   are known. Many common distributions are in this family, including the normal, exponential, gamma, Poisson, Bernoulli, and (for fixed number of trials) binomial, multinomial, and negative binomial.
