Finally, Vyom reveals all the crimes he did (he killed Shiv's father in order to protect his parents, he killed Sharanya's father and Sadhvi, as they both found out Shiv is her lover, not Vyom, also he killed Shranaya's doctor and many others). Vyom accepts that he stabbed Shiv and killed him and accepts all the murders he have done in madness of her love. Sharanya says that he will never get her love and leaves him saying he is a big fraud but stops on Shiv's mother's choking voice. Vyom says that he have murdered many and killing her is no big deal for him. Sharanya stops and says that she will listen to what he says and asks him to leave Shiv's mothers neck.
