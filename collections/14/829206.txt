Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea played on "Idiots Rule". "I knew that Flea loved the trumpet and didn't get to play it too often," recalled Farrell. "So I invited him down one of the Nothing's Shocking sessions. He didn't yet have those tough lips that trumpet players need. I'd go, 'Are you ready?' and this poor kid would go [makes mournful parping noise]. That's when I realised he needed a rest."[11]
