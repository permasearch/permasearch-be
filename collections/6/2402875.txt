This is a process of disbondment of protective coatings from the protected structure (cathode) due to the formation of hydrogen ions over the surface of the protected material (cathode).[43] Disbonding can be exacerbated by an increase in alkali ions and an increase in cathodic polarization.[44] The degree of disbonding is also reliant on the type of coating, with some coatings affected more than others.[45] Cathodic protection systems should be operated so that the structure does not become excessively polarized,[46] since this also promotes disbonding due to excessively negative potentials. Cathodic disbonding occurs rapidly in pipelines that contain hot fluids because the process is accelerated by heat flow.[citation needed]
