It has some properties that are unusual for a metal; taken together,[427] these are sometimes used as a basis to classify aluminium as a metalloid.[428] Its crystalline structure shows some evidence of directional bonding.[429] Aluminium bonds covalently in most compounds.[430] The oxide Al2O3 is amphoteric,[431] and a conditional glass-former.[277] Aluminium can form anionic aluminates,[427] such behaviour being considered nonmetallic in character.[68]
