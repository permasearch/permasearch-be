Philippine law does not provide for divorce inside the country, and it remains the only UN-member state without legal provision for divorce. The only exception is with respect to Muslims, who are allowed to divorce in certain circumstances according to their religion. For majority non-Muslims, the law only allows for annulment of marriages.
