The government is not permitted to appeal or try again after the entry of an acquittal, whether a directed verdict before the case is submitted to the jury,[90] a directed verdict after a deadlocked jury,[91] an appellate reversal for sufficiency (except by direct appeal to a higher appellate court),[92] or an "implied acquittal" via conviction of a lesser included offense.[93] In addition, the government is barred by collateral estoppel from re-litigating against the same defense a fact necessarily found by the jury in a prior acquittal,[94] even if the jury hung on other counts.[95]
