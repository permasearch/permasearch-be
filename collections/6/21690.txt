The four finalists dance for the coveted mirror ball trophy. Each couple will dance a judges' choice of a previous performance in hopes to improve their original scores, a samba relay, and a super sized freestyle. At the end of the night one couple will be eliminated. On the second night, the top three couples will perform a fusion dance (two dances fused together with the same song) chosen by the other competitors the night before, only having 24 hours of preparation.
