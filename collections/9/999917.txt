Swift performed "Love Story" on all venues of her first headlining concert tour, the Fearless Tour, which extended from April 2009 to June 2010. The performances begun with backup dancers, dressed in Victorian era clothing, dancing ballroom to Baroque composer Johann Pachelbel's "Pachelbel's Canon", as a castle backdrop was projected onto the stage.[96] Swift emerged to upper level of the stage, from below, donning a crimson, 18th century gown with a golden accents.[97] For the song's last refrain, Swift hid behind backup dancers as she changed her wardrobe to a white wedding dress.[98] Jon Pareles of The New York Times said Swift offered the audience with optimistic thinking with the performance in the August 27, 2009 concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City.[98] Reviewing the May 22, 2010 concert at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto, Canada, Jane Stevenson of The Toronto Sun stated the moment was far too girly for her liking.[99] "Love Story" served as the final performance on the setlist of Swift's second concert tour, the Speak Now World Tour (2011); the performances featured Swift roaming throughout the stage, wearing a white sundress.[100] On January 25, 2013, Swift did an acoustic version of the song, followed by "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" at the Los Premios 40 Principales in Spain.[101] In 2014, Swift performed a new rendition of 'Love Story', having a much more arena rock sound during the 2014 iHeartRadio Music Festival and in 2015, at the BBC Radio 1 Big Weekend in Norwich. This version was used once again during her fourth headlining tour, The 1989 World Tour.
