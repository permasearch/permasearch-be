Tide has also sponsored a few things like NASCAR stock cars, notably as the "Tide Ride". Darrell Waltrip drove the #17 Tide-sponsored Chevy for Hendrick Motorsports. The relationship lasted from 1987 to 1990 and won the 1989 Daytona 500 along the way. Waltrip left the team to form his own team. Tide then sponsored Ricky Rudd in the #5 car after Levi Garrett left Hendrick. Rudd drove for Hendrick until 1993, when he left the racing team, also to form his own team and taking the Tide sponsorship. Rudd Performance Motorsports ran from 1994â€“1999 and won the 4th Brickyard 400 in 1997. After Rudd became winless in his first time in 17 seasons, Tide left Rudd after being lured by Calvin Well's new team PPI Motorsports. The new team's number was 32, which was a combination of 17, 5, and 10 added all up. Scott Pruett was the first driver but after DNQing 6 times and no Top 10's. Ricky Craven took over in 2001 and responded with a win at Martinsville Speedway. He went winless in 2002, but one year later, he won the closest race in NASCAR history at Darlington in the Carolina Dodge Dealers 400, rubbing with Kurt Busch for laps and with a margin-of-victory of 0.002. It is tied for the closest finish in Cup Series history. After no Top 10's halfway through the 2004 season, Craven left PPI and was replaced by Bobby Hamilton, Jr. for 2004 and 2005. Travis Kvapil ran for PPI in 2006 but with four DNQ's.[19] Tide left the sport before it was going to sponsor one of Well's proposed Toyota teams in 2007. Tide was on Kevin Harvick's truck a few times, but Kroger was promoting the car with it. Tide made its Cup series return in September 2016, when it sponsored Matt Kenseth's No. 20 car for a Darlington tribute scheme.[20] Tide extended their sponsorship to Joe Gibbs Racing to three races in 2017.[21]
