The chariot arena was modeled on a historic circus in Jerusalem.[98] Covering 18 acres (7.3 ha), it was the largest film set ever built at that time.[123] Constructed at a cost of $1 million, it took a thousand workmen more than a year to carve the oval out of a rock quarry.[97][98] The racetrack featured 1,500-foot (460 m) long straights and five-story-high grandstands.[98] Over 250 miles (400 km) of metal tubing were used to erect the grandstands.[49] Matte paintings created the illusion of upper stories of the grandstands and the background mountains.[124] More than 40,000 short tons (36,000 t) of sand were brought in from beaches on the Mediterranean to cover the track.[125] Other elements of the circus were also historically accurate. Imperial Roman racecourses featured a raised 10-foot (3.0 m) high spina (the center section), metae (columnar goalposts at each end of the spina), dolphin-shaped lap counters, and carceres (the columned building in the rear which housed the cells where horses waited prior to the race).[124][126] The four statues atop the spina were 30 feet (9.1 m) high.[46] A chariot track identical in size was constructed next to the set and used to train the horses and lay out camera shots.[126]
