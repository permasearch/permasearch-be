In 2005, the U.S. Congress adopted the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act which criminally penalised the wilful reproduction of works for commercial distribution.[26] More specifically, it prohibited the recording of copyrighted audiovisual works like movies without the prior permission of the copyright owner from the public performance of such works in a theatre or other similar facility.[27] This Act distinguishes between first-time offenders and repeat offenders and the criminal sanctions include a fine and/or imprisonment.[27]
