Around 1850, the French composer Hervé was experimenting with a form of comic musical theatre he called opérette.[32] The best known composers of operetta were Jacques Offenbach from the 1850s to the 1870s and Johann Strauss II in the 1870s and 1880s.[18] Offenbach's fertile melodies, combined with his librettists' witty satire, formed a model for the musical theatre that followed.[33] Adaptations of the French operettas (played in mostly bad, risqué translations), musical burlesques, music hall, pantomime and burletta dominated the London musical stage into the 1870s.[34]
