In a first-for-Springsteen effort to gain dance and club play for his music, Arthur Baker[4] created the 12-inch "Blaster Mix" of "Dancing in the Dark", wherein he reworked the album version. The remix was released on July 2, 1984. The result generated a lot of media buzz for Springsteen, as well as actual club play; the remix went to #7 on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart,[5] and had the most sales of any 12-inch single in the United States in 1984.[4]
