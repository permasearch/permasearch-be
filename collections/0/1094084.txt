Development for the game began in 2009. It runs an enhanced version of the IW 3.0 engine used in Treyarch's past title, World at War. The improvements made allowed for bigger campaign levels to be made as well as enhanced lighting. Treyarch focused specifically on Black Ops during development. Different teams within the company focused on a certain game mode. Music was composed by Sean Murray, with music by the Rolling Stones and Creedence Clearwater Revival appearing in the campaign. Marketing of the game began in April 2010. Multiple trailers promoting the game and its modes were released from May until October.
