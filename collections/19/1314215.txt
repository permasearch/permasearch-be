Following a social identity approach, Reysen and Katzarska-Miller tested a model showing the antecedents and outcomes of global citizenship identification (i.e., degree of psychological connection with global citizens).[16] Individuals’ normative environment (the cultural environment in which one is embedded contains people, artifacts, cultural patterns that promote viewing the self as a global citizen) and global awareness (perceiving oneself as aware, knowledgeable, and connected to others in the world) predict global citizenship identification. Global citizenship identification then predicts six broad categories of prosocial behaviors and values, including: intergroup empathy, valuing diversity, social justice, environmental sustainability, intergroup helping, and a felt responsibility to act.[18] Subsequent research has examined variables that influence the model such as: participation in a college course with global components,[19] perception of one’s global knowledge,[20] college professors' attitudes toward global citizenship,[21] belief in an intentional worlds view of culture,[22] participation in a fan group that promotes the identity,[23] use of global citizen related words when describing one's values,[24] possible self as a global citizen,[25] religiosity and religious orientation,[26] threat to one’s nation,[27] interdependent self-construal prime,[28] perception of the university environment,[29] and social media usage.[30]
