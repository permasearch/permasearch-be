When the field is patterned with a series of diagonal stripes (bendlets), running from top-left to bottom-right, the field is described as bendy. In the opposite fashion (top-right to bottom-left) it is bendy sinister; (of skarpes, the diminutive in England of the bend sinister) of chevronels, chevronny.  (An unusual example of bendy in which a metal alternates with two colours is in the arms of Dr. Murray Lee Eiland Jr.[3])
