Originally three houses, Number 10 was offered to Sir Robert Walpole by King George II in 1732.  Walpole accepted on the condition that the gift was to the office of First Lord of the Treasury rather than to him personally. Walpole commissioned William Kent to join the three houses and it is this larger house that is known as Number 10 Downing Street.
