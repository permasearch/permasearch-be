In modern American English, the term is now commonly used to mean a dimwitted or a stupid person, a usage first recorded in 1932 and popularized by the cartoon character Bugs Bunny, who sarcastically refers to the hunter Elmer Fudd as "nimrod",[36][37] as an ironic connection between "mighty hunter" and "poor little Nimrod", i.e. Fudd.[38]
