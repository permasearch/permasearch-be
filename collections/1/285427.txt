Ultrasound is sound waves with frequencies higher than the upper audible limit of human hearing. Ultrasound is not different from "normal" (audible) sound in its physical properties, except in that humans cannot hear it. Ultrasound devices operate with frequencies from 20Â kHz up to several gigahertz.
