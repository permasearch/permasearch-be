The color yellow is used throughout the novel to signify suffering and mental illness.[original research?] Examples include Sonya's yellow ticket, a license to practice prostitution, the walls of Raskolnikov's garret, and the walls of the old pawnbroker, among numerous other examples. Of note, the Russian term for lunatic asylum, "zholti dom", is literally translated as "yellow house". Yellow is also mentioned as the color of Luzchin's ring.
