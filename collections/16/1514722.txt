One decade later (in Episode 55 "Buried Secrets"), she was discovered by the Turtles, Casey Jones, and her teenage daughter. She explained how her whole family's difficulties with the Kraang raged on for many years, and seemed happy to be reunited with her daughter. She wondered of Kirby's whereabouts, to which the Turtles assured her that he was "on a safari in Puerto Rico." She attracted the suspicions of the sharp and intuitive Michelangelo, who planned to expose her true motives by any means. She was later revealed to be a clone of the real Mrs. O'Neil as an infiltration experiment infused with the human DNA of the real Mrs. O'Neil and Kraang DNA; thus having only her memories. April expressed her sadness at losing her family all over again, even if it truly was not her mother, and wondered if she was indeed gone forever or was still alive somewhere.
