Several accidents and injuries have occurred on the monorails since Walt Disney World opened, with one death. On July 5, 2009, a driver was pronounced dead in transit from the site after two monorails (Pink and Purple), collided near the Ticket and Transportation Center, on the EPCOT line.  It was the first, and only, fatal accident in the monorail's history.[25]
