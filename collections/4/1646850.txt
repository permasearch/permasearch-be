The electron transport chain is responsible for establishing a pH and electrochemical gradient that facilitates the production of ATP through the pumping of protons. The gradient also provides control of the concentration of ions such as Ca2+ driven by the mitochondrial membrane potential.[1] The membrane only allows nonpolar molecules such as CO2 and O2 and small non charged polar molecules such as H2O to enter the matrix. Molecules enter and exit the mitochondrial matrix through transport proteins and ion transporters. Molecules are then able to leave the mitochondria through porin.[8] These attributed characteristics allow for control over concentrations of ions and metabolites necessary for regulation and determines the rate of ATP production.[9][10]
