Having defined     k   {\displaystyle k}  , the trial number, and     t   {\displaystyle t}  , the time elapsed after the     k   {\displaystyle k}  th event, each recorded trial can be written as     x ( t , k ) = s ( t ) + n ( t , k )   {\displaystyle x(t,k)=s(t)+n(t,k)}   where     s ( t )   {\displaystyle s(t)}   is the signal and     n ( t , k )   {\displaystyle n(t,k)}   is the noise (Note that, under the assumptions above, the signal does not depend on the specific trial while the noise does).
