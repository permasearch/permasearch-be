Like admission to the Academy, admission to the Prep School is competitive, with selections made by the Academy director of admissions. If a civilian or Airman, either Active Duty or Reserve, applies for but does not receive a direct appointment to the Air Force Academy, they will automatically be considered for the Prep School. Air Force enlisted personnel may apply directly to the Prep School via Air Force Form 1786, submitted through the unit commander and MPF. AFI 36-2021 should be consulted for details. Enlisted members from the Army, Navy and Marine Corps are not eligible for nomination but can be considered as civilians.[2]
