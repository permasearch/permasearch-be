Iron Weasel decide to record a charity single for Tripp's grandmother's retirement home. But when the band purposely spends the money from the song on a sky-diving trip, they must perform community service to pay off their debt to the home or else they would go to jail. They help them put on a show in which they perform "I Wanna Punch Stuff", but end up trashing the place.
