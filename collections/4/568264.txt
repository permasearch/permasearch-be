Estimates for the contribution of land-based plastic vary widely. While one study estimated that a little over 10% of plastic debris in ocean water comes from land-based sources, responsible for 0.8 million tonnes (790,000 long tons; 880,000 short tons) every year.[3] In 2015, Jambeck et al. calculated that 275 million tonnes (271,000,000 long tons; 303,000,000 short tons) of plastic waste was generated in 192 coastal countries in 2010, with 4.8 to 12.7 million tonnes (12,500,000 long tons; 14,000,000 short tons) entering the ocean - a percentage of only up to 5%.[29]
