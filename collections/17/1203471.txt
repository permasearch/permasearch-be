Just a little over a week prior to The Open Championship McIlroy injured his left anterior talofibular ligament (ankle ligament). This led to him missing the tournament and the subsequent WGC-Bridgestone Invitational.[110] He made his return in the 2015 PGA Championship and made the cut finishing in 17th place.[111]
