Local or city ordinances are sometimes drafted to include specific classes of people not covered by the state criminal codes, such as individuals carrying folding knives with locking blades primarily for use as weapons.[79] For example, a San Antonio, Texas city ordinance makes it unlawful for anyone to knowingly carry within city limits "on or about his person" any folding knife with a blade less than 5.5 inches long with a lock mechanism that locks the blade upon opening.[79] This ordinance is designed to work in tandem with the Texas state statute[110] making illegal the carrying of knives with blades longer than 5.5 inches.[111] The San Antonio ordinance allows police to charge persons carrying most types of lock blade knives without good cause with a criminal misdemeanor violation, allowing police to remove the knife from the possession of the offender, while providing exemptions from the ordinance designed to protect certain classes of people the city assumes to pose no threat to public order.[112] Occasionally, city and county ordinances conflict with state law. In one example, the city of Portland, Oregon initially passed a city ordinance banning all pocket knives,[citation needed] until the measure was overturned by the Oregon Supreme Court as conflicting with state criminal statutes.
