A sinus rhythm is any cardiac rhythm where depolarization of the cardiac muscle begins at the sinus node.[1] It is characterised by the presence of correctly oriented P waves on the  electrocardiogram (ECG).[2] Sinus rhythm is necessary, but not sufficient, for normal electrical activity within the heart.[2]
