The wealth of greenspace afforded by Chicago's parks is further augmented by the Cook County Forest Preserves, a network of open spaces containing forest, prairie, wetland, streams, and lakes that are set aside as natural areas which lie along the city's outskirts,[240] including both the Chicago Botanic Garden in Glencoe and the Brookfield Zoo in Brookfield.[241] Washington Park is also one of the city's biggest parks; covering nearly 400 acres (160Â ha). The park is listed on the National Register of Historic Places listings in South Side Chicago.
