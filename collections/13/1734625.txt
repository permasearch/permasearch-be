In more recent times, the term was brought up again by Republicans in the 2008 U.S. presidential election.[28] In July 2007, one month after the release of Michael Moore's film Sicko, Rudy Giuliani, the front-runner for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination, attacked the health care plans of Democratic presidential candidates as socialized medicine that was European and socialist,[29][30][citation needed] Giuliani claimed that he had a better chance of surviving prostate cancer in the US than he would have had in England[31] and went on to repeat the claim in campaign speeches for three months[32][33][34][35][36][37] before making them in a radio advertisement.[38] After the radio ad began running, the use of the statistic was widely criticized by FactCheck.org,[39] PolitiFact.com,[40] by The Washington Post,[41] and others who consulted leading cancer experts and found that Giuliani's cancer survival statistics to be false, misleading or "flat wrong," the numbers having been reported to have been obtained from an opinion article by Giuliani health care advisor David Gratzer, a Canadian psychiatrist in the Manhattan Institute's City Journal where Gratzer was a senior fellow.[42] The Times reported that the British Health Secretary pleaded with Giuliani to stop using the NHS as a political football in American presidential politics. The article reported that not only the figures were five years out of date and wrong but also that US health experts disputed both the accuracy of Giuliani's figures and questioned whether it was fair to make a direct comparison.[43] The St. Petersburg Times said that Giuliani's tactic of "injecting a little fear" exploited cancer, which was "apparently not beneath a survivor with presidential aspirations."[44] Giuliani's repetition of the error even after it had been pointed out to him earned him more criticism and was awarded four "Pinnochios" by the Washington Post for recidivism.[45][46]
