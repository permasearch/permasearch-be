The northern flank of the Fourth Army was held by VIII Corps (Lieutenant-General Aylmer Hunter-Weston). Three divisions were to attack on the first day, with the 48th (South Midland) Division in reserve, except for two battalions that held a 1.6 mi (2.6 km) stretch between the Third and Fourth armies and two battalions that were attached to the 4th Division.[85]
