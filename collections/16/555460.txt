The Spartan 310 is marketed and distributed by Remington Arms, in Madison, North Carolina.[1] It is a variant of a classical Russian shotgun IZh-27 manufactured by Izhevsk Mechanical Plant for export under trademak "Baikal", in Izhevsk, Russia.[2] The Spartan 310 is inexpensive compared to other double barreled shotguns.[3] It is most often used for hunting birds, and for clay target games such as trap and skeet. Remington ceased importing the shotgun in 2009.
