Working in relays, the army set about this labour-intensive task under the eyes of Hannibal, who was constantly encouraging them. Both the sick and the healthy were put to this. The next day the road was in sufficient condition to permit the cavalry and pack animals to cross the broken stretch of road;[90] Hannibal ordered that these should instantly race down below the foliage line (2Â miles below the summit of the Alps)[91] and should be allowed access to the pastures there.[90]
