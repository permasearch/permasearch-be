Team totals have risen steadily throughout the history of ODIs. This has accelerated in recent years, with improvements in techniques, new playing methods and introduction of Twenty20 International cricket.[5] The highest team total before 400 runs was reached was the 398/5 scored by Sri Lanka against Kenya on 6 March 1996 at Asgiriya Stadium, Kandy.[6]
