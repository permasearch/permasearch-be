In Greece, one of the most popular coffees is a variation of iced coffee called Frapp√©, invented by a Nescafe represenatative Dimitrios Vakondios in 1957. The preparation entails instant coffee (traditionally Nescafe), water, and optionally, sugar, together using either an electric mixer or a shaker to create a foam. Subsequently, milk is optionally added followed by ice cubes, and the remainder is topped with water. It became well known outside of Greece as a result of the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, during which many tourists became fond of it and an article in the Los Angeles Times was published about it.[2] Since its founding, Frappe became a very popular drink in Cyprus, and in Romania.
