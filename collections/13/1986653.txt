Macbeth did not survive the English invasion for long, for he was defeated and mortally wounded or killed by the future Malcolm III ("King Malcolm Ceann-mor", son of Duncan I)[23] on the north side of the Mounth in 1057, after retreating with his men over the Cairnamounth Pass to take his last stand at the battle at Lumphanan.[24] The Prophecy of Berch√°n has it that he was wounded and died at Scone, sixty miles to the south, some days later.[25] Macbeth's stepson Lulach was installed as king soon after.
