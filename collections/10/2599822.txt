WBEB is the only station in the area to features "song tags," in which, at the completion of each song, a pre-recorded voice-over states the song's name and artist. The voice is female and sounds computerized. Pre-recorded song tags allow listeners to know the identity of songs and artists without the disc jockey having to list this information.
