In Chapter XVI, Poe recounts Captain James Cook's circumnavigation of the globe aboard the Resolution that reached 70°10′ latitude.[9] He also drew from A Narrative of Four Voyages (1832), an account by Benjamin Morrell that became a bestseller.[10] A Narrative of Four Voyages may have given Poe the idea of the summarized title of his novel.[11] Poe may have used these real-life accounts in an attempt to hoax his readers into believing the novel was an autobiographical narrative by Pym.[12]
