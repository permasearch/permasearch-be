Sarah Murdoch visited the models with her friend Crystal Barter to talk about breast bancer, and surprised the girls with a visit from their loved ones. After a trip to the landfill, they arrived at the Strand Arcade for a fashion show in which they had to wear garments made of sustainable garbage for an exhibition at the Australian Museum. The winner of the challenge was given $500 to donate to a charity of her choosing. The contestants were later photographed semi-nude and covered in pink paint with male models to promote breast cancer awareness.
