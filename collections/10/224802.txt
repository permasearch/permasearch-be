Silent Hill has been compared to the Resident Evil series of survival horror video games. Bobba Fatt of GamePro labeled Silent Hill a "shameless but slick Resident Evil clone",[5] while Edge described it as "a near-perfect sim nightmare."[64] Others felt that Silent Hill was Konami's answer to the Resident Evil series[6] in that, while they noted a similarity, Silent Hill utilized a different form of horror to induce fear, attempting to form a disturbing atmosphere for the player, in contrast to the visceral scares and action-oriented approach of Resident Evil.[4] Adding to the atmosphere was the audio, which was well-received; Billy Matjiunis of TVG described the ambient music as "engrossing";[69] a reviewer for Game Revolution also praised the audio, commenting that the sound and music "will set you on edge".[4] Less well-received was the voice acting which, although some reviewers remarked it was better than that found in the Resident Evil series,[5] was found poor overall by reviewers, and accompanied by pauses between lines that served to spoil the atmosphere.[4][5]
