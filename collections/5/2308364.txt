To make inferences and predictions about behavior concerning a voting decision, certain factors such as gender, race, culture or religion must be considered.  Moreover, key public influences include the role of emotions, political socialization, tolerance of diversity of political views and the media. The effect of these influences on voting behavior is best understood through theories on the formation of attitudes, beliefs, schema, knowledge structures and the practice of information processing. For example, surveys from different countries indicate that people are generally happier in individualistic cultures where they have rights such as the right to vote.[2] Additionally, social influence and peer effects, as originating from family and friends, also play an important role in elections and voting behavior.[3][4][5] An important question in this context is how to disentangle the social contagion by peers from external influences.[4][5] The degree to which voting decision is affected by internal processes and external influences alters the quality of making truly democratic decisions.
