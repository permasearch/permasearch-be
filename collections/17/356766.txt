Service: This was a special steak night, and it was the final service performed as two teams, with black jackets on the line for the merger into one team. Jake Steinfeld and Jerry Hairston, Jr. were in attendance. Michelle's winning challenge dish was among the dishes served at this service. The blue team got off to a strong start on their appetizers, while Michelle made a slight error in consistency while cooking the red team's capellini. Nick nearly sent out scorched, dried salmon for the blue team's entrees. Alison made her own mistakes by undercooking the red team's filet and the salmon due to her inexperience on the fish station, and Josh slowed the team down by struggling with the garnish station. All this resulted in Ramsay sending out half of one table's order before the other half was finished. Meghan made a rare mistake for her when she sent out a raw New York strip steak for the blue team (mainly due to the fact she had many orders) but recovered quickly. Alison continued making her mistakes with the salmon on the red team, while Josh continued making his own mistakes on the garnish. The blue team finally managed to complete their final orders with no problems at all, and Ramsay immediately rewarded Meghan, Milly, and Nick with a "dessert" of their new black jackets. When Alison continued making mistakes with the red team's salmon, Ramsay finally removed her from the fish station and put T on it instead, which sped their service back up again. He also quickly put the former members of the blue team to work in helping the red team finish up their service. In the end, the blue team won and were told to join the red team in coming up with two people for elimination.
