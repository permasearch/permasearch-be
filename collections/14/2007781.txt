The article (and tv show itself) states that Phil Ken Sebben won the silver in Judo in 1962. However, in the episode Deadomutt (part 1), Sebben states he's 34 (2 years younger than Harvey). The latter seems to be more credible given his..physique. Editor's Mistake? -ali It's a cartoon. They're not always going to be accurate with this stuff. 12.206.114.132 18:50, 4 November 2006 (UTC)
