Network transmission lines reached Barcaldine and Longreach in 1985, Roma (from Tarong power station) in 1986, St George, Charleville and Quilpie in 1987, and Cunnamulla in 1988. As if to complete the circle of history, a 22Â kV transmission line was also commissioned to Thargomindah in 1988, ensuring that settlement continues to be able to claim the record of being the longest provider of a supply of electricity for public purposes in Queensland anywhere outside Brisbane.
