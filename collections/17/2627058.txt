On June 13, Sabathia left the game after an apparent left hamstring injury. It was eventually revealed that his left hamstring was diagnosed with a Grade 2 strain, landing him on the disabled list.[54] He returned on July 4, starting against the Toronto Blue Jays at Yankee Stadium.[55] On July 21, Sabathia earned a win on his 37th birthday, throwing  5 1⁄3 scoreless innings.[56] On August 1, Sabathia made his 500th career start in loss against the Detroit Tigers.[57] He was the second player in Major League history to make 500 starting pitching appearances in the regular season without ever appearing as a reliever; the feat was previously achieved by Tom Glavine.[58] On August 8, he was taken out of a game after the third inning after experiencing pain in his surgically repaired right knee.[59][60] On August 11, Sabathia landed on the 10-day disabled list again due to the lingering knee problem. He finished the season 14-5 with a 3.69 ERA, 120 strikeouts and a 1.27 WHIP in  148 2⁄3 innings (27 starts). Sabathia was especially dominant in the role of the Yankee's stopper. In games following a Yankee's loss Sabathia went 9-0 with a 1.71 ERA in 11 starts, by far the best stats in both categories among pitchers who made at least seven starts following a team loss. Starting game 2 of the ALDS, Sabathia limited the Indians to earned runs in  5 1⁄3 innings followed by 9 strikeouts against just two runs allowed in  4 1⁄3 innings in game 5 as the Yankees advanced to the ALCS for the first time since 2012. Starting Game 3 of the ALCS Sabathia spun six shutout innings of three hit ball as the Yankees defeated the Astros 8-1. With the win Sabathia improved to 10-0 in with a 1.69 ERA in games started following Yankees losses (including the postseason).
