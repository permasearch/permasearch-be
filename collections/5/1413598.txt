Impulsivity is both a facet of personality and a major component of various disorders, including ADHD,[7] substance use disorders,[8][9] bipolar disorder,[10] antisocial personality disorder,[11] and borderline personality disorder.[10] Impulsiveness may also be a factor in procrastination.[12] Abnormal patterns of impulsivity have also been noted instances of acquired brain injury[13] and neurodegenerative diseases.[14] Neurobiological findings suggest that there are specific brain regions involved in impulsive behavior,[15][16][17] although different brain networks may contribute to different manifestations of impulsivity,[18] and that genetics may play a role.[19]
