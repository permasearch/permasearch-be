The twin sisters Alison and Courtney Day-DiLaurentis were born on June 6, 1990,[citation needed] the fruits of a secret sexual relationship between Jessica DiLaurentis and Peter Hastings. They were identical, but completely opposite in personality. Both were popular in her hometown, but Alison was known for her wickedness, unlike Courtney, who was admired for having a kind behavior. Disgusted by that fact, Alison began to make her parents—Jessica and Kenneth, the adoptive father—think that Courtney was psychologically damaged. Alison forced Courtney to each impersonate the other, which led to a physical fight between the two. When their parents tried to find a solution to the situation, Alison threw all the blame on Courtney, saying she was making up fake stories. Eventually Courtney was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. The family then moved to Rosewood to avoid attention and shortened their surname from Day-DiLaurentis to just DiLaurentis.[4]
