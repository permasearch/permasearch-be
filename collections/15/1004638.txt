Arsenal began their Premier League campaign at home to Leicester City, with the Gunners having lost their last two openers, both at home to West Ham and Liverpool. The record looked to be extended when Jamie Vardy and Shinji Okazaki scored for the Foxes after a record equaling 94th-second opener from new signing Lacazette, opening his league debut with his first competitive Arsenal goal with only his second touch of the game. Danny Welbeck drew Arsenal level in the last minute of first half stoppage time, but Vardy scored a second ten minutes into the second half to put Leicester ahead once more. The Gunners looked set to lose their first match to the Foxes since 1994 when the final ten minutes approached, but a five-minute period of pressure yielded two goals from Aaron Ramsey and Olivier Giroud to make it 4â€“3, which the Gunners held on to for only their second opening day victory since 2012.
