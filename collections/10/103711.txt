Glorification is the Protestant alternative to purgatory, as it is "the means by which the elect receive perfection before entering into the kingdom of Heaven." Purgatory deals with the means by which the elect become perfect, glorification deals with the elect becoming perfect. The majority of Protestant denominations believe in this form of glorification, although some have alternative names.
