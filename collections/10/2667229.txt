During the War of the Confederation, Chilean and Peruvian rebel armies were forced sign the peace treaty known as the Paucarpata Treaty, which included their unconditional surrender, but in 1839 Battle of Yungay the army of Confederation was defeated. This was the turning point in Bolivian history; for the next 40 years coups and short-lived regimes dominated Bolivian politics. Plagued by a vicious economic and political crisis, Bolivia's weakness was further demonstrated during the War of the Pacific (1879â€“83), when it lost access to the ocean and the nitrate rich fields to Chile.
