The earliest known inscriptions in Greek tend to identify or explain the object on which they are inscribed.[112]  Possibly the earliest known Greek inscription is found on a jug from the first half of the eighth century BC, discovered in Osteria dell'Osa in Latium.[113]  Most early inscriptions were written in verse, though some from Ionia were in prose, influenced by the prose traditions of Ionia's eastern neighbours.[112]  From the beginning of the seventh century, curses and dedications began to be inscribed on objects,[113] and by the sixth century, surviving inscriptions include public records such as law codes, lists of officials, and records of treaties.[112]
