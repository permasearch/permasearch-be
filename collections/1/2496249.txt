The two bronze medals were won by Zoi Sadowski-Synnott in the women's snowboarding big air and by Nico Porteous in the men's ski halfpipe. Porteous at 16 years 91 days and Sadowski-Synnott at 16 years 353 days became the nation's two youngest Olympic medallists, breaking the previous record of 17 years 100 days set by Danyon Loader at the 1992 Summer Olympics.[4]
