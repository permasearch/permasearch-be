Now following the Wayne–Macomb county line, M-102 separates Warren from Detroit. The highway also runs parallel to, and about a half mile (0.8 km) north of Outer Drive,[6][7] the original beltway highway proposed in 1918 to encircle Detroit.[10] The road passes the Mound Road Engine facility, a former Chrysler plant next to the Mound Road intersection. East of the plant,[6][7] the highway crosses a branch line of the Conrail Shared Assets Operations on the east side of the plant complex[9] before intersecting M-53 (Van Dyke Road).[6][7] Further east, 8 Mile Road passes north of the Bel Air Center Shopping Center before crossing another Canadian National Railway line[9] next to the intersection with M-97 (Groesbeck Highway).[6][7]
