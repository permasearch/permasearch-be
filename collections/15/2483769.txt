The design of      W    {\displaystyle \mathbf {W} }   remains an open question. One way of proceeding is to identify a system which generates the estimation error and setting      W    {\displaystyle \mathbf {W} }   equal to the inverse of that system.[42] This procedure may be iterated to obtain mean-square error improvement at the cost of increased filter order. The same technique can be applied to smoothers.
