On 1 August 2013, Square Enix Europe executive Phil Rogers announced that a new Tomb Raider game was in development for the eighth generation of video game consoles.[39] At E3 2014, Microsoft announced the game during their press conference, while confirming that the game would be released in late 2015.[40] At Gamescom 2014, Microsoft revealed that Rise of the Tomb Raider would be an exclusive for its Xbox series of video game platforms, including Xbox 360 and Xbox One, though Phil Spencer, an executive from Microsoft Studios, confirmed that it was a timed exclusive, similar to Microsoft's deal with Capcom and Crytek on Dead Rising 3 and Ryse: Son of Rome in which both would be released for Microsoft Windows. This had led to outrage from players, since Tomb Raider had a longer history with PlayStation, and that they blamed franchise owner Square Enix over the decision.[41] The fact that Microsoft called the game an "exclusive on Xbox for holiday 2015" sparked confusion among both the gaming press and players.[42] Rogers later explained in 2015 that the timed exclusivity with Microsoft was mainly due to Microsoft's strong support for the 2013 reboot whereas many others did not. Darrell Gallagher, head of Crystal Dynamics, also believed that the partnership can help the team to "deliver the best game that [they] can".[43] Rogers described the arrangement as a "natural" evolution and a "tough" decision.[44]
