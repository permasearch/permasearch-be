The teaching of religion in schools is a controversial issue in Romania, and it is a political topic regulatory debated in the public space. Various politicians (notably Remus Cernea) have been vocal on this issue. In 2014, the Constitutional Court of Romania ruled that parents (or legal guardians) of students (or students over 18 years) who want to study religion must submit an opt-in application for this class.[50] Before 2014, all students were enrolled automatically, unless their parents opted-out, with pressure to attend being high. There are also debates on whether religion should be taught in a confessional way or in a history of religion way.[51] Another issue is whether children aged 14â€“17 (who have a limited form of legal capacity under Romanian law) should choose themselves whether to study religion, or whether their parents should make the decision.[52]
