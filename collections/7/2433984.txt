Poultry farming is the process of raising  domesticated birds such as chickens,  ducks,  turkeys and  geese for the purpose of farming  meat or  eggs for food. Poultry - mostly chickens - are farmed in great numbers.  Farmers raise more than 50 billion chickens  annually as a source of food, both for their meat and for their eggs.[1] Chickens raised for eggs are usually called[by whom?] layers while chickens raised for meat are often called broilers.[2]
