By 1940, just four streetcar routes remained in Somerville: the 87 Clarendon Hill – Lechmere via Somerville Avenue and 88 Clarendon Hill – Lechmere via Highland Avenue pair, the 89 Clarendon Hill – Sullivan Square Station route, and the 101 Salem Street – Sullivan Square Station route which connected with the Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway's Fellsway Line to Stoneham. The 87 and 88 were converted to trackless trolleys in 1941, while the 89 and 101 saw heavy wartime use and lasted until 1946 and 1947, respectively.[9]
