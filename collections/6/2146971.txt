VC and PAVN casualties were claimed to have numbered 245 dead left on the battlefield and three captured, while many more were thought to have been removed as they withdrew. Others were so badly mutilated their remains were unidentifiable.[194] Approximately half were believed to have been caused by artillery and the remainder by small arms.[170] The initial estimate was given by an Australian Army spokesman, and some participants in the battle regarded these figures as inflated.[206] These figures however are directly disputed by many individuals present at the battle, with reports by a D Company commander stating actual body counts as no more than 50.[207] The official history of the D445 Battalion and 275th Regiment records either 30 or 47 were killed in total, primarily by artillery fire.[2] Another estimate was 150 according to Colonel Bao who was overall district commander, but did not directly participate[207] alongside battle commander Nguyen Thanh Hong.[208]
