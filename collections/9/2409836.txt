In 2010, scientists created "malaria-resistant mosquitoes" in the laboratory.[143][144][145] The World Health Organization estimated that malaria killed almost one million people in 2008.[146] Genetically modified male mosquitoes containing a lethal gene have been developed to combat the spread of dengue fever[147] and the Zika virus.[148] Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the single most important carrier of dengue fever and the Zika virus, were reduced by 80% in a 2010 trial of these GM mosquitoes in the Cayman Islands[149][150] and by 90% in a 2015 trial in Bahia, Brazil.[148] In comparison, the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District has achieved only 30â€“60% population reduction with traps and pesticide spraying.[151] In 2016 FDA approved a genetically modified mosquito intervention for Key West, Florida. UK firm Oxitec proposed the release of millions of modified male (non-biting) mosquitoes to compete with wild males for mates. The males are engineered so that their offspring die before maturing, helping to eradicate mosquito-borne disease. Final approval was to be based on a local referendum to be held in November.[152] Andrea Crisanti, a molecular biologist at Imperial College in London is working on ways to stop the A. gambiae mosquito from transmitting disease.[153]
