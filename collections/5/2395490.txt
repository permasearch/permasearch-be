In her game of truth or dare with Wilson, she initially states that her father is supportive of her sexuality, although she later corrects this, saying he is in fact unaware and she never came out to him. She also tells Wilson that she has never been in a threesome. Wilson seems astonished, given Thirteen's promiscuity, and former thrill-seeking behavior. She later states that she may have participated in a foursome, thereby allowing her to truthfully answer "no", to the question about a threesome. However, at the end of the game, it is implied that nothing she has told him has been truthful, leaving her status with her father a mystery.
