The Estero de San Antonio has a variety of habitat types, including freshwater ponds, mudflats, eelgrass and saltgrass areas, and wooded ravines, including 923 acres of associated wetlands. Tidewater goby, Ghost shrimp and Mud shrimp, as well as significant seabird aggregations and other species depend upon this habitat. In the summer or early fall, a sandbar often forms at the mouth of the Estero, damning it until the winter rains arrive.
