In early 2010, the MSC was criticised by environmental groups like the Sierra Club for certifying the British Columbia sockeye salmon fishery[29][30][31] when stocks in the Fraser River (a part of the fishery) had been in decline since the early 1990s.[32] The year before, the salmon run of the Fraser River (a part of the fishery) was only 1.4 million (M) of a predicted 11 M salmon and had prompted the Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper to launch a judicial enquiry.[33] The 2010 run was 30 M and the 2011 run is estimated to be greater than 4 M.[34] The Fraser Sockeye 2010 think tank at Simon Fraser University stated that the large 2010 run was due mainly to the cyclical peak of fish from the Adams River and that returns were high only for a subset of tributaries.[35] However, it stated that "the large unresolved uncertainties [â€¦] highlight our collective uncertainty about the relative roles of climate change, aquaculture, and fisheries management in determining salmon returns".[35]
