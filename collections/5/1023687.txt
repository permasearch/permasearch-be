While ongoing ocean acidification is at least partially anthropogenic in origin, it has occurred previously in Earth's history.[17] The most notable example is the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM),[18] which occurred approximately 56Â million years ago when massive amounts of carbon entered the ocean and atmosphere, and led to the dissolution of carbonate sediments in all ocean basins.
