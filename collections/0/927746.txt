Vesta is the second-most-massive and second-largest body in the asteroid belt after the dwarf planet Ceres,[16][17][18][19][20][21][22] and it contributes an estimated 9% of the mass of the asteroid belt.[23] It is slightly larger than Pallas,[24] though significantly more massive. Vesta is the last remaining rocky protoplanet (with a differentiated interior) of the kind that formed the terrestrial planets.[25][26][27] Numerous fragments of Vesta were ejected by collisions one and two billion years ago that left two enormous craters occupying much of Vesta's southern hemisphere.[28][29] Debris from these events has fallen to Earth as howardite–eucrite–diogenite (HED) meteorites, which have been a rich source of information about Vesta.[30][31][32]
