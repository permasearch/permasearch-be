Elsa is jealous of Helen because her beauty is nowhere near her sister and had won a beauty pageant in their hometown. She connives her to give up her dreams of being an actress to work in a department store, an action which Julie does not like believing Elsa to be jealous of her. While closing up, Elsa is murdered by Ben.
