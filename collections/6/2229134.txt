Lysine price-fixing Ajinomoto was a member of the Lysine price fixing cartel in the mid-1990s. Along with  Kyowa Hakko Kogyo, and Sewon America Inc., Ajinomoto settled with the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division in September 1996. Each firm and one executive from each pleaded guilty as part of a plea bargain to aid in further investigation. Their cooperation led to Archer Daniels Midland settling charges with the US Government in October 1996 for $100 million, a record antitrust fine at the time.[23] The cartel had been able to raise Lysine prices 70% within their first six months of cooperation.[24]
