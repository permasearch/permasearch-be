As in many other Polynesian languages, diphthongs in MƒÅori vary only slightly from sequences of adjacent vowels, except that they belong to the same syllable, and all or nearly all sequences of nonidentical vowels are possible. All sequences of nonidentical short vowels occur and are phonemically distinct.[47] With younger speakers, /ai, au/ start with a higher vowel than the [a] of /ae, ao/.
