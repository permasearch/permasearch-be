Aramco partners continued to operate and manage Saudi Arabia's oil fields.[22] In November 1988, a royal decree changed its name from Arabian American Oil Co. to Saudi Arabian Oil Co. (or Saudi Aramco)[21] and took the management and operations control of Saudi Arabia's oil and gas fields from Aramco and its partners. In 1989â€“90, high-quality oil and gas was discovered in three areas south of Riyadh: the Raghib area about 77 miles southeast of the capital.[23]
