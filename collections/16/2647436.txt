The first eight Ohio-class submarines were armed at first with 24 Trident I C4 SLBMs.[5] Beginning with the ninth Trident submarine, Tennessee, the remaining boats were equipped with the larger, three-stage Trident II D5 missile.[6] The Trident I missile carries eight multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV), while the Trident II missile carries twelve, in total delivering more destructive power than the Trident I missile and with greater accuracy. Starting with Alaska in 2000, the Navy began converting its remaining ballistic missile submarines armed with C4 missiles to carry D5 missiles. This task was completed in mid-2008.
