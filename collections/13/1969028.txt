The theatre has hosted most of the New York-based finales for the reality game show Survivor. The Ed Sullivan Theater was first used for Survivor: The Amazon (following bad weather cancelling an outdoor arena finale from central park) and was subsequently used for every even-numbered season from Survivor: Palau to Survivor: One World.
