North of the Cajon Pass, I-15 traverses the Mojave Desert towns of Hesperia and Victorville. I-15 passes through desert for 30 miles (48 km) before reaching Barstow, then continues past Zzyzx Road, before reaching the town of Baker. The sign for Zzyzx Road — alphabetically the last place name in the world — is a landmark of sorts on the drive between Los Angeles and Las Vegas. I-15 enters Nevada near the casino town of Primm, formerly known as Stateline, Nevada.
