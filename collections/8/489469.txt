The programmes have been criticized on various grounds, such as actually diminishing Europe's industrial competitiveness[32] and failing to deliver fundamental excellence and global economic competitiveness.[33] In 2010, the Austrian Research Promotion Agency launched a petition calling for a simplification of administrative procedures, which attracted over 13,000 signatories.[34] The numerous other criticisms of the petitioners were later distilled into a green paper.[35] In Horizon 2020 there are significant simplifications: e.g. fewer funding rates (increasing the funding rates of the large companies), less reporting, less auditing, shorter time from proposal to project kick-off.
