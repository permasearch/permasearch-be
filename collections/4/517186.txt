Animals can be poisoned directly by mine products and residuals. Bioaccumulation in the plants or the smaller organisms they eat can also lead to poisoning: horses, goats and sheep are exposed in certain areas to potentially toxic concentration of copper and lead in grass.[11] They are fewer number of ants species in soil containing high copper levels, in the vicinity of a copper mine.[9] If fewer ants are found, chances are great that other organisms leaving in the surrounding landscape are strongly affected as well by this high copper levels, since ants are a good environmental control: they live directly in the soil and are thus pretty sensitive to environmental disruptions.
