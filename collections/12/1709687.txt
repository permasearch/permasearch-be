Sergeant Pepper (Charles Demers; singing Rod Stewart)[39] is a circus bug who travels from town to town, or rather yard to yard, to show his amazing circus the Lonely Hearts Club Band. Among his performers are the acrobatic Fleas lead by Billy Shears. He understands Walter the most due to their shared love of performance.
