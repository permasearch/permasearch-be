In 2012, clothing company Urban Outfitters created a clothing line inspired by Denise entitled "A Different World", describing it as "a nod to the coolest older sister ever".[142] Business Insider criticized the organization for hiring a white model Dana Boulos to promote the clothing line, arguing "that most Urban customers wouldn't even know who Denise is."[143] Denise has served as a blueprint for and inspired a generation of young, middle-class female television characters attending college.[38] According to Soraya Nadia McDonald of The Undefeated, "Girls modeled on Denise are smart, but their intellect isn’t necessarily reflected in their grades. They’re sheltered, and they move through college under ideal, manageable circumstances. And they’re presented as typical, pleasant girls who should be completely relatable for white America."[38]
