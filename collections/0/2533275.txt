Carnitine deficiency has been extensively studied, although most commonly as a secondary finding to other metabolic conditions.[4]  The first case of SPCD was reported in the 1980s, in a child with fasting hypoketotic hypoglycemia that resolved after treatment with carnitine supplementation.  Later cases were reported with cardiomyopathy and muscle weakness.  Newborn screening expanded the potential phenotypes associated with SPCD, to include otherwise asymptomatic adults.[5]
