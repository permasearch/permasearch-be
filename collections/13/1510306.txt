In 1998, Ralph Nader asked Dell (and five other major OEMs) to offer alternate operating systems to Microsoft Windows, specifically including Linux, for which "there is clearly a growing interest"[22][23] Possibly coincidentally, Dell started offering Linux notebook systems that "cost no more than their Windows 98 counterparts" in 2000,[24] and soon expanded, with Dell becoming "the first major manufacturer to offer Linux across its full product line"[25] However, by early 2001 Dell had "disbanded its Linux business unit."[26]
