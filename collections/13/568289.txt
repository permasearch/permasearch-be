There are also other types of degradable materials that are not considered to be biopolymers, because they are oil-based, similar to other conventional plastics. These plastics are made to be more degradable through the use of different additives, which help them degrade when exposed to UV rays or other physical stressors.[56] yet, biodegradation-promoting additives for polymers have been shown not to significantly increase biodegradation.[60]
