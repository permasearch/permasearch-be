Various authors have attempted to distinguish between complete and incomplete forms of koro, along with cultural and non-cultural forms.[16] Cultural forms are said to involve a cultural belief or myth which plays a role in the genesis and spread of the disease in the community.  These are regarded as complete forms of koro, matching all the symptoms required for diagnosis without significant co-morbidity.[16][9] Differentiation into primary koro,  a culture-bound expression, and secondary koro.  Secondary koro is proposed to have co-morbidity with a CNS disorder, another psychiatric disorder, or possible drug use.[9]
