In the war the government banned ice cream and rationed sweets, such as chocolates and confections; sweets were rationed until 1954.[72] Most people grumbled, but for the poorest, rationing was beneficial, because their rationed diet was of greater nutritional value than their pre-war diet. Housewives organized to oppose the austerity.[73] The Conservatives saw their opening and rebuilt their fortunes by attacking socialism, austerity, rationing, and economic controls, and were back in power by 1951.[74]
