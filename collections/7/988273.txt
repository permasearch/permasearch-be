In June 2008, nine Haredi poskim signed a public pronouncement (Kol Koreh) stating that it was forbidden to raise or lower the temperature by reprogramming on Yom Tov using the Star-K Kosher Certification approved Shabbat Mode feature.[13] The pronouncement referred to the differing opinion of Rabbi Moshe Heinemann[14] (although without explicitly mentioning Rabbi Heinemann by name) as a minority opinion (Da'as Yachid) that should not be relied upon. However, Rabbi Heinemann said that he continued to stand by his opinion that it is permissible.[13]
