This parable seems on a natural reading to support the first view, justification by works. The 'sheep' are saved because of the good deeds they have done, independent of any framework of knowledge or belief, or hope of future benefit. Some Calvinist theologians in particular have therefore attempted to get out from under the passage either by restricting the range of the phrase 'the least of these my brethren', or denying that the passage has any literal application to the after-life. The first option seems to be unnatural and to go against the spirit of the parable of the Good Samaritan. As associate professor of Biblical Languages at Union Presbyterian Seminary, E. Carson Brisson, says, "Let it be noted that this list of afflicted and needy individuals is, at first glance, a list of the very ones who appear to be bereft of God's favor. These are ‘the least.’ These are truly ‘other.’"[3] The first option also does not support predestination, but at most might indicate, say, that unbelievers are to be judged by how well they treat believers.
