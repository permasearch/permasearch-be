The brand split returned after the 2016 event along with a new world title, the WWE Universal Championship, but the 2017 pay-per-view event was made a SmackDown-exclusive event for a contract for a match for its world championship, the WWE Championship (formerly WWE World Heavyweight Championship). The 2017 event also included the first-ever Women's Money in the Bank ladder match, with the winner receiving a contract for a SmackDown Women's Championship match. Due to the controversy surrounding the win of that match, the first non-pay-per-view Money in the Bank ladder match occurred on the June 27 episode of SmackDown Live. The 2018 event was dual branded, involving both the Raw and SmackDown brands, and with one men's match and one women's match.
