In 2006, China was the top producer of coal with 38% share followed by the United States and India, according to the British Geological Survey. As of 2012 coal production in the United States was falling at the rate of 7% annually[156] with many power plants using coal shut down or converted to natural gas; however, some of the reduced domestic demand was taken up by increased exports[157] with five coal export terminals being proposed in the Pacific Northwest to export coal from the Powder River Basin to China and other Asian markets;[158] however, as of 2013, environmental opposition was increasing.[159] High-sulfur coal mined in Illinois which was unsaleable in the United States found a ready market in Asia as exports reached 13 million tons in 2012.[160]
