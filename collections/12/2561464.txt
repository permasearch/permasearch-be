The Topanga Corral was a nightclub that featured an eclectic mix of performers, including then Topanga locals Canned Heat, Spirit, Little Feat, Spanky and Our Gang, Taj Mahal, Emmylou Harris, Bob Denver, Neil Diamond and Russ Tamblyn. Etta James, Windance, Neil Young, and Crazy Horse, Geronimo Black, and many others.[citation needed] It is rumored that Jim Morrison was inspired to write "Roadhouse Blues" about the drive up Topanga Canyon Boulevard to The Corral.[citation needed] Later in the 1970s, after being destroyed by fire and rebuilt, the club featured many up and coming bands from the L.A. punk scene.[citation needed] In 1986, the Corral again burned to the ground and was not rebuilt.[citation needed] Today, many musicians, artists and actors continue to make Topanga their home. Linda Ronstadt had been seen hitchhiking through the Canyon barefoot with her guitar.[citation needed]
