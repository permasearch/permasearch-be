In 2002, the term for schizophrenia in Japan was changed from seishin-bunretsu-byō (精神分裂病, lit. "mind-split disease") to tōgō-shitchō-shō (統合失調症, lit. "integration disorder") to reduce stigma.[201] The new name was inspired by the biopsychosocial model; it increased the percentage of people who were informed of the diagnosis from 37 to 70% over three years.[202] A similar change was made in South Korea in 2012.[203] A professor of psychiatry, Jim van Os, has proposed changing the English term to "psychosis spectrum syndrome".[204]
