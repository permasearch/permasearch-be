One of the earliest names used for the area was Conejo Mountain Valley, as used by the founder of Newbury Park, Egbert Starr Newbury, in the 1870s.[16] During the 1920s, today’s Thousand Oaks was home to 100 residents. In the 1920s came talks of coming up with a name for the specific area of Thousand Oaks. A local name contest was held, where 14 year-old Bobby Harrington’s name suggestion won: Thousand Oaks.[17][18][19] The valley was - and still is - characterized by its tens of thousands of oak trees (50-60,000 in 2012[20]).[18][21]
