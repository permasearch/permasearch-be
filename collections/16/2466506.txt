Cath is a freshman at the University of Nebraskaâ€“Lincoln, along with her much more outgoing identical twin sister Wren. But Cath is having a hard time adjusting to college. First, because Wren doesn't want to room with her, and second, because of her social anxiety disorder. A lot of Cath's free time is spent writing fan fiction for a book series about a boy magician named Simon Snow, and Cath has thousands of passionate followers who read her award-winning fan fiction based on a story similar to Harry Potter. Wren distances herself from Cath as she enters college, professes to have outgrown fan fiction and Simon Snow, and goes out drinking and dancing with her roommate almost every night. Meanwhile, Cath is more interested in her fiction-writing class. The professor is very impressed with her writing, and Cath finds a writing partner and friend in Nick, whom she meets with weekly for writing sessions. However, Cath suffers an emotional and academic setback when the professor gives Cath an F for writing a fan fiction story for a class assignment, as she considers this to be plagiarism.
