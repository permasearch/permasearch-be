Jim Razzi's 1985 children's gamebook Snow White in the Enchanted Forest (Choose Your Own Adventure: Walt Disney #1) features the Prince-like character's confrontations with evil Queen as she is searching for Snow White, who is hiding with the Dwarfs, to "put an end to her, once and for all!"[120] In it, she has much greater powers than in the film, including being able to instantly change between her hag and queen forms at will,[121] magically disappear in a cloud of smoke,[122] change herself into an animal and back, and turn others into animals with magic beams from her hands.[123]
