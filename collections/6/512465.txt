After suffering financial losses, including an estimated $29 million in the 1988 collapse of First Republic Bank Corporation, Bright sold the franchise to Jerry Jones in 1989 for $140 million.[3] Jones made many changes to the team, including firing longtime head coach Tom Landry. Later, Bright claimed that he wanted to fire Landry himself as early as 1987, but general manager Tex Schramm claimed he didn't have a successor in place yet.[6]
