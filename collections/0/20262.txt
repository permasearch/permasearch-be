Part II (s.10-21) deals with the marriageable age and the marriage of minors. In the original 1961 Act, marriageable age was set at 16 for females and 18 for males. The marriageable age was equalised in 1991 by the Sex Discrimination Amendment Act 1991[3] which raised the marriageable age of females to 18.
