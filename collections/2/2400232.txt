The song was written by Brown and his songwriting team, the Graffiti Artists (Rob Allen and Andre Merritt). He stated that after entering the studio, Polow da Don created a beat that Brown wrote along to. Because the producer's style was "more of a European, techno, house-type feel,"[2] the group "wanted to give it that other side of crossover, and go a little bit to that pop realm".[2] "Forever" is one of four new songs Brown recorded for the re-release of his second studio album Exclusive. He recorded the song using an autotune effect, as he did in one of his previous singles, "Kiss Kiss".[3] The song was first intended to be on Brown's following album, but decided he "wasn't ready to release a new album yet".[4]
