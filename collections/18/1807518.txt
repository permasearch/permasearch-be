The Modern Filipino alphabet (Filipino: Makabagong alpabetong Filipino), otherwise known as the Filipino alphabet (Filipino: alpabetong Filipino), is the alphabet of the Filipino language, the official national language and one of the two official languages of the Philippines. The Modern Filipino alphabet is made up of 28 letters, which includes the entire 26-letter set of the ISO basic Latin alphabet, the Spanish Ã‘ and the Ng digraph of Tagalog. It replaced the Pilipino alphabet of the Fourth Republic. Today, the Modern Filipino alphabet may also be used as the alphabet for all autochthonous languages of the Philippines and in writing Chavacano, a Spanish-derived creole.
