The hyperboloid cage masts supporting the three-tier fire-control tops, the two funnels, the open-mount 5-inch (127 mm)/25 caliber guns and the casemates with the single-purpose 5-inch/51 caliber guns were replaced by a single funnel and dual-purpose 5-inch/38 caliber guns. On the decks, 40 mm Bofors and 20 mm Oerlikon batteries were added.[6][19] Although the two-ocean naval policy dictated a beam limit of 108 feet (33 m) for U.S. battleships to traverse the Panama Canal, when Tennessee, California and West Virginia were rebuilt their beams were widened to 114 feet (35 m) feet, effectively limiting their service to the Pacific theater.[6][19] After her rebuild her appearance differed from her sister ship, Maryland, while resembling that of Tennessee and California except for her twin-gun main battery turrets.[6][19]
