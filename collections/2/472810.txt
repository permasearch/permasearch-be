In 1970 the ages for "R" and "X" were raised from 16 to 17.[12] Also, due to confusion over whether "M"-rated films were suitable for children,[12] "M" was renamed to "GP" (for General audiences, Parental guidance suggested),[13][14] and in 1971 the MPAA added the content advisory "Some material not generally suitable for pre-teenagers".[15] On February 11, 1972,[16] "GP" was revised to "PG".[12]
