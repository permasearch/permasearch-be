Besson was born in Paris, to parents who both worked as Club Med scuba-diving instructors.[1] Influenced by this milieu, as a child Besson planned to become a marine biologist. He spent much of his youth traveling with his parents to tourist resorts in Italy, SFR Yugoslavia, and Greece.[2] The family returned to France when Besson was 10. His parents promptly divorced and each remarried.
