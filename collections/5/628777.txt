According to researchers at the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University, the AHCA legislation would lead to a loss of 924,000 jobs by 2026.[67] The group also studied the BCRA, which would cost an estimated 1.45 million jobs by 2026, including over 900,000 in healthcare. The stimulus effects from tax cuts would initially create jobs, but would be offset by the larger declines in spending as the various parts of the law take effect. Further, gross state products would be $162 billion lower in 2026.  States that expanded Medicaid would bear the brunt of the economic impact, as government funds would be reduced more significantly.[68]
