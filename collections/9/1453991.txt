Kangaroo Island is connected to the main South Australian power grid by a subsea cable across Backstairs Passage.[24] This 33kV cable is reaching the end of its 30-year design life, and options have been explored to replace it.[25] The Kangaroo Island power station has three standby diesel generators capable of providing a combined 6MW through the Kingscote substation to provide stability of supply if the submarine cable is unavailable.[26] An additional 2MWÂ generator is anticipated to be added soon.[25]
