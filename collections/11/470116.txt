Team challenge: A slot machine was spun and determined what type of ingredients and steak one member of each team had to cook in 30 minutes. Since Kimmie did not spin due to the women having an extra member, she got to choose which batch of ingredients she would cook with; she chose Robyn's, but Robyn's ribeye steak was chosen over Kimmie's. Justin's filet mignon scored over Tiffany's, Christina's hangar steak scored over Royce's, neither Dana's or Patrick's flat iron steak scored a point and both Barbie's and Brian's New York strips scored a point. Clemenza's ribeye steak then scored over Robyn's, giving the men a 3-2 win. Ramsay told the women they should have chosen Kimmie's steak, which he preferred.
