Emily has been juggling a lot of secrets and lies lately, and with a surprise visit from her father before a big swim meet, the pressure gets to be too much for her — sending her to the hospital with an ulcer. But with the prospect of having to come clean to her father about Danby, Emily realizes she has bigger problems when "A" reveals his/her part in Emily's swim career. Wren turns out to be her doctor in the hospital. While visiting Emily, Spencer and Aria take the opportunity to try and do more digging around about the cause of Alison's death and how the broken field hockey stick may play a part in the last few moments of their friend's life. Spencer discovers that Ali had been buried alive because Ali's autopsy report mentions her having dirt in her lungs. She also discovers that Ali's report is missing a page. Meanwhile, Hanna struggles with the prospect of losing both men in her life when her father's wedding "Save the Date" arrives, and the possibility of Caleb running out of Rosewood before his past can come back to haunt him.
