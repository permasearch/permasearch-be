The official music video was released May 2, 2017 and directed by Wes Edwards and Ryan Silver. The film depicts the brothers as owners of a pawn shop robbed by men wearing rubber masks of U.S. presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump, in an homage to the "Ex-Presidents" of the 1991 action crime thriller Point Break and as an implicit criticism of the American political system. The video uses the circumstances of the criminals' escape to make a series of visual gags about the presidents whose masks they wear: "Clinton" ogles a passing woman, "Bush" leaves his bag on the roof of his getaway vehicle and loses all of his money, "Obama" is shot at by a disgruntled gunowner, and "Trump" upstages an African-American church service, attempts to pilfer the offering dish, and gets caught up in an angry protest. The thieves all escape to freedom by scaling a wall, save for "Trump", who is cornered by the police.[2]
