Darren Richmond recovers from an attempted assassination. He learns he is now a paraplegic and ponders his political future.[2] Campaign manager Jamie Wright stays by Richmond's side during his recovery, while Richmond's girlfriend and assistant Gwen Eaton has dealt with personal guilt for contributing information that led to Darren's arrest, subsequent shooting, and the discovery that he has been unfaithful. She left Seattle for Washington, D.C. to work for a senator friend of her father's but returned to help Darren distance himself from the murder suspicion.[5][6] Jamie also steels Darren's campaign resolve by suggesting the current mayor might be behind the false arrest. Darren returns to the campaign race.[3]
