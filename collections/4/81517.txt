Sam's supernatural abilities are the result of him being fed Azazel's demon blood while he was an infant. Sam exhibits signs of precognition throughout the first season, manifesting as dreams of others' deaths and later as visions.[7][9] Sam has also shown signs of sensing spirits, once displayed telekinesis, and immunity to certain demonic powers.[9][12][26][67] Sam states that his abilities are connected to Azazel and anything related to his actions, such as the other special children.[68] This argument was further proven after Azazel's death, as Sam stopped having visions of both the demon and the other psychics,[23] however, according to Ruby his powers were simply dormant.[26] After training with Ruby, Sam develops new abilities, such as exorcising demons with his mind, and his telekinesis becomes more potent.[27] By drinking demon blood Sam's power become stronger, to the point where he can outright kill demons and even torture them while in their human hosts; by drinking at least three gallons of demon blood, he can kill demons just by concentrating and willing it to happen.[35][45] After being affected by the Horseman Famine, Sam uses his powers to defeat him by attacking the demon spirits that Famine had recently consumed, although Dean and Bobby were subsequently forced to lock Sam in the panic room to detox.
