Much of the auditorium's main floor seating, the backstage areas and the entire stage (including the inlaid circle of wood from the Ryman's stage) was underwater during the flood. While the Grand Ole Opry House's stage was replaced thereafter, the Ryman circle was restored and again placed at center stage in the Grand Ole Opry House before shows resumed.[30][31] The remediation following the flood also resulted in a renovated backstage area, including the construction of more dressing rooms and a performer's lounge.
