Canids communicate with each other by scent signals, by visual clues and gestures, and by vocalizations such as growls, barks, and howls. In most cases, groups have a home territory from which they drive out other conspecifics. The territory is marked by leaving urine scent marks, which warn trespassing individuals.[40] Social behaviour is also mediated by secretions from glands on the upper surface of the tail near its root and from the anal glands.[39]
