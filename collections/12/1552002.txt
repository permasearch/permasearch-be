In canon law, grants, laws, contracts, sentences, jurisdiction, and appointments are at times revoked by the grantor, his successor or superior according to the prescriptions of law. Revocation without just cause is illicit though often valid. Laws and customs are revoked when, owing to change of circumstances, they cease to be just and reasonable.
