After the area came under Russian rule in 1868, Jews were granted equal rights with the local population.[108] In that period some 50,000 Jews lived in Samarkand and 20,000 in Bukhara.[108] After the Russian revolution in 1917, and the establishment of the Soviet regime, Jewish religious life was restricted. By 1935 only one synagogue out of 30 was left in Samarkand; nevertheless, underground community life continued during the Soviet era.[108]
