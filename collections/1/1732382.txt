There are two types of theories of imitation, transformational and associative. Transformational theories suggest that the information that is required to display certain behavior is created internally through cognitive processes and observing these behaviors provides incentive to duplicate them.[42] Meaning we already have the codes to recreate any behavior and observing it results in its replication. Bandura's "social cognitive theory" is one example of a transformational theory.[43] Associative, or sometimes referred to as "contiguity",[44] theories suggest that the information required to display certain behaviors does not come from within ourselves but solely from our surroundings and experiences.[42] Unfortunately these theories have not yet provided testable predictions in the field of social learning in animals and have yet to conclude strong results.[42]
