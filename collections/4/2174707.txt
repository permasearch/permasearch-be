Beginning with Toy Story (1995), director John Lasseter had long decided that the Toy Story films would not be musicals in which the characters perform songs but agreed that musician Randy Newman would be writing songs about certain "moment[s] in the story", most of which he would sing himself.[1] Originally, the filmmakers had considered having Jessie simply explain her backstory; this concept was re-worked several different times until the idea of converting her thoughts into the form of a song called "When She Loved Me" was introduced instead.[1] Lasseter feels that the scene Newman originally doubted that "When She Loved Me" would work, initially thinking the filmmakers were "making a mistake" by including it in the film,[2] due to it essentially being about a doll discussing the difference between being loved and unloved, calling it a risk due to the studio's history of fearing slowing films down too much and losing the audience's interest.[3] Newman continued to doubt that most children would be capable of sitting through the song until he watched them do it themselves during a screening of the film.[2] The songwriter was ultimately surprised to see that even the youngest of children actually sat through the song despite its slow tempo and mature, emotional themes.[3] Newman joked that the song "isn't the first time [Pixar] knew better than I did",[2] explaining, "I wrote something that must have worked or the kids would have been running up the aisle."[3] Lasseter admitted that he is most proud of the use of "When She Loved Me" in the film.[1]
