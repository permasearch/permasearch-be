Rabbinic tradition ascribes the authorship of Job to Moses. However, scholars generally agree that it was written between the 7th and 4th centuries BCE, with the 6th century BCE as the most likely period for various reasons.[17] The anonymous author was almost certainly an Israelite, although he has set his story outside Israel, in southern Edom or northern Arabia, and makes allusion to places as far apart as Mesopotamia and Egypt.[18] According to the 6th-century BCE prophet Ezekiel, Job was a man of antiquity renowned for his righteousness,[19] and the book's author has chosen this legendary hero for his parable.[20]
