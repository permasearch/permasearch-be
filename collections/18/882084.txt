Major League Baseball's first amateur draft was held on June 8â€“9, 1965, in New York City.[14] Teams chose players in reverse order of the previous season's standings, with picks alternating between the National and American Leagues.[15] With the first pick, the Kansas City Athletics took Rick Monday, an outfielder from Arizona State University.[1]
