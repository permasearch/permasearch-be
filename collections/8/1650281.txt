Greenland sharks have also been found with remains of seals, polar bears, horses, moose,[11] and reindeer (in one case an entire reindeer body) in their stomachs.[7][12] The Greenland shark is known to be a scavenger, and is attracted by the smell of rotting meat in the water. The sharks have frequently been observed gathering around fishing boats.[7] It also scavenges on seals.[10]
