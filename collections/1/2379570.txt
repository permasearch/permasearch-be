72.198.104.147 (talk) 00:57, 24 May 2015 (UTC)==Inside man?== The old Rabbi had two headphones with different colors (one red and one white). When the police interrogated him and asked him why they were different, he said it was to distinguish which was for the left ear and which one was for the right. However, as I remember, Russell had worn one white earphone when he entered the bank that was identical to the Rabbi's, thus indicating that they were communicating with each other even before the robbery began. This would make sense in that in the end of the movie it is revealed that the Rabbi is related to the Russell (both were in the black van). So does this mean that the Rabbi was the inside man? I'll have to find some sources to verify this though. (though most likely the inside man refers to Russel hiding within the walls of the bank)--TBC??? ??? ??? 05:44, 15 April 2006 (UTC)
