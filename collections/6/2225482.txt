2002–03 proved to be another productive season for Henry, as he scored 32 goals in all competitions while contributing 23 assists—remarkable returns for a striker.[15] In doing so, he led Arsenal to another FA Cup triumph (where he was man-of-the-match in the Final),[16] although Arsenal failed to retain their Premier League title.[17] Throughout the season, he competed with Manchester United's Ruud van Nistelrooy for the league scoring title, but the Dutchman edged Henry to the Golden Boot by a single goal.[3] Nonetheless, Henry was named both the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year.[18][19] His rising status as one of the world's best footballers was affirmed when he emerged runner-up for the 2003 FIFA World Player of the Year award.[13]
