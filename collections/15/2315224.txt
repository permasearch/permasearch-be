The work of both Newton and Leibniz is reflected in the notation used today. Newton introduced the notation        f ˙      {\displaystyle {\dot {f}}}   for the derivative of a function f.[27] Leibniz introduced the symbol     ∫   {\displaystyle \int }   for the integral and wrote the derivative of a function y of the variable x as        d y   d x      {\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}}  , both of which are still in use.
