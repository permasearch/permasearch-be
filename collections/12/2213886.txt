Lee made his first recordings in his hometown of Memphis for Tampa Records and Sun Records in 1957–58.  He achieved his first chart success in 1962, when his composition "She Thinks I Still Care" was a hit for George Jones (later recorded by Elvis Presley, Connie Francis, Leon Russell and later Anne Murray as "He Thinks I Still Care").  Later that year, "Patches," written by Barry Mann and Larry Kobler and recorded by Lee for Smash Records, rose to No. 6. The song tells in waltz-time the story of teenage lovers of different social classes whose parents forbid their love.  The girl drowns herself in the "dirty old river."  The singer concludes: "It may not be right, but I'll join you tonight/ Patches I'm coming to you."  Because of the teen suicide theme, the song was banned by a number of radio stations.  However, it sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc.[2]
