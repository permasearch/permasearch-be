The Rocky film scene has become a cultural icon. Many tourists visit the steps to recreate the scene themselves.[8] E! Channel ranked it No. 13 in its 101 Most Awesome Moments in Entertainment.[9] During the 1996 Olympic Torch Relay, Philadelphia native Dawn Staley was chosen to run up the museum steps. The steps are the backdrop for the annual Independence Day celebration, and have often been featured in large concerts such as Live 8. Two journalists from the Philadelphia Inquirer spent a year interviewing people who ran the steps, and published a book in 1996 called Rocky Stories: Tales of Love, Hope, and Happiness at America's Most Famous Steps.[10] The 2017 NFL Draft was held from the steps, the first time the NFL draft was held outdoors.[11]
