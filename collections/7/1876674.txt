After his parents' deaths and prior to meeting Sebastian, he was enslaved by a cult and scheduled to be a ritual sacrifice. During a sacrificial session, Ciel's torturers sacrificed his twin, causing Sebastian to be summoned. Ciel made a contract with Sebastian instead of the cult and then commanded the demon to kill all the people in the room. From that day forward, Ciel devoted his life to finding the people responsible for the humiliation and suffering he had to endure. During the time he was captured, a brand was burned into his back, which he does not want anyone to see. As a nobleman, Ciel presents himself as a proud, solemn, and mature boy. Due to his past misfortunes, he rarely smiles and is merciless when dealing with enemies. However, Ciel has occasionally expressed concern for the well-being of the few close to him. Despite his stoic demeanor, Ciel exhibits traits befitting a young man for his age, such as his fondness for sweets and games. As such, Ciel is clever, mischievous, and competitive, doing whatever it takes to win a match. Although physically weak, Ciel is proficient with the use of guns, and always carries one in order to protect himself. His name means "sky" in French.
