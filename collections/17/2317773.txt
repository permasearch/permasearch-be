Arenado went 0-for-3 in his major league debut against the Arizona Diamondbacks at Chase Field. He recorded his first three major league hits in his second game—including his first home run versus Josh Wall—in a 12–2 win versus the Los Angeles Dodgers.[23] In his sixth game, he hit first major league grand slam and second career home run off Tampa Bay Rays pitcher David Price.[24] Arenado's defensive dominance translated smoothly to the major leagues, as ESPN.com published on September 7 that he would have ranked second for a hypothetical National League (NL) Defensive MVP Award. Arenado trailed only shortstop Andrelton Simmons for the league lead in Defensive Runs Saved (DRS), 38–30.[25] Arenado appeared in 133 major league games and slashed .267/.301/.405 with 10 home runs and 52 RBI.[26] Defensively, he led NL third basemen in range factor both per game (3.08) and per nine innings (3.24), and was second in putouts (91), assists (309) and double plays turned (tied with two others with 27).[27]
