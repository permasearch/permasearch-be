By age 11, Woodhull had only three years of formal education, but her teachers found her to be extremely intelligent.  She was forced to leave school and home with her family when her father, after having "insured it heavily,"[4] burned the family's rotting gristmill.  When he tried to get compensated by insurance, his arson and fraud were discovered; he was run off by a group of town vigilantes.[4] The town held a "benefit" to raise funds to pay for the rest of the family's departure from Ohio.[4]
