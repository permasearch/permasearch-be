After a long planning process by the government regarding the development of a mass rapid transit system in Indonesia's capital, the Jakarta Mass Rapid Transit infrastructure is currently under construction, with a north–south line between Kota and Lebak Bulus; and an east–west line, which will connect to the north–south line at Sawah Besar station. The Jakarta MRT will be a combination of subways and elevated rails. Preparation work started in April 2012,[166] and groundbreaking was done in October 2013, with the first, 15.2 km-long line between Hotel Indonesia and Lebak Bulus scheduled to be operational by 2018, and the north–south line MRT network is scheduled to be operational by 2020. The total length of the network when complete will be approximately 110.8 kilometres (68.8 miles).[167][168] The Jakarta city government decided on a rail-based system because of its ability to carry large numbers of people quickly and cheaply.[169] As of 2016[update], the mass rapid transit system has an investment of nearly US $1.7 billion to ease the capital's traffic issue in the coming years, including the construction of a subway.[170]
