In July 2012, one of Kepler's four reaction wheels (wheel 2) failed.[17] On May 11, 2013, a second wheel (wheel 4) failed, jeopardizing the continuation of the mission, as three wheels are necessary for its planet hunting.[15][16] Kepler had not collected science data since May because it was not able to point with sufficient accuracy.[140] On July 18 and 22 reaction wheels 4 and 2 were tested respectively; wheel 4 only rotated counter-clockwise but wheel 2 ran in both directions, albeit with significantly elevated friction levels.[179]  A further test of wheel 4 on July 25 managed to achieve bi-directional rotation.[180] Both wheels, however, exhibited too much friction to be useful.[19] On August 2, NASA put out a call for proposals to use the remaining capabilities of Kepler for other scientific missions.  Starting on August 8, a full systems evaluation was conducted.  It was determined that wheel 2 could not provide sufficient precision for scientific missions and the spacecraft was returned to a "rest" state to conserve fuel.[17]   Wheel 4 was previously ruled out because it exhibited higher friction levels than wheel 2 in previous tests.[180] Sending astronauts to fix Kepler is not an option because it orbits the Sun and is millions of kilometers from Earth.[19]
