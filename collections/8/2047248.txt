California allows "non-clergy marriage" by "members of a particular religious society or denomination not having clergy for the purpose of solemnizing marriage or entering the marriage relation," provided that specified forms, including the signatures of two witnesses, are properly completed and filed.[8] An atheist couple in San Francisco reportedly were allowed to have a non-clergy marriage under this provision of California law, by entering "atheist" in the box for "religious society or denomination" on the non-clergy marriage form.[9]
