The longest serving executive in the organization is Lew Hayman, who had a five decade career beginning in the 1930s as coach and administrator. A Jewish-American, Hayman served with both the Argos and Montreal Alouettes and has been called "the architect of Canadian football."[126] He was the team's first president and managing director at the insistence of Eric Cradock in 1957,[127] and would continue in the former role until 1981. Ralph Sazio took over from Hayman and is another hall of fame builder.[128]
