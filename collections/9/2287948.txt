Nonstoichiometry is pervasive for metal oxides, especially when the metal is not in its highest oxidation state.[1]:642–644 For example, although wüstite (ferrous oxide) has an ideal (stoichiometric) formula FeO, the actual stoichiometry is closer to Fe0.95O.  The non-stoichiometry reflect the ease of oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ effectively replacing a small portion of Fe2+ with two thirds their number of Fe3+.  Thus for every three "missing" Fe2+ ions, the crystal contains two Fe3+ ions to balance the charge. The composition of a non-stoichiometric compound usually varies in a continuous manner over a narrow range.  Thus, the formula for wüstite is written as Fe1−xO, where x is a small number (0.05 in the previous example) representing the deviation from the "ideal" formula.[2] Nonstoichiometry is especially important in solid, three-dimensional polymers that can tolerate mistakes.  To some extent, entropy drives all solids to be non-stoichiometric.  But for practical purposes, the term describes materials where the non-stoichiometry is measurable, usually at least 1% of the ideal composition.
