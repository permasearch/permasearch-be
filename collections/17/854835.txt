Each episode generally has a unifying theme (such as burgers or comfort food) with the host visiting multiple restaurants to sample the food that corresponds to this theme. The program focuses on small, independent eateries featuring traditional American-style, sometimes Canadian, cuisine (such as barbecue, smoked meat, hamburgers, deep-fried food, pizza, steak, and bacon-and-egg breakfast), regional styles, or ethnic specialties. Most often, the chosen restaurants use fresh ingredients, home-style recipes, and gourmet culinary approaches to what is usually not considered gourmet food. The host interacts with both the customers, to get their opinion on the food, and with the kitchen staff, who demonstrate how to prepare one or more of the dishes.
