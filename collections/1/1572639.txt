The rear portion of airfoil rotates downwards on a simple hinge mounted at the front of the flap.[7] The Royal Aircraft Factory and National Physical Laboratory in the United Kingdom tested flaps in 1913 and 1914, but these were never installed in an actual aircraft.[8] In 1916, the Fairey Aviation Company made a number of improvements to a Sopwith Baby they were rebuilding, including their Patent Camber Changing Gear, making the Fairey Hamble Baby as they renamed it, the first aircraft to fly with flaps.[8] These were full span plain flaps which incorporated ailerons, making it also the first instance of flaperons.[8] Fairey were not alone however, as Breguet soon incorporated automatic flaps into the lower wing of their Breguet 14 reconnaissance/bomber in 1917.[9] Due to the greater efficiency of other flap types, the plain flap is normally only used where simplicity is required.
