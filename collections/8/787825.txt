Further to the Beatles' pioneering use of promotional films since 1965, the clip for the song served as an early example of what became known as a music video.[158][159] In 1985, the "Strawberry Fields Forever" and "Penny Lane" clips were the oldest selections included in the New York Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)'s exhibition of the most influential music videos.[160] The two films occupied a similar place in MoMA's 2003 "Golden Oldies of Music Video" exhibition, where they were presented by avant-garde artist Laurie Anderson.[161][nb 13] The "Strawberry Fields Forever" clip also provided the inspiration for the start of the fan vidding phenomenon in 1975.[163] Kandy Fong, influenced by the Beatles not attempting to perform the music,[164] set images from the Star Trek TV series to an apparently unrelated musical soundtrack.[165]
