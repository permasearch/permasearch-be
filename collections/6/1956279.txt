where        F      {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\mathcal {F}}}   is the magnetomotive force (MMF) across a magnetic element,      Φ    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle \Phi }   is the magnetic flux through the magnetic element, and        R      {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\mathcal {R}}}   is the magnetic reluctance of that element. (It will be shown later that this relationship is due to the empirical relationship between the H-field and the magnetic field B, B=μH, where μ is the permeability of the material). Like Ohm's law, Hopkinson's law can be interpreted either as an empirical equation that works for some materials, or it may serve as a definition of reluctance.
