Vanished is the second novel and was released in November 2010.[12] The story starts out with a bang - or more accurately, a boom - as a pirate ship sails into Blackpool harbor, accidentally firing off its canon. Suddenly everyone is talking about pirate curses and stolen Gypsy gold. It's all fun and games, until someone is stabbed to death. As Molly and Michael Graham dig into the mystery, they find that more than one person had reason to want the man dead. Not only that, but the Grahams' investigation is making them some powerful enemies.
