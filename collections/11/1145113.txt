Pisco, a kind of brandy, is the national drink of Peru. It originated during the colonial period as a then, cheaper substitute for the Spanish liquor known as Orujo. Nevertheless, Orujo is a product made from the spoils of wine production, Pisco, in the other hand, uses fresh grapes very much as wine does. This distilled beverage made from grapes is produced in various regions of the country. Pisco Sour is a cocktail made from pisco combined with key lime juice, the white of an egg and sugar. Chilcano [13] also made with Pisco, is a very refreshing cocktail as well.
