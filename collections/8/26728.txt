Euophrys omnisuperstes, a minute black jumping spider, has been found at elevations as high as 6,700 metres (22,000Â ft), possibly making it the highest confirmed non-microscopic permanent resident on Earth. It lurks in crevices and may feed on frozen insects that have been blown there by the wind. There is a high likelihood of microscopic life at even higher altitudes.[62]
