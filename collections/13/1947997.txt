Kerr helped organise a 90th birthday party for Nelson Mandela at Hyde Park, London on 27 June 2008.[citation needed] The event came 20 years after Kerr and Simple Minds played a role (releasing the single Mandela Day amongst other activities) in the 70th birthday concert at Wembley Stadium, which was held to demand Mandela's release. Mandela attended the 2008 event in person.
