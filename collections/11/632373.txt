The von Mises yield criterion (also known as the maximum distortion energy criterion[1]) suggests that yielding of a ductile material begins when the second deviatoric stress invariant      J  2     {\displaystyle J_{2}}   reaches a critical value.[2] It is part of plasticity theory that applies best to ductile materials, such as some metals. Prior to yield, material response can be assumed to be of a nonlinear elastic, viscoelastic or linear elastic behavior.
