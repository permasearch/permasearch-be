The Nationals headed out to Milwaukee for the start of a seven-game roadtrip beginning August 31 and stretching into September having posted their highest win total in a month for the season, despite injuries to key players like Harper, Scherzer, and Madson during August. After losing the last two games in their three-game set in Miami to start the month,[267] they proceeded to win two of three from the Cubs on the road,[268] win three of four from the Marlins[269] and then two of three from the Giants at home,[270] split the two-game interleague series with the visiting Angels,[271] win three of four from the Padres[272] and then two of three from the Astros on the road,[273] split the four-game series with the visiting Mets,[274] and then sweep the Marlins in three games at home.[275] The Milwaukee Brewers ended Washington's four-game winning streak, winning 6–3 in the August 31 series opener despite Turner falling a home run shy of hitting for the cycle.[276] All in all, the Nationals went 18–11 over the month of August and finished the month with a 81–52 record, good for second overall in the National League behind the Los Angeles Dodgers and 15 games up over the second-place Marlins in the National League East.[277]
