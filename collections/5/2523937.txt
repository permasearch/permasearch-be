The Amazing Race 13 spanned 40,000 miles (64,000 km) in 23 days, visiting eight different countries. This included the series' first visits to Bolivia, Cambodia and Kazakhstan, and return visits to Brazil, New Zealand, India, and Russia, with the finish line in Portland, Oregon. CBS had originally planned to only air one installment of The Amazing Race (season 12) in the 2007–08 season, but due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, CBS ordered a 13th installment as a replacement for programs affected by the strike.[3] CBS greenlit the 13th installment on December 9, 2007.[4] Race locations were scouted in January 2008 and filming took place between April and May 2008.[5][6][7]
