Tropic Thunder held an early screening at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con,[78] two weeks before it officially premiered on August 11, 2008, at the Mann Village Theatre in Westwood, California and two days before its wide release. Members of several disability groups picketed before the premiere, protesting at the portrayal of intellectual disability shown in the film.[79] The groups revealed that it was the first time that they had ever protested together at an event.[79] As a result of the protest, the normally unobstructed views of the red carpet leading to the premiere were blocked off by 10-foot (3-m)-high fences and there was an increase in the number of security personnel present.[80] No protests were held at the United Kingdom's September premiere.[81]
