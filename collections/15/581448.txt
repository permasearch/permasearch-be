Uneven heating can cause newly generated gases to break out of a weak spot on the surface of comet's nucleus, like a geyser.[68] These streams of gas and dust can cause the nucleus to spin, and even split apart.[68] In 2010 it was revealed dry ice (frozen carbon dioxide) can power jets of material flowing out of a comet nucleus.[69] Infrared imaging of Hartley 2 shows such jets exiting and carrying with it dust grains into the coma.[70]
