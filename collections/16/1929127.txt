Chip trucks have long been a staple of the Belgian countryside. The Belgian Food Truck Association is lobbying to legalize food trucks on the street.[48] Brussels was the first European city to propose locations for food trucks at football matches.[citation needed] Belgium also holds the Brussels Food Truck Festival, the largest of its kind in Europe, every year in May.[49]
