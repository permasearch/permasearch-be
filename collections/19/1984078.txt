The cockpit of the Beluga is pressurized but the cargo deck is not, making it inaccessible during flight and unsuitable for cargoes that require a pressurized environment, such as live animals. However, the cargo deck is fitted with a heating module to keep the cargo within an appropriate temperature range.[3] On at least one occasion, a pressurized container has been used for cargo (see Operational history). The aircraft is operated by a crew of three â€“ two pilots and a loadmaster.[3]
