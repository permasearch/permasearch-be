After the homicide rates escalated to the point of making Cd. Juárez the most violent city in the world, the city has seen a significant and steady decline in violent crime since then.[39] In 2012, homicides were at their lowest rate since 2007 when drug violence flared between the Sinaloa cartel and the Juarez Cartel.[40] That trend has continued in 2013 when 497 homicides were reported, the lowest amount since 2007,[41] dropping Ciudad Juárez to the 37th spot of most dangerous cities.[42]
