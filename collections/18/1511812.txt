Wanda (Wanda Sykes, Seasons 2–5, 7–8) is a friend of Cheryl's who rarely agrees with Larry. In "The Bowtie," (Season 5 Episode 2) Wanda tells Larry that she is "not his link into the black world" after he gets himself in an awkward racial incident. In "Funkhouser's Crazy Sister," Wanda and Cheryl use Larry's name to get a table at a crowded restaurant. She tends to 'appear' anytime Larry has a misunderstanding with a black person.
