In season three, Ed Deline's office appears to be in the middle of the strip, overlooking Harrah's, Caesars Palace, The Mirage, and The Venetian, which puts the Montecito near where Treasure Island is located. This is inconsistent with the flyover shots of the Montecito, which would place Ed's office over two miles away. Closer examination of the window scene shows that The Mirage's marquee over their driveway has been edited to read "Montecito". In season 4, "Died in Plain Sight", a scene in Ed Deline's office shows again an overview of The Mirage and Caesars Palace. Again, it is a confirmation that Ed Deline's office would be where Treasure Island is located.
