Colour and development of manes in male lions varies between regions, among populations and with age of lions.[24] The Asiatic lion differs from the African lion by a less developed mane.[6] Manes of most lions in ancient Greece and Asia Minor were also less developed without extending to below the belly, sides or ulnar. Lions with such smaller manes were also known in the Syrian region, Arabian peninsula and Egypt.[3]
