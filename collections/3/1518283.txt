Section 152 of The Criminal Justice Act 2003[10] states that the court must not pass a custodial sentence unless it is of the opinion that the offence (or combination of offences): "was so serious that neither a fine alone nor a community sentence can be justified". The court must always state the reason for imposing a custodial sentence.
