Scottish singer and songwriter Sandi Thom had lined up Jackson as a Supporting Guest Act in Glasgow as part of her Homecoming Scotland 2009 Tour.[40] As of April 2009 half of the concert dates had been cancelled by the management. The reason why the dates were cancelled is unknown, but Leon said he was "gutted" at the cancellations and that it was not his doing.[41] All but two of the joint tour days from England and Wales remained (with support act Same Difference playing a solo tour gig in Portsmouth),[42] while seven of the nine tour dates in Scotland remained.[43]
