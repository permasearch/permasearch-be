Van Dam and Benoit, meanwhile, had been feuding over the Intercontinental Championship since Benoit won it on the July 29, episode of Raw.[13] Shortly after this match, Benoit took advantage of what was referred to as "open season" on wrestler contracts and took his title with him to SmackDown!, where he had originally been drafted. Benoit was still required to defend the title against a Raw roster member at SummerSlam and Van Dam defeated Jeff Hardy on the August 12 episode of Raw in a match to determine the #1 contender.
