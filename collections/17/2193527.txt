Some survival strategies often involve disrupting cytokines and other methods of cell signaling to prevent the phagocyte's  responding to invasion.[115] The protozoan parasites Toxoplasma gondii, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Leishmania infect macrophages, and each has a unique way of taming them.[115] Some species of Leishmania alter the infected macrophage's signalling, repress the production of cytokines and microbicidal molecules—nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species—and compromise antigen presentation.[116]
