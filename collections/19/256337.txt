Female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species.[178] Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate.[179] Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.[180]
