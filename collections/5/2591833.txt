Due to the corporate structure of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles which is no longer owned or controlled by US investors, some media sources now list Detroit as having a "Big Two" (GM and Ford) as opposed to a "Big Three".[35] Some media sources are now including Tesla in the "Big Three" because it is the third largest US owned automobile manufacturer with a valuation ($34.16B), much higher than FCA ($9.05B).[36][37]
