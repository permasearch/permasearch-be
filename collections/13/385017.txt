The possession of open containers of alcohol and drinking in public (street, park etc.) is legal for people of the legal drinking age (16 for beer and wine; 18 for distilled spirits). Many cities forbid or restrict the consumption of alcohol in public transit or inside train stations. For example, the city of Hamburg made drinking on public trains and buses illegal in 2011.[12] Deutsche Bahn forbids "excessive" consumption of alcohol in Berlin S-Bahn stations;[13] violations are considered a civil and not criminal matter.[14] Similarly, BVG excludes intoxicated passengers only if they threaten operational order or safety.[15] The rules on trains vary considerably; the north German Metronom Eisenbahngesellschaft banned alcohol consumption on its trains in 2009, while the Deutsche Bahn sells alcohol to travelers on its trains.[16] Many regional transit authorities that do not ban alcohol consumption in trains make efforts to contain disruptive behaviour, such as by providing additional dedicated trains for football (soccer) fans traveling to or from matches.[16]
