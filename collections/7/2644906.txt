The ventral striatum is composed of the nucleus accumbens and the olfactory tubercle.[4][8] The nucleus accumbens is made up of the nucleus accumbens core and nucleus accumbens shell, which differ by neuron populations. The olfactory tubercle receives input from the olfactory bulb but has not been shown to play a role in processing smell.[8] In non-primate species, the islands of Calleja are included.[9] The ventral striatum is associated with the limbic system and has been implicated as a vital part of the circuitry for decision making and reward-related behavior.[10][11]
