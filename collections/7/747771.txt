After being kicked and spat upon, the bodies were hung upside down from the roof of an Esso gas station.[181] The bodies were then stoned from below by civilians. This was done both to discourage any Fascists from continuing the fight, and as an act of revenge for the hanging of many partisans in the same place by Axis authorities. The corpse of the deposed leader was subject to ridicule and abuse. Fascist loyalist Achille Starace was captured and sentenced to death and then taken to the Piazzale Loreto and shown the body of Mussolini. Starace, who once said of Mussolini "He is a god,"[182] saluted what was left of his leader just before he was shot. The body of Starace was subsequently hung up next to that of Mussolini.
