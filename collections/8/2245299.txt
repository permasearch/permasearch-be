Freud and Nimmo appeared from the first programme in 1967, while Williams joined in the show's second series in 1968. Jones made his dÃ©but in 1971. After Williams' death in 1988, Merton (a long-time fan of the show) contacted the producer at Nicholas Parsons' suggestion and was invited to participate during the following year.[23] Nimmo died in 1999, Jones in 2000 and Freud in 2009, leaving Merton as the only regular, albeit he is not in every edition.
