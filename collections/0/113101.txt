The model year and the actual calendar year of production rarely coincide. For example, a 2015 model year automobile is available during most of the 2015 calendar year, but is usually also available from the third quarter of 2014 because production of the 2015 model began in July or August 2014. When a new model is introduced there may be an additional delay to retool and retrain for production of the new model.[citation needed]
