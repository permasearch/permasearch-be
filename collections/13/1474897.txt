Some deme lists suggest to extend the 139+3 list adding 43 other names some of which have been considered by scholars as attic demes.[8] The criticism performed by John S. Traill[9] shows that 24 are the result of error, ancient[10] or modern,[11] or of misinterpretation[12] and 19[13] are well known chiefly from inscriptions of the second and third centuries after Christ, i.e. in the fifth period, and thus for political purposes they were originally dependent on legitimate cleisthenic demes.
