On April 9, 2015, Bold Films came on board to fully finance and produce the crime thriller film, titled Shot Caller to be directed by Ric Roman Waugh, based on his own script.[12] Participant Media developed the project, while Participant's Jonathan King would produce along with Michel Litvak and Matthew Rhodes of Bold Films, along with Waugh.[12] In April 2015, Relativity Media acquired the US rights to the film for $3 million with a wide release commitment, and Sierra/Affinity was on board to handle international sales.[4] Due to the fact that Relativity Media filed for bankruptcy on July 2015,[13] the film's release was postponed until Saban Films acquired the U.S. distribution rights on April 2017.[14]
