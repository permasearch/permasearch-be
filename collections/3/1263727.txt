Advocacy groups for individuals with Down syndrome began to be formed after the Second World War.[149] These were organizations advocating for the inclusion of people with Down syndrome into the general school system and for a greater understanding of the condition among the general population,[149] as well as groups providing support for families with children living with Down syndrome.[149] Before this individuals with Down syndrome were often placed in mental hospitals or asylums. Organizations included the Royal Society for Handicapped Children and Adults founded in the UK in 1946 by Judy Fryd,[149][150] Kobato Kai founded in Japan in 1964,[149] the National Down Syndrome Congress founded in the United States in 1973 by Kathryn McGee and others,[149][151] and the National Down Syndrome Society founded in 1979 in the United States.[149]
