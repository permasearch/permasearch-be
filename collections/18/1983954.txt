While moving across Haiti, the circulation of Isaac became disrupted while the convection became disorganized.[16] Continuing to the northwest, the storm moved along the north coast of Cuba.[17] Convection increased over the center by early on August 26, and Isaac re-intensified slightly while entering the Straits of Florida.[18] However, continued dry air prevented the inner core of convection from developing. Hurricane Hunters reported that a ragged eye developed multiple times, but the feature did not persist. The storm tracked northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico due to a subtropical ridge to its north.[19] Although the barometric pressure continued to decrease, Isaac remained a large storm, which contributed to the lack of strengthening.[20] At about 1620 UTC (11:20 a.m. CDT) on August 28, Isaac attained hurricane status about 75 mi (115 km) south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River, based on data from the Hurricane Hunters.[21]
