The Newark riots of 1967 were in response to an incident of excessive force where two Newark Police officers arrested and beat John Smith (an African American taxi driver). The riots in Newark occurred 2 years after riots in Los Angeles[7] and came at a time when racial tensions were high. Historians believe that the shrinking of the economy, increased unemployment, and a city with a majority African American population which was being run by white politicians increased tensions during that era.[2]
