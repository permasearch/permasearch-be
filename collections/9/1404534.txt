The facade is bordered on the north and south by two towers and include three main doorways, each of which lead to a different part of the building.[1] The southern door leads to the Patio of Honor and presidential offices (no public access).[2] The northern door is known as the Mariana Door, named in honor of Mariano Arista who had it constructed in 1850. The area next to this door used to be the old Court Prison, with courtrooms and torture chambers. It is now occupied by the Finance Ministry. It contains the Treasury Room, constructed by architects Manuel Ortiz Monasterio and Vicente Mendiola. The iron and bronze door is the work of Augusto Petriccioli.[1]
