The state's typically humid subtropical climate rarely encounters precipitation coupled with freezing temperatures. The Gulf of Mexico helps maintain this climate, particularly closer to the coast. The normally extreme summers are rarely countered by cold winters, with snowfall low in intensity and frequency.[10] Average winter temperature normals in southern Louisiana vary from the 40s to the 60s Fahrenheit.[3] Natural disasters such as hurricanes are far more common, and such an ecosystem is ill prepared for snow, particularly the seafood supply on which Louisiana relies for much of its revenue.[11] Little research has been done directly linking effects on Louisiana's ecosystem to snow conditions. However, the jet stream that created the 2014 North American cold wave has been linked to global warming,[12] and resultant cold fronts have been linked to salt water intrusion in Louisiana's Atchafalaya Bay.[13] However, one of Louisiana's most famous animals, the alligator, has proved versatile in adapting to cold weather conditions by burrowing in "alligator holes", which they usually use for waiting out a drought.[14] Studies conducted in Finland and Sweden suggest that snow creates more potential problems in urban communities due to increased pollution in runoff.[15][16] Due to the state's lack of resources and funding, however, it is unclear what levels of pollution due to snow affect the Louisiana area.
