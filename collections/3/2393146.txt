Metalwork was an important and well-developed craft, and metal tools such as axes, mammoties and hoes were widely used. Weapons and tools of iron and steel were produced in large scale for the military.[88] A good indication of the development of metalwork of this period is the Lovamahapaya, which had been roofed entirely with copper.[89]
