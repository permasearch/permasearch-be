Prison construction kept pace with post-revolutionary legal change. All states that revised their criminal codes to provide for incarceration also constructed new state prisons.[92] But the focus of penal reformers in the post-revolutionary years remained largely external to the institutions they built, according to David Rothman.[100] For reformers of the day, Rothman claims, the fact of imprisonment—not the institution's internal routine and its effect on the offender—was of primary concern.[100] Incarceration seemed more humane than traditional punishments like hanging and whipping, and it theoretically matched punishment more specifically to the crime.[101] But it would take another period of reform, in the Jacksonian Era, for state prison initiatives to take the shape of actual justice institutions.[100]
