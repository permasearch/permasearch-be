For the first time since 1993's Vs., the band members did not go into the recording sessions with any completed songs, only guitar riffs.[4] Vedder admitted that the band "really went in with nothing."[7] The band sat around playing music together and discussed the song arrangements, and in just one week had completed ten songs.[3][8] Ament described it as a "real collaborative effort,"[3] and Vedder described it as "absolute democracy."[9] Guitarist Mike McCready stated that the band members were feeling "fresh and energetic" and "were communicating better than ever."[10] Toward the end of the sessions it came down to Vedder to finish up the material, with Ament observing that "the way the record started and the way that it finished is probably two different things."[11] Regarding his lyric writing process, Vedder said that he wrote at least four different sets of lyrics for each song,[12] with many going as high as eight. Vedder described as a process that demands "the patience of like a National Geographic photographer sitting underneath the bush in a tent", adding he would at times "figure out after eight, nine or eleven drafts that the first one was actually the one".[8] A total of 25 songs were written before coming down to the 13 on the final track listing.[4] Outtakes include "The Forest", later featured on Ament's 2008 solo album Tone,[13] and "Of the Earth", which started being played live in 2010.[4][14]
