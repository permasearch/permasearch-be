In 1848, Thomas Bateman discovered the mid-seventh century Benty Grange Helmet at Benty Grange, Derbyshire.[120] The frame comprises seven pieces of iron, and the helmet is crested with a bronze boar figureâ€”the figure is decorated with garnet eyes mounted in beaded gold, along with gilded, inlayed tusks and ears.[121] In Guilden Morden, Cambridgeshire, another bronze boar was discovered at a female grave. The boar was apparently a helmet crest, but no other helmet pieces were found there; therefore, the crest may have been detached from the helmet before being buried.[122] There is also a boar crest on the Pioneer Helmet, unearthed in Wollaston, Northamptonshire, although this boar was made with iron.[123]
