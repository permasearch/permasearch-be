The building's 1,073-foot (327.1 m) design was first released in December 2001.[82] However, the first design did not meet with approval from other architects, or from the residents of Chicago.[87] A subsequent revision in July 2002 resulted in an 86-floor design for use as an office and residential structure, similar to the 2006 design which is, however, for a different combination of uses.[88] Smith's 2002 plans put broadcast antennas (multiple communications dishes) at the top of the building.[89] A revised 90-story, 1,125 feet (342.9 m) plan was unveiled in September 2003 for a building including condominiums, office space, a "condominium hotel", retail stores, and restaurants.[90][91] In January 2004, another revision changed floors 17 through 26 from offices into condominiums and hotel rooms.[92] In his May 2004 plan, Smith decided to top the building with an ornamental spire instead of communications dishes. These dishes, according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, would not have counted toward the building's height. The spire, however, will count, raising the tower's height to 1,300 feet (396.2 m).[89] At one point in 2005, Trump aspired to build a slightly taller building that would surpass the Sears Tower as the nation's tallest building, but Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley was against the plan.[93][94] Eventually, Smith settled on a design with a height of 1,362 feet (415.1 m), which was the height of 2 World Trade Center, the shorter of the former twin World Trade Center towers.[95] This height makes the Tower the third tallest in the United States after One World Trade Center and the Willis Tower.[96]
