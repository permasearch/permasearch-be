This division also provides both propulsion engines and power generation systems to the naval shipbuilding industry, such as the Series 3512B turbocharged V-12 diesel engine for American Virginia class nuclear submarines. Caterpillar diesel engines are also used in San Antonio class amphibious transport docks, Spanish Alvaro de Baz√°n class frigates, British River class patrol vessels, Mexican Sierra class patrol boats,[103] and Malaysian Kedah class MEKO A-100 offshore patrol vessels.[104] The poor network security of the Caterpillar engines puts America's submarine force at risk for cyberattack.[105] In a recent interview on cybersecurity, the Navy clarified that Caterpillar actually has some of the most secure control systems and will be used as a model of how the Navy will design cyber protections into its control systems.[106]
