The Anglican parish church of St Peter was originally built in the mid 13th century and had a three-stage tower added in the 15th, however it was extensively restored when the main house was built in the late 17th century. The church consists of a north and south aisle, chancel and south west porch with the tower to the west.[25] In the south aisle are encaustic tiles dating from the 13th century.[26] The font is Norman while the pulpit is Jacobean. There is also a 16th-century Flemish altar triptych.[25]
