Jataka Tattva reiterates that the person whose lord of the 10th house is in conjunction with benefic planets (Sutra X.19) or is hemmed and aspected by benefic planets (Sutra X.22) or is situated in a navamsa owned by a benefic planet (Sutra X.20), becomes renowned, however, any association with evil planets earns bad name only, makes one notorious (Sutra X.23) and makes his father suffer (Sutra X.57). Raja yoga arises if the 10th house formed by a fixed sign is occupied by the lord of the lagna and Jupiter is in a kendrasthana (Sutra X.148) or if the strong lord of the 10th house from the Natal Moon is in a kendra, in the 9th or in the 2nd from the Lagna (Sutra X.160).[10]
