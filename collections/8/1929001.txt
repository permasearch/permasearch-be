Most of the languages spoken in Eritrea belong to the Ethiopian Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic family.[110] Other Afroasiatic languages belonging to the Cushitic branch are also widely spoken in the country.[110] The latter include Afar, Beja, Blin, and Saho. Smaller groups also speak other Afroasiatic languages, such as the newly recognized Dahlik and Arabic (the Hejazi and Hadhrami dialects spoken by the Rashaida and Hadhrami, respectively).
