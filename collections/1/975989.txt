Sutton was an accomplished bank robber. He usually carried a pistol or a Thompson submachine gun. "You can't rob a bank on charm and personality," he once observed. In an interview in the Reader's Digest published shortly before his death, Sutton was asked if the guns that he used in his robberies were loaded. He responded that he never carried a loaded gun because somebody might get hurt. He stole from the rich and kept it, though public opinion later made him into a  type of Gentleman Thief, like Robin Hood. He allegedly never robbed a bank when a woman screamed or a baby cried.  According to writer Pavle Stanimirovic who wrote about Willie Sutton in his new True Crime Stories from behind the wall with Burl Barer, he talks about all the "old school" gangsters from "Mad Dog" Joe Sulivan, Jimmy "The Gent" Burke, John Gotti, and Jimmy Ida .[5]
