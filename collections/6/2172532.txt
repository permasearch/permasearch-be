In 2000, Energy Science Laboratories developed a new carbon fiber material that might be useful for solar sails.[47][48] The material is over 200 times thicker than conventional solar sail designs, but it is so porous that it has the same mass. The rigidity and durability of this material could make solar sails that are significantly sturdier than plastic films. The material could self-deploy and should withstand higher temperatures.
