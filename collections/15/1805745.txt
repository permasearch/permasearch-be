Palindromic sequences may also have methylation sites.[citation needed] These are the sites where a methyl group can be attached to the palindromic sequence. Methylation makes the resistant gene inactive; this is called insertional inactivation or insertional mutagenesis. For example, in PBR322 methylation at the tetracyclin resistant gene makes the plasmid liable to tetracyclin; after methylation at the tetracyclin resistant gene if the plasmid is exposed to antibiotic tetracyclin, it does not survive.
