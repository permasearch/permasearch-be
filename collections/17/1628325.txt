While traveling to the Negative Zone to rescue three children, Spider-Man's suit transformed into a white and black suit that apparently did nothing other than change his appearance.[104] On a second visit to the Negative Zone, Spider-Man gained a version of his red-and-blue nano-tech suit from the TV series Spider-Man Unlimited.[105] Also, Alex Ross created a specially designed suit with a different appearance for the 2002 live action film, which was still in development at the time. In Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions, the Negative Zone costume worn by Spider-Man Noir is an alternate costume.
