Each season had a slightly different format to its predecessors, although the theme of 1950s military training is common to all. The 3rd season (known as Bad Lads' Army: Officer Class) had the volunteers train to become officers while the 4th season (known as Bad Lads' Army Extreme) had the volunteers train to become paratroopers.
