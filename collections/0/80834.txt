This pandemic has been described as "the greatest medical holocaust in history" and may have killed more people than the Black Death.[45] It is said that this flu killed more people in 24 weeks than AIDS killed in 24 years, and more in a year than the Black Death killed in a century.[11] However, a 2016 article in The Atlantic states that the Black Death, over the course of the decade of the 1340s, killed more than 10% of the world population whereas the 1918 flu pandemic killed less than half this percentage.[46]
