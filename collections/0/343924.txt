Gore a long-shot for the Presidential nomination, but many believe he could provide a natural complement for any of the other candidates: a young, attractive, moderate Vice Presidential nominee from the South. He currently denies any interest, but he carefully does not reject the idea out of hand."[13] At the time, he was 39 years old, making him the "youngest serious Presidential candidate since John F. Kennedy."[13]
