The animators also had a mixture of ex-Disney employees and college graduates from CalArts.[9] Every day, they had to do what would normally be done across a two-week period at Disney.[9] The colour stylist was veteran Disney animator A. Kendall O'Connor, a member of Disney's feature animation department from its first feature Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,[7] and Oliver likened the light-hearted frog sequence to Merrie Melodies.[9] A massive TDK sign was included by Rees as the company was a big sponsor.[9] The animators used many visual cues to help inform the audience about plot and character. For example during Toaster's nightmare at the beginning of the film, he burns toast and emits smoke, which symbolises his guilt and fear of being responsible.
