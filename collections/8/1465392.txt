Children’s literature critic Peter Hunt argues that no book is innocent of harbouring an ideology of the culture it comes from.[146] Critics discuss how an author’s ethnicity, gender and social class inform their work.[147] Scholar Kimberley Reynolds suggests books can never be neutral as their nature is intended as instructional and by using its language, children are imbedded with the values of that society.[148] Claiming childhood as a culturally constructed concept,[149] Reynolds states that it is through children’s literature that a child learns how to behave and to act as a child should, according to the expectations of their culture. She also attributes capitalism, in certain societies, as a prominent means of instructing especially middle class children in how to behave.[131] The "image of childhood"[150] is said to be created and perpetuated by adults to affect children "at their most susceptible age".[151] Kate Greenaway’s illustrations are used as an example of imagery intended to instruct a child in the proper way to look and behave.[150] In Roberta Seelinger Trites's book Disturbing the Universe: Power and Repression in Adolescent Literature, she also argues adolescence is a social construct established by ideologies present in literature.[152] In the study The First R: How Children Learn About Race and Racism, researcher Debra Ausdale studies children in multi-ethnic daycare centres. Ausdale claims children as young as three have already entered into and begun experimenting with the race ideologies of the adult world. She asserts racist attitudes are assimilated[153] using interactions children have with books as an example of how children internalize what they encounter in real life.[154]
