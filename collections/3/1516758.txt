A stoneless avocado, marketed as a "cocktail avocado," which does not contain a pit, is available on a limited basis. They are five to eight centimetres long; the whole fruit may be eaten, including the skin. It is produced from an unpollinated blossom in which the seed does not develop.[46] Seedless avocados regularly appear on trees.[47] Known in the avocado industry as "cukes", they are usually discarded commercially due to their small size.[48]
