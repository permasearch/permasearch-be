In 2011, Chorley Council launched an initiative, "Choose Chorley", to encourage SME's and large businesses to relocate to Chorley. The website at www.choosechorley.co.uk was launched in 2014, after the domain name was acquired from Chorley-based web design agency, NRD media. The initiative offers red carpet introductions to key people in the town, financial incentives and tailored support for business growth.[33]
