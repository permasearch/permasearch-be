The listed heights are the architectural heights of the building, which means flagpoles, antennae and other pure functional elements are excluded. Only finished buildings are listed. The Dom Tower of Utrecht, that is 112 metres tall, is excluded as well, because less than fifty percent of its height is occupied by usable floors.
