It would be 17 long years before North Sydney made the finals series again when they finished 3rd in the 1982 season.  North Sydney were coached that year by the great Ron Willey.  Norths were knocked out of the finals series that year in consecutive games, firstly losing to Manly and then Eastern Suburbs the following week.  In 1986, North Sydney made the finals series again, this time they were eliminated by Balmain in the first week.[12]
