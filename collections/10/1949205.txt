Din's attendant, Impa, tells Link that they were headed for Hyrule; she instructs him to see the Maku Tree in Horon Village, the capital of Holodrum.[3] Link finds a sword in a cave and makes his way to the tree. The Maku Tree tells Link he will need the eight Essences of Nature and gives him the Gnarled Key, which unlocks the dungeon holding the first Essence. Link retrieves the eight Essences, hidden in eight dungeons throughout Holodrum and Subrosia, and brings them to the Maku Tree. The Maku Tree uses them to create a Huge Maku Seed, a sacred seed that cleanses evil, which allows Link to enter Onox's castle.[4] Link enters the castle, defeats Onox, and rescues Din, who tells him that he is now a true hero and must face a new trial soon.[5] Twinrova, watching the scene remotely, states that the Flame of Destruction has been powered by the havoc Onox has wrought.[6]
