Only after the end of the franchise, David Simpatico, one of the writers, revealed Ryan's homosexuality, described he as a "coded gay" â€“ characters without revealed sexuality by the rules of the studios, a controversial topic when talking to children and teenagers.[19] Ortega based the character on his own adolescence: "I see a lot of myself in Ryan. Yeah, I knew I was gay in high school, but I didn't tell anybody".[20]
