Elastic-waisted soft fabric shorts usually worn as underwear, but originally designed for wear by boxing participants. In their current form "boxers" were introduced in 1925 by Jacob Golomb (founder of the sports equipment and clothing company Everlast) as an alternative to the leather-belted trunks that boxers typically wore.[20] They subsequently became an alternative to long underwear as well.[21] Men's boxers as undergarments began to be presented in novelty prints and patterns from the late 1950s onwards.[22] During the 1980s and 1990s women began to wear boxer shorts paired with T-shirts as loungewear or sleepwear.[23] Boxer briefs, which emerged in the 1990s, are an underwear-specific variation on boxer shorts, but made from elastic knit fabric for a snug fit.[24]
