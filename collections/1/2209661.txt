Pension trusts are the most economically significant kind of trust, as they compose over £1 trillion worth of retirement savings in the UK.[118] Partly because of this, and also because occupational pension savers pay for their retirement through their work, the regulation of pensions differs considerable from general trust law.[119] The interpretation and construction of a pension trust deed must comply with the basic term of mutual trust and confidence in the employment relationship.[120] Employees are entitled to be informed by their employer about how to make the best of their pension rights.[121] Moreover, workers must be treated equally, on grounds of gender or otherwise, in their pension entitlements.[122] The management of a pension trust must be partly codetermined by the pension beneficiaries, so that a minimum of one third of a trustee board are elected or "member nominated trustees".[123] The Secretary of State has the power by regulation, as yet unused, to increase the minimum up to one half.[124] Trustees are charged with the duty to manage the fund in the best interests of the beneficiaries, in a way that reflects their general preferences,[125] by investing the savings in company shares, bonds, real estate or other financial products. There is a strict prohibition on the misapplication of any assets.[126] Unlike the general position for a trustee's duty of care, the Pensions Act 1995 section 33 stipulates that trustee investment duties may not be excluded by the trust deed.[127]
