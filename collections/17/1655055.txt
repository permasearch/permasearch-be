The first type of definitions is well exemplified by Bellany's definition, according to which a pariah state is "A state lacking any significant soft power."[6] Similarly, The Penguin Dictionary of International Relations, defines the pariah states as "international States/actors which, by virtue of their political systems, ideological postures, leadership or general behavior, suffer from diplomatic isolation and widespread global moral opprobrium."[7] This definition, as the previous one, does not indicate what kind of political system, ideological posture, leadership or general behavior, is ascribed to the pariah state by the other nations.
