The Labour Party came into government under the leadership of Tony Blair in May 1997 after the electoral wipeout of the Conservative government, led by John Major; this ended 18 years of Conservative rule.[1][2][3] Having secured a landslide victory with 418 seats in the House of Commons,[4] the Party had a working majority of 179 seats,[5] and went on to win the 2001 and 2005 elections.[6] During its first term in office Blair's government introduced many popular policies, including legislation to establish a national minimum wage, reducing the length of hospital waiting lists, and devolving lawmaking powers to Scotland and Wales.[3] Blair also played a key role in the Northern Ireland peace process.[3] But his decision to commit British troops to the 2003 invasion of Iraq turned public opinion against him and lost him the support of some of his own MPs.[7] When Blair stepped down as Prime Minister in June 2007 he was succeeded by his Chancellor, Gordon Brown.[6] Blair's decade-long premiership had been a time of economic boom for the United Kingdom,[3] but Brown's tenure as Prime Minister was dominated by the global recession of the latter part of the 2000s.[8] Although commentators perceived Brown to have made some good decisions during the economic crisis, such as providing financial aid to several UK banks which found themselves in difficulty, his fiscal policy of borrowing and spending led to a dramatic increase in the country's national debt.[3][9][10] He was also viewed by the media as someone who lacked interpersonal skills.[7] Another major event that occurred during Brown's time in government was the 2009 scandal involving MPs expenses, which damaged the public's trust in politicians.[3]
