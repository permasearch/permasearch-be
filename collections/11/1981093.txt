The Marcellus is found throughout the Allegheny Plateau region of the northern Appalachian Basin of North America. In the United States, the Marcellus shale runs across the Southern Tier and Finger Lakes regions of New York, in northern and western Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, through western Maryland, and throughout most of West Virginia extending across the state line into extreme western Virginia.[23] The Marcellus bedrock in eastern Pennsylvania[24] extends across the Delaware River into extreme western New Jersey.[1] It also exists in the subsurface of a small portion of Kentucky and Tennessee.[25] Below Lake Erie, it can be found crossing the border into Canada, where it stretches between Port Stanley and Long Point to St. Thomas in southern Ontario.
