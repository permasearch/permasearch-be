First settled in 1763, Northwood was incorporated on February 6, 1773 by Colonial Governor John Wentworth, when a large tract of land called "North Woods" was separated from Nottingham. Around 1800, the Portsmouth to Concord Turnpike was built, and the town began to prosper. Numerous taverns accommodated sledge and stage passengers. At one time,[when?] there were some twelve sawmills in the town, five of which were replaced by shoe factories during the latter half of the 19th century.[citation needed] By 1920, however, the last shoe factory had closed. More recently,[when?] the town has been a popular vacation spot, being home to nine lakes and many antique shops.[citation needed]
