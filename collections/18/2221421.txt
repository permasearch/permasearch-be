Parts of the Dingo Fence are lit at night by 86 mm (3.4 in) cold cathode fluorescent lamps which are alternately red and white. They are powered by long life batteries which are charged by photovoltaic cells during the day.[7] At minor and farm crossings, a series of gates allow vehicles to pass through the fence.[8] Where the fence intersects major roads and highways, cattle grids are used to allow high-speed vehicles through.
