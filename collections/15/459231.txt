The battle is alluded to in William Shakespeare's Henry VI, Part 3 (1595).[98] The end of Act V, scene one depicts the events leading up to the battle; scenes two and three portray the conclusion, in which the characters discuss the combat and the fates of its participants. Shakespeare uses few details reported by contemporary chroniclers and ignores notable incidents, such as the confusion over Oxford's and Edward's badges.[99] His play is based mostly on poetic and dramatic sources. In the play, Montagu is killed while trying to save his brother (Shakespeare's source material included Hall's 1548 The Union of the Two Noble and Illustrate Famelies of Lancastre and Yorke),[100][101] and Warwick is dragged in by Edward IV and left to speak his dying words to Oxford and Somerset.[102] Warwick's death dominates the scenes, reflecting Hall's vivid portrayal of the earl's passing as a valiant death.[103] Furthermore, whereas several chronicles mention Edward's desire to capture Warwick, Shakespeare has the Yorkist king lustily demand Warwick's skin.[101]
