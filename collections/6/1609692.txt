Cholesterol binds to and affects the gating of a number of ion channels such as the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, GABAA receptor, and the inward-rectifier potassium ion channel.[58] Cholesterol also activates the estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα), and may be the endogenous ligand for the receptor.[59][60] The constitutively active nature of the receptor may be explained by the fact that cholesterol is ubiquitous in the body.[60] Inhibition of ERRα signaling by reduction of cholesterol production has been identified as a key mediator of the effects of statins and bisphosphonates on bone, muscle, and macrophages.[59][60] On the basis of these findings, it has been suggested that the ERRα should be de-orphanized and classified as a receptor for cholesterol.[59][60]
