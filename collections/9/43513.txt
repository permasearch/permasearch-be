Elimination: Colleen and Lacey were nominated. In a deleted scene included on the DVD release, the others attempted to persuade Carol to nominate herself in place of Colleen despite the latter's dreadful performance, hoping to ensure Lacey's elimination despite regarding Colleen as their worst cook, but Carol refused on the grounds that it could result in her being axed for costing her team the win. After Colleen and Lacey plead their cases for staying and before Ramsay could make a decision, Ji - who had admirably completed the dinner service in spite of her injury and was subsequently restricted to a wheelchair - announced to Ramsay that she wished to withdraw from the competition, fearing her physical state would be a hindrance to the women's success. She had lamented this earlier to her teammates right after the end of service. Andrea declared to Ramsay that a hobbled Ji was still far more effective than Colleen or Lacey, but Ramsay honored Ji's request and allowed her to leave, thus reluctantly sparing Colleen and Lacey from elimination. He then lauded Ji personally for her effort and her "phenomenal" performance, while allowing her to keep her jacket as a token of her bravery (this was the first time Ramsay had let a contestant keep their jacket, it became much more common in later seasons). After she bid a tearful goodbye to her teammates, and as she was wheeled by Andrea out of Hell's Kitchen, the men all rose and gave Ji a farewell standing ovation for her gritty performance. Ramsay then called on the remaining contestants to draw from Ji's perseverance, which, he said, demonstrated "courage at its best." Despite withdrawing from the competition due to injury, she got her picture burned instead of the traditional coat hook and burning sequence unlike Vanessa Gunnell from season 4.
