An elaborate series of foundation rituals preceded construction. A further set of rituals followed the temple's completion, dedicating it to its patron god. These rites were conducted, at least in theory, by the king as part of his religious duties; indeed, in Egyptian belief all temple construction was symbolically his work.[85] In reality, it was the work of hundreds of his subjects, conscripted in the corv√©e system.[86] The construction process for a new temple, or a major addition to an existing one, could last years or decades.[87]
