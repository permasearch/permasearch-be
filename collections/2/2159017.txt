Starting in 1980 the Air Coryell offense debuted tight end Kellen Winslow running wide receiver-type routes. Tight ends prior to Winslow were primarily blockers lined up next to an offensive lineman and given short to medium drag routes.[3] Winslow was put in motion to avoid being jammed at the line, lined up wide, or in the slot against a smaller cornerback.[4] Former Chargers assistant coach Al Saunders said Winslow was "a wide receiver in an offensive lineman's body."[3] Back then, defenses would cover Winslow with a strong safety or a linebacker, as zone defenses were not as popular.[5] Strong safeties in those times favored run defense over coverage speed. Providing another defender to help the strong safety opened up other holes.[6] Winslow would line up unpredictably in any formation from a three point blocking stance to a two point receiver's stance, to being in motion like a flanker or offensive back.[7] Former head coach Jon Gruden referred to such multi-dimensional tight ends as "jokers", calling Winslow the first ever in the NFL.[7][8] Head coach Bill Belichick notes that the pass-catching tight ends that get paid the most are "all direct descendants of Kellen Winslow", and there are fewer tight ends now that can block on the line.[7]
