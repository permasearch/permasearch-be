Australia has some highly venomous spiders, including the Sydney Funnel-web, its relatives in the family Hexathelidae, and the Redback Spider, whose bites can be extremely painful and have historically been linked with deaths in medical records.[1] Most Australian spiders do not have venom that is considered to be dangerously toxic.[2][3][4] While there have only been several reports of death caused by spider bites in Australia since the widespread availability of medical treatment, none have been substantiated by a coronial inquest since 1979. There are, however, no shortage of sensationalised news reports that fail to cite evidence of any kind.[5] A Field Guide to Spiders of Australia published by CSIRO Publishing in 2017[3] featuring around 836 species illustrated with photographs of live animals, around 381 genera and 78 families, introduced significant updates to taxonomy from Ramirez, Wheeler and Dmitrov [6][7][8][9]
