This constitutes a schedule where player 14 has a fixed position, and all other players are rotated clockwise           n 2         {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{\frac {n}{2}}\end{matrix}}}   positions. This schedule alternates colours and is easily generated manually. To construct the next round, the last player, number 8 in the first round, moves to the head of the table, followed by player 9 against player 7, player 10 against 6, until player 1 against player 2. Arithmetically, this equates to adding           n 2         {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{\frac {n}{2}}\end{matrix}}}   to the previous row, with the exception of player     n   {\displaystyle n}  . When the result of the addition is greater than     ( n − 1 )   {\displaystyle (n-1)}  , then subtract     (       n 2       − 1 )   {\displaystyle ({\begin{matrix}{\frac {n}{2}}\end{matrix}}-1)}  .
