The last week in Jerusalem is the conclusion of the journey which Jesus had started in Galilee through Perea and Judea.[53] Just before the account of the final entry of Jesus into Jerusalem, the Gospel of John includes the Raising of Lazarus episode, which builds the tension between Jesus and the authorities. At the beginning of the week as Jesus enters Jerusalem, he is greeted by the cheering crowds, adding to that tension.[53]
