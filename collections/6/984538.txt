Following the resignation of Sir Nigel Crisp in March 2006, a separate post of Chief Executive of the NHS in England was created, held by Sir David Nicholson. Following the Health and Social Care Act 2012 and the creation of the independent NHS Commissioning Board, known as NHS England, this post has evolved into Chief Executive of the new organisation. As of 1 April 2014, the incumbent is Simon Stevens.
