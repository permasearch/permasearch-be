Note that similar fact evidence is only permissible to resolve facts in issue. What is in issue will depend on the nature of the defence. For example, where the defence is an alibi, the presence or absence of the accused at the particular place is crucial, and similar fact evidence could conceivably be relevant. If the defence is self-defence, however, different considerations apply.
