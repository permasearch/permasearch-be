The notaries (tabelliones) appeared in the late Roman Empire. Like their modern-day descendants, the civil law notaries, they were responsible for drafting wills, conveyances, and contracts.[215] They were ubiquitous and most villages had one.[215] In Roman times, notaries were widely considered to be inferior to advocates and jury consults.
