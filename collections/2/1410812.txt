The final draft was nearly complete when his wife died suddenly in 1858.[3][4] Mill suggests that he made no alterations to the text at this point and that one of his first acts after her death was to publish it and to "consecrate it to her memory."[3] The composition of this work was also indebted to the work of the German thinker Wilhelm von Humboldt, especially his essay On the Limits of State Action.[3][5] Finally published in 1858 On Liberty was one of Mill's two most influential books (the other being Utilitarianism).[4]
