Arwa al-Sulayhi is still remembered as a great and much loved sovereign, as attested in Yemeni historiography, literature, and popular lore, where she is referred to as  Balqis al-sughra , that is "the junior queen of Sheba".[73] Although the Sulayhids were Ismaili, they never tried to impose their beliefs on the public.[74] Shortly after queen Arwa's death, the country was split between five competing petty dynasties along religious lines.[75] The Ayyubid dynasty overthrew the Fatimid caliphate in Egypt. A few years after their rise to power, Saladin dispatched his brother Turan Shah to conquer Yemen in 1174Â CE.[76]
