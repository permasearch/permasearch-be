As soon as the term "Cold War" was popularized to refer to post-war tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, interpreting the course and origins of the conflict has been a source of heated controversy among historians, political scientists, and journalists.[324] In particular, historians have sharply disagreed as to who was responsible for the breakdown of Sovietâ€“US relations after the Second World War; and whether the conflict between the two superpowers was inevitable, or could have been avoided.[325] Historians have also disagreed on what exactly the Cold War was, what the sources of the conflict were, and how to disentangle patterns of action and reaction between the two sides.[236]
