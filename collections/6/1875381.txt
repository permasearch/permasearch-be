"Stay High" has been described as an alternative EDM track.[200][210] Its instrumentation consists of a "soft" bass beat,[211] and Lo's "distorted" vocals.[210] Tyler Almodovar of Raver Rafting noted that the track "is relatively simple, with most of the focus directed at the ethereal vocals" provided by Lo.[211] For the remix, Hippie Sabotage increased the speed and the pitch of the original track, and reworked Lo's vocals.[210] Digital Spy's Amy Davidson said that the lyrics talk about a "decadent devotion to a night 'where the fun ain't got no end'".[212] Miles Raymer of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the remix shared "a similar theme of getting through emotional struggles with copious amounts of chemical assistance" with the original version, although feeling that the latter was "more bluntly honest".[120] In an interview with PopBytes, Lo told that "I just love how [Hippie Sabotage have] made a proper dance remix of the song, but it still has that darkness to it. Itâ€™s just the way that they used all the parts. They did a genius job on it."[201]
