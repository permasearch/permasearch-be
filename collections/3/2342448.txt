More than 250 Emergency Response Vehicles (ERVs) were sent to provide food and water to victims.[37] By September 11, 75,000 evacuees remained in 445 shelters in 19 states.[38] By that date, the Red Cross was calling for 40,000 new volunteers to relieve those who initially responded. Disaster response classes were training tens of thousands across the country.
