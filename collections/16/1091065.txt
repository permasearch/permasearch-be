The episode was also the subject of criticism for its portrayal of the September 11 attacks, in which Brian and Stewie go back in time to make the attacks happen again, ultimately resulting in a high five when they are successful (despite Stewie immediately remarking that would sound terrible out of context).[15] The Daily Mail reported on the episode writing, "Nothing is ever off limits for Family Guy and its creator Seth MacFarlane. No topic is taboo, not the Holocaust, not drunk driving and not even abortion, but last night's episode may finally have crossed the line."[15] Terri Pous of Time also wrote of the episode, "It sounds custom-made for a 'too soon' label, and it probably is. But avid Family Guy viewers live for "too soon" moments, no matter how sensitive the material."[16] Other news organizations, including Aly Semigran of Entertainment Weekly, also thought the show had gone too far with the reference.[17] Nellie Andreeva of Deadline also commented that it "squeaked past the Fox standards and practices department but is sure to raise as many eyebrows."[18] MacFarlane was scheduled to be on one of the planes that hit the Twin Towers but overslept allegedly due to being hungover.[19]
