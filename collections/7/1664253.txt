The features from a decision tree or a tree ensemble are shown to be redundant. A recent method called regularized tree[27] can be used for feature subset selection. Regularized trees penalize using a variable similar to the variables selected at previous tree nodes for splitting the current node. Regularized trees only need build one tree model (or one tree ensemble model) and thus are computationally efficient.
