The Targum[5] connects the name with the Persian word for "star", setareh (In Persian: ستاره), explaining that Esther was so named for being as beautiful as the Morning Star. In the Talmud (Tractate Yoma 29a), Esther is compared to the "morning star", and is considered the subject of Psalm 22, because its introduction is a "song for the morning  star".
