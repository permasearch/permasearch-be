The Mackenzie Mountains hold about 55% of the world's known reserves of tungsten.[citation needed] The mining town of Tungsten, site of the Cantung Mine is in the Mackenzie Mountains. Only two roads lead into the Mackenzie Mountains, both in the Yukon: the Nahanni Range Road leading to the townsite of Tungsten and the Canol Road leading to the Macmillan Pass.
