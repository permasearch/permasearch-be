Sky Sports covered the FA Cup since it first went on air as BSB's Sports Channel in 1990 alongside the BBC but has not broadcast the FA Cup since 2008 after both broadcasters were outbid by ITV and Setanta, after the collapse of Setanta Sky did not bid for the rights and went to ESPN UK. In 2014â€“15 the rights transferred from ITV/ESPN to BBC and BT Sport after bidding together.
