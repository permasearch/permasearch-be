Many scholars and critics distinguish between Wahhabi and Salafi. According to American scholar Christopher M. Blanchard,[71] Wahhabism refers to "a conservative Islamic creed centered in and emanating from Saudi Arabia", while Salafiyya is "a more general puritanical Islamic movement that has developed independently at various times and in various places in the Islamic world".[39]
