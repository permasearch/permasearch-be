The October 22, 2014 release of the Wainstein Report[146] alleging institutionalized academic fraud that involved over 3,100 students and student athletes, over an 18-year period from 1993 to 2011 that began during the final years of the Dean Smith era, marred "The Carolina Way" image.[147] The report alleged that at least 54 players during the Dean Smith era were enrolled in what came to be known as "paper classes." [148] In response to the allegations of the Wainstein report, the NCAA launched their own investigation and on June 5, 2015[149] accused the institution of five major violations (including lack of institutional control[150]). Sports Illustrated has since gone on to say, "The Carolina Way" is no longer shorthand for all that is admirable and salutary in college sports." [151]
