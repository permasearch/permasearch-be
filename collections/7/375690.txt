The fossil record of moss is sparse, due to their soft-walled and fragile nature.  Unambiguous moss fossils have been recovered from as early as the Permian of Antarctica and Russia, and a case is put forwards for Carboniferous mosses.[24] It has further been claimed that tube-like fossils from the Silurian are the macerated remains of moss calyptræ.[25] Mosses also appear to evolve 2–3 times slower than ferns, gymnosperms and angiosperms.[26]
