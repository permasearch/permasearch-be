The first box lacrosse match conducted in Australia came about as part of a fund raising appeal for the Queen Victoria Hospital in Melbourne. The Victorian Lacrosse Association was approached by the appeal committee to stage a lacrosse match as part of a multi sport carnival at the Plaza (Wattle Path Palais) ballroom at St Kilda on 1 July 1931.[14] After a lightning six-a-side (outdoor) tournament format was successfully carried out a few weeks prior,[15] it was decided to play six-a-side for this exhibition game between MCC and a composite team from other clubs, with players wearing rubber shoes and using a softer ball for the match.[16] Newspaper articles at the time suggest that the sport may have even been created in Australia, with P. J. Lally of the famous Canadian lacrosse stick manufacturing company requesting a copy of the rules of the game from the VLA Secretary.[17][18][19] By 1933, box lacrosse matches were being played in Adelaide,[20] Brisbane,[21] and Perth.[22] This new version of the game however did not overtake the traditional version of lacrosse in popularity in Australia as happened in Canada.[23]
