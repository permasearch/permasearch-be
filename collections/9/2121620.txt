Beckert sees a young girl in the reflection of a shop window and begins to follow her, but stops when the girl meets her mother. He encounters another girl and befriends her, but the blind vendor recognizes his whistling. The blind man tells one of his friends, who tails the killer with assistance from other beggars he alerts along the way. Afraid that Beckert will get away, one man chalks a large M (for MÃ¶rder, "murderer" in German) on his palm, pretends to trip, and bumps into Beckert, marking the back of his overcoat.[11]
