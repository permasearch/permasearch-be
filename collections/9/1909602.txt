The Sources of Soviet Conduct began as a private report prepared for Secretary of Defense James Forrestal in January 1947.[6] It was never intended as a public document. On the urging, however, of Hamilton Fish Armstrong, editor of Foreign Affairs, Kennan obtained permission from Forrestal to publish the article under the pseudonym "X".[6] When published, the article was not intended to be a statement of the government's official views of the Soviet situation. When it was revealed that the author was George Kennan, the connection to official policy was made, and some high-ranking officials, including Secretary of State George C. Marshall, questioned the approval for the publication.[6][7]
