While St. Simons Island was entering its tourism phase, Jekyll Island remained a private retreat for the rich and famous. After the Great Depression and World War II, however, the Jekyll Island Club and the winter "cottages" fell into disuse. In 1947, the State of Georgia purchased the island for the purpose of creating a state park.[56] Shortly thereafter, the Jekyll Island Authority was created by the state legislature to manage the island and develop a tourism business.
