The program had its own stable of performers, most notably Paul Revere & the Raiders, who served as the de facto house band. When the group departed the show in 1966, they were replaced by The Robbs and The Hard Times. Other regular performers on Action included the dance troupe Pete Manifee and the Action Kids. Individual episodes featured a wide range of guest performers, as detailed below. Tina Mason was a regular singer being promoted by Dick Clark on the show. She met and later married Phil Volk, the bass player for Paul Revere and the Raiders, whom she met on the "Action" set. They married on the second anniversary of the show's premiere, June 27, 1967.
