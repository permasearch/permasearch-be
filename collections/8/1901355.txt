In grammar, a complement is a word, phrase or clause that is necessary to complete the meaning of a given expression.[1][2] Complements are often also arguments (i.e., expressions that help complete the meaning of a predicate). There are indicative as well as non-indicative complements in languages. Non-indicative complements follow the appropriate complementizers. Indicative complements do not follow complementizers, but instead are included with special markers and clauses.[3]
