In a process called thrombolysis (the breakdown of a thrombus), fibrinolytic drugs are used. They are given following a heart attack to dissolve the thrombus blocking the coronary artery; experimentally after a stroke to allow blood flow back to the affected part of the brain; and in the event of a massive pulmonary embolism.
