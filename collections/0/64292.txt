Principal photography began on May 17, 2010, using 20 locations all within the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.[23][24] DreamWorks selected the area primarily due to tax incentives from the Pennsylvania Film Production Tax Credit.[14] The film studio also had a positive experience shooting She's Out of My League in Pittsburgh in 2008. The production was scheduled to last 12 to 13 weeks.[25]
