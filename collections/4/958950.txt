In the 1980s, the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP) formed a task force to study learning styles.[33] The task force defined three broad categories of style—cognitive, affective, and physiological—and 31 variables, including the perceptual strengths and preferences from the VAK model of Barbe and colleagues,[14] but also many other variables such as need for structure, types of motivation, time of day preferences, and so on.[33]:141–143 They defined a learning style as "a gestalt—not an amalgam of related characteristics but greater than any of its parts. It is a composite of internal and external operations based in neurobiology, personality, and human development and reflected in learner behavior."[33]:141
