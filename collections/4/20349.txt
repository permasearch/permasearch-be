The condition is diagnosed based on the history of the symptoms and a physical examination with confirmation by echocardiography.[4] Blood tests, electrocardiography, and chest radiography may be useful to determine the underlying cause.[4] Treatment depends on the severity and cause of the disease.[4] In people with chronic stable mild heart failure, treatment commonly consists of lifestyle modifications such as stopping smoking,[6] physical exercise,[16] and dietary changes, as well as medications.[6] In those with heart failure due to left ventricular dysfunction, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers along with beta blockers are recommended.[4] For those with severe disease, aldosterone antagonists, or hydralazine with a nitrate may be used.[4] Diuretics are useful for preventing fluid retention.[6] Sometimes, depending on the cause, an implanted device such as a pacemaker or an implantable cardiac defibrillator may be recommended.[4] In some moderate or severe cases cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) may be suggested[17] or cardiac contractility modulation may be of benefit.[18] A ventricular assist device or occasionally a heart transplant may be recommended in those with severe disease despite all other measures.[6]
