One of the most basic pharmacological strategies used in evaluating agents is called Therapeutic Index and can be applied in many ways. At the most basic level, Therapeutic Index is the ratio between the dosage which results in a given behavioral change for 50% of individuals tested versus the dosage which results in death for 50% of individuals tested. However, this applications of Therapeutic Index is only about basic safety. More sophisticated use compares the ratios for a variety of different responses,. E.g. dry mucous membranes for 50% vs. sleepiness for 50% within a group of individuals.
