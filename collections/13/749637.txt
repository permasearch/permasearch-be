The soul and the body are like salt and water, states the Upanishad in volume 6.13. Salt dissolves in water, it is everywhere in the water, it cannot be seen, yet it is there and exists forever no matter what one does to the water.[141] The Sat is forever, and this Sat is the soul, the essence, it exists, it is true, asserts the text.[133][134]
