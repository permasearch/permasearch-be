In the season 15 episode "October Surprise", SVU pursues Barba's childhood friend Alex Muñoz (Vincent Laresca), a frontrunner for the mayor of New York City, for indecent exposure and possession of child pornography. Although Barba is initially reluctant to aid in the investigation, he becomes more focused on doing the right thing when it becomes clear that Muñoz is guilty. Barba gives Muñoz the opportunity to "get ahead of it" by alerting him to severity of the charges, which irritates the detectives, particularly Detective Nick Amaro (Danny Pino). Barba is ultimately forced to bring charges against Muñoz, despite repeated warnings and threats from Muñoz, his manager, and Muñoz's wife, who happens to have had a relationship with Barba. A handful of details regarding Barba's early life was also revealed in "December Solstice"; it is mentioned there that he grew up in the Bronx and attended Harvard University on a scholarship.
