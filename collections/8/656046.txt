The Galileo craft made six close flybys of Ganymede from 1995–2000 (G1, G2, G7, G8, G28 and G29)[20] and discovered that Ganymede has a permanent (intrinsic) magnetic moment independent of the Jovian magnetic field.[83] The value of the moment is about 1.3 × 1013 T·m3,[20] which is three times larger than the magnetic moment of Mercury. The magnetic dipole is tilted with respect to the rotational axis of Ganymede by 176°, which means that it is directed against the Jovian magnetic moment.[20] Its north pole lies below the orbital plane. The dipole magnetic field created by this permanent moment has a strength of 719 ± 2 nT at Ganymede's equator,[20] which should be compared with the Jovian magnetic field at the distance of Ganymede—about 120 nT.[83] The equatorial field of Ganymede is directed against the Jovian field, meaning reconnection is possible. The intrinsic field strength at the poles is two times that at the equator—1440 nT.[20]
