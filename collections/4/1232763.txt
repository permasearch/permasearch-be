Darren meets Jodie Gold (Kylie Babbington), and the two start a relationship. Darren and his flatmate Minty (Cliff Parisi) plan to attend the 2010 FIFA World Cup final. Minty gives the tickets to Darren to look after, but they end up destroyed in the wash, when Darren leaves them in his pocket. An enraged Minty orders Darren to move out of the flat. When Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) hears that Darren is homeless, she convinces her father Max (Jake Wood) to let him stay with them. Abi starts to fancy Darren, and attempts to sabotage his dates with Jodie. On the first night that Darren attempts to get intimate with Jodie, she screams at the sight of his naked body, and runs away. Darren confronts her, and she apologises, but says that because Darren is not Jewish, and therefore not circumcised, she would find sex strange with him. Initially reluctant, Darren makes a call to book a circumcision. He does not tell Jodie he is having the operation and tells her he is going on holiday while he recovers. After the procedure, Jodie's father Harry (Linal Haft) mistakes him for Max and knees him in the groin due to Max's affair with his wife Vanessa (ZÃ¶e Lucker). The next day, Jodie sees Darren and tells him she no longer wants to see him because he lied.
