The fable of Arachne appears in Ovid's Metamorphoses (8 AD) (vi.5–54 and 129–145) and is briefly referenced in Virgil's Georgics, (29 BC) (iv, 246). Though both of these works are primarily derived from Hesiod and other classical Greek sources, the tale of Arachne does not appear in Hesiod, nor has any earlier Greek-language source for the story survived. Arachne's name means spider in ancient Greek.[131] According to Ovid, Arachne was the daughter of a famous dyer in Tyrian purple in Hypaipa of Lydia, and a weaving student of Athena. She became so conceited of her skill as a weaver that she began claiming that her skill was greater than that of Athena herself.[132] Athena gave Arachne a chance to redeem herself by assuming the form of an old woman and warning Arachne not to offend the deities.[132] Arachne scoffed and wished for a weaving contest, so she could prove her skill.[132]
