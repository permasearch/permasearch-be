The Knight is described by Chaucer in the "General Prologue" as the person of highest social standing amongst the pilgrims, though his manners and clothes are unpretentious. We are told that he has taken part in some fifteen crusades in many countries and also fought for one pagan leader against another. However though the list of campaigns, mentioned by Chaucer, is real, "and though it was perhaps just possible for one man to have been in them all, [it] is probably idealized."[1] Chaucer's portrait of the Knight in the "Prologue" "is generally thought to show a man of unsullied ideals, though some see him as a mercenary.[2] He is accompanied on his pilgrimage by the Squire, his 20-year-old son.
