Rather than acting as independent mechanisms, genetic and environmental factors often interact to cause developmental change.[30] Some aspects of child development are notable for their plasticity, or the extent to which the direction of development is guided by environmental factors as well as initiated by genetic factors.[30] When an aspect of development is strongly affected by early experience, it is said to show a high degree of plasticity; when the genetic make-up is the primary cause of development, plasticity is said to be low.[33] Plasticity may involve guidance by endogenous factors like hormones as well as by exogenous factors like infection.[30]
