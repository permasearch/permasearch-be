McCown completed passes to nine different receivers; four of them—Gary Barnidge, Travis Benjamin, Andrew Hawkins and Taylor Gabriel—had six or more receptions. He finished 36/51 for a career-high 457 yards with two passing touchdowns and a rushing touchdown. McCown also became the first quarterback in franchise history to throw 300+ passing yards in three straight games. The Browns ran the ball 25 times, with seven carries in overtime to set up the game-winning field goal by Coons, who is now 10-for-10 to start his career.
