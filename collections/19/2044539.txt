In her debut, Cortese impressed Peterson "even less than the old Ruby."[47] While Peterson was accepting of the sexual relationship between Ruby and Sam, she felt the "seduction came out of nowhere" in "I Know What You Did Last Summer." Contributing to this problem was Cortese's inability to "pull it off," making the "whole thing [feel] gratuitous and clumsy." Conversely, Peterson enjoyed the performances of actresses Anna Williams and Michelle Hewitt-Williams as Ruby's temporary hosts in the episode; the former was "great," while she found the latter "sassy" and "[missed] her already."[48] She "loved" Ruby's death in the finale, describing it as "a beautiful thing."[49] Similar to Peterson, BuddyTV's Williams considered Cortese's acting "a bit distracting," but noted she improved over time.[50] Steenbergen considered Cortese an "acceptable Ruby," but wrote that the actress' portrayal was often "too girlish to connect with the previous incarnations of the character."[51] In contrast to Williams, Steenbergen felt that Cortese "seemed out of her depth in the acting department" towards the end of the season.[52] Ruby's seeming betrayal of Anna Milton in "Heaven and Hell" would "have added some welcome layers to her character" in Steenbergen's opinion, but the character's true intentions made the character development "less exciting."[53] However, Steenbergen deemed Ruby's overall deceit of Sam a "great revelation."[54]
