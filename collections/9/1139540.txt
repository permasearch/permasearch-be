Their Wild Card game was played in Washington, D.C., against the Washington Redskins. Despite falling behind early in the first quarter by a score of 14-0, the Seahawks scored 24 unanswered points in the second and fourth quarters to win 24-14. It was their first road playoff win since 1983. They then travelled to Atlanta to play the Divisional playoff game against the Atlanta Falcons. Once again, the Seahawks found themselves down big early, taking a 20-0 deficit to the locker room at halftime. A frantic fourth-quarter comeback allowed them to take the lead 28-27 with less than a minute to go in the game, but the Falcons were able to mount a quick drive and score a field goal with under 10 seconds left, and the Seahawks lost by the score of 30-28.
