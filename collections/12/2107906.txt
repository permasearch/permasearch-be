Tous les garçons et les filles is a yé-yé album that combines elements of rockabilly, folk, jazz and blues.[2][4] Marc Hogan of Pitchfork felt that the album "finds an enduring middle ground between rockabilly shimmy and Gallic introspection".[5] It has been noted for its simplicity, featuring a minimalist jazz percussion, prominent bass, and twangy guitars.[2][5] Stewart Mason of AllMusic considered the album to be "the '60s pop equivalent of Shaker furniture: free of ornamentation and exquisitely simple."[3] This distanced Hardy from the "bombastic" music of her yé-yé contemporaries.[4] John Paul of Spectrum Culture felt that, although Hardy's music has "its origins in the American girl group sounds and their trademark harmonies," it is interesting that it "[features] little more than this stripped down approach, allowing for her voice to ring through clearly without being saddled with superfluous instrumentation and backing vocals."[4]
