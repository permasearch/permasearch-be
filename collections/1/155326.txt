In the two clubs' very first meeting, the New York Titans hosted the Boston Patriots at New York's Polo Grounds. Al Dorow of the Titans erupted to three touchdown throws and led the Titans to a 24–7 lead in the third quarter. But Butch Songin and 109 rushing yards by Patriots runners clawed Boston back to trail 24–21 in the fourth quarter, then Chuck Shonta finished off the Titans when punter Rick Sapienza fumbled the snap. The ball bounced around wildly until Chuck Shonta picked up the ball at the 25 and ran in for a touchdown. The Titans complained that linebacker Jack Rudolph had kicked the ball, which was illegal, during the chase for the ball but the play stood.
