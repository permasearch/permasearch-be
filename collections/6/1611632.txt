Following positive feedback from supporters, in June 2015 the club decided to permanently change the official club crest back to a more familiar and traditional design. Today the crest is virtually identical in design to that which has been used for the majority of the club's history. The famous "star and moon" are both silver on a blue background and have a slight three-dimensional appearance. The star has the more familiar eight points instead of the five-point design introduced for the commemorative WWI 2014–15 season. The crest's shield retains the three points at the top but is in a more traditional shape. No words or lettering features on the club crest just like that which was used on home shirts the previous 2014–15 season.
