In 1950 William Hammon at the University of Pittsburgh isolated serum, containing antibodies against poliovirus, from the blood of polio survivors.[42] The serum, Hammon believed, would prevent the spread of polio and to reduce the severity of disease in polio patients.[51] Between September 1951 and July 1952 nearly 55,000 children were involved in a clinical trial of the anti-polio serum.[52] The results of the trial were promising; the serum was shown to be about 80% effective in preventing the development of paralytic poliomyelitis, and protection was shown to last for 5 weeks if given under tightly controlled circumstances.[53] The serum was also shown to reduce the severity of the disease in patients who developed polio.[42]
