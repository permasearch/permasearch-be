The usual explanation for fuel-rich mixtures is that fuel-rich mixtures have lower molecular weight exhaust, which by reducing     M   {\displaystyle M}   increases the ratio         T  c    M     {\displaystyle {\frac {\sqrt {T_{c}}}{M}}}   which is approximately equal to the theoretical exhaust velocity. Fuel-rich mixtures actually have lower theoretical exhaust velocities, because        T  c       {\displaystyle {\sqrt {T_{c}}}}   decreases as fast or faster than     M   {\displaystyle M}  .[8]
