By the time TV Asahi started broadcasts, The X-Files was already a solid performer at video stores in Japan with sales of over 300,000. When The X-Files first hit Japan, it was the No. 1 rated show in its time slot and had an average rating of 14.9% for its first season. It was the first American-produced series to succeed in Japan in almost a decade and the only U.S. program to have a regular primetime spot on a Japanese television network during its initial three-year run.[166][167]
