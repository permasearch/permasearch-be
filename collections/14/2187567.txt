Her earliest musical influences were her parents: her father sang choir at the Roman Catholic church; her mother played piano at the Presbyterian church. She attended Business High School in D.C.—which would later become Roosevelt Senior High School—likely graduating in 1924. Alarmed by his daughter's evident penchant for the stage, her father sent her to the George Washington University School for Nursing—where she attended classes for nine months between 1924-25—withdrawing to pursue a career in show business.[2]
