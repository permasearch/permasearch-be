Shortly after the Bash Angle interfered in a Guerrero match under the guise of a masked wrestler named "El Gran Luchador", but was exposed by the former champion. On July 22, 2004, WWE Chairman Vince McMahon confronted Angle, who was still using crutches and the wheelchair, demanding his resignation for faking his handicap. When Angle would not do so, McMahon fired him and began attacking him with one of the crutches. McMahon saw that Angle was completely healthy as he fended off the attack and thus put him back on the active roster and ordered Angle to wrestle Guerrero at SummerSlam.[38] Angle defeated Guerrero after he forced Guerrero to submit to the Ankle lock.[39] At Survivor Series their feud finally ended in a Four-on-Four Traditional Survivor Series Tag Team Match with Guerrero's team (composed by Eddie Guerrero, The Big Show, Rob Van Dam, and John Cena) resulting as victorious against Team Angle (composed by Kurt Angle, Luther Reigns, Mark Jindrak, and Carlito).
