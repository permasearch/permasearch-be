After her promotional activities ended in Japan, Carey flew to Hawaii for a three-day music video shoot from June 8â€“10, 2008.[61] The video was directed by Chris Applebaum and premiered on BET's 106 & Park on July 3, 2008 at 6:00pm ET/PT and on Yahoo! Music at midnight on the same day. It later appeared on Total Request Live (TRL) on July 7, 2008.[62] Aside from the video's original version, the remix also featured an accompanying video, with some additional scenes from T.I. Some of the scenes were filmed on the beaches of Hawaii, while some of the smaller parts were shot in Wet'n'Wild Hawaii. According to several reports, Carey was seriously injured on the set of the video during shooting on June 9. Carey's representative quickly denied the allegation, and said "She was so excited to be shooting in Hawaii. She wanted all her friends to come down and be a part of the shoot."[63] After watching the music video, Tim Nixon from The Sun called it "mouth-watering", and wrote "if she carries on churning out three-and-a-half-minute visual feasts like this, long may that continue..."[64]
