Tim McGraw spent the most weeks at number one of any act, with ten.  His song "Just to See You Smile" spent six weeks at the top, the most by one song, and was ranked number one on Billboard's year-end chart of the most popular country songs.[3]  The final number one of the year was "You're Easy on the Eyes" by Terri Clark.  Clark was one of three female vocalists to achieve their first number one in 1998, the others being Jo Dee Messina, who reached the top spot for the first time with "Bye, Bye", and Anita Cochran, who spent one week at the top with "What If I Said", a duet with Steve Wariner.[4][5][6]  Dixie Chicks also topped the chart for the first time, with "There's Your Trouble".[7]
