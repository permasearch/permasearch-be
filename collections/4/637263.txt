A small group of individuals continue to dispute the connection between HIV and AIDS,[277] the existence of HIV itself, or the validity of HIV testing and treatment methods.[278][279] These claims, known as AIDS denialism, have been examined and rejected by the scientific community.[280] However, they have had a significant political impact, particularly in South Africa, where the government's official embrace of AIDS denialism (1999â€“2005) was responsible for its ineffective response to that country's AIDS epidemic, and has been blamed for hundreds of thousands of avoidable deaths and HIV infections.[281][282][283]
