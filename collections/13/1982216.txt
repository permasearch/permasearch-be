The Spanish introduced slavery in Florida soon after they claimed it in 1513. Spanish settlement was sparse and they held comparatively few slaves.[34] But the Spanish promised freedom to refugee slaves from the English South Carolina and Georgia colonies, in order to destabilize English settlement. If the slaves converted to Catholicism and agreed to serve in a militia for Spain, they could become Spanish citizens. By 1730 the black settlement known as Fort Mose developed near St. Augustine and was later fortified. There were two known Fort Mose sites in the eighteenth century, and the men helped defend St. Augustine against the British. It is "the only known free black town in the present-day southern United States that a European colonial government sponsored.[35] The Fort Mose Site, today a National Historic Landmark, is the location of the second Fort Mose."[35] During the nineteenth century, this site became marsh and wetlands.
