Viruses are an important natural means of transferring genes between different species, which increases genetic diversity and drives evolution.[93] It is thought that viruses played a central role in the early evolution, before the diversification of bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes, at the time of the last universal common ancestor of life on Earth.[109] Viruses are still one of the largest reservoirs of unexplored genetic diversity on Earth.[75]
