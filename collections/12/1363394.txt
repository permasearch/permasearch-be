The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017) is set thousands of years after Ocarina of Time, though it is not specified as to whether it occurs in the "Adult Link Timeline", "Child Link Timeline", or "Fallen Hero Timeline". Link awakens after a century in a stasis pod, and comes to discover that an evil force called the Calamity Ganon has been trapped in Hyrule Castle for as long as he had been in stasis. During the last century, Hyrule has fallen into ruin in the wake of the Calamity Ganon, as it has been largely reclaimed by the wilderness. Link learns that the Calamity Ganon has slowly been gaining strength, and that he must defeat it before it escapes the castle and destroys the world. During his adventure, it is revealed that Link was the Hylian Champion and Princess Zelda's appointed knight prior to his stasis. He was the chosen hero to wield the Master Sword to defeat the Calamity Ganon, but is nearly killed while protecting Zelda, which prompts to have the Sheikah tribe put him into stasis in order to heal him. It is revealed by Zelda that Link was the son of a knight in the Royal Guard, and that he rarely talks because he feels the need to bear the large burden placed on him in silence.
