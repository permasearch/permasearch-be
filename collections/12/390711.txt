At least 50 Challenger Drag Race Package Cars are being built to meet NHRA requirements. Engine options include a 6.1L HEMI, 5.7-L HEMI, and a 5.9L Magnum Wedge. Manual or automatic transmissions are available, and the rear axle is solid (not IRS). The initial run of the required 50 cars has been completed and over 100 of the "2009 Challenger Drag Pak" vehicles will be produced. Currently a 2010 program is being considered. "Big Daddy" Don Garlits bought the first drag race package car and has raced it in NHRA competition.[34] The prototype cars shown at SEMA were built by MPR Racing of Michigan, who continue to modify the production cars as delivered from Chrysler. Currently, the "Drag-Pak" cars running in legal A/SA trim are running around the 9.7–10 second mark at 130–140 mph in the quarter mile.
