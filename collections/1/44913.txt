Methodism came to the Caribbean in 1760 when the planter, lawyer and Speaker of the Antiguan House of Assembly, Nathaniel Gilbert (c. 1719â€“1774), returned to his sugar estate home in Antigua.[114] A Methodist revival spread in the British West Indies due to the work of British missionaries.[115] Missionaries established societies which would later become the Methodist Church in the Caribbean and the Americas (MCCA). The MCCA has about 62,000 members in over 700 congregations, ministered by 168 pastors.[115] There are smaller Methodist denominations that have seceded from the parent church.
