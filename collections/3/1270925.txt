"Three Little Birds" was released as Talbot's first single on 10 June 2008 in the UK,[10] and released alongside the album in the U.S. on 14 October.[11] Rashvin Bedi, writing for Malaysian newspaper The Star, said that "Three Little Birds" was her favourite song on Over the Rainbow.[12] The single peaked at number 3 on the Independent Singles Charts in the United Kingdom,[13] and entered the Billboard Hot Singles Sales chart at number 2, dropping to 3 the next week.[14] It then raised back to number 2, and, on the sixth week, reached number 1.[15] Talbot received attention from the British press because of the single's success, with the Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph attributing her success in America to her appeal to the Christian market,[16][17] and to the success of her videos on YouTube.[17] Talbot's father, Gavin, spoke about the song reaching number one, saying "When we received the phone call we were driving back from doing a round of radio interviews in London and Connie was asleep in the back of the car. When we told her she just took it in her stride. I just cannot believe that she is number one in America. We are all very proud of her. It is a big achievement â€“ people have just taken a shine to her." He also said it was "a big shock to hear she was number one. It is tremendous."[18] As of November 2008, the single has sold more than 250,000 copies worldwide.[19]
