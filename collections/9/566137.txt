Klimt undertook more extensive preparations for the portrait than any other piece he worked on.[22] Much of the portrait was undertaken by an elaborate technique of using gold and silver leaf and then adding decorative motifs in bas-relief using gesso, a paint mixture consisting of a binder mixed with chalk or gypsum.[39] The gold frame for the painting was made by the architect Josef Hoffmann.[40] Klimt finished the work by 1907.[41]
