It has been widely reported, with confirmation, that as of 25 August 2017, those going through the licence renewal process can expect significant delays, sometimes as long as eight months, before the renewals are complete. In July 2016 The SIA disabled their contact telephone number, which now advises people to contact them through the website. This is problematic as the SIA appear to have communication problems and are unable to reply to any messages sent.
