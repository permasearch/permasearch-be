Since the early 1970s Edward L. Deci and Richard M. Ryan[43] have conducted research that eventually led to the proposition of the self-determination theory (SDT). This theory focuses on the degree to which an individual's behaviour is self-motivated and self-determined. SDT identifies three innate needs that, if satisfied, allow optimal function and growth: competence,[44][45] relatedness,[46] and autonomy.[47][48]
