Critics generally responded with positive reviews, garnering an 82% on Rotten Tomatoes. The two lead performances received rave reviews, particularly Witherspoon's, whose performance is described by critics as her best work to date. Roger Ebert praised Witherspoon for her "boundless energy" and predicted her to win the Academy Award for Best Actress.[6][7] In her review for the Los Angeles Times, Carina Chocano wrote, "Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon do first-rate work â€” they sing, they twang, they play new-to-them instruments, they crackle with wit and charisma, and they give off so much sexual heat it's a wonder they don't burst into flames".[8]
