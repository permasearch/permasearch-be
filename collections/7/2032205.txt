When courting an estrous female, a male pronghorn approaches her while softly vocalizing[30] and waving his head side to side, displaying his cheek patches.[34] The scent glands on the pronghorn are on either side of the jaw, between the hooves, and on the rump.[17] A receptive female remains motionless, sniffs his scent gland, and then allows the male to mount her.[30][35]
