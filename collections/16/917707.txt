The Catholics founded numerous colleges for women. The first was the College of Notre Dame of Maryland, which opened elementary and secondary schools in Baltimore in 1873 and a four-year college in 1895. It added graduate programs in the 1980s that accepted men and is now Notre Dame of Maryland University.[27] Another 42 women's colleges opened by 1925; by 1955, there were 116 Catholic colleges for women. Most—but not all most of them—went co-ed, merged or closed after 1970.[28]
