Neverwinter Nights was named the best computer role-playing game of 2002 by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences (AIAS),[56] PC Gamer US and GameSpot.[57][58] RPG Vault declared it "Product of the Year",[59] while Computer Games Magazine ranked it the year's second-best computer game across all genres. The latter publication's editors wrote that the "single-player game is merely passable", but they highly praised Neverwinter Nights' content-creation tools, and argued that the game is "what computer role-playing games should have been all along".[60]
