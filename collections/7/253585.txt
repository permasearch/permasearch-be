A musical phrase from the act 1 trio of The Marriage of Figaro (where Basilio sings Così fan tutte le belle) was later reused, by Mozart, in the overture to his opera Così fan tutte.[37] Mozart also quotes Figaro's aria Non più andrai in the second act of his opera Don Giovanni; it is also used as a military march. Further, Mozart used it in 1791 in his Five Contredanses, K. 609, No. 1. Mozart reused the music of the Agnus Dei of his earlier Krönungsmesse (Coronation Mass) for the Countess' Dove sono, in C major instead of the original F major.[38] Mozart also reused the motif that begins his early bassoon concerto in another aria sung by the Countess, Porgi, amor.[citation needed] Franz Liszt quoted the opera in his Fantasy on Themes from Mozart's Marriage of Figaro and Don Giovanni.
