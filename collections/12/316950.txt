In December 2013, Costa Rica was drawn in Group D against Italy, England, and Uruguay. Costa Rica were widely perceived as minnows who had no hope in a group against three former World Cup champion nations. They were given extremely unlikely odds of 2500 to 1 to win the tournament. Amazingly, they ended up topping the group with two wins against Uruguay and Italy and a 0–0 draw with England. In the round of 16 they beat Greece 5–3 on penalties after a 1–1 draw,  seeing them through to the quarterfinals for the first time ever. At the quarterfinals, the Costa Ricans fought the Netherlands to a 0–0 draw after extra time; the game then went to penalties in which Costa Rica lost 4–3 to the Netherlands. After the tournament, Costa Rica rose 12 places in the FIFA World Rankings, reaching 16th place. In an interview by former Federation member Farabundo Fidel Calderón cited their long journey, started in 2007, as the reason of their achievement.[7]
