During the September 11 terrorist attacks, as the first World Trade Center tower collapsed, people took refuge from the massive debris cloud inside the church. Falling wreckage from the collapsing tower knocked over a giant sycamore tree that had stood for nearly a century in the churchyard of St. Paul's Chapel, which is part of Trinity Church's parish and is located several blocks north of Trinity Church. Sculptor Steve Tobin used its roots as the base for a bronze sculpture titled Trinity Root, which stood in front of the church at the corner of Wall Street and Broadway until December, 2015 when it was moved by the church to its conference center in Connecticut. The move was controversial as it seriously damaged the sculpture, and the artist has objected to its eviction.[16]
