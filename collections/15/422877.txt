New York City is home to hundreds of cultural institutions and historic sites, many of which are internationally known. Museum Mile is the name for a section of Fifth Avenue running from 82nd to 105th streets on the Upper East Side of Manhattan,[437] in an area sometimes called Upper Carnegie Hill.[438] The Mile, which contains one of the densest displays of culture in the world, is actually three blocks longer than one mile (1.6Â km). Ten museums occupy the length of this section of Fifth Avenue.[439] The tenth museum, the Museum for African Art, joined the ensemble in 2009, although its museum at 110th Street, the first new museum constructed on the Mile since the Guggenheim in 1959,[440] opened in late 2012. In addition to other programming, the museums collaborate for the annual Museum Mile Festival, held each year in June, to promote the museums and increase visitation.[441] Many of the world's most lucrative art auctions are held in New York City.[442][443]
