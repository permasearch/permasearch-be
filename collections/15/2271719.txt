In October 2010, forty-four years after the initial airing of It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown, the pumpkin was the topic of a licensed use by the children's internet site Poptropica. The site's 15th quest (island) is "Great Pumpkin Island", and features several of the Peanuts characters interacting with the avatars of Poptropica players.[20] Again, the Great Pumpkin never appears.
