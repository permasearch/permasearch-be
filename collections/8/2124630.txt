To date, the Fred Walecki tribute concert appearance in 2000 represents the last time that the Byrds have performed together.  However, Hillman and Crosby both expressed interest in working with McGuinn again on future Byrds projects, but the lead guitarist and head Byrd remains adamant that he is not interested in another band reunion.[261]  During an interview with music journalist John Nork, McGuinn replied "absolutely not," when asked if he had any plans to revive the Byrds, explaining, "No, I don't want to do that. I just want to be a solo artist. The Byrds are well documented. I don't think we need anymore from the Byrds."[261]
