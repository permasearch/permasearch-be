The club's theme song, "See the Bombers Fly Up", was written c. 1959 by Kevin Andrews and is based on the tune of Johnnie Hamp's 1929 song "(Keep Your) Sunny Side Up" at an increased tempo. At the time, "(Keep Your) Sunny Side Up" was the theme song for the popular Melbourne-based TV show Sunnyside Up.[56] The official version of the song was recorded in 1972 by the Fable Singers and is still used today.[57]
