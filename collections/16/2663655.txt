The last chapters, from 6.6 to 6.7 of the text discusses Yoga and meditation, as a means to Vishnu devotion.[62][72] Contemplative devotion, asserts the text, is the union with the Brahman (supreme soul, ultimate reality), which is only achievable with virtues such as compassion, truth, honesty, disinterestedness, self-restraint and holy studies.[73] The text mentions five Yamas, five Niyamas, Pranayama and Pratyahara.[74] The pure and perfect soul is called Vishnu, states the text, and absorption in Vishnu is liberation.[75]
