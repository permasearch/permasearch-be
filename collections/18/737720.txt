The term cabinet projection (sometimes cabinet perspective) stems from its use in illustrations by the furniture industry.[9] Like cavalier perspective, one face of the projected object is parallel to the viewing plane, and the third axis is projected as going off at an angle (typically 63.4Â°). Unlike cavalier projection, where the third axis keeps its length, with cabinet projection the length of the receding lines is cut in half.
