Springfield's Amtrak station sits at the junction of lines serving Vermont (Vermonter); Chicago and Boston (Lake Shore Limited); and New Haven and beyond. Currently, Amtrak operates out of a self-built platform following the 1973 close of Springfield's grand 1926 Union Station. In 2011, Springfield's Union Station started a $70 million renovation to become an "intermodal transportation facility," allowing Peter Pan Bus, Greyhound Bus, and the PVTA to occupy a modernist space next to the rebuilt, 1926 Union Station.[128] The southern line, in 2014, began to follow the tracks of the more direct, former Montrealer route. The New Haven–Springfield Line is being upgraded for high-speed intercity commuter and freight rail. The project has received funding from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Federal Government and the State of Connecticut. The trains on the route between New Haven and Springfield will, it has been reported, reach speeds of 110 mph (177 km/h). The project is scheduled to begin service in January 2018.[129]
