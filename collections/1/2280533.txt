In addition to the ULS check mentioned above, a Service Limit State (SLS) computational check must be performed. As for the ULS, here also the SLS is not a physical situation but rather a computational check. The aim is to prove that under the action of Characteristic design loads (un-factored), and/or whilst applying certain (un-factored) magnitudes of imposed deformations, settlements, or vibrations, or temperature gradients etc. the structural behavior complies with, and does not exceed, the SLS design criteria values, specified in the relevant standard in force. These criteria involve various stress limits, deformation limits (deflections, rotations and curvature), flexibility (or rigidity) limits, dynamic behavior limits, as well as crack control requirements (crack width) and other arrangements concerned with the durability of the structure and its level of everyday service level and human comfort achieved, and its abilities to fulfill its everyday functions. In view of non-structural issues it might also involve limits applied to acoustics and heat transmission that might also affect the structural design. To satisfy the serviceability limit state criterion, a structure must remain functional for its intended use subject to routine (read: everyday) loading, and as such the structure must not cause occupant discomfort under routine conditions. This calculation check is performed at a point located at the lower half of the elastic zone, where characteristic (un-factored) actions are applied and the structural behavior is purely elastic.
