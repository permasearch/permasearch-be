James Kirby did not plan out making a record like An Empty Bliss Beyond This World, and the album was made because of "pure chance in action at all times."[5] The making of the album started when he shopped at a Brooklyn store in December 2010 and bought a ten-dollar collection of numerous old ballroom music records.[6][7] He wouldn't use the records for a while until he was in a Berlin flat, where he spent around a month tracking the vinyls by playing them on a broken turnable and transferring the recordings to a digital recorder he obtained while vacationing in Spain during the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallaj√∂kull.[5][6] Then, by the time he moved to another flat, he edited and mixed the recordings.[7] The artwork for An Empty Bliss Beyond This World was done by Kirby's long-time friend Ivan Seal.[5]
