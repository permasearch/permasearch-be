By 390 BC, several Gallic tribes had begun invading Italy from the north as their culture expanded throughout Europe. Most of this was unknown to the Romans at this time, who still had purely local security concerns, but the Romans were alerted when a particularly warlike tribe,[51][52] the Senones,[52] invaded the Etruscan province of Siena from the north and attacked the town of Clusium,[53] not far from Rome's sphere of influence. The Clusians, overwhelmed by the size of the enemy in numbers and ferocity, called on Rome for help. Perhaps unintentionally[51] the Romans found themselves not just in conflict with the Senones, but their primary target.[53] The Romans met them in pitched battle at the Battle of the Allia[51][52] around 390â€“387 BC. The Gauls, under their chieftain Brennus, defeated the Roman army of around 15,000 troops[51] and proceeded to pursue the fleeing Romans back to Rome itself and partially sacked the town[54][55] before being either driven off[52][56][57] or bought off.[51][53]
