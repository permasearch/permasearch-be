Meade told Warren to have his entire force ready to move.[100] By 9:17 p.m., Warren was ordered to withdraw from the line and send a division to Sheridan at once.[101] At 9:45 p.m., Meade first advised Grant of Bartlett's forward location at Dr. Boisseau's farm and inquired of Grant whether Warren's entire corps should go to help Sheridan. Meade did not tell Grant that the plan to move Warren's entire corps to Sheridan's aid was Warren's idea.[102]
