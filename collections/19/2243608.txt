Oliver uses his burgeoning medical skills at school when he performs CPR on Stefanie's Pomeranian, which quickly elevates his social status much to Kaz's chagrin. When Kaz thinks the popularity has gone to his head, he cuts Oliver down to size, literally, with a shrinking ray. Meanwhile, Horace cannot perform surgery on Citadel, an ailing superhero with an impenetrable metal exoskeleton. To perform the surgery, a shrunken Oliver is sent inside the hero's body to diagnose the problem, which turns out to be Micros, Citadel's arch nemesis. Elsewhere, Wallace and Clyde try to find Mighty Med and defeat Horace by placing a tracker on Kaz's backpack, but Gus takes Kaz's backpack by mistake while heading to the hospital and the twins inadvertently cause Gus' popularity to skyrocket.
