Originally recorded when the group was just renamed the Vels (from the Del-Phis), the song was one of the first of many recordings led by Martha Reeves; original member Gloria Williams was the groups lead singer up until this point. The song was intended for Mary Wells, but when Wells couldn't make the session, Martha, then an assistant and secretary to Stevenson, was asked to sing it in her place as a demo record,[3] and she recruited her groupmates Rosalind Ashford, Gloria Williams and Annette Beard to back her. The performance so impressed Stevenson and label president Berry Gordy that they signed the group to the label, decided to release the song as a single, and recorded another single for release, the Williams led "You'll Never Cherish A Love So True('Til You Lose It)" / "There He Is (At My Door)". But by the time of its release the Vels would become first "the Vandellas" and then finally "Martha and the Vandellas". Also around this time, Williams would leave the quartet, deciding that show business was too rigorous, making them a trio from then onward. The Williams-led single was released at the same time as this one, but on the Mel-O-Dy subsidiary[3] and still credited to "the Vells"  [sic].[1] Neither singles charted,[4] but five months later they would release their first hit single, "Come and Get These Memories".
