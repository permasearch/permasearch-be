Mary Dorothy Christian (née Perry, June 12, 1889 – April 20, 2003) was an American supercentenarian who became the oldest recognized person in the United States at age 113 upon the death of 113-year-old Mae Harrington and was succeeded in this title by another 113-year-old, Elena Slough. Perry was born in Taunton, Massachusetts to parents whose name had been anglicized from Perreira (she was of Portuguese descent). She spent much of her life in California, where she died in a San Pablo, California nursing home at 113 years and 312 days.[67][92]
