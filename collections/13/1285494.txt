Henry's succession plans were thrown into chaos by the sinking of the White Ship on 25 November 1120.[260] Henry had left the port of Barfleur for England in the early evening, leaving William Adelin and many of the younger members of the court to follow on that night in a separate vessel, the White Ship.[261] Both the crew and passengers were drunk and, just outside the harbour, the ship hit a submerged rock.[262][nb 26] The ship sank, killing as many as 300 people, with only one survivor, a butcher from Rouen.[262] Henry's court was initially too scared to report William's death to the King. When he was finally told, he collapsed with grief.[264]
