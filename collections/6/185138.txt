Gardner was killed in a motorcycle accident about two miles from his home in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania on Tuesday, September 14, 1982. State Police said that at about 2:30 pm Gardner completed a curve on Route 92 about 3 mi (4.8 km) north of Oakland (41.986246, -75.601200). Passing the home of photographer John Wood, he lost control of his 1979 Harley-Davidson, went into the dirt shoulder, struck the guard rail, and was thrown from the motorcycle, suffering blunt force trauma to his body from his handlebars. He was pronounced dead at Barnes-Kasson Hospital in Susquehanna.[10][11] Gardner's fiancée, Susan Thornton, stated that Gardner had been drinking the night before the accident.[12] An autopsy revealed Gardner had a blood alcohol level of 0.075; the legal limit for driving at the time was 0.08.[12] Thornton also mentioned exhaustion from overwork as a contributing factor, and that the curve on Route 92 had been freshly-oiled gravel.[12]:267 The crash was four days before his planned marriage to Thornton.[12]:269 He was buried next to his brother Gilbert in Batavia's Grandview Cemetery.
