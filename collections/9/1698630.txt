As with his poetry, A Child's Christmas in Wales does not have a tight narrative structure, but uses descriptive passages designed to create an emotive sense of the nostalgia Thomas is intending to evoke.[11] The story is told from the viewpoint of the author recounting a festive season as a young boy in a fictionalised autobiographical style. In the first passage, Thomas searches for a nostalgic Western belief in Christmas past with the line, "It was snowing. It was always snowing at Christmas", furthering his idyllic memory of childhood past by describing the snow as being better and more exciting then, than the snow that he experiences as an adult.[11] The prose is comedic, with exaggerated characters used either for comedic effect, or to show how childhood memories are enlarged through youthful interpretation.
