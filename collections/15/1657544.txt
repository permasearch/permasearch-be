The principal statute regulating the selection, obligations and conduct of juries is the Juries Act 1976 as amended by the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008.[56][57][58] There is a fine of â‚¬500 for failing to report for jury service, though this was poorly enforced until a change of policy at the Courts Service in 2016.[59] Criminal jury trials are held in the Circuit Court or the Central Criminal Court.[60] Juryless trials under the inadequacy exception, dealing with terrorism or organised crime, are held in the Special Criminal Court, on application by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP).[61] Juries are also used in some civil law trials, such as for defamation;[62] they are sometimes used at coroner's inquests.[63]
