Among those considered for the title role of Django, Michael K. Williams and Will Smith were mentioned as possibilities, but in the end Jamie Foxx was cast in the role.[13][14] Smith later said he turned down the role because it "wasn't the lead".[15] Tyrese Gibson sent in an audition tape as the character.[16] Franco Nero, the original Django from the 1966 Italian film, was rumored for the role of Calvin Candie,[17] but instead was given a cameo appearance as a minor character. Nero suggested that he play a mysterious horseman who haunts Django in visions and is revealed in an ending flashback to be Django's father; Tarantino opted not to use the idea.[18] Kevin Costner was in negotiations to join as Ace Woody,[19] a Mandingo trainer and Candie's right-hand man, but Costner dropped out due to scheduling conflicts.[20] Kurt Russell was cast instead[21] but also later left the role.[22] When Kurt Russell dropped out, the role of Ace Woody was not recast; instead, the character was merged with Walton Goggins's character, Billy Crash.[23]
