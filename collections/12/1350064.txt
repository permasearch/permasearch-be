Although Bill's friends are often disgusted or frustrated at his stupidity and the number of times he has wrecked their plans, they were devastated when it appeared that he had sacrificed himself to save them when they were stuck on a military target zone, with Hank saying that he was a good friend - sweet, loyal, and brave. During their high school years as they have one last blowout in Bill's honor as he's being shipped off a drunken Hank stirs up a fight with a thug at a bar, but Bill intervenes and saves Hank. On some occasions, Bill will fight back, and relentlessly, if pushed enough; upon the words of a fraudulent and condescending doctor who would sarcastically and falsely told him he would lose his legs from diabetes shortly after diagnosis, and had toyed with Bill's social life and the friends he made along the way, he would exact a beating on him, alongside Hank.
