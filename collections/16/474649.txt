The species exhibits a single breeding season; mating occurs between June and October, with some local variation taking place between different populations across its range.[48] Historical observation, mark-and-recapture studies, and preliminary investigations of population genetics indicate the possibility of both resident and transient members of populations, and suggest a polygynous mating system.[57] Females are thought likely to become sexually mature in their second year, with breeding confirmed still to take place in animals over nine years old.[57]
