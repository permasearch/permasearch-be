In 1898, they got as far as Rampart before the Yukon River froze in place for the winter. Rampart was a friendly place, but far from the real action. They left with the spring thaw and headed for St. Michael,  on the Norton Sound, a major gateway to the Alaskan interior via the Yukon River. Wyatt managed a small store during the spring of 1899, selling beer and cigars for the Alaska Commercial Company.[173][174][175] But Wyatt's friend Tex Richard sent him a number of letters belittling Wyattâ€™s steady but small income in St. Michael as "chickenfeed" and persuaded him to relocate to Nome.[9]
