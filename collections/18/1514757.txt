In the 1987 cartoon, Shredder (voiced by James Avery), as Saki, is a member of the Foot Clan trained alongside Hamato Yoshi in Japan under the wise master Pasang. After Saki framed him for the attempted murder of a visiting sensei, Yoshi exiled himself to New York City, where he lived in the sewers with four pet turtles that were accidentally dropped down a storm drain. In the following years, Saki took leadership of the Foot Clan under his Shredder persona and met a trans-dimensional alien called Krang, who gave him advanced technology to replace the Foot Ninja with robots called the Foot Soldiers. Shredder secretly moved to New York, where he crossed paths with Yoshi after many years believing his old rival was dead. In an attempt to kill his old foe, Shredder dumped mutagen in the sewers. However, this instead mutated Yoshi into Splinter, who then started training the also mutated Turtles in ninjutsu to stop Shredder's rise to power from the city's criminal underworld.
