Raj then embarks on a search for Radhika. He discovers that she has changed her name to Shreya and has become a highly successful supermodel. After much effort, he manages to meet her and apologises. Shreya refuses to accept his apologies and tells him that if he really wants her forgiveness, he will have to work hard for it. To do this, Raj becomes her personal assistant and she makes him do all sorts of tasks, from cleaning to serving at parties. She tries to humiliate him on every occasion, but Raj remains firm in his resolve and continues to serve without complaint. She finally gives up and tells him how hurt she felt, alone on the day that was supposed to be their wedding. Exasperated, she tells Raj to give up his penance and go home. However, while Raj is waiting for his flight to Sydney, she arrives and tells him that she has realised that the root of her frustration was bottled-up hate against Raj that she no longer bears. She forgives him. Content, Raj returns to Australia, having completed what he had set out to do.
