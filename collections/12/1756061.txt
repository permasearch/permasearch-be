Many in America were not happy with the draft-card burners, or with the frequent depiction of them in the media. Joseph Scerra, national commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, spoke against what he saw as too much news coverage: "All of our young people are not burning up their draft cards. All of our young people are not tearing up the flag. All of our youth are not supporting North Vietnam and carrying Viet Cong flags."[47] In October 1967 at a rally in support of the government a news photograph was snapped of a man kissing his draft card, his girlfriend smiling at his side.[47] In Playboy's November 1967 issue, Playboy Playmate Kaya Christian wrote that her "turn-offs" were "hypocrites" and "draft card burners".[48]
