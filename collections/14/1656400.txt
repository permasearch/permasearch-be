Subsequently another hand-powered dishwasher was invented in 1887 by Josephine Cochrane with the help of George Butters in Josephine's tool shed in Shelbyville, Illinois and was unveiled at the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago, Illinois under the name of Lavadora but was changed to Lavaplatos as another machine invented in 1858 already held that name. This machine is what everyone now knows as the washing machine.[8][better source needed] Cochrane's inspiration was her frustration at the damage to her good china that occurred when her servants handled it during cleaning.[9]
