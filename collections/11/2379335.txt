The film was not without its detractors, however. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post, for example, notably gave the film a negative review. While praising Williams, he felt the film was "compulsory and condescending", and that the film was merely "a Robin Williams concert movie welded clumsily onto the plot from an old Danny Kaye picture."[10]
