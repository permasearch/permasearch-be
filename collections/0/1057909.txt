In December 2012, following criticism that it was insufficiently transparent about its finances, the City of London Corporation revealed that its "City's Cash" account – an endowment fund built up over the past 800 years that it says is used "for the benefit of London as a whole"[37] – holds more than £1.3bn. The fund collects money made from the corporation's property and investment earnings.[38]
