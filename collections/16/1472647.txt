When people first settled in what they called the Āryāvarta (or Madhyadesha), Allahabad (then Kaushambi) was an important part of their territory.[31] The Kurus, rulers of Hastinapur (near present-day Delhi), established the town of Kaushambi near Allahabad.[32] They shifted their capital to Kaushambi when Hastinapur was destroyed by floods.[31]
