The school began construction in 2010 on a new 81,000 square foot building, Wells Fargo Hall, which has completed May 2012. The five-story structure connects with Otterson Hall and features large capacity classrooms, conference rooms, a behavioral lab and the 295-seat J.R. Beyster Auditorium. Wells Fargo Hall also features an outdoor space adjacent to the J.R. Beyster Auditorium named Sullivan Square, in honor of the schoolâ€™s founding dean Robert S. Sullivan. Wells Fargo Hall is LEED Gold certified.
