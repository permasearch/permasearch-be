Jimbo is shown on numerous occasions to drive a Hummer.[5][6][7][8][9] He likes to place bets on local sporting events, such as elementary school football games[10] and boxing matches.[11] Jimbo campaigned in opposition of a proposal to change the South Park flag because the flag depicted the town's racist past. As a show of friendship with Chef, Jimbo agreed to a compromise with supporters of the change.[12] Jimbo has also publicly voiced his opinion on other occasions, such as when he was displeased with a fireworks ban,[9] and clashed with protesters of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.[13]
