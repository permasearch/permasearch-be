In the United States, the Rokes version of "Let's Live for Today" found its way to the head of Dunhill Records, who felt that the song would make a suitable single release for The Grass Roots.[1] The composer/producer team of P. F. Sloan and Steve Barri, who managed The Grass Roots' recordings, were also enthusiastic about the song, with Sloan being particularly enamored with the similarities that the song's chorus had to The Drifters' "I Count the Tears".[1] "Let's Live for Today" was recorded by The Grass Roots, with the help of a number of studio musicians, including Sloan on lead guitar, and was released as a single in May 1967.[1][2] The lead vocal on The Grass Roots' recording was sung by the band's bassist Rob Grill[1] and the distinctive "1-2-3-4" count-in before the chorus was sung by guitarist Warren Entner. The single version shortened the repeat of the final chorus, while the album version of the song extended the repeated ending of 12 seconds before the final fade.
