The episode starts with a crate falling off from a truck and into a cliff, where the wooden crate breaks and its contents start to glow. Bob has to go to court to contest a parking ticket, and borrows one of Mort's client's suit that was left behind in the funeral home. Meanwhile, Gene, who is demoralized when already failing a health assignment, discovers a talking toilet in the woods –  capable of warming the seat and telling jokes, among other things –  as he is on his way home. Gene shows his siblings the toilet, where he finds out that its battery is almost drained and needs charging.
