The song runs for three minutes and forty-eight seconds.[5] It has influences of R&B and hip hop.[1] The sound is backed by Grande's vocals, singing, "The light is coming to give back everything the darkness stole". The song contains a "jittery beat" that is used with quick drums and synths.[6][7] The song samples a CNN archive clip of a man who is shouting at former senator Arlen Specter at a town hall meeting in Pennsylvania in 2009 concerning healthcare ("You wouldn't let anybody speak for this and instead!").[8][9]
