High-profile opposition to the Vietnam War increasingly turned to mass protests in an effort to shift U.S. public opinion. Riots broke out at the 1968 Democratic National Convention during protests against the war.[232] After news reports of American military abuses such as the 1968 My Lai Massacre, brought new attention and support to the anti-war movement, some veterans joined Vietnam Veterans Against the War. On 15 October 1969, the Vietnam Moratorium attracted millions of Americans.[233] The fatal shooting of four students at Kent State University in 1970 led to nationwide university protests.[234] Anti-war protests declined with the final withdrawal of troops after the Paris Peace Accords in 1973.
