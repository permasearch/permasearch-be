Bertha Butterswagon, a small green runabout, watches Mack admiring his own reflection in a metal tanker truck. Leroy Traffik, a minivan with a mattress on his roof and a temporary spare as his right-rear wheel, passes a tired Mack just before the truck stop. He is seen with new tires from Luigi's during the film's epilogue.
