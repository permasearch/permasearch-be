Blumentritt wrote extensively about the Philippines, although he never visited the islands, corresponding with the then Filipino student and writer Jos√© Rizal, who later became national hero. Blumentritt's relationship with Rizal began at least as early as August 1888.[2] Blumentritt became one of Rizal's closest confidants although they met only once. He translated the latter's first book, Noli Me Tangere, into German and wrote the preface to Rizal's second book, El filibusterismo, although he was against its publication as he believed that it will lead to Rizal's death. These two novels are commentaries disguised as fiction which angered both the Catholic Church and the Spanish colonial government, and which eventually led to Rizal's 1896 trial and execution. Before the execution in Manila, Rizal wrote his final letter for Blumentritt.[3][4] Blumentritt reportedly cried after receiving the letter.
