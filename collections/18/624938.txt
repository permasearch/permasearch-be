Macaws have been demonstrated to fully comprehend the concept of object permanence at a young age.[41] They will even refute the "A-not-B error". If they are shown an item, especially one with whose purpose they are familiarâ€”they will search logically for where it could be feasibly placed. One test for was done as follows: A macaw was shown an item; the item was then hidden behind the back of the trainer and placed into a container. The container it was placed in without the macaw seeing, along with another container and multiple objects, were spread upon a table simultaneously. The specific container that the item was stored in out of the macaws' sight was one that the macaw had never observed before. The macaw searched this some, then another container, then returning to open the correct container to demonstrate knowledge of and the ability to search for the item.[42]
