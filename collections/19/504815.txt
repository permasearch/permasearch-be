The City has an oceanic climate (Köppen "Cfb") modified by the Urban Heat Island in the centre of London. This generally causes higher night-time minima than outlying areas. For example, the August mean minimum[49] of 14.7 °C (58.5 °F) compares to a figure of 13.3 °C (55.9 °F) for Greenwich[50] and Heathrow[51] whereas is 11.6 °C (52.9 °F) at Wisley[52] in the middle of several square miles of Metropolitan Green Belt. All figures refer to the observation period 1971–2000.
