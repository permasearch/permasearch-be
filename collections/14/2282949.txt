Students can join one or more of the more than 100 clubs within Johnson and hundreds of others that accommodate a university-wide membership. Clubs within Johnson range in interest from entrepreneurship to wine tasting to international affairs to skiing. The clubs invite speakers to campus, organize trips, social events, and help forming bonds between students of similar interests.
