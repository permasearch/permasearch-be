When the Vision attempts to defeat Kang by abducting his infant self and taking him to another point in time, Kang, split into increasingly divergent versions of himself by the fractured state of time, decides to 'counter-attack' by attacking various Avengers in their infant states. However, a possible future version of Kang saves key Avengers from his past self's attack by bringing them into Limbo until Hercules - the only Avenger immune to Kang's current plan of attack as nobody knows exactly where and when he was born - acquires an amulet from a former Fate that will protect him from Kang's assault. During a battle inside a temple in Vietnam, Wasp is sent by Vision to place baby Kang back to where he belonged. After that, Captain America devises a plan to defeat Kang. It's later revealed that Kang is now afraid of the Avengers, who are defeating every version of himself and will find him shortly. He then captures the Avengers and begins to erase them completely until he's defeated.[47]
