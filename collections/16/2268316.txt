Frank Oz performed Animal from his first appearance until 2000; in 2002 newcomer Eric Jacobson took over. In Muppet Babies, he was voiced by Howie Mandel (1984–1985) and by Dave Coulier (1986–1991). Animal was also played by Kevin Clash in Muppets Tonight and by Bill Barretta in MuppetFest (the first Muppet fan convention). Animal's drumming was performed by British jazz and big band drummer Ronnie Verrell.[10] He has had numerous appearances on television in advertising and even on a U.S. postage stamp.
