In September 1983, Simple Minds travelled to Monnow Valley Studio in Rockfield, near Monmouth in Wales,[16] for three weeks to work on some new material; Lillywhite accompanied them for the last two weeks to meet the musicians and suggest some modifications to their music.[17] This material consisted of around six tracks developed during a session the band had spent at a recording studio called The Chapel in Lincolnshire in January,[16][17] and other initial samples recorded in London's Nomis Studios before their performance at Phoenix Park.[17] At Rockfield, most of the tracks were dramatically changed, as they had begun as demos consisting only of work by Mick MacNeil and Charlie Burchill, with some drum and bass machine sounds overlapping.[17] With drummer Mel Gaynor now having fully integrated himself into the band, the songwriting was beginning to be influenced consistently from all group members.[18]
