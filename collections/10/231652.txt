Illinois requires residents who make purchases online or when traveling out-of-state to report those purchases on their state income tax form and pay use tax. In 2014, Illinois passed legislation which required sales tax to be collected by "catalog, mail-order and similar retailers along with online sellers... if they have sales of $10,000 or more in the prior year." Although the law went into effect January 1, 2015, retailers were given an additional month to comply with the legislation.[100]
