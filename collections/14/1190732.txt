Due to his intelligence, especially in sports, Jimmy is placed on the "Whack Your Brain" team after one of the contestants got sick with mono. Both Jimmy and Rick detest his decision, and Rick tried to go to Mr. Raditch to tell him to get Jimmy off the team. However, he is quickly dismissed by Mr. Raditch who says he can't force Jimmy to be friends with him, and for Rick to try to make a better relationship with him. Rick is discouraged by this, but he and Jimmy soon start to get along. Jimmy even defends him when Spinner, Jay, and Alex tried to bully him. Because of this, Rick mocks them and reminds them it was him who sprayed their cars. Spinner and Jay vow for their revenge.
