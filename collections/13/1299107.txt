Billboard gave the song four and half stars out of five.[18] Chris Willman Writing for Yahoo called the song "Pretty weird, and pretty wonderful".[19] Katie Hasty of HitFlix gave the song an A+ writing that the song "is damned near perfect." [20] Writing for Vulture, Lindsay Zoladz stated that "Swift revealed something even more promising: the cavernous, Antonoff-produced “Out of the Woods,” which seemed to herald an exciting, unexpected, and mature new direction in Swift’s sound."[21] Sam Lansky of Time praised the track stating, "It's the furious chant of that anthemic chorus, all breathless urgency, and the left-of-center production that help Swift perform the niftiest sleight of hand: Even with lyrics that include some of her most headline-grabbing autobiographical admissions to date, the most interesting thing here isn't who it's about, but rather, how different it sounds".[22] "Out of the Woods" ranked number 94 on Pitchfork's list of The 100 Best Tracks of 2014.[23]
