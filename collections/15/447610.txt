According to the Records of the Salem-Village Church, Parris spoke with Sibly (or Sibley) privately on March 25, 1692, about her "grand error" and accepted her "sorrowful confession." During his Sunday sermon on March 27 he addressed his congregation on the subject of the "calamities" that had begun in his own household, but stated "it never brake forth to any considerable light, until diabolical means were used, by the making of a cake by my Indian man, who had his direction from this our sister, Mary Sibly." He admonished all the congregation against the use of any kind of magic, even white magic, because it was essentially, "going to the Devil for help against the Devil." Mary Sibly (or Sibley) publicly acknowledged the "error" of her actions before the congregation, who voted by a show of hands that they were satisfied with her admission.[73]
