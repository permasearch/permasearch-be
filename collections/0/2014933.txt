At that time, the scientific category Juvenis averionensis was used, as a special case of the Homo ferus,[5] described by Carl Linnaeus in Systema Naturae. Linnaeus and his discoveries, then, forced people to ask the question, "What makes us men?" Another developing idea prevalent during the Enlightenment was that of the noble savage. Some believed a man existing in the pure state of nature would be "gentle, innocent, a lover of solitude, ignorant of evil and incapable of causing intentional harm."[6]
