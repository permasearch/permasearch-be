On October 30, 1960, Elvis Presley recorded a version of the song during the sessions for his RCA Victor gospel album, His Hand in Mine.[6] It was not included on that album, but rather was held back by RCA Victor and finally released as an "Easter Special" single (447-0643) in April 1965,[7] hitting number three on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and topping the Easy Listening chart for seven weeks,[8] the greatest chart success for Presley over a six-year span. The single reached number one on the British charts in 1965 where it stayed for two weeks.[9] It was later included as a bonus track on Presley's 1967 gospel album, How Great Thou Art.[10] The single was eventually certified "Platinum" by the RIAA for sales in excess of one million units in the US.[citation needed]
