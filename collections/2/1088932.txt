Alison informed the contestants that one person from each team would have to go home for a week and only their weight would count towards the team's total percentage of weight lost. She then told them that the person going home would be taking their trainer with them. Dolvett chose Conda to return home for the week, while Bob picked Daphne to return home, thinking that she has something to prove for her team. Back at the ranch, Kim once again leads her team without Dolvett, while Bob's team seems a bit unfocused, and they comment on how it doesn't feel right without him. The challenge for the week was the teams would have to squeeze every person on their team underneath a log by digging through sand. The winning team would get letters from home and a 1Â lb advantage for the person at home. The Red Team wins.
