The Faroe Islands utilize a special version of the Danish krone notes that have been printed with text in the Faroese language. It is not a separate currency, but can be exchanged 1:1 with the Danish version.[7] Monetary policy is controlled by the Danish Central Bank.[7] If Denmark does adopt the euro, separate referendums would be required in the Faroe Islands and Greenland to decide whether they should follow suit. Both territories have voted not to be a part of the EU in the past, and their populations will not participate in the Danish euro referendum.[8] On 5 November 2009 the Faroese Parliament approved a proposal to investigate the possibility for euro adoption, including an evaluation of the legal and economic impact of adopting the euro ahead of Denmark.[9][10][11][12][13][14]
