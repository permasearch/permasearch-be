Training and practice significantly reduce the vigilance decrement, reduce the false alarm rate, and may improve sensitivity for many sustained attention tasks. Changes in strategy or bias may improve task performance. Improvements based on such a criterion shift would be expected to occur early in the training process.[33] Experiments involving both audio and visual stimuli indicate the expected training performance improvement within the first five to ten hours of practice or less.[34][35][36]
