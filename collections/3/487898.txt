The company has drawn criticism for the expense of the dolls, which cost $115 without accessories as of December 2014.[31] Buyers can easily spend more than $600 for a doll, outfits, accessories and lunch in the company's store in New York.[32] Some aspects of the doll's characters and history have also provoked controversy. Some observers questioned why Addy, American Girl's first African-American historical character, was portrayed first as a slave (in later stories Addy and her family gain their freedom after the Civil War), while Cecile Rey, American Girl's second black historical character, was portrayed as a well-to-do black girl in New Orleans. [33] American Girl later went on with releasing their first African-American Girl of the Year, Gabriela McBride, who is portrayed as a dancer, artist, and poet.[34][35] In 2005, residents of Pilsen (a neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois) criticized a passage in the book associated with the Latina-American doll Marisol, claiming it inaccurately depicted their neighborhood as dangerous. A senior public relations associate for American Girl responded to critics saying: â€œWe feel that this brief passage has been taken out of context in the book."[36] The 2009 limited-edition release of Gwen, a homeless American Girl character, was also controversial.[37][38]
