When they get there, things go smoothly until the Giraffe and the Monkey, while cleaning the windows of the Duchess's bedroom, spot a burglar who attempts to steal the Duchess's jewels. The Pelican then flies in and catches the burglar in his beak, holding him prisoner there. Then the burglar keeps shooting which ends up puncturing the beak. Soon the police arrive to arrest the burglar, whom the Chief of Police identifies as "The Cobra", one of the world's most dangerous cat burglars.
