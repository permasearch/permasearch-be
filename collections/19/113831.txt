A dedicatory inscription from Smyrna describes a 1stâ€“2nd century sanctuary to "God Himself" as the most exalted of a group of six deities, including clothed statues of Plouton Helios and Koure Selene, "Pluto the Sun" and "Kore the Moon."[172] The status of Pluto and Kore as a divine couple is marked by what the text describes as a "linen embroidered bridal curtain."[173] The two are placed as bride and groom within an enclosed temple, separately from the other deities cultivated at the sanctuary.
