Kahlo’s identification with indigenous Mexican culture greatly affected her painting aesthetic. By using powerful iconography from indigenous Mexican culture, Kahlo situates herself in a tradition of rebellion against colonial forces and male rule.[5] The dead hummingbird which hangs around her neck is considered a good luck charm for falling in love in Mexican folklore.[6] An alternate interpretation is that the hummingbird pendant is a symbol of Huitzilopochtli, the Aztec god of war.[7] Meanwhile, the black panther is symbolic of bad luck and death and the monkey is a symbol of evil.[6] The natural landscape, which normally symbolizes fertility, contrasts with the deathly imagery in the foreground. Rivera gave Kahlo a spider monkey as a gift, thus suggesting that it could be a symbol of Rivera, especially since he inflicts pain upon Kahlo by tugging the thorn necklace hard enough to make her bleed.[6] Alternately, the thorn necklace could allude to Christ’s crown of thorns, thus likening herself to a Christian martyr, and representing the pain and anguish she felt after her failed romantic relationships. In line with this interpretation, the butterflies and dragonflies could symbolize her resurrection.[5]
