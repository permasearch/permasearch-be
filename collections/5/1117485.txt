In 1999, the West Fork experienced a massive fish kill that spread for 50 miles (80 km) for an estimated loss of 4.6 million fish (187 tons).[5]  The kill was traced back to Guide Corp, an automotive parts maker in Anderson, which had discharged 10,000 US gallons (38,000 l) of the chemical HMP 2000 into the river.[6]  Guide Corp eventually reached a settlement whereby the company would pay a total of $14.2 million in fines, penalties, legal expenses, and river restoration.  Many animals that had burrowed into the mud were protected from the chemical,[7] and by March 2000, some fish were naturally returning to the affected area.[5]  The Indiana Department of Natural Resources conducted a restocking program in October.[5]  The city of Anderson announced in 2002 that it would invest millions of dollars for improvements to its sewage treatment system. Ten years after the fish kill, officials with the DNR stated that the White River was in better condition than before the environmental disaster.[7]  Stones along the bank of the river are still bleached, however, and serve as a reminder of the chemical spill.[7]
