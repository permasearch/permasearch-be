The color of the bridge is officially an orange vermilion called international orange.[43] The color was selected by consulting architect Irving Morrow[44] because it complements the natural surroundings and enhances the bridge's visibility in fog. Aesthetics was the foremost reason why the first design of Joseph Strauss was rejected. Upon re-submission of his bridge construction plan, he added details, such as lighting, to outline the bridge's cables and towers.[45] In 1999, it was ranked fifth on the List of America's Favorite Architecture by the American Institute of Architects.
