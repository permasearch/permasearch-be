In late 2012, Tyler Perry partnered with OWN to provide it with scripted television programming. One of Perry's series, The Haves and the Have Nots has consistently posted very successful ratings and has set a preeminent record on OWN, providing the network with its highest ratings to date.[2] A March 11, 2014 episode of the series brought in 3.6 million viewers, surpassing the 3.5 million that tuned in for an Oprahâ€™s Next Chapter episode which was the network's previous highest rated viewing.[2]
