Reviews were broadly positive not only domestically (in India) but also internationally.[34] The film was discussed or reviewed in Newsweek,[25] Time,[35] the Washington Post,[36][37] The Public Historian,[38] Cross Currents,[39] The Journal of Asian Studies,[40] Film Quarterly,[41] The Progressive,[42] The Christian Century[42] and elsewhere.[43] Ben Kingsley's performance was especially praised. Among the few who took a more negative view of the film, historian Lawrence James called it "pure hagiography"[44] while anthropologist Akhil Gupta said it "suffers from tepid direction and a superficial and misleading interpretation of history."[45] The film was also criticised by some right-wing commentators who objected to the film's advocacy of nonviolence, including Pat Buchanan, Emmett Tyrrell, and especially Richard Grenier.[42][46]
