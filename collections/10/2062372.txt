On January 2, 2012, Citizens Bank Park hosted the fifth annual NHL Winter Classic between the long time division rivals New York Rangers and Philadelphia Flyers before an SRO crowd of 46,967. The game, which was televised throughout the United States and Canada by NBC and CBC, was won by the Rangers, 3â€“2.[34][35] Two days earlier on New Year's Eve, 45,667 had attended an alumni game played between teams made up of former Flyers and Rangers who had retired from the NHL between the 1970s and 2011 of which eight (four on each team) were also members of the Hockey Hall of Fame. The Flyers' starting goalie for the game, which was won by the Flyers alumni, 3-1, was Hall of Famer Bernie Parent. He had made his first on ice appearance since his playing career ended prematurely due to an eye injury suffered during a game against the Rangers played at the neighboring (although since demolished) Spectrum in February 1979.[36]
