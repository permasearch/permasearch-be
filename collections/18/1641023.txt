During larval development, an extraembryonic membrane surrounds each organism during maturation with the caterpillar host. A series of experiments performed by Giron and Strand proved that this membrane serves as the cue for kin selection; they demonstrated that attack rates were less common with kinship when the membrane was present. When the membrane was removed, attack rates between kin increased.[8] This study additionally demonstrated how the membrane functions as a cue for kin discrimination by switching the membranes between larvae. Researchers found that the soldiers were fooled into not killing relatively unrelated larvae that were encased by an transplanted membrane.
