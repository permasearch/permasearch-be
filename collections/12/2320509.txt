Hazard ratios are often treated as a ratio of death probabilities.[2] For example, a hazard ratio of 2 is thought to mean that a group has twice the chance of dying than a comparison group. In the Cox-model, this can be shown to translate to the following relationship between group survival functions:      S  1   ( t ) =  S  0   ( t  )  r     {\displaystyle S_{1}(t)=S_{0}(t)^{r}}   (where r is the hazard ratio).[2] Therefore, with a hazard ratio of 2, if      S  0   ( t ) = 0.2   {\displaystyle S_{0}(t)=0.2}   (20% survived at time t),      S  1   ( t ) =  0.2  2   = 0.04   {\displaystyle S_{1}(t)=0.2^{2}=0.04}   (4% survived at t). The corresponding death probabilities are 0.8 and 0.96.[9] It should be clear that the hazard ratio is a relative measure of effect and tells us nothing about absolute risk.[11][pageÂ needed]
