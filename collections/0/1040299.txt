Although the song's relatively modest initial chart success prevented Paul Williams from getting any more leads on Temptations singles releases,the fact is that "Don't Look Back" became a huge belated hit, because his dynamic performance of the song on the Temptations Live! LP received huge airplay by R&B DeeJays nationwide, and propelled sales of the album into the Top 10 of the Billboard pop album chart.[citation needed] Both sides of the single would receive a second pressing and the tracks remixed, with the following statements added on: "Taken from the album #G 914 The Temptin' Temptations." With the second printing, the sides were reversed, making "My Baby" the A-side, while 'Don't Look Back, the original A-side, was relegated to B-side status.[2]
