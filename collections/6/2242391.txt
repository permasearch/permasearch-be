While HSAs can be rolled over from fund to fund, an HSA cannot be rolled into an IRA or a 401(k), and funds from such investment vehicles cannot be rolled into an HSA, except for the one-time IRA transfer mentioned earlier. Unlike some employer contributions to a 401(k) plan, all HSA contributions belong to the participant immediately, regardless of the deposit source. A person contributing to an HSA is under no obligation to contribute to an employer-sponsored HSA, but employers may require that payroll contributions be made only to the sponsored HSA plan.
