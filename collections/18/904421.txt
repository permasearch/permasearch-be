Linda Fields & The Funky Boys covered a nearly identical sounding version, released as a single (7") in 1975 (credited to Linda & the Funky Boys); it was re-released in 1983 as a 12" EP. This version appears on several disco compilations and is often confused with the original. In 1974, The Rolling Stones recorded the song but never released. Tina Charles covered the song. The song was also sung on The Cher Show by Cher and Tina Turner in 1975. Polish-Swedish singer Izabella Scorupco recorded a cover version of the song in 1992 which was a charted hit in a number of European countries. It appears on an extended version of her 1991 album Iza. Also in 1992, the song was covered by British-American singer Sinitta. It was released as a single and peaked at number 28 in the United Kingdom. It was later included on her third studio album Naughty Naughty (1995). The A-Teens recorded a cover of the song for their album New Arrival (2003). Henri Salvador recorded a French version of the song, with the title "J'aime tes g'noux" ("I like your knees").
