One-act plays of Sattriya are called Ankiya Nat, which combine the aesthetic and the religious through a ballad, dance and drama.[5][6] The plays are usually performed in the dance community halls (namghar[6]) of monastery temples (sattras).[7] The themes played relate to Krishna and Radha, sometimes other Vishnu avatars such as Rama and Sita.[8]
