Documentary proof may be difficult to obtain, with the system requiring documents such as bank accounts, Insurance policies, driving licences etc. that themselves increasingly require an Aadhaar card to originate, or similar documentary evidence as an Aadhaar card.[151] This may lead to a significant minority underclass of undocumented citizens who will find it harder to obtain necessary services.[152] Introducers and Heads of family may also assist in documentation, however for many agencies and legitimate applications, this facility may not be practical.[153]
