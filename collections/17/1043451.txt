The required disk space may be easily allocated on systems with more recent specifications (i.e. a system with 3 GB of memory having a 6 GB fixed-size pagefile on a 750 GB disk drive, or a system with 6 GB of memory and a 16 GB fixed-size pagefile and 2 TB of disk space). In both examples the system is using about 0.8% of the disk space with the pagefile pre-extended to its maximum.
