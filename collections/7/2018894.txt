People can live long normal lives with the devices.  Many patients have multiple implants.  A patient in Houston, Texas had an implant at the age of 18 in 1994 by the recent Dr. Antonio Pacifico. He was awarded "Youngest Patient with Defibrillator" in 1996. Though today these devices are implanted into small babies shortly after birth.
