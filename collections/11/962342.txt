The word city and the related civilization come, via Old French, from the Latin root civitas, originally meaning citizenship or community member and eventually coming to correspond with urbs, meaning city in a more physical sense.[13] The Roman civitas was closely linked with the Greek "polis" â€“ another common root appearing in English words such as metropolis.[21]
