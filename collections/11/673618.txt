Alcohol sales were previously prohibited until 9 a.m. on Sundays. In 2013 an exception was made to allow sales starting at 6 a.m. when St. Patrick's Day falls on a Sunday.[7] But in 2015 the legislature revised the law again to allow sales on any Sunday starting at 5 a.m., the same as every other day of the week.[8]
