Later SoapNet aired reruns of the show seven days a week until 2013. The syndicated episodes featured the show's original music, unlike the DVD and Hulu releases. In 2015, Pop currently airs reruns of the show with two back-to-back episodes. The syndicated episodes that are featured on this network however, do not use the show's original music with the content mostly taken from the DVD releases.
