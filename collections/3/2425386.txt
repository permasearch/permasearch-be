While filling in for an injured Steve Kerr on a Los Angeles Lakers-Sacramento Kings broadcast,[17] Charles Barkley made disparaging comments about the age of referee Dick Bavetta.[18] The conversation between Barkley and play-by-play man Marv Albert eventually led him to comment that he could outrun Bavetta, and any other man of his age (Bavetta was 67 at the time).
