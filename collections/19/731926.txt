Ghost Rider had again been delayed to begin in late 2004, but the lack of a workable script continued to delay production.[17]  In January 2005, actor Wes Bentley was cast as the villain Blackheart, having been introduced to Johnson by Colin Farrell, who had worked with the director in Daredevil.[18]  Actress Eva Mendes was also cast opposite Cage as Roxanne Simpson.[19]  On February 14, 2005, Ghost Rider commenced filming in Australia at the Melbourne Docklands film studios.[20]  Then in March 2005, actor Peter Fonda (who starred in Easy Rider) was cast as the villain Mephistopheles.[21]  Johnson originally planned to film before an audience at the Telstra Dome, but instead opted to create a crowd using computer-generated imagery.[22]  The director also chose to film in the motorcycle district of Melbourne.[23]  By June 2005, principal photography had been completed for Ghost Rider,[24] which was set for a summer 2006 release.[25] In April 2006, the cast and crew performed last-minute reshoots in Vancouver.[26] Ghost Rider was originally scheduled to release on August 4, 2006,[27] but the date was moved three weeks earlier to July 14, 2006.[28]  Sony changed the film's release date once more to February 16, 2007 to help relieve the studio's crowded 2006 calendar.[29]
