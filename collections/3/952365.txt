A stationary front is a non-moving (or stalled) boundary between two air masses, neither of which is strong enough to replace the other. They tend to remain essentially in the same area for extended periods of time, usually moving in waves.[11] There is normally a broad temperature gradient behind the boundary with more widely spaced isotherm packing.
