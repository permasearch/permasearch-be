A large impact might have triggered other mechanisms of extinction described below,[100] such as the Siberian Traps eruptions at either an impact site[101] or the antipode of an impact site.[100][102] The abruptness of an impact also explains why more species did not rapidly evolve to survive, as would be expected if the Permian-Triassic event had been slower and less global than a meteorite impact.
