Socioeconomic status is measured primarily based on the factors of income, educational attainment and occupation.[121] Current investigations into the role of socioeconomic factors on child development repeatedly show that continual poverty is more harmful on Intelligence Quotient IQ,[122] and cognitive abilities[123] than short-lived poverty.  Children in families who experience persistent financial hardships and poverty have significantly impaired cognitive abilities compared to those in families who do not face this issue.[123] Low income poverty can cause a number of further issues shown to effect child development, such as poor academic success, less family involvement, iron deficiency, infections, a lack of stimulation,[124] malnutrition and lead poisoning due to lead paint found on the walls of some houses.[125] Child blood levels of lead increase as income decreases.[126] Income poverty is associated with a 6â€“13 point reduction in IQ for those earning half of the poverty threshold compared to those earning twice the poverty threshold.[122] That being said, children coming from households featuring continual or temporary poverty still perform lower than children in middle-class families.[123]
