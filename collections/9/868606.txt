The apportionment methodology currently used is the method of equal proportions,[1][16][17][18] so called because it guarantees that no additional transfer of a seat (from one state to another) will reduce the ratio between the numbers of persons per representative in any two states.[19] The method of equal proportions minimizes the percentage differences in the populations of the congressional districts.[20]
