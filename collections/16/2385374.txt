According to Ahmed, the game's music was an improvement over Adventure's "campy glam-rock and J-pop soundtrack", with less emphasis on lyrics,[2] and Liu appreciated its more "understated" approach.[59] Four-Eyed Dragon called the music "an eclectic mix of orchestrated masterpieces, guitar tunes, and melodic hip-hop voices gracefully fill the game's ambiance to a perfect pitch."[37] Reaction to the voice acting was mixed; although Ahmed said, "The voice acting, and the lip-synching in particular, is executed quite well",[2] Liu and Chau thought the English voices were inferior to the Japanese ones.[1][59]
