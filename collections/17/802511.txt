"Above Suspicion" was written by executive producer/show runner Warren Leight (with Julie Martin), who is promoted to executive producer, replacing Ted Kotcheff, as of this episode. The episode was directed by Michael Slovis. Ed Zuckerman, who was co-executive producer on the original Law & Order, replaces David Matthews. Ice-T announced on Twitter that filming on the fourteenth season began on Monday, July 23, 2012.[3] Leight said of the two episode premiere, "Where we got lucky was, quite by chance, NBC called and said they wanted two episodes for our first night back. They didn’t necessarily mean a two-parter, they just meant two separate episodes. Now we more or less had permission do a three-episode story, which is unheard of in the "Law & Order" world. So basically by the end of the day, we’ve essentially made a movie, a three-act movie."[4]
