In Japan, used cars are mainly sold at auto auctions by car owners and dealers. At auto auctions, owners are hidden from bidders while the auctioneers provide independent car evaluations called inspection sheets.[2] Exporters, acting as bidding agents for importers, use the auto auctions as their main supply.[citation needed] There are over 200 auto auction groups operating throughout Japan including JAA, JU Group, TAA, USS, and ZIP.[3]
