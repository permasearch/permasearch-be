For those whose RLS disrupts or prevents sleep or regular daily activities, medication may be useful. Evidence supports the use of dopamine agonists including: pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine, and cabergoline.[62][63] They reduce symptoms, improve sleep quality and quality of life.[64] Levodopa is also effective.[65] One review found pramipexole to be better than ropinirole.[66]
