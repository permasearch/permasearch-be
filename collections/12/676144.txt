In Poland, since the fall of communism, 1 May is officially celebrated as May Day, but is commonly called Labour Day.[55][56] it is currently celebrated without a specific connotation, and as such it is May Day. However, due to historical connotations, most of the large organized celebrations are focused around Labor Day festivities. It is customary for labor activists to organize parades in cities and towns across Poland. The holiday is also commonly referred to as "Labor Day" ("Święto Pracy").
