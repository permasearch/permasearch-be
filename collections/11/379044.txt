Much fine external marble has been removed over the centuries - for example, capitals from some of the pilasters are in the British Museum.[35] Two columns were swallowed up in the medieval buildings that abutted the Pantheon on the east and were lost. In the early 17th century, Urban VIII Barberini tore away the bronze ceiling of the portico, and replaced the medieval campanile with the famous twin towers (often wrongly attributed to Bernini[36]) called "the ass's ears,"[37] which were not removed until the late 19th century.[38] The only other loss has been the external sculptures, which adorned the pediment above Agrippa's inscription. The marble interior has largely survived, although with extensive restoration.
