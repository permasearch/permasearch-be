I have a different interpretation of the lyrics to that presented here. To me, it seems that the song is about a father who would like to spend more time with a son who finds the demands of life make it difficult for him to give time to his father; only after his retirement does the father appreciate that he was once like this. This is indicated in the final verse, and seems to be how the programme Something Understood took the programme.ACEOREVIVED (talk) 23:20, 12 October 2008 (UTC)
