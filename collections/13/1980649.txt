To save money for the production, Bay reduced his usual fee by 30%. He planned an 83-day shooting schedule,[22] maintaining the required pace by doing more camera set-ups per day than usual. Bay chose to shoot the film in the United States instead of Australia or Canada, allowing him to work with a crew he was familiar with, and who understood his work ethic.[22][24][32] A pre-shoot took place on April 19, 2006 and principal photography began three days later at Holloman Air Force Base,[33] which stood in for Qatar.[22] To film the Scorponok sequence at White Sands Missile Range, a sweep was performed to remove unexploded ordnance before building of a village set could begin; ironically, the village would be blown up. The scene was broken down for the Air battle managers flying aboard the AWACS aircraft, who improvised dialogue as if it were an actual battle.[22][34]
