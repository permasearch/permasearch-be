Starting in the third season, Hannah's look changes slightly. Her wig is shorter and wavy and her fashion changes as well (more boldly coloured). This is discussed on the DVD Keeping It Real in the bonus feature "Miley's Makeover â€“ Hannah Gets a New Look." Cyrus and her team describe the new look as an "'80s flavored style with the glitz and glam of modern fashion." It is also revealed in Super(stitious) Girl, as part of Wizards on Deck With Hannah Montana, that she started wearing a single pink glove during concerts and it is also shown in music videos like It's All Right Here and Let's Get Crazy that she does. It symbolizes how Hannah Montana is growing up as well. In season 4, she gets a new wig that's long again but curlier. Her style also is back to glam-country girlish style.
