In the United States, there is an Animal Welfare Act that was produced in 1966. This law protects animals in acts of research, transportation, and sale. Generally, animals are protected from any torture, neglect, or killing. There have been many amendments made towards this act to keep it updated. In order to be charged for animal abuse, there has to be prosecution and a trial. While there is only one act covering the entire United States, there are more current laws surrounding animal rights, which vary by state. Even though there are policies and severe consequences, the laws are not normally enforced with as much force or timeliness as regular crime.[36]
