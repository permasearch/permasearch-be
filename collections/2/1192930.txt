Local hard liquors include rum, Guaro, and coffee liqueur. The most commonly served rums are Ron Centenario, which is made in Costa Rica, and Nicaraguan rum Flor de Caña.[1][4] Guaro is a strong-tasting hard liquor made from sugarcane, similar to vodka.[4]  It is usually consumed in a mixed drink called a guaro sour, or by the shot.[1] The government created the brand of guaro called Cacique (meaning chieftain) in an effort to stop illegal moonshine manufacturing.[4] Café Rica is a locally produced coffee liqueur.[4] Last but not least, there is a traditional alcoholic beverage originally made by the Chorotega people of Costa Rica called Vino de Coyol (Coyol wine). It is made by fermenting the sweet, watery sap of the coyol tree, a spiny palm.[4]
