Arévalo was constitutionally prohibited from contesting the 1950 elections. The largely free and fair elections were won by Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán, Arévalo's defense minister.[99] Árbenz continued the moderate capitalist approach of Arévalo.[100] His most important policy was the agrarian reform bill passed in 1952,[101][102] which transferred uncultivated land to landless peasants.[101] Only 1,710 of the nearly 350,000 private land-holdings were affected by the law,[103] which benefited approximately 500,000 individuals, or one-sixth of the population.[103]
