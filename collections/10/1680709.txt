Some scholars disagree that the Bhagavata Purana was a socially and sexually revolutionary text, states Coleman, rather it may reflect a conservative ideology where women in the form of Gopis amorously chase the divine Krishna who is represented as a man, the liberation of Gopis is actually fleeting despite their praise in the text as the most blessed of devotees for love.[75] Many scholars, however, view the Bhagavata as a remarkably early literary work that questions and discusses social and gender norms in the 5th to 10th-century India.[75]
