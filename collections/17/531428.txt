West Sitting Hall did not exist when the White House was completed in 1809. James Hoban's original design for the White House had a flight of stairs, one against the north wall and one against the south wall, on the Ground Floor. These rose to a landing, and then a single flight of stairs rose to the Second Floor.[93] This left only a small area north and south of the staircase, which by 1865 was being called the West Hall.[99] In 1869, President Grant rebuilt the stairs so that the single staircase rose against the south wall. This left what space there was in a single rather than divided area, making it more useful.[69] The new space created on the Second Floor became the West Sitting Hall.[70] Considered part of the First Family's private space, the West Sitting Hall has undergone redecoration with every new presidency and is not considered a historic room.[103]
