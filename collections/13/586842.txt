The Metropolitan Opera in the US reports that the average age of its audience is now 60.[38] Many opera companies have experienced a similar trend, and opera company websites are replete with attempts to attract a younger audience. This trend is part of the larger trend of greying audiences for classical music since the last decades of the 20th century.[39] In an effort to attract younger audiences, the Metropolitan Opera offers a student discount on ticket purchases.[40]
