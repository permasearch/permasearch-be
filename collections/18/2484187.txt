Aguilera has reinvented her public image on numerous occasions throughout her career.[200] In the later 1990s, her then-manager Steve Kurtz marketed her as a bubblegum pop entertainer to capitalize on the genre's financial lure,[51] which earned her recognition as a teen idol.[201] Aguilera introduced her alter ego "Xtina" during 2002 and 2003, which presented an increasingly provocative persona.[202][203] During this time, she dyed her hair black, debuted several piercings, and participated in several nude pictorials for publications.[69] In 2004, Aguilera embraced a more "mature" image with retro-styled hair and makeup, which was inspired by classic movie stars including Marilyn Monroe, Marlene Dietrich and Mary Pickford.[80] This reinvention was named "Baby Jane" in 2006, an alter ego which was taken from the 1962 film What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?.[204] Aguilera received widespread criticism over her curvy figure from gaining weight in 2012.[205] She later received favorable media attention after a significant weight loss in 2013.[206]
