A collection of "ladies" or "mistresses", Po-ti-ni-ja (Potnia) are named in the Mycenaean scripts. As such, Athena (A-ta-na) appears in an inscription at Knossos as mistress Athena, similar to a later Homeric expression, but in the Pylos tablets she is mentioned without any accompanying word.[125] Si-to po-ti-ni-ja appears to be an agricultural goddess, possibly related to Demeter of later antiquity,[119] while in Knossos there is the "mistress of the Labyrinth".[126] The "two queens and the king" (wa-na-ssoi, wa-na-ka-te) are mentioned in Pylos.[127][128] Goddess Pe-re-swa mentioned may be related to Persephone.[119][125] A number of Mycenaean divinities seem to have no later equivalents, such as Marineus, Diwia and Komawenteia.[116]
