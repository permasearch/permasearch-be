The Indian Revolutionary saying "Give me Blood, I will give you Freedom", Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was born in Cuttack, whose House (Janakinath Bhavan) is now a museum, well equipped to provide details of his life-history. The medieval capital, Cuttack has a treasure to share with you, the Barabati fort (witnessing Gangas, Marathas and British), the silver filigree works, Katak Chandi Temple, Barabati Stadium, Qadam-I-Rasul and Dhabaleswar temple (having longest rope-bridge in India succeeded by Lakshman Jhula in Rishikesh). Eastern Ghats' highest peak, Mahendragiri, where Lord Parshuram is still in meditation, according to Ramayana and Mahabharata is in Gajapati district.
