On 1 October 2010, Langley Air Force Base was joined with Fort Eustis to become Joint Base Langleyâ€“Eustis. The base was established in accordance with congressional legislation implementing the recommendations of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. The legislation ordered the consolidation of the two facilities which were nearby, but separate military installations, into a single joint base, one of 12 formed in the United States as a result of the law.
