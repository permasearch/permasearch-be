Unaware of events on the ship, Kirk decides to access the neutralizer and test it on himself, with Noel at the controls. During the test, she tries to find out whether the device can actually implant new memories and emotions in a subject by playfully suggesting that a Christmas-party encounter between the two of them went a little further than it did. Adams appears, overpowers Noel, seizes the controls, increases the neutralizer's intensity and brainwashes Kirk into thinking that he has been in love with Noel for years. Kirk and Noel are confined to their quarters.
