The Falconsâ€“Saints rivalry is a divisional rivalry in the NFC South of the National Football League (NFL) between the Atlanta Falcons and New Orleans Saints. The series is by far the oldest and most established rivalry in the division.[citation needed] Founded one year apart, the Saints and Falcons were the first two NFL franchises in the Deep South (Washington, Dallas, and Miami being arguably southern but not in the "traditional" Deep South). They have shared some important players, such as kicker Morten Andersen (the leading scorer in New Orleans history), Bobby Hebert (who quarterbacked for both teams in the 1990s), and Joe Horn (the Pro Bowl Saints receiver who left for the Falcons in 2007). They have also drawn coaches from the same families, and even shared a head coach: recent Falcons coach Jim L. Mora is the son of longtime Saints coach Jim E. Mora, and former Falcons and Saints coach Wade Phillips is the son of former Saints coach Bum Phillips.
