The history of professional sports in Kansas probably dates from the establishment of the Minor League Baseball Topeka Capitals and Leavenworth Soldiers in 1886 in the Western League.[62][63] The African-American Bud Fowler played on the Topeka team that season, one year before the "color line" descended in professional baseball.[63]
