As a redshirt junior in 2010, Foles was the unquestioned starter. Foles led the Wildcats to a 7â€“1 start, including a victory against #9 Iowa on national television. Foles led the game-winning drive that ended with a touchdown pass to Bug Wright.[13] A knee injury in the Washington State game sidelined him for two games, but Foles finished off his junior year with 3,191 yards, 20 touchdowns, and 10 interceptions.[14]
