India is endowed with economically exploitable and viable hydro potential assessed to be about 125,570 MW at 60% capacity factor.[87] India ranked fourth globally by underutilized hydro power potential. In addition, 6,780 MW in terms of installed capacity from Small, Mini, and Micro Hydel schemes have been assessed. Also, 56 sites for pumped storage schemes with an aggregate installed capacity of 94,000 MW have been identified for catering to peak electricity demand and water pumping for irrigation needs. It is the most widely used form of renewable energy but the economically exploitable hydro power potential keeps on varying due to technological developments and the comparable cost of electricity generation from other sources.[88] The hydro-electric potential of India ranks 5th in terms of exploitable hydro-potential on global scenario.
