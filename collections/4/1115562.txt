The name Multi-channel Network has only recently begun to be standard, coined by former YouTube employee Jed Simmons (reportedly because of YouTube's distaste for the notion of "networks.")[3] Prior to 2014 many names were used by the different companies, including Online Video Studio, Internet Television Company, ITC, OVS, YouTube Network or simply Network.[4][not in citation given]
