At 18:00 UTC on September 19, a tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen, which was centered located about 520 mi (840 km) west-southwest of Cape Verde. Despite unfavorable conditions from being located near Hurricane Karl, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Lisa on September 20. After nearly reaching hurricane status, Lisa began executing a small cyclonic loop due to a Fujiwhara interaction with a tropical wave. Additionally, the interaction caused Lisa to weaken to a tropical depression on September 23. During the next several days, the storm fluctuated in intensity, from a tropical depression to a strong tropical storm. A deep mid- to upper-level trough caused Lisa to turn northward on September 25.[81]
