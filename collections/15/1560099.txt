The alpha-decay half-lives of 1700 nuclei with 100 ≤ Z ≤ 130 have been calculated in a quantum tunneling model with both experimental and theoretical alpha-decay Q-values.[16][17][18][19][20][21] The theoretical calculations are in good agreement with the available experimental data.[dubious – discuss]
