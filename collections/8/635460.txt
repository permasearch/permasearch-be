On October 4, 2016, the series was renewed for a seventh cycle, which premiered on September 5, 2017.[3][1][2] Ryan Murphy confirmed that the season will be connected to Freak Show; but will be set in modern day.[19] In February 2017, on Watch What Happens Live, Murphy announced that the season would revolve around the 2016 U.S. election and suggested that it may feature a character based on President Donald Trump.[20] Murphy has said that the season will be representative of both sides of the political divide. He also said that he will be "illuminating and highlighting" groups of people he believes to be "ignored by the current [Trump] administration and who are afraid and feel terrorized that their lives are going to be taken away."[21]
