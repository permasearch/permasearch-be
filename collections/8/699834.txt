Unnamed sources told CNN that Coral Springs police arrived at the scene and saw three Broward deputies behind their vehicles with pistols drawn.[116] The commanding sheriff's office captain ordered deputies to form a perimeter instead of immediately confronting the shooter; this tactic was contrary to BSO training regarding active shooters. Based on time stamps of the police logs, the order was given some time after the shooting had stopped.[119] Sheriff Israel said that Coral Springs officers were the first to enter the building, about four minutes after Cruz had left the school.[119] Due to a tape delay in viewing surveillance footage, officers believed that Cruz was still in the building.[120] As of early March, there were three investigations into the timeline of police response.[121][116]
