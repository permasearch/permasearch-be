Through Talia al Ghul's access to Kord Industries,[32][61] as well as being LexCorp's former CEO, Jason has access to high-level civilian and military-grade weaponry including firearms such as pistols, machine guns, shotguns, etc. He also has access to explosives, rocket launchers, and advanced computer equipment and gadgetry. However, his dagger (which resembles a kris and is a replica of one of Ra's al Ghul's knives) still remains as his preferred weapon of choice for hand-to-hand combat; it can cut through Batman's armor and arsenal. He also has some lethally sharpened shurikens based on Batman's batarang designs as throwing weapons.
