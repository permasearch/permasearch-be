Historically, judicial immunity was associated with the English common law idea that "the King can do no wrong."  (Compare Sovereign immunity.)  Judges, the King's delegates for dispensing justice, accordingly "ought not to be drawn into question for any supposed corruption [for this tends] to the slander of the justice of the King."[2] An example of applying judicial immunity: a judge is not liable for a slander or libel suit for statements made about someone during a trial, no matter how corrupt that act was.[citation needed]
