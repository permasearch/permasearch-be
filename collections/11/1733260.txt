In 1925, Althing banned the adoption of new family names.[11] Some of the common arguments against the usage of family names were: they were not authentically "Icelandic"; the usage of -son in family names made it unclear if the name was actually a family name or patronymic; and there were fears that low-class people would adopt the family names of well-known upper-class families.[11] Some of the common arguments for the usage of family names were: they made it easier to trace lineages; they made it easier to distinguish individuals (a problem in mid-19th century Iceland was that there were so many people named Jón — in fact, one in six Icelandic males were named Jón at the time); and that Iceland ought to follow the lead of its Nordic neighbours.[11]
