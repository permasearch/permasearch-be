Most modern scholars argue that the king was intervening in a civil war between traditionalist Jews in the countryside and Hellenized Jews in Jerusalem.[25][26][27] According to Joseph P. Schultz, modern scholarship, "considers the Maccabean revolt less as an uprising against foreign oppression than as a civil war between the orthodox and reformist parties in the Jewish camp."[28] In the conflict over the office of High Priest, traditionalists with Hebrew/Aramaic names like Onias contested against Hellenizers with Greek names like Jason or Menelaus.[29] Other authors point to social and economic factors in the conflict.[30][31] What began as a civil war took on the character of an invasion when the Hellenistic kingdom of Syria sided with the Hellenizing Jews against the traditionalists.[32] As the conflict escalated, Antiochus prohibited the practices of the traditionalists, thereby, in a departure from usual Seleucid practice, banning the religion of an entire people.[31] Other scholars argue that while the rising began as a religious rebellion, it was gradually transformed into a war of national liberation.[33]
