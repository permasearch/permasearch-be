Most funds use an independent accounting firm to audit the assets of the fund, provide tax services and perform a complete audit of the fund's financial statements. The year-end audit is often performed in accordance with the standard accounting practices enforced within the country the fund it established or the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).[136] The auditor may verify the fund's NAV and assets under management (AUM).[137][138] Some auditors only provide "NAV lite" services, meaning that the valuation is based on prices received from the manager rather than independent assessment.[139]
