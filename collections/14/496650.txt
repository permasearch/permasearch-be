A standard screw lamp socket has only two electrical contacts.  In the center of the bottom of a standard socket is the hot contact (contact one in photo), which typically looks like a small metal tongue bent over.  The threaded metal shell is itself the neutral contact (contact three in photo).  When a standard bulb is screwed into a standard socket, a matching contact on the bottom of the bulb presses against the metal tongue in the center of the socket, creating the live connection.  The metal threads of the bulb base   touch the socket shell, which creates the neutral connection, and this is how the electrical circuit is completed.
