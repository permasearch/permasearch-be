For skilled personnel such as confinement nannies from Malaysia, the work permit is short-term. Employers or appointed agencies are able to hire Malaysian confinement nanny[23] by applying the work permit either online or manually. The validity period can be up to 16 weeks with reference to the birth time of the child. There are two situations which the pass can be extended. It is either when the required employment period is longer than the issued permit or when the confinement nanny leaves Singapore during her employment period.
