A short, lightweight and fast train passing over an insulated blockjoint may disappear from the departing track circuit before it appears in the arriving track circuit, allowing false clear signals to be given. This problem can be overcome by introducing a time delay of say 1 â€“ 2 seconds into the departing track circuit. Electronic track circuits such as the CSEE can easily incorporate such a time delay.
