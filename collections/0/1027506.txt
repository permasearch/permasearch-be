A levels evolved gradually from a two-year linear course with an exam at the end, to a modular course, between the late 1980s and 2000. By the year 2000 there was a strong educational reason[clarification needed] to standardise the exam and offer greater breadth to students through modules[5] and there was also a pragmatic case based on the inefficiency of linear courses where up to 30% of students were failing to complete or pass.[6]
