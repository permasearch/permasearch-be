Garfield was carried back to the White House. Although doctors told him that he would not survive the night, the President remained conscious and alert.[37] The next morning his vital signs were good and doctors began to hope for recovery.[38] A long vigil began, with Garfield's doctors, led by D. Willard Bliss, issuing regular bulletins that the American public followed closely throughout the summer of 1881.[39][40] His condition fluctuated. Fevers came and went. Garfield struggled to keep down solid food and spent most of the summer eating little, and then only liquids.[41]
