The Sheriff (Marc Miles) is, as the name implies, the local law enforcement official in Moab, Utah. The Sheriff has no mentioned name. The Sheriff is first mentioned when Indiana Jones instructs Herman to find the Sheriff and alert him that grave robbers are digging in a cave in Arches National Park. Herman does what he says bringing the Sheriff to the Jones residence. Indiana hands the Sheriff the cross of Coronado and tells him that there were "five or six of them." The Sheriff takes the cross and tells Jones that Panama Hat and his gang were the rightful owners of the cross, calling Fedora & his gang as witnesses to prove it, and he will not press charges against Jones if he gives the cross back. He hands the cross to Fedora who sells it to Panama Hat. He then bids Indiana farewell with a tip of his hat before walking out.
