Competition speed skydivers fly in the head down position and reach even higher speeds. The current world record is 1,357.6 km/h (843.6 mph/Mach 1.25) by Felix Baumgartner who skydived from 38,969.4 m (127,852.4 ft) above earth on 14 October 2012. The record was set due to the high altitude where the lesser density of the atmosphere decreased drag.
