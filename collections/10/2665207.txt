River's Edge was the first major film for many of its actors, including Daniel Roebuck and Ione Skye.[3] On casting Keanu Reeves, casting director Carrie Frazier recalled: "He walked in the door, and I went, "Oh my god, this is my guy!" It was just because of the way he held his bodyâ€”his shoes were untied, and what he was wearing looked like a young person growing into being a man. I was over the moon about him."[3] Ione Skye was cast in the film after a casting director saw a photo of her with her brother, Donovan Leitch, who was an aspiring actor at the time; she had no acting experience, and it was her first film.[3] Auditioning for the role of the brutish Samson, Daniel Roebuck arrived at his audition in full-costume with his hair slicked back with K-Y Jelly, and two beer cans in his front pockets.[3]
