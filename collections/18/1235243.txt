In an unveiling of the presidential library's plans on May 4, 2017, the presidential library compound is revealed to incorporate the Jackson Park end of Midway Plaisance from the north (which is to be readapted into a water basin), and a parcel of parkland and the park hockey fields to the south, where the main buildings will be predominantly located.[25] As part of a wider plan to reclaim parkland and improve park safety, the project also necessitates the closure of South Cornell Drive between 60th and 67th Streets, a 6-lane park thoroughfare that runs along the western park lagoon and golf course from Midway Plaisance to South Shore.[25]
