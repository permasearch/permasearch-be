The original act provided for lifetime Secret Service protection for former presidents. In 1997, it was reduced to 10 years for presidents taking office after 1997. The 1997 amendment was reverted by the Former Presidents Protection Act of 2012 (Pub.L. 112â€“257).[2] All living former presidents and their spouses are now entitled to receive lifetime Secret Service protection.[3]
