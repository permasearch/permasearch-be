Following Infinite Crisis and 52, Tim Drake modified his costume to favor a mostly red and black color scheme in tribute to his best friend, Superboy (Kon-El), who died fighting Earth-Prime Superboy. This Robin costume had a red torso, long sleeves, and pants with a cape that was black on the outside and yellow on the inside. It also had yellow stitching and belt, and black domino mask, gloves, and boots.
