Veteran African-American civil rights activist Bayard Rustin was King's first regular advisor on nonviolence.[234] King was also advised by the white activists Harris Wofford and Glenn Smiley.[235] Rustin and Smiley came from the Christian pacifist tradition, and Wofford and Rustin both studied Gandhi's teachings. Rustin had applied nonviolence with the Journey of Reconciliation campaign in the 1940s,[236] and Wofford had been promoting Gandhism to Southern blacks since the early 1950s.[235] King had initially known little about Gandhi and rarely used the term "nonviolence" during his early years of activism in the early 1950s. King initially believed in and practiced self-defense, even obtaining guns in his household as a means of defense against possible attackers. The pacifists guided King by showing him the alternative of nonviolent resistance, arguing that this would be a better means to accomplish his goals of civil rights than self-defense. King then vowed to no longer personally use arms.[237][238]
