Hospitals were forbidden by law to turn away patients who were unable to pay.[39] Eventually, charitable foundations called waqfs were formed to support hospitals, as well as schools.[39] Part of the state budget also went towards maintaining hospitals.[34] While the services of the hospital were free for all citizens[39] and patients were sometimes given a small stipend to support recovery upon discharge, individual physicians occasionally charged fees.[34] In a notable endowment, a 13th-century governor of Egypt Al Mansur Qalawun ordained a foundation for the Qalawun hospital that would be free for patients and contain a mosque, a library for doctors and a pharmacy[43] and the hospital is used today for ophthalmology.[34] The hospital had accommodation for 8,000 people - [44] "it served 4,000 patients daily."[45]
