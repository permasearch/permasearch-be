15-year-old Aristotle "Ari" Mendoza has no plans for the summer of 1987. He is bored, miserable, and friendless. Ari lives with his mother and his father; his two older sisters have grown up and moved away and his older brother is in prison. Everyone in Ari's family refuses to talk about his brother and behaves as if he were dead. Ari's father served in the Vietnam War, but also refuses to talk about his experiences in battle. Ari goes swimming to escape the suffocating silence of his house, even though he doesn't know how to swim.[8]
