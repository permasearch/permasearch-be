Stephanie Hall of KSiteTV gave a good review to the episode saying that the show continued "the pattern of solid episodes this season. [...] Though not the most intense episode, it was a generally enthralling and contained more enjoying quips than usual." Hall gave a positive feedback to Sonnenshine, the writer of the episode: "Lightening up all of the drama and deaths of this episode were great and humorous lines of dialogue. Writer Rebecca Sonnenshine included a perfect amount of sass, most notably with Tessa, to break the intensity."[4]
