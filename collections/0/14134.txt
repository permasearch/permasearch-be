Staind (/steÉªnd/ STAYND) is an American rock band formed in 1995. The original lineup consisted of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Aaron Lewis, lead guitarist Mike Mushok, bassist and backing vocalist Johnny April, and drummer Jon Wysocki. The lineup has been stable outside of Wysocki's departure in 2011, who was replaced by Sal Giancarelli. The band has recorded seven studio albums: Tormented (1996), Dysfunction (1999), Break the Cycle (2001), 14 Shades of Grey (2003), Chapter V (2005), The Illusion of Progress (2008), and Staind (2011). The band's activity became more sporadic after their self-titled release; with Lewis pursuing a solo country music career and Mushok subsequently joining the band Saint Asonia, but the band continued to tour off and on in the coming years. As of 2016, Lewis had reiterated that the band has not broken up, and will possibly create another album, but that his current focus is his solo career. The band's most recently performed live in 2017, and as of 2018, is in a hiatus. The band has sold over 15 million records worldwide.[1] Many of the band's singles have substantially charted on US rock and all-format charts as well, including "It's Been Awhile", "Fade", "Price to Play", "So Far Away", and "Right Here".
