Bucharest's public transport system is the largest in Romania and one of the largest in Europe. It is made up of the Bucharest Metro, run by Metrorex, as well as a surface transport system run by STB (Societatea de Transport BucureÈ™ti, previously known as the RATB), which consists of buses, trams, trolleybuses, and light rail. In addition,  a private minibus system operates there. As of  2007[update], a limit of 10,000 taxicab licenses was imposed.[63]
