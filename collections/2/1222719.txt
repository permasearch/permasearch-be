Mayor Mitchel's successor, John Francis Hylan, was elected in 1917; and he immediately commissioned a series of new boats.[103] The result was President Roosevelt (also known as T.R.), delivered in 1921,[104][105] and American Legion I, delivered five years later.[105][106] The names of both boats triggered some controversyâ€”President Roosevelt due to resentment of Theodore Roosevelt, and American Legion I due to the fact that it was named after the American Legion, which was only one of the various veterans' organizations in existence.[105] At the same time, Hylan also ordered three more boats for the 39th Street route, and he ordered 11 boats for other city-operated routes. This brought the number of boats ordered by Hylan's administration to 16.[107] After Hylan's electoral defeat by Jimmy Walker in 1925, George W. Loft and William Randolph Hearst were respectively renamed to West Brighton and Whitehall II.[108] In April 1926, the white paint scheme of the boats was replaced by a maroon scheme, which was better at hiding the accumulations of grime on the boats' exteriors.[109]
