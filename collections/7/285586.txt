Laura Prepon and Yael Stone were next to join the series.[2] Abigail Savage, who plays Gina, and Alysia Reiner, who plays Fig, had auditioned for role of Alex Vause.[9][15] Prepon initially auditioned for Piper Chapman,[16] however Kohan felt she would not worry about her [in prison], noting a "toughness and a presence to her that wasnâ€™t right for the character." Kohan instead gave her the role of Alex.[9] Stone had originally auditioned for the role of Nicky Nichols, but she was not considered "tough enough" for the character;[17] she was asked to audition for Lorna Morello instead.[18] Likability was important for Morello, whom casting director Jen Euston deemed "a very helpful, nice, sweet Italian girl."[18] Laverne Cox, a black transgender woman, was cast as Sophia Burset, a transgender character. The Advocate touted Orange Is the New Black as possibly the first women-in-prison narrative to cast a transgender woman for this type of role.[19] Natasha Lyonne was to audition for Alex, but was asked to read for the character Nicky Nichols; "[Kohan knew] she could do Nicky with her eyes closed. She was perfect," said Euston.[18] Uzo Aduba read for the part of Janae Watson but was offered the character Suzanne "Crazy Eyes" Warren.[18][20] Taryn Manning was offered the role of Tiffany "Pennsatucky" Doggett.[18] This American Life host Ira Glass was offered a role as a public radio host, but he declined. The role instead went to Robert Stanton, who plays the fictional host Maury Kind.[21]
