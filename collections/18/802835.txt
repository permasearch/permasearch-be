Mobility on Dutch roads has grown continuously since the 1950s and now exceeds 200 billion km travelled per year,[129] three quarters of which are done by car.[130] Around half of all trips in the Netherlands are made by car, 25% by bicycle, 20% walking, and 5% by public transport.[130] With a total road network of 139,295 km, which includes 2,758 km of expressways,[131] the Netherlands has one of the densest road networks in the world—much denser than Germany and France, but still not as dense as Belgium.[132]
