In early 2010, Miller signed with Rostrum Records.[15] Rostrum president Benjy Grinberg met Miller while recording with Wiz Khalifa at ID Labs.[16] Although Grinberg started giving Miller advice, he didn't show any interest in getting involved with his career until the artist began work on the K.I.D.S. mixtape, when, as he later told HitQuarters, Grinberg "noticed a maturation in his sound and approach to his music."[16] By that point Miller had started attracting interest from different record companies but chose Rostrum due to its location in his hometown and association with Wiz Khalifa.[16] K.I.D.S. was released by the label in August 2010.[1] The mixtape was inspired by the movie Kids. A significant breakthrough came in late 2010 when Miller embarked on his first tour, the Incredibly Dope Tour, selling out every location.[16] In 2010, he won two awards at the Pittsburgh hip hop awards.[17]
