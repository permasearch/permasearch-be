This period is considered as something of a golden age for the Samaritan community, the population thought to number up to a million.[62] The Temple of Gerizim was rebuilt after the Bar Kokhba revolt against the Romans, around 136 CE. Much of Samaritan liturgy was set by the high priest Baba Rabba in the 4th century.[63]
