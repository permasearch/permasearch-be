Now the hypotheses can be stated properly. The initial condition       v   0   ( x )   {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{0}(x)}   is assumed to be a smooth and divergence-free function and the external force      f  ( x , t )   {\displaystyle \mathbf {f} (x,t)}   is assumed to be a smooth function as well. The type of solutions that are physically relevant are those who satisfy these conditions:
