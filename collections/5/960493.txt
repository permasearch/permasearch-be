In the 2D animated show, Mother Gothel debuts in a dream-turned-nightmare Rapunzel had in the premiere episode "What the Hair!?" a few days after her hair had mysteriously returned. She had bragged about how Rapunzel thought that she was "gone forever" and had expressed her wicked delight in seeing that "her daughter's" golden hair and its mystical properties had returned. She firmly told Rapunzel that she came back to bring her back to her tower, where she would be "safe and secure." It was then that the mystical rock spikes that resulted in the regrowth of Rapunzel's 70-feet golden hair appear all around her.
