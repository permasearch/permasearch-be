Skyler is going in to work on a Saturday, and Walt notices that she is looking especially niceâ€”possibly dressing up for her boss, with whom she has a history. Hank is still suffering from the after-effects of killing Tuco and seeing the bomb detonate in Juarez. Walt gives him a motivational speech, talking about how he has not had any fear in his life since he was diagnosed with cancer and knew with certainty what would kill him. This helps Hank leave the house, but he still has anxiety attacks. Meanwhile, Jesse has slept with Jane. He offers her marijuana to smoke, and she reveals that she is in recovery from addiction and has been clean for 18 months. He agrees to stop smoking in the house. Later, he orders a mattress, as he has no furniture in his apartment. Seeing it, Jane comes over, and the two start making out once again.
