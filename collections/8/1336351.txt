In electrical engineering degrees of freedom is often used to describe the number of directions in which a phased array antenna can form either beams or nulls.  It is equal to one less than the number of elements contained in the array, as one element is used as a reference against which either constructive or destructive interference may be applied using each of the remaining antenna elements.  Radar practice and communication link practice, with beam steering being more prevalent for radar applications and null steering being more prevalent for interference suppression in communication links.
