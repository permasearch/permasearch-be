The park was converted from an incomplete mansion, known as the Palace in the Sky. It was built during the Marcos era to host the visit of US President Ronald Reagan. Work stopped when Reagan canceled his visit.[1] The incomplete scaffolding of the mansion remained intact. It has been described as a monument to Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos' "lifestyle built on greed, excess and arrogance"[1] and has been seen as an example of the couple's "edifice complex."[2]
