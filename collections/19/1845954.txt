The episode starts with Elena (Nina Dobrev) hearing a noise in the middle of the night; she gets up to check what it is and runs into Alaric (Matt Davis) and Jenna (Sara Canning). The three of them start talking while Jonas (Randy J. Goodwin), who is in the house, gets into Elena's bedroom and steals some of Elena's personal items. Jonas manages to get out before Elena sees him.
