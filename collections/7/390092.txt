There is evidence of prehistoric bear worship, though this is disputed by archaeologists.[120] The prehistoric Finns,[121] Siberian peoples[122] and more recently Koreans considered the bear as the spirit of their forefathers.[123] There is evidence of bear worship in early Chinese and Ainu cultures.[124] In many Native American cultures, the bear is a symbol of rebirth because of its hibernation and re-emergence.[125] The image of the mother bear was prevalent throughout societies in North America and Eurasia, based on the female's devotion and protection of her cubs.[126] Japanese folklore features the Onikuma, a "demon bear" that walks upright.[127] The Ainu of northern Japan, a different people from the Japanese, saw the bear instead as sacred; Hirasawa Byozan painted a scene in documentary style of a bear sacrifice in an Ainu temple, complete with offerings to the dead animal's spirit.[128]
