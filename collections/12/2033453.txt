As in the novel, her telekinetic abilities were present when she was a child, though only one example is given: the shower of flaming rocks. Her only other telekinetic manifestations happened after the shower incident. However, this film adds events that never took place in either the original novel or film; in one scene, she falls into a bizarre trance, during which she bends her metal ruler and cracks her desk in half with her mind, but is unaware of what she's done until she comes back to consciousness. After researching "miracles" and finding out about telekinesis, she begins practicing with it, attempting to control and intensify it.
