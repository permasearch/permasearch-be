In Genesis 39, a positive example is presented in Joseph, one of Jacob’s twelve sons. He is sold into slavery in Egypt and quickly rises to a prominent and successful position managing the household of Potiphar, a military captain. He resists sexual advances from Potiphar’s wife “day after day,”[6] protesting that he does not wish to betray Potiphar’s trust. One day her advances become physical, and in his effort to escape, Joseph leaves his cloak behind. Potiphar’s wife uses this ‘evidence’ to falsely accuse Joseph of attempted rape and he is imprisoned, losing all but his life.[7] More than two years later[8] Joseph is restored to an even higher position serving Pharaoh himself.
