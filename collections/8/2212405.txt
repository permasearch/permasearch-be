Andy and Lucy console one another in the aftermath of the Miss Twin Peaks Pageant, where Annie was kidnapped by Windom Earle. Cooper, Harry, and Hawk contemplate the chalkboard map, as Cooper says quietly, "Fire walk with me." Pete Martell enters the police station exclaiming, "Grand theft auto!" and says the Log Lady stole his truck and drove off toward the woods. There were "...twelve rainbow trout in the [truck] bed." Truman recalls a circle of twelve sycamore trees in the woods: Glastonbury Grove, where Hawk found the pages torn from Laura's diary. The Log Lady arrives carrying a jar of black oil given to her by her husband before his death. Cooper informs Pete that Windom Earle stole his truck. The Log Lady says, "This oil is an opening to a gateway." The oil smells like scorched engine oil. Hawk brings in Ronnette Pulaski, who recognizes the odor from the night of Laura Palmer's death.
