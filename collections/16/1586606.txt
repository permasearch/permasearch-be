In January 1876, following the Meiji Restoration, Japan employed gunboat diplomacy to pressure Korea, under the Joseon Dynasty, to sign the Japanâ€“Korea Treaty of 1876, which granted extraterritorial rights to Japanese citizens and opened three Korean ports to Japanese trade. The rights granted to Japan under this unequal treaty,[7] were similar to those granted western powers in Japan following the visit of Commodore Perry.[7] Japanese involvement in Korea increased during the 1890s, a period of political upheaval.
