The accidents led to national level inquiries and detailed analysis of why the accidents occurred.[12] There was a significant pause where changes were made before the Shuttles returned to flight.[12] The Columbia disaster occurred in 2003, but STS took more than a year off before returning to flight in June 2005 with the STS-114 mission.[12] The previous break was between January 1986 (when the Challenger disaster occurred) and 32 months later when STS-26 was launched on September 29, 1988.[16]
