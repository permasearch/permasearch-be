The Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) was required under section 303(d) of the CWA to create a list of impaired waters for which TMDLs would be required.[49] IDEM's NPS and watershed efforts concentrate on these impaired water resources.[47] Implementation of TMDLs is managed by local watershed organizations, and NPS pollution controls are only voluntary.[50]  Watershed groups use funding from IDEM to create incentive programs for the use of best management practices, as well as provide public information and education.[50] Funding sources for NPS pollution regulation in Indiana include CWA 319(h) grants; CWA 205(j) grants; grants from the Environmental Quality Incentives Program of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008; and a wide variety of foundations and individual fundraising.[51] Zoning ordinances may also be structured in a way that limits NPS water pollution.
