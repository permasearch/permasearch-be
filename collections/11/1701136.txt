Joey + Rory's third studio album, His and Hers, was released on July 31, 2012. "When I'm Gone" and "Josephine" served as the album's first two singles and were simultaneously released to radio before the album,[12] though neither charted. In late 2015, due to a spike in sales for "When I'm Gone" after the video was featured in some press about Joey + Rory, it managed to enter the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart at number 21.
