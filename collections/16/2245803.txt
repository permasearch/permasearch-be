The melody of the "Deutschlandlied" was originally written by Joseph Haydn in 1797 to provide music to the poem "Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser" ("God save Franz the Emperor") by Lorenz Leopold Haschka. The song was a birthday anthem honouring Francis II (1768â€“1835), Habsburg emperor, and was intended as a parallel to the British "God Save the King". Haydn's work is sometimes called the "Emperor's Hymn."
