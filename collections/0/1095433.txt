Although the Judgedoms were hereditary lordships, the old Byzantine imperial notion that personal title or honor was separate from the state still remained, so the Giudicato was not regarded as the personal property of the monarch as was common in later European feudalism. Like the imperial systems, the new order also preserved "semi-democratic" forms, with national assemblies called the Crown of the Realm. Each Giudicato saw to its own defense, maintained its own laws and administration, and looked after its own foreign and trading affairs.[44]
