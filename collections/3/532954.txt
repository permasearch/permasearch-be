The popular book Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, by Edwin Lefèvre, reflects on many of those lessons, and is in effect a financial memoir of Livermore (a pseudonym is used) starting with the bucket shop days and ending in the 1920s before the crash. The book, which Lefèvre dedicated to Livermore, has an avid following in the investment community, and is still in print. There is some speculation that this partnership between the two men was not their first collaboration. Since Lefèvre was a writer and journalist, it is thought that he was one of the friendly newspapermen that Livermore employed for both information and planted articles. Livermore himself wrote a less widely read book, How to trade in stocks; the Livermore formula for combining time element and price. It was published in 1940, the same year Livermore committed suicide.
