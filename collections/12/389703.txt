It has a score of 79% on Metacritic.[5] GameSpot awarded it 7 out of 10, saying "Everything, from the visual touches to the character interactions in and out of battle to the voiceovers, is meant to make Naruto fans happy--though the fact that thereâ€™s a fun little fighting game underneath certainly helps."[7] Destructoid awarded it a score of 8 out of 10, saying "It's an extravagant, over-the-top spectacle where you get to watch teenage ninjas blow up chunks of the planet using magic attacks, and that's pretty cool."[6] IGN awarded it a score of 5.5 out of 10, saying "Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm's strong combat is countered hard by poor AI and connection problems."[8] Hardcore Gamer awarded it 3 out of 5 and said "Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 has solid controls and an outstanding roster of characters, but suffers from too many flaws to allow the average gamer to drop $60 right now."[10] The Escapist awarded it 9 out of 10, saying "Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 is solid, both in gameplay and narrative. It has been a long time since a fighting game has been this fun for me."[9]
