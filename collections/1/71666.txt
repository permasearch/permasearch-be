The band recorded the album between September 2015 and February 2017 in multiple studios. Band members Brad Delson and Mike Shinoda served as the album's primary producers. The sound of One More Light has been described as being more pop-focused, departing from the alternative metal sound of their previous album, The Hunting Party (2014). The album features guest vocal appearances from Pusha T, Stormzy, and Kiiara, and production and songwriting collaborations with Julia Michaels, Justin Tranter, Ross Golan, Andrew Goldstein, blackbear, and Eg White.[1] The album is also the band's first to feature a title track, as they felt that the song "One More Light" was the heart of the album.
