Both Comic Book Resources and The Economic Times noted that the episode gave the feeling that the show was nearing its end, with Comic Book Resources stating: "With few stones left unturned now, and a Steven Universe movie on the way, it feels like Rebecca Sugar’s hit cartoon is nearing its endgame", feeling that the upcoming film "could very well serve as the show’s swan song."[3][5]
