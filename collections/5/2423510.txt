Entering the FA Cup in the third round by virtue of Premier League status, Manchester City's first game was at home against Watford. In City's side, a notable absentee was Joe Hart who was replaced by substitute goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon. Hart had been designated the club's domestic cup goalkeeper but had conceded four goals in his previous game. The City team took control after a mixed first 20 minutes. Carlos Tevez and Gareth Barry scored in the first half.[16] In the second half, substitute academy player Marcos Lopes scored within seconds of taking the field in the 90th minute to become the club's youngest ever goalscorer at the age of 17 years and eight days.[17]
