The system is workload-optimized, integrating massively parallel POWER7 processors and built on IBM's DeepQA technology,[17] which it uses to generate hypotheses, gather massive evidence, and analyze data.[2] Watson employs a cluster of ninety IBM Power 750 servers, each of which uses a 3.5Â GHz POWER7 eight-core processor, with four threads per core. In total, the system has 2,880 POWER7 processor threads and 16 terabytes of RAM.[17]
