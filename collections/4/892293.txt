The beads of the tire are held on the rim, or the "outer edge" of a wheel.[43] These outer edges are shaped to obtain a proper shape on each side, having a radially cylindrical inclined inner wall on which the tire can be mounted. The wheel's rim must be of the proper design and type to hold the bead of the appropriately sized tire.[44] Tires are mounted on the wheel by forcing its beads into the channel formed by the wheel's inner and outer rims.[45]
