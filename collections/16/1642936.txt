Porridge was critically acclaimed and is widely considered to be one of the greatest British sitcoms of all time, with it being ranked No. 35 on the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes compiled by the British Film Institute in 2000. The series was followed by a 1978 sequel, Going Straight, which saw Barker reprise his character as he tries to avoid going back to prison. The show was later revived in 2017 under the same name, after a one-off special, aired on 28 August 2016 as part of the BBC's Landmark Sitcom Season and focusing on the life of Fletcher's grandson, Nigel Fletcher (played by Kevin Bishop), as he begins a prison sentence.
