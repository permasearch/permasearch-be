The team expected great fanfare upon returning to the United States, having just won the first Women's World Cup. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The win did not draw national attention and the team was without money. There was no training or games, and many players returned to college to await the fate of the team.[56] It was nine months after the World Cup that the team played another match; however, they only played in two matches in 1992.[58]
