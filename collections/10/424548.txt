Ranipokhari which is translated as "Queen's Pond" is a historic artificial pond that nestled in the heart of Kathmandu. It was built by king Pratap Mall in 1670 AD for his beloved queen after she lost her son who couldn't recover from her loss.[66] A large stone statue of an elephant in south signifies the image of Pratap Malla and his two sons. Balgopaleshwor Temple stands still inside the temple above the pond. Rani Pokhari is opened once a year during the final day of Tihar i.e. Bhai Tika and Chhath festival. The world largest Chhath takes place every year in Ranipokhari. The pond is one of Kathmandu's most famous landmarks and is known for its religious and aesthetic significance.
