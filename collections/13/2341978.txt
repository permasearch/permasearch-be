Similar to the first game, Five Nights at Freddy's 2 is a survival horror video game with point-and-click elements. Players must survive a night shift at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a restaurant reminiscent of those like Chuck E. Cheese's and ShowBiz Pizza Place, from 12 A.M. to 6 A.M. game time (approximately seven minutes and six seconds), without being attacked by any of the animatronic enemy characters that wander from room to room. There are multiple different animatronic characters: the original game's antagonists (the titular Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie the Bunny, Chica the Chicken, Foxy the Pirate Fox, and Golden Freddy), as well as upgraded "toy" versions of Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy, a marionette referred to as "the Puppet", and a humanoid robot named "Balloon Boy".
