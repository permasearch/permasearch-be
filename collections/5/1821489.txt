Though Portal 2 introduced some new characters, the writers wanted to maintain the one-on-one relationships between each character and the player-character.[77] Valve explored the possibility of introducing a new protagonist for Portal 2. The playtesters accepted playing as a different character for the first part of the game, but they became disoriented when GLaDOS did not recognize them. The writers returned to using Chell, the protagonist of Portal.[78] Valve artists experimented with Chell's attire, and considered changing her (ambiguous) nationality.[79] They returned to the orange "dehumanizing" jumpsuit from Portal with the top tied around Chell's waist to enhance her freedom of movement and help her "stand out more as an individual".[80] PSM3 called the new look "controversially sexy".[81] As in the first game, Chell's facial appearance is based on that of voice actress Al√©sia Glidewell.[81] Chell continues her role as a silent observer, as the straight man in response to the insanity around her and refuses to give her antagonists any satisfaction.[82]
