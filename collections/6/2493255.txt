Yes the numbers on the balls are simply to identify them as your court's (in high school I once served off the side of my racket at a tournament and it flew through six adjacent courts so it helps). The stuff about higher bounce is an internet invention. I can't imagine the cost additions to ball production if they took each individual ball, measured the internal pressure to within a fraction of an atmosphere (or better yet, took the the time to measure the height of a "bounce test" haha), separated and stamped them accordingly, and then packaged them in multiple separate lines. Also, the previous comment about getting multiple numbers in the same can seems questionable to me. Was it a new (unopened) can? I've been playing tennis for 25 years and there has never been such an occurrence. It would defeat the (actual) purpose of the numbering. Username4761 (talk) 00:54, 15 February 2015 (UTC)
