Shivanya and her cousin Shesha are shape-shifting serpents, or Icchadhari Naagins, who want to avenge Shivanya's parents' death. There were five murderers, but Shivanya was able to see only three of them: Ankush, Viren and Shailesh. They killed Shivanya's parents in a failed attempt to attain a precious gem with magical powers called the Naagmani.
