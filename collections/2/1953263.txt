Identical twins share 100% of their DNA.[2] Full siblings are first-degree relatives and, on average, share 50% of their genes out of those that vary among humans, assuming that the parents share none of those genes.[2] Half-siblings are second-degree relatives and have, on average, a 25% overlap in their human genetic variation.[3]
