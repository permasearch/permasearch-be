The HK-1 aircraft contract was issued in 1942 as a development contract[9] and called for three aircraft to be constructed in two years for the war effort.[10] Seven configurations were considered, including twin-hull and single-hull designs with combinations of four, six, and eight wing-mounted engines.[11] The final design chosen was a behemoth, eclipsing any large transport then built.[9][12][N 2] It would be built mostly of wood to conserve metal (its elevators and rudder were fabric-covered[13]), and was nicknamed the Spruce Goose (a name Hughes disliked) or the Flying Lumberyard.[14]
