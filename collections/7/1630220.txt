On April 25, 2011, Nintendo released an official statement announcing a system to succeed the Wii to be released during 2012, and that playable console units would be present at E3 2011.[40] Speaking at an investor's conference, Iwata stated the Wii successor would "offer something new for home game systems."[41] He also confirmed that the device would not launch in fiscal year 2012, meaning that it would release after April 2012.[42] In early June, Nikkei issued a report confirming earlier rumors that the new console would feature a controller with a 6-inch touchscreen that would give tablet-like controls to games, as well as a rechargeable battery and camera.[43]
