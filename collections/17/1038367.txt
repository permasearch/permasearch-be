Finally, in December 1961, India militarily invaded Goa, Daman and Diu, where regardless of the odds the Portuguese put up a fight.[16][17] Portuguese armed forces had been instructed to either defeat the invaders or die. Only meager resistance was offered due to the Portuguese army's poor firepower and size (only 3,300 men), against a fully armed Indian force of over 30,000 with full air and naval support.[18][19] The Governor of Portuguese India signed the Instrument of Surrender[20] on 19 December 1961, ending 450 years of Portuguese rule in India.
