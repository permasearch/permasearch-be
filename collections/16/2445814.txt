Taylor Jewel - Belly's best friend despite being her polar opposite. Unlike Belly, she is boy crazy and shallow, though by We'll Always Have Summer, she grows up and has something wise to say for once. In the first book of the series as seen in flashbacks, she is considered something of a slut as she goes for all three guys (Steven, Conrad and Jeremiah) almost at once (first setting her eyes on Conrad and flirting with him, then kissing and leading Jeremiah on and then getting caught kissing Steven, all in less than a week) despite telling Belly that girls "can't do that." She is seen desperately trying to pair Belly with guys and trying to get her to "show some cleave" despite her friend's endless protests. She and Belly have a falling out towards the climax of It's Not Summer Without You when she accuses Belly of being "a crappy friend" when Belly does not want her to come to a party at the beach house, claiming that she "keeps her summer house and her summer boys all to herself and not sharing anything with [her]," which sparks an argument between the two girls. By We'll Always Have Summer, though, they make peace, and Taylor can be seen throughout the course of the book supporting and helping Belly with her wedding. She confronts Conrad after suspecting he said something to Belly after noticing a change in her behavior, and warns him to leave her alone, stating he only hurt her endlessly in the past. Although she admits Belly told her a part of her will always love him and she knows he loves Belly too-"only he can stop her from marrying Jeremiah"- she asks him to be "damn sure he still wants her [Belly]" and to "be the good guy Belly says he is" by "let[ting] her go."
