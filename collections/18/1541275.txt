FBI agents take command of the police situation, ordering the building's power shut off. The loss of power—as Gruber anticipated—disables the vault's final lock. Gruber demands a helicopter on the rooftop for transport, but the FBI prepare to double-cross him by sending helicopter gunships to take down the terrorists. McClane discovers that Gruber's true intention is to detonate the explosives on the roof, faking the deaths of his team so they can escape with the bearer bonds - a plan that would kill all the hostages. Gruber sees a news report by intrusive reporter Richard Thornburg that features McClane's children, and from a desk photo, deduces that McClane is Holly's husband. The criminals order the hostages to the roof, but Gruber takes Holly with him to use against McClane. McClane defeats Karl in a fight, kills Uli, and sends the hostages back downstairs before the explosives detonate, destroying the roof and the FBI helicopter.
