Many musicians worked with Zimmer in the score. The biggest collaborators were Mexican duo Rodrigo y Gabriela,[3] whose music Zimmer met after being given their album by a friend. Zimmer said they were picked for the soundtrack because the duo "play rock n' roll with flamenco guitars".[2] American composer Eric Whitacre helped with choir-based songs, most notably the mermaid theme, and brought along his soprano wife, Hila Plitmann.[2][4] Pen√©lope Cruz's brother Eduardo Cruz wrote a tango song,[5] and Geoff Zanelli contributed to many tracks. Trumpetist Arturo Sandoval is featured throughout the score.[6] The music was recorded at the Sony Scoring Stage in Culver City, California, conducted by Nick Glennie-Smith,[7] with Whitacre's choir being done at Abbey Road Studios.[8]
