Consumption of dark fleshed fish containing dietary omega-3 fatty acids is associated with a decreased incidence of dry eyes syndrome in women.[37] This finding is consistent with postulated biological mechanisms.[37] Early experimental work on omega-3 has shown promising results when used in a topical application[38] or given orally.[39] A randomized, double-masked study published in 2013 to evaluate the effects of a triglyceride of DHA (Omega-3; Brudy Sec 1.5), showed significant results compared to other methods that are being used.[40]
