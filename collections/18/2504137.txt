Parental investment is any effort that increases quality of offspring, this could be things such as spending of time, energy and resources to help offspring to survive. Traditionally, females have greater parental effort while males have greater mating effort, and males often compete for the access to females and their investment in order to pass on their genes. In human parental investment, males are more uncertain compared to females when investing in offspring, as they don't know if the offspring belongs to them, so called paternity uncertainty. Lack of paternal investment due to father absence constituted a unique and independent path to early sexual activity and adolescent pregnancy for females.[41] Many studies have identified the absence of father as a major risk factor for both early sexual activity[42] and teenage pregnancy.[43] In the study, females that had no father absent since the age of 0 to 5 are more likely to engage in sexual activities earlier than females who had no father absent from 6 to 13.[41][44]
