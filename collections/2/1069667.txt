Task Force Kean launched its attack on August 7, moving out from Masan,[78] but Kean's offensive had collided in a meeting engagement with one being simultaneously delivered by the North Koreans.[79][80] Heavy fighting continued in the area for three days. By August 9, Task Force Kean was poised to retake Chinju.[81] The Americans initially advanced quickly though North Korean resistance was heavy.[82] On August 10, the Marines picked up the advance.[13] However, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was withdrawn from the force on August 12 to be redeployed elsewhere on the perimeter.[79][83] Task Force Kean continued forward, capturing the area around Chondong-ni.[84] Eighth Army requested several of its units to redeploy to Taegu to be used elsewhere on the front, particularly at the Naktong Bulge.[14][83]
