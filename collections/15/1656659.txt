While the FDA generally determines violations through its own inspections, they can also issue one based on evidence from state personnel[2] The FDA considers a warning letter informal and advisory. It communicates the agency's position on a matter, but does not commit the FDA to an enforcement action. For that reason, the FDA does not consider a warning letter a final action on which it can be sued.[3]
