Missy Robinson[15] (Haley Ramm) was Carly's best friend, because both of their fathers were stationed at the same naval base at Seal Beach when they were 7, before Carly met Sam. In "iReunite with Missy", she returns and constantly tries to get rid of Sam so she can be Carly's best friend again. She gives Sam the address to a pinata factory while she and Carly went on a helicopter ride, and then gives Sam expired chocolates which makes her sick. Missy even fills in for Sam on iCarly that same night. Carly finds out about her plan and ends her friendship with her. Missy left for a six-month sea cruise, which Freddie originally won and then gave to her to end her threat to iCarly. On the cruise, Missy vomited because of seasickness.
