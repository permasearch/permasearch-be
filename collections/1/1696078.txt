Ben Taub is a Level I trauma center, one of three in Southeast Texas, the others being nearby Memorial Hermann Hospital and University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. Kenneth Mattox, a trauma surgeon named Best Doctor in America five times, is the head of the trauma department. With 586 licensed beds, it is one of the busiest trauma centers in the United States, caring for over 106,000 emergency patients during its last fiscal year (March 1, 2010 to February 28, 2011). Ben Taub is also the only hospital in Houston with a psychiatric emergency room open 24 hours a day.[2][3] The hospital is named after Ben Taub (1889â€“1982), a real estate developer and businessman whose extensive behind-the-scenes philanthropic efforts helped transform Houston.
