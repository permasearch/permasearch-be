Christian Aid raises income from a wide number of sources, such as institutional grants, regular gifts, Christian Aid Week campaign, general donations, legacies, and emergency appeals. In 2013, the institutional income, part of which comes from the Department for International Development and the European Commission, constituted 41% of the total income.[8] A significant percentage of the remaining income comes from thousands of individuals in churches and communities. The main fundraising moments include Christmas, Lent, Easter, Harvest, and Christian Aid Week.[9] In 2013, Â£12.6 million (or 13% of the total income) were raised during this week.[5] Throughout the year supporters give regularly using direct debit, cash donations, and Will Aid. Churches and community groups also take part in the annual calendar of events (e.g., walks, soup lunches, and quizzes) raising millions of pounds.
