After moving to LA, Post, Probst, and several other producers and artists formed the music group BLCKVRD and recorded music together.[21] Several members of the group, including Post, moved into a house in San Fernando Valley together. While living in San Fernando Valley, Austin met 1st Down of FKi. He met 1st and Rich from FKi and Rex Kudo who produced several of Post's tracks, including "White Iverson".[3] Post recorded the song two days after writing it.[13] "White Iverson" is, in part, a reference to the professional basketball player Allen Iverson.[22][23][19] In February 2015, upon completion, it was uploaded to Post's SoundCloud account.[24] On July 19, 2015, Post released a music video for "White Iverson". The single received praise from Mac Miller and Wiz Khalifa.[9][25][26] However, the song was mocked by artists such as Earl Sweatshirt.[27][28][29]
