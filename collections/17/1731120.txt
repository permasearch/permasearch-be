The choice of     Ïƒ   {\displaystyle \sigma }  -algebras in the definition above is sometimes implicit and left up to the context. For example, for       R     {\displaystyle {\mathbb {R} }}  ,       C     {\displaystyle {\mathbb {C} }}  , or other topological space, the Borel algebra (containing all the open sets) is a common choice. Some authors define measurable functions as exclusively real-valued ones with respect to the Borel algebra.[1]
