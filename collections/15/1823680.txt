The Coton de TulÃ©ar has a medium-to-long, fluffy, cotton-like coat that is considered hair rather than fur.[2] It is a non-shedding breed with low dander. When it is a puppy, it may shed its puppy coat. Like the poodle or Havanese, this breed has very low allergic effects and is considered hypoallergenic. Matted hair should be removed through daily brushing and combing. Grooming the Coton de Tulear can be quite a challenge.[3][4] This breed does not have the common "doggie smell" and, when properly bathed and groomed, has little to no odor.
