The far field is the region in which the field acts as "normal" electromagnetic radiation. In this region, it is dominated by electric or magnetic fields with electric dipole characteristics. The near field is governed by multipole type fields, which can be considered as collections of dipoles with a fixed phase relationship. The boundary between the two regions is only vaguely defined, and it depends on the dominant wavelength (Î») emitted by the source and the size of the radiating element.
