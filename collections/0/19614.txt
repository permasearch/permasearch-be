When Israel declared Independence on 14 May 1948, the population of Tel Aviv was over 200,000.[47] Tel Aviv was the temporary government center of the State of Israel until the government moved to Jerusalem in December 1949. Due to the international dispute over the status of Jerusalem, most embassies remained in or near Tel Aviv.[48] In the early 1980s, 13 embassies in Jerusalem moved to Tel Aviv as part of the UN's measures responding to Israel's 1980 Jerusalem Law.[49] Today, all national embassies are in Tel Aviv or environs.[50]
