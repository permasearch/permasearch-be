On 6 September 1918 the Bolshevik militias consolidated under the supreme command of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic – Russian: Revvoyensoviet, Революционну Военну Совет, Revolyutsionny Voyenny Sovyet. The first Chairman was Leon Trotsky. The first commander-in-chief was Jukums Vācietis from the Latvian Riflemen; in July 1919 he was replaced by Sergey Kamenev. Soon afterwards Trotsky established the GRU (military intelligence) to provide political and military intelligence to Red Army commanders.[13] Trotsky founded the Red Army with an initial Red Guard organization, and a core soldiery of Red Guard militiamen and Chekist secret police.[14] Conscription began in June 1918,[15] and opposition to it was violently suppressed.[16][page needed] To control the multi-ethnic and multi-cultural Red Army soldiery, the Cheka operated special punitive brigades which suppressed anti-communists, deserters, and "enemies of the state".[13][17] Wartime pragmatism allowed the recruitment of ex-Tsarist officers and sergeants (non-commissioned officers, NCOs) into the Red Army.[18] Lev Glezarov's special commission recruited and screened them.[citation needed] By mid-August 1920 the Red Army's former Tsarist personnel included 48,000 officers, 10,300 administrators, and 214,000 NCOs.[19] At the civil war's start, ex-Tsarists made up 75% of the Red Army officer-corps,[20][page needed] who were employed as military specialists (voenspetsy, ru:Военный советник).[21] The Bolsheviks occasionally enforced the loyalty of such recruits by holding their families as hostages.[20][page needed] At war's end in 1922, ex-Tsarists constituted 83% of the Red Army's divisional and corps commanders.[21]
