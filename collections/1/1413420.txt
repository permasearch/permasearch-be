The sequel to the first story was an hour-long special airing in November 2005. The operation was located in Fairfax County, Virginia, in the suburbs of Washington, D.C., and saw 19 men arrive over three days. Among the men caught were rabbi David Kaye and elementary-school teacher Steven Bennof, both of whom lost their jobs after taping.[5]
