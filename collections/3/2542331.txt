Initial response to the single was mixed. The Daily Telegraph noted how "technically impressive the current generation of British pop singers are.... [with the artists putting in] a hell of a lot into every over-stretched syllable", although noted that the "jump cut from distressing Third World scenes to smiling first world celebrities will always strike an awkward note".[20] The Guardian noted that in contrast to previous versions of the track, it was "more sombre and downbeat: it features plenty of representatives from the vogueish world of pop-house but their actual sound doesnâ€™t impact on the track at all".[21] Finally, Digital Spy were heavily critical of the single stating that they wouldn't "be bullied into buying a mediocre record when there are plenty of other ways to donate and do your bit to help".[22] The Independent criticised the song for retaining what was described as perpetuating the patronising and condescending perspective of the original, with rapper Fuse ODG citing this as the reason he dropped out of the project.[23]
