The group encounters Calvin's slave trackers en route: cornering one of Calvin's disfigured Mandingo fighters, D'Artagnan, who tried to escape to avoid fighting again. Angered, Calvin has several attack dogs devour D'Artagnan alive. After finding Broomhilda and telling her of their plan, Schultz offers to buy her while negotiating the initial deal during dinner. Calvin's staunchly loyal house slave, Stephen, becomes suspicious and accurately deduces their plan: he alerts Calvin, who alters the deal at gunpoint so that Broomhilda will be sold instead of the Mandingo fighter. Schultz agrees, and the papers for her freedom are drawn up and signed. Calvin smugly insists that the deal be sealed through a handshake; Schultz, sick of Calvin's cruelty, shoots him through the heart with his concealed derringer, killing him. Schultz is then killed by Calvin's bodyguard Butch, who is then killed by Django with his own revolver. A shootout ensues, and Django kills many of Calvin's henchmen before surrendering.
