The growth of the collection has warranted several additions to the museum's original 1893 building, which was constructed for the World's Columbian Exposition of the same year. The most recent expansion, the Modern Wing designed by Renzo Piano, opened in 2009 and increased the museum's footprint to nearly one million square feet, making it the second-largest art museum in the United States, after the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[3] The Art Institute is connected with the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, a leading art school, making it one of the few remaining unified arts institutions in the United States.
