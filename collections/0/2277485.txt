Overflow in a circuit is costly. Unfortunately, traditional control valves make it inevitable. As we size a control valve the Kv calculated almost certainly will not match the Kvs of the nearest appropriate valve. For example, a Kv calculation of 4.5 M3/h would most likely lead to selection of a valve with a 6.3 M3/h Kvs. This means the valve is capable of delivering 40% more flow than required. As pressure increases in our variable flow system our valve will deliver this extra pressure as flow.
