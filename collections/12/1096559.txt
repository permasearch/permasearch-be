The third season received mixed reviews. Positive reviews included Ken Tucker of Yahoo!, who wrote that "Under the Dome is certainly broadcast televisionâ€™s most enjoyable science-fiction/fantasy series, a summer treat that, while sometimes silly and over-the-top, is never less than energetically imaginative and aware of the history of its genre",[63] Scott Von Doviak of The A.V. Club, who wrote that "this show is always more fun when it leans into its sci-fi elements",[64] and Paul Dailly of TV Fanatic, who wrote that "All things considered, this was a solid, if unspectacular return for the show".[65] Negative reviews included Kevin Yeoman of ScreenRant, who wrote that "There is a certain joy that comes from watching something as consistently moronic as Under the Dome",[66] and Tim Surette of TV.com, who wrote that "it takes balls to think your audience is so dumb and brain dead that you feel the need to explain the big twist in the episode that's about to happen before the episode even begins".[67]
