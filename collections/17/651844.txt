During the British Raj, India experienced some of the worst famines ever recorded, including the Great Famine of 1876–1878, in which 6.1 million to 10.3 million people died[149] and the Indian famine of 1899–1900, in which 1.25 to 10 million people died.[150] Recent research, including work by Mike Davis and Amartya Sen,[151] argue that famines in India were made more severe by British policies in India. An El Niño event caused the Indian famine of 1876–1878.[152]
