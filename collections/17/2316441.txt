In their first appearance in the South Island the Lions played Otago on 18 June at Carisbrook Stadium. The stadium is known to visiting teams as the "House of Pain", particularly for the Lions who lost games to the Otago side on four previous tours. Otago began strongly and the Lions were penalised four times in the first eleven minutes, Otago converting two. The Lions' stronger scrum play brought them back into the game, and the first half was closely fought, ending 13â€“13. The Lions clearly had the momentum, as Will Greenwood had scored a try, converted by Charlie Hodgson, just before the break.
