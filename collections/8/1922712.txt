John Williams composed and conducted the score for the first two films. The main "shark" theme, a simple alternating pattern of two notes, E and F,[36] became a classic piece of suspense music, synonymous with approaching danger. Williams described the theme as having the "effect of grinding away at you, just as a shark would do, instinctual, relentless, unstoppable."[37] When the piece was first played for Spielberg, he was said to have laughed at Williams, thinking that it was a joke. Spielberg later said that without Williams' score the film would have been only half as successful, and Williams acknowledges that the score jumpstarted his career.[16] Williams won an Academy Award for Original Music Score for his work on the first film.[38]
