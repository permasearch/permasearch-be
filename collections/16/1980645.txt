Michael Bay was asked to direct by Spielberg on July 30, 2005,[22] but he dismissed the film as a "stupid toy movie".[23] Nonetheless, he wanted to work with Spielberg, and gained a new respect for the concept upon visiting Hasbro.[22] Bay considered the first draft "too kiddie", so he increased the military's role in the story.[22][24] The writers sought inspiration from G.I. Joe for the soldier characters, being careful not to mix the brands.[25] Bay based Lennox' struggle to get to the Pentagon phoneline while struggling with an unhelpful operator from a real account he was given by a soldier when working on another film.[22]
