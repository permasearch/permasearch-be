Pachimari are toys that appear through various Overwatch maps, customization items, and additional media. They are anime-like creatures shaped like an upside-down onion with cephalopod-type legs. Blizzard created the pachimari as they needed to have toys to populate UFO catchers on the Hanamura map. Their design was created by concept artist David Kang, who named them pachimari after the Korean word for "onion". Blizzard did not expect there to be much interest in pachimari, but there was a great deal of fan attention in the characters, with unlicensed plush toys, clothing, and other merchandise made by fans. Seeing this, Blizzard incorporated pachimari more into the game and media, including placing a "King Pachimari" atop the payload for the Junkertown map, and licensed official plush toys for purchase. Blizzard has stated since there is lore behind pachimari that they are waiting on introducing.[173]
