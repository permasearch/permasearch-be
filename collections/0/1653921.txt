Initial experiments on the reaction of carbon monoxide with metals were carried out by Justus von Liebig in 1834. By passing carbon monoxide over molten potassium he prepared a substance having the empirical formula KCO, which he called Kohlenoxidkalium.[55] As demonstrated later, the compound was not a metal carbonyl, but the potassium salt of Â´hexahydroxy benzene and the potassium salt of dihydroxy acetylene[31]
