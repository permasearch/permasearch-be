A noraebang (Korean: 노래방) refers to a singing venue in South Korea where private sound-proof rooms are available for rent, equipped for singing – typically microphones, remote controls, a large video screen, couches, and mood décor such as disco lights and tambourines. The term noraebang is a Korean compound word, blending norae (노래 - song) and bang (방 - room). It is the regional equivalent to the Karaoke box in Japan.[19]
