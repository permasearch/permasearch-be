Florida's stand-your-ground law went into effect on October 1, 2005. Florida state representative Dennis Baxley, an author of the law, said that the violent crime rate has dropped since the enactment of the law, though he said there may be many reasons for the change. Others have argued that the law may lead to an increase in crime.[48] Violent crime data for 1995 â€“ 2015 has been published by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.[49]
