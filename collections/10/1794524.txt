A Northâ€“South divide remains in education at all levels. There is a significant attainment gap between Northern and Southern schools, even after controlling for the economic difference across the country, and pupils in the three Northern regions are less likely than the national average to achieve five higher-tier GCSEs.[126] Northern students are under-represented at Oxbridge, where three times as many places go to Southerners as to Northerners, and other Southern universities while Southerners are under-represented at leading Northern universities such as Sheffield, Manchester and Leeds.[127]
