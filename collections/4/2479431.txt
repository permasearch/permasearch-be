In the episode "War Of The Gods, Parts One And Two", the charismatic miracle worker Count Iblis promises to Adama that he will deliver "the enemy", meaning Baltar, to the Colonials. Baltar, irritated that neither he nor his Cylon crew can explain the mysterious lights dogging his basestar, transmits a direct message to the Galactica requesting permission to board on a proposal of "universal truce". Adama instead seizes the opportunity to capture Baltar and his Raider, and have him tried by the Council for crimes against humanity, of which he is soon found guilty. For the remainder of the series, Baltar is a prisoner on board the Colonial prison barge. The episode "Baltar's Escape" features an attempt by Baltar and other imprisoned villains (Borellian Nomen and some Eastern Alliance officers) to escape from the prison barge. All do escape except for an overconfident Baltar, who witnesses a (cleverly exploited) malfunction in his re-activated Centurions which makes them destroy his Raider's launch panel instead of starting it, allowing the Galactica's people to re-apprehend him with little struggle.[citation needed]
