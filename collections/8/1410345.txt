Despite the declaration by the Irish government that participation in the war was illegal, around 250 Irishmen went to fight for the Republicans[citation needed] and around 700 of Eoin O'Duffy's followers ("The Blueshirts") went to Spain to fight on Franco's side. Both sides were former IRA members.
