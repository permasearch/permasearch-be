Lindsay Pulsipher was born and grew up in Salt Lake City, Utah, with five siblings,[4] and was inspired to be an actor by her mother, a theater actress. As she puts it, "I used to make either my little sister or my best friend act out these plays with me. I was doing that from the time I can remember. It was always something I enjoyed doing". She was influenced by Julie Christie and Audrey Hepburn who showed her "a whole new world as far as acting goes".[1]
