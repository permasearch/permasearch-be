The song describes a real-life dilemma faced by many hippies: whether to cut one's hair to a more practical length, or leave it long as a symbol of rebellion.[3] It was written by David Crosby, and features solo vocals by Crosby, with the rest of the band joining in on instruments rather than (as in many of their other songs) on vocal harmony. Unlike most of the tracks on DÃ©ja Vu, the quartet and their studio musicians,  Dallas Taylor (drums) and Greg Reeves (bass), all recorded it at the same place and time.[1] It was one of only two songs from the album that Neil Young joined in on despite not writing.[4]
