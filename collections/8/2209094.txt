The decision led Toronto City Council to debate withdrawing its Pride funding for 2017.[29] The motion to withdraw funding, put forward by councillor John Campbell, failed on a vote of 27-17.[30] A small group of Toronto residents organized a competing event with the theme of "first responder unity", which was scheduled for the same time as the main Pride parade but was located in another part of downtown Toronto.[31] The First Responder Unity event made unauthorized use of Pride's logo on its website, as well as making deceptive marketing claims in an apparent attempt to portray itself as the "real" Pride event, calling itself one of the world's largest LGBTQ events and claiming a million attendees — Pride's usual attendance figures — months before the Unity event's actual attendance figures could possibly even be predicted.[32] On June 19, however, Saunders publicly indicated that Toronto Police officers who wished to attend that event were also not permitted to do so in uniform.[33]
