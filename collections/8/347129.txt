A material commonly used in SSNTDs is polyallyl diglycol carbonate (PADC), also known as Tastrak, CR-39 and CR39. It is a clear, colorless, rigid plastic with the chemical formula C12H18O7. Etching to expose radiation damage is typically performed using solutions of caustic alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, often at elevated temperatures for several hours.
