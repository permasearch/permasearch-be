Two British film industry officials requested that the film be shot in the United Kingdom, offering their assistance in securing filming locations, the use of Leavesden Film Studios, as well as changing the UK's child labour laws (adding a small number of working hours per week and making the timing of on-set classes more flexible).[12] Warner Bros. accepted their proposal. Filming began on 17 September 2000 at Leavesden Film Studios and concluded on 23 March 2001,[42] with final work being done in July.[34][43] Principal photography took place on 2 October 2000 at North Yorkshire's Goathland railway station.[44] Canterbury Cathedral and Scotland's Inverailort Castle were both touted as possible locations for Hogwarts; Canterbury rejected Warner Bros. proposal due to concerns about the film's "pagan" theme.[45][46] Alnwick Castle and Gloucester Cathedral were eventually selected as the principal locations for Hogwarts,[12] with some scenes also being filmed at Harrow School.[47] Other Hogwarts scenes were filmed in Durham Cathedral over a two-week period;[48] these included shots of the corridors and some classroom scenes.[49] Oxford University's Divinity School served as the Hogwarts Hospital Wing, and Duke Humfrey's Library, part of the Bodleian, was used as the Hogwarts Library.[50] Filming for Privet Drive took place on Picket Post Close in Bracknell, Berkshire.[48] Filming in the street took two days instead of the planned single day, so payments to the street's residents were correspondingly increased.[48] For all the subsequent film's scenes set in Privet Drive, filming took place on a constructed set in Leavesden Film Studios, which proved to have been cheaper than filming on location.[51] London's Australia House was selected as the location for Gringotts Wizarding Bank,[12] while Christ Church, Oxford was the location for the Hogwarts trophy room.[52] London Zoo was used as the location for the scene in which Harry accidentally sets a snake on Dudley,[52] with King's Cross Station also being used as the book specifies.[53]
