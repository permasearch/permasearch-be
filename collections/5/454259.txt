The 8-0 Patriots faced the 7-0 Colts in the RCA Dome, the latest in a season that two undefeated teams had ever faced off. The Patriots had scored over 34 points in every game but the Colts defense stifled the Patriots' attack and Indianapolis clawed to a 20-10 lead in the fourth. But a 58-yard Tom Brady bomb to Randy Moss was caught at the Colts' 3-yard line, leading to a Wes Welker touchdown catch. After stopping Manning and forcing a punt, a strong kick return by Welker set up a three-play touchdown drive highlighted by a 32-yard catch by Dont√© Stallworth and a Kevin Faulk touchdown catch. Manning was hit and threw the ball into the hands of Rosevelt Colvin on the next Colts drive and the Patriots ran out the remaining clock for the 24-20 win.[citation needed] This win was number 9 in the Patriots' 16-0 regular season.
