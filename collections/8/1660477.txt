The Libyan National Army comprises a ground army, an air force and a navy. It is currently being re-established by the Libyan government[citation needed], as Libya's previous national army was defeated in the Libyan Civil War and disbanded. As of May 2012, an estimated 35,000 personnel have joined its ranks.[160]
