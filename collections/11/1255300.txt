The Santa Fe River is unusual in that it completely disappears underground and then reappears 3 miles (4.8Â km) downstream.  The river drops into a large sinkhole in O'Leno State Park and reappears in the adjacent River Rise Preserve State Park.  A map of the watershed clearly shows the gap in the river where it flows underground.[3] Springs like Gilchrist Blue, Ginnie, Hornsby, Lily, Poe, and Rum Island springs are located at the banks of the river, mostly downstream of the river's reappearance above ground level.[4]
