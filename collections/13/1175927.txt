Trevor is probably the kindest of the family, and the one his mother likes best. He was very nearly not home for one Christmas, much to Agnes's dismay (everyone else knew). However, in the middle of the party, Trevor walks through the door and Agnes bursts into tears, overjoyed. When he leaves for the missions in Series Two, he tells his mother that he doesn't want a big fuss like last time, his exact words being "no cake, no decorations, no brass band and please, Mammy, no tears". Agnes disobeys him and orders everything. Another Christmas time, Agnes is reading the letters her children sent to Father Christmas, and reads Trevor's. Trevor asks for his presents to be given to a poor boy with no toys.
