The earliest-surviving fragments of Sanskrit drama date from the 1st century CE.[7] The wealth of archeological evidence from earlier periods offers no indication of the existence of a tradition of theatre.[8] The Vedas (the earliest Indian literature, from between 1500 and 600 BCE) contain no hint of it; although a small number of hymns are composed in a form of dialogue), the rituals of the Vedic period do not appear to have developed into theatre.[8] The Mahābhāṣya by Patañjali contains the earliest reference to what may have been the seeds of Sanskrit drama.[9] This treatise on grammar from 140 BCE provides a feasible date for the beginnings of theatre in India.[9]
