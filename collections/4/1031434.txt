After the song's completion, it was mixed at The Hit Factory alongside the rest of Graceland, at an average of two days per song.[3] Simon's vocals on the song are rather quick-paced, which made them difficult to mix over the numerous instruments in the backing track. After much work on the track, Simon's long-time engineer Roy Halee used tape delays feeding separately into the two audio channels, which made the vocals clear.[3]
