Wegmans stores offer a prepared foods section called "Chefs Creations". Here, prepared entrees ranging in price from $6 to $10 are paired with two side dishes of the customers choosing. These meals can also come pre-packaged by the store for easy selection. In 2016, Wegmans began pushing their "EZ Meals" line of ready-to-eat, ready-to-cook, and fresh-cut entrees and dinners. These products are created in-store with the benefit of offering an easy to prepare meal.
