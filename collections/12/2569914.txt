The bats were entirely composed of computer-generated imagery since it was decided directing real bats on set would be problematic.[16] The Penguin's "bird army" was a combination of CGI, robotic creatures, men in suits and even real penguins.[25] Robotic penguin puppets were commissioned by Stan Winston. In total 30 African penguins and 12 king penguins were used.[37] A miniature effect was used for the exteriors of the Cobblepot Mansion in the opening scene and for Wayne Manor. The same method was used for the Bat Ski-boat and the exterior shots of the Gotham Zoo.[38]
