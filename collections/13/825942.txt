Jiaying Johnson (portrayed by Dichen Lachman)[167][168] is the Inhuman wife of Calvin Johnson, and Daisy's mother, who does not age and can heal rapidly thanks to an elder of her village giving their life each year. Pieced back together by Calvin after Whitehall dissects her to discover the secret to her abilities, Jiaying is never the same, and goes to great lengths to find her daughter, now willingly taking innocent lives to feed her abilities, having no regard for humans. Eventually Jiaying tries to escape this new persona by founding Afterlife, a haven for Inhumans, and when Daisy (going by Skye) journeys to Afterlife, Jiaying happily becomes her mentor. However, when S.H.I.E.L.D. discovers the location of Afterlife, Jiaying starts a war with them, and attempts to kill all humans with artificial Terrigen crystals. She even tries to drain Skye's life when the former turns on her, but is stopped by Calvin, who kills her. After Tony Caine gives Daisy the information about the modified Project Centipede serum that John Garrett used, she goes to the graveyard and starts exhuming Jaiying's grave.
