In 2014, as part of an exclusive programming deal with Disney, Turner Classic Movies agreed to become the sponsor of the attraction. The attraction underwent a refurbishment in 2015, with the addition of a new pre-show and post-show hosted by Robert Osborne, who also provided onboard narration to the ride.[3] The changes were unveiled on May 29, 2015.[8] On July 15, 2017, it was announced that the attraction would be closing on August 13, 2017 to make way for Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway.[1]
