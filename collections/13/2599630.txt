A common convention for wiring systems in industrial buildings is: black jacket – AC less than 7003100000000000000♠1,000 volts, blue jacket – DC or communications, orange jacket – medium voltage 7003230000000000000♠2,300 or 7003416000000000000♠4,160 V, red jacket 7004138000000000000♠13,800 V or higher. Red-jacketed cable is also used for relatively low-voltage fire alarm wiring, but has a much different appearance.
