Redman recalled the writing of the song was through an initial idea or suggestion from co-writer Jonas Myrin. Redman told Worship Leader magazine: "He [Myrin] played me an idea for some of the chorus melody, and I found it immediately inspiring. In fact, it felt like a perfect fit for a song based on the opening of Psalm 103. The song came together really quickly - a good chunk of the song was actually a spontaneous moment",[1] adding that the song reiterates how "we live beneath an unceasing flow of goodness, kindness, greatness, and holiness, and every day we're given reason after reason why Jesus is so completely and utterly worthy of our highest and best devotion".[1]
