In many cases, the manipulated variable output by the PID controller is a dimensionless fraction between 0 and 100% of some maximum possible value, and the translation into real units (such as pumping rate or watts of heater power) is outside the PID controller. The process variable, however, is in dimensioned units such as temperature. It is common in this case to express the gain      K  p     {\displaystyle K_{p}}   not as "output per degree", but rather in the form of a temperature     1  /   K  p     {\displaystyle 1/K_{p}}   which is "degrees per full output". This is the range over which the output changes from 0 to 1 (0% to 100%).
