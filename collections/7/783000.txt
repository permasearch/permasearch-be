Although the ISS uses Whipple shielding to protect itself from minor debris,[75] portions (notably its solar panels) cannot be protected easily. In 1989, the ISS panels were predicted to degrade c. 0.23% in four years, and they were overdesigned by 1%.[76] A maneuver is performed if "there is a greater than one-in-10,000 chance of a debris strike".[77] As of JanuaryÂ 2014[update], there have been sixteen maneuvers in the fifteen years the ISS had been in orbit.[77]
