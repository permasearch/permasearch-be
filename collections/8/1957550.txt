Although the majority of Little Hell Gate has been filled in, this bridge still exists.[note 1] Some time after the rail bridge was built, a 1,000-foot (300Â m) long, 3 span, steel arch road bridge, designed by George Washington Bridge-engineer Othmar Ammann, was also built across Little Hell Gate, just a short distance to the north west of the rail bridge.[note 2]
