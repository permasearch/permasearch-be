On March 29, 2006 Sampson was named the head coach at Indiana University following the resignation of Mike Davis.[2] Sampson was the second minority coach in the history of the Hoosier basketball program behind Mike Davis. Upon taking the reins of the Indiana Hoosiers he noted, "I love my job at Oklahoma and I would not leave OU for any job unless it was a job like Indiana. My family and I have had 12 great years at Oklahoma, the best years of our life, but Indiana is one of the great programs in college basketball and if they call and offer, it is a job as a coach that you have to take."[3]
