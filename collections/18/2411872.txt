Archaeological evidence shows that the island was settled at least by the early years of the first millennium AD.[citation needed] This includes the city of Leluh that existed from about 1250 AD, and in its heyday had a population of about 1,500 and covered some 27 hectares. It featured burial pyramids for the nobility.[4]
