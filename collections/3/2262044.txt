On 7 March 1936,[8] Adolf Hitler took a massive gamble by sending 30,000 troops into the Rhineland. As Hitler and other Nazis admitted, the French army alone could have destroyed the Wehrmacht.[9] The French passed the problem to the British, who found that the Germans had the right to "enter their own backyard", and no action was taken.[10] In the League of Nations, the Soviet delegate Maxim Litvinov was the only one who proposed economic sanctions against Germany.[8][11] According to historian Samuel Mitcham, the Rhineland crisis was the last chance for the Allies to defeat Hitler while the odds were overwhelmingly on their side. All restraint on German rearmament could now be removed, and was. France's eastern allies (the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia) concluded that since the French refused to defend their own border, they certainly would not stand up for their allies in the East. Hitler could now continue eroding the alliance system that France had built since 1919.[12] On October 16, 1936, Belgium repudiated the 1921 alliance with France and declared its absolute neutrality.[13] In October 1937, Belgium signed a non-aggression pact with Germany.[14]
