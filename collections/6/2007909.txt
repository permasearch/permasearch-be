Coach Schneider is the abusive coach of Jesse and Ron. After struggling to sleep and experiencing strange events around his home, Jesse finds himself wandering the streets and seeks shelter from the rain inside a sadomasochistic nightclub where he is confronted by Schneider while attempting to drink alcohol. Schneider forces him to go to the school and run laps as punishment. When Jesse begins showering, Schneider experiences strange events in his office as objects begin to fly from their shelves and furniture moves around. A skipping rope binds his arms seemingly on their own and he is dragged into the showers and restrained before Jesse. Freddy Krueger takes over Jesse's body and slashes at Schneider's back, killing him.[5]
