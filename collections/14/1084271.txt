"A person who is conscious of grave [mortal] sin is not to celebrate Mass or receive the body of the Lord without previous sacramental confession unless there is a grave reason and there is no opportunity to confess; in this case the person is to remember the obligation to make an act of perfect contrition which includes the resolution of confessing as soon as possible." [46] Catholics must receive the Eucharist at least once a year - if possible, during Eastertide -[47] but for grave reason (such as illness or child rearing) or dispensation are excused from attending Mass.[48] In some countries a custom has recently arisen whereby someone who for some reason, such as not being a Catholic or not being in the state of grace, or not old enough to receive communion, cannot receive Communion may with arms crossed approach the priest who is distributing the Eucharist and receive from him a blessing instead.
