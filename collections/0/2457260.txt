At the time of the decision, five states required abortion clinics to operate under "hospital-like" standards: Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Tennessee, though in the last of these a court order prevented enforcement. Nine states required doctors to have hospital admitting privileges, of which three were enforcing that requirement – North Dakota, Missouri, and Tennessee – and 6 were not – Wisconsin, Kansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.[37]
