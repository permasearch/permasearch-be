Faris attended Edmonds-Woodway High School (from where she graduated in 1994), and while studying, she performed onstage with a Seattle repertory company and in nationally broadcast radio plays. She once described herself as a drama-club "dork", stating that she used to wear a Christmas-tree skirt in school and did not date until senior year. "I liked guys, but no one really liked me", she recalled.[3] She then attended the University of Washington and earned a degree in English literature in 1999.[5] Despite her love for acting, Faris admitted she "never really thought [she] wanted to become a movie star" and continued to act "just to make some extra money", hoping one day to publish a novel.[3][13] After graduating from college, Faris was going to travel to London, where she had a receptionist job lined up at an ad agency. However, she ended up living in Los Angeles "at the last minute", once she committed to the idea of pursuing mainstream acting, eventually getting the starring role in Scary Movie.[13] At 22, she lived on her own in a studio apartment located at the Ravenswood in Hancock Park.[13]
