Herr Pfister (the agent who hired the Brits) is late with the wages. We are introduced to the hardcase McGowan for the first time. Dennis & Oz take a trip to Li√©ge to watch Sunderland A.F.C. even though they are Newcastle United F.C. fans. Oz's wife Marjorie meets Dennis's wife Vera as she has not heard from Oz in a month. Oz receives a letter from his wife, Marjorie. He sends it back marked 'not known at this address' to avoid sending her any money.
