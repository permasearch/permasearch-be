Measurement of mb has changed several times.[30] As originally defined by Gutenberg (1945c) mb was based on the maximum amplitude of waves in the first 10 seconds or more.  However, the length of the period influences the magnitude obtained.  Early USGS/NEIC practice was to measure mb on the first second (just the first few P-waves[31]), but since 1978 they measure the first twenty seconds.[32] The modern practice is to measure short-period mb scale at less than three seconds, while the broadband mBBB scale is measured at periods of up to 30 seconds.[33]
