As of 2013[update], only about 15% of the population of the emirate was made up of UAE nationals,[101] with the rest comprising expatriates, many of whom either have been in the country for generations or were born in the UAE.[102][103] Approximately 85% of the expatriate population (and 71% of the emirate's total population) was Asian, chiefly Indian (51%) and Pakistani (16%); other significant Asian groups include Bangladeshis (9%) and Filipinos (3%). There is a sizable community of Somalis numbering around 30,000, as well as other communities of various nationalities.[104] A quarter of the population (local and foreign) reportedly traces their origins to Iran.[105] In addition, 16% of the population (or 288,000 persons) living in collective labour accommodation were not identified by ethnicity or nationality, but were thought to be primarily Asian.[106] There are over 100,000 British expatriates in Dubai, by far the largest group of Western expatriates in the city.[107] The median age in the emirate was about 27 years. In 2014, there were estimated to be 15.54 births and 1.99 deaths per 1,000 people.[108] There are other Arab nationals, including GCC nationals.[citation needed]
