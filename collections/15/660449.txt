To check the power of the captain even further, the crew would elect a quartermaster to make sure the men received the necessary rations and equal distribution of the booty.[1]:66 He would also "adjudicate crew member conflicts," and "administer punishment."[20]:35 This was usually an experienced seaman who the crew trusted and knew well.[1]:66 Leeson further states that a pirate captain could not take any action without the support of the quartermaster.[20]:36 One such was Hendrick van der Heul who sailed with William Kidd. He had the fortune to have never been convicted of Piracy and lived a full life beyond his days on the Adventure Prize.
