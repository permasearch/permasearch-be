In April 2009, more than 100 college and university presidents signed the Amethyst Initiative.[3]  The Amethyst Initiative seeks to spark discussion about the current drinking age, problems related to underage drinking, and to develop new ideas about the best ways to prepare young adults to make responsible decisions about alcohol.[4]  One preventative component of this that many campuses have adopted is requiring an online alcohol education course before registering for classes.  Another option to better handle underage drinking is the introduction of medical amnesty policies.
