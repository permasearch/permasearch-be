Evelyn Burnaby was the younger brother of the famous English Long Rider Colonel Frederick Burnaby. Whereas the elder brother was famous for having ridden across Central Asia and the Ottoman Empire, Evelyn decided to keep his equestrian adventures closer to home. He set off in 1892 to ride from Land’s End, Cornwall to John o’ Groats, Scotland. Evelyn’s journey was soon serialised in a popular publication, "The Country Gentleman" and was published in book form the following year.
