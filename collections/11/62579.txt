In the United Kingdom, increasing numbers of people have adopted a vegetarian diet since the end of World War II.[108] The Food Standards Agency Public Attitudes to Food Survey 2009 reported that 3% of respondents were found to be "completely vegetarian", with an additional 5% "partly vegetarian (do not eat some types of fish or meat)".[40] The UK's National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) reported in 2014 that its four-year study found 2.6% of adults and 1.9% of children were vegetarian.[41] The "How many vegans?" survey conducted in May 2016 by the Vegan Society found that 3.25% of UK residents were vegetarian or vegan, while 1.05% were vegan.[42] Some less formal market studies suggest that vegetarians constitute 7% to 11% of the UK adult population (4 million people).[109][110][111] There are twice as many vegetarian women as men.[111] According to Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, the UK has the third highest rate of vegetarianism in the European Union.[90] Flexitarianism is also becoming more popular in the UK.[112]
