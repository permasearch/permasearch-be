On 14 February 2007, a German translation of RuneScape was introduced,[66] followed by a French translation on 11 December 2008,[67] Brazilian Portuguese on 24 July 2009,[68] and Latin American Spanish on 25 April 2013.[69] In an interview in May 2008, former Jagex CEO Geoff Iddison stated that, "We do plan to go East with it [RuneScape] to the Asian market and the Eastern European market too" [...] "RuneScape is not for Japan, but it could work well in Malaysia for example. And where's India in all this? I think RuneScape is a game that would be adopted in the English-speaking Indian world and the local-speaking Indian world. We're looking at all those markets individually."[70] RuneScape later launched in India through the gaming portal Zapak on 8 October 2009,[71] and in France and Germany through Bigpoint Games on 27 May 2010.[72]
