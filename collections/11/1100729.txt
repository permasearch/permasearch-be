Tuna is canned in edible vegetable oils, in brine, in water, or in various sauces. In the US, it is sometimes called tuna fish. In the United States, only albacore can legally be sold in canned form as "white meat tuna";[12] in other countries, yellowfin is also acceptable. While in the early 1980s, canned tuna in Australia was most likely Southern bluefin; as of  2003[update] it was usually yellowfin, skipjack, or tongol (labelled "Northern bluefin").[13]
