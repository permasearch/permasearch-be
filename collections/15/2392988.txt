In 2011, Toad plays a role in the 3DS title Super Mario 3D Land in which he, upon his rescue at the end of World One, assists Mario throughout the rest of the adventure through the availability of Toad Houses, where he provides items and uncovering secrets for Mario in the various levels.[17] Toad also appears as a prominent character in New Super Mario Bros. 2 where he runs the Toad Houses once again to assist both Mario and Luigi throughout the game.[18] In Super Mario 3D World, both the Toad character (cap colored blue), and Captain Toad returning from Super Mario Galaxy' are playable but only the former appears in the major game, while Captain Toad, playable for the first time, has his own levels "The Adventures of Captain Toad" separate from the main playable characters.[19] In "The Adventures of Captain Toad", Captain Toad must collect five Green Stars without jumping, and two hits will result in a lost in life, but he can use his headlight to destroy any ghosts in his levels. The Toad runs the fastest but jumps the lowest and falls faster. Captain Toad later starred in his eponymous spin-off game a year after Super Mario 3D World was released.
