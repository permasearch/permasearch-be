With the construction of the extensions and connecting turnpikes, the highway was envisioned to be a part of a system of toll roads stretching from Maine to Chicago.[213] When the Delaware River Bridge was completed in 1956, a motorist could drive from New York City to Indiana on limited-access toll roads.[212] By 1957, it was possible to drive from New York City to Chicago without encountering a traffic signal.[214]
