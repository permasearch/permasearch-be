Many of the cast members at the time were relatively unknown actorsâ€”Texans who had played roles in commercials, television, and stage shows, as well as performers whom Hooper knew personally, such as Allen Danziger and Jim Siedow.[19][20][21] Involvement in the film propelled some of them into the motion picture industry. The lead role of Sally was given to Marilyn Burns, who had appeared previously on stage and served on the film commission board at UT Austin while studying there.[20] Teri McMinn was a student who worked with local theater companies, including the Dallas Theater Center.[20] Henkel called McMinn to come in for a reading after he spotted her picture in the Austin American-Statesman.[22] For her last call-back he requested that she wear short shorts, which proved to be the most comfortable of all the cast members' costumes.[20]
