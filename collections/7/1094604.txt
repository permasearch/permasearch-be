An infinitesimal formula for an infinitely tall, unit impulse delta function (infinitesimal version of Cauchy distribution) explicitly appears in an 1827 text of Augustin Louis Cauchy.[15] Sim√©on Denis Poisson considered the issue in connection with the study of wave propagation as did Gustav Kirchhoff somewhat later. Kirchhoff and Hermann von Helmholtz also introduced the unit impulse as a limit of Gaussians, which also corresponded to Lord Kelvin's notion of a point heat source. At the end of the 19th century, Oliver Heaviside used formal Fourier series to manipulate the unit impulse.[16] The Dirac delta function as such was introduced as a "convenient notation" by Paul Dirac in his influential 1930 book The Principles of Quantum Mechanics.[17] He called it the "delta function" since he used it as a continuous analogue of the discrete Kronecker delta.
