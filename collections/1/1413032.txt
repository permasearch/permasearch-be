After Ned brings his 'Anthropology of the Occult' teacher a spirit board and she starts getting haunted, she has to forget everything she thought she knew about the paranormal world in order for Melinda to help her. At first, Mel, Ned and Eli think the ghost might be her late fiancé, who died three years ago, but it turns out to be the daughter of the guy who drove the car that killed Avery's fiancé, probably blaming her for her death because she had sent the text her fiancé was answering at the time of the accident. Melinda gets a message on the spirit board she took away from Ned-that someone they know will die soon.
