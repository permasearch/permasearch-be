In October 1960, Foucault took a tenured post in philosophy at the University of Clermont-Ferrand, commuting to the city every week from Paris,[82] where he lived in a high-rise block on the rue du Dr Finlay.[83] Responsible for teaching psychology, which was subsumed within the philosophy department, he was considered a "fascinating" but "rather traditional" teacher at Clermont.[84] The department was run by Jules Vuillemin, who soon developed a friendship with Foucault.[85] Foucault then took Vuillemin's job when the latter was elected to the Coll√®ge de France in 1962.[86] In this position, Foucault took a dislike to another staff member whom he considered stupid: Roger Garaudy, a senior figure in the Communist Party. Foucault made life at the university difficult for Garaudy, leading the latter to transfer to Poitiers.[87] Foucault also caused controversy by securing a university job for his lover, the philosopher Daniel Defert, with whom he retained a non-monogamous relationship for the rest of his life.[88]
