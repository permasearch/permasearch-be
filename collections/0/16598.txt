Under British law, the Isle of Man is not part of the United Kingdom. However, the UK takes care of its external and defence affairs.[42] There are no independent military forces on the Isle of Man, although HMS Ramsey is affiliated with the town of the same name.[43] From 1938 to 1955 there was the Manx Regiment of the British Territorial Army, which saw extensive action during the Second World War.[44] In 1779, the Manx Fencible Corps, a fencible regiment of three companies, was raised; it was disbanded in 1783 at the end of the American War of Independence. Later, the Royal Manx Fencibles was raised at the time of the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars. The 1st Battalion (of 3 companies) was raised in 1793. A 2nd Battalion (of 10 companies) was raised in 1795,[45] and it saw action during the Irish Rebellion of 1798. The regiment was disbanded in 1802.[46] A third body of Manx Fencibles was raised in 1803 to defend the Island during the Napoleonic Wars and to assist the Revenue. It was disbanded in 1811.[47] In 2015 a multi-capability recruiting and training unit of the British Army Reserve was established in Douglas.[48]
