Controversy arose out the safe-haven law enacted in Nebraska in July 2008: the Nebraska law in force at the time was interpreted to define a child as anyone under 18,[6] and resulted in the desertion of children older than infants, some as old as teenage years.[7] Under the prior version of the law, at least 35 children were dropped off in Nebraska hospitals in a four-month span, at least 5 of them from other US states.[8] The law was changed in November 2008, allowing only infants up to 30 days old to be surrendered.
