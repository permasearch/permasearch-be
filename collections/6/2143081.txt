The Autumn Oaks is held in Richmond, Indiana and attracts competitors from 39 states and Canada.[12] Another large annual hunt is the Grand American Coon Hunt, which has been held in Orangeburg, South Carolina since 1965 and is sanctioned by the American Coon Hunters' Association.[23] It includes a popular bench or conformation show in addition to the hunting competition, and has special events for children who hunt or own coonhounds.[24] In addition to the larger all-breed hunts, the UKC also holds a number of nite hunts each year that are breed-specific, meaning that they are limited to dogs of only one breed. The Southeastern Treeing Walker Conference is an example of this.[25] The American Kennel Club and other kennel clubs also sanction coon hunting competitions.[26]
