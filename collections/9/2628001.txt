There are eighteen social sororities represented at Auburn University. The Auburn Panhellenic community donates roughly $500,000 and over 60,000 hours to various philanthropies every year.[66] Sorority recruitment is a week-long process held by the Panhellenic Council in August of every year. Each sorority at Auburn has over 200 members. Sororities are located not in individual houses like Auburn fraternities, but in The Village on campus in Magnolia Hall, Oak Hall, and Willow Hall. Each of the three buildings house six sororities. Each sorority has an individual "chapter" room on the first floor for meetings and a "hall" where members can live located above on the second, third, or fourth floor of the same building. Usually the sorority's officers and members of the sophomore class live on the "hall". Housing sororities on campus keeps dues for these sororities among the lowest in the nation.
