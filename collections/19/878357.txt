On June 15, 2010, Gardner ate a last meal of steak, lobster tail, apple pie, vanilla ice cream and 7-Up, before beginning a 48-hour fast while watching The Lord of the Rings film trilogy and reading Divine Justice.[54] According to his lawyers, the fast was motivated by "spiritual reasons."[3] Gardner was visited by an LDS bishop and his family before his execution.[48][55] Gardner walked voluntarily to his place of execution.[56] When asked if he had any last words, he responded, "I do not, no."[57]
