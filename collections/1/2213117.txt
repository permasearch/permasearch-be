At the time of his casting in 2001, Richter was unknown, working mainly as a street mime, leading a troupe in London. Kubrick made him largely responsible for choreographing the "Dawn of Man" sequence, believing Richter could take the film away from Hollywood clichÃ©s of men in monkey suits. Richter and his troupe spent hours watching apes in the London zoo, particularly the especially popular Guy the Gorilla, followed by hours of rehearsal mimicking their movements. Following 2001, Richter made an appearance in the film The Revolutionary.[1] In 2002, Richter published a book about his experiences entitled Moonwatcher's Memoir: A Diary of 2001: A Space Odyssey.[2]
