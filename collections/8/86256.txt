The first of the public/private partnerships is The Oklahoma Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul Technology Center (MROTC),[8] managed by Battelle Oklahoma, owned by Oklahoma Industries Authority (OIA),[9] and partners with the Department of Defense to provide a national center for technical solutions[clarification needed] to aging commercial and military aircraft. The MROTC[10] is a 370-acre (1.5Â km2) MRO facility, on the south east site of Tinker AFB, sharing runways and security with the base. The MROTC complex is planned as a major military and commercial aircraft facility with 17 hangars and more than one million square feet of related industrial space and education and training facilities. The facility currently houses three hangars, one leased by Boeing (designed to accommodiate Boeing 767-400 class aircraft), a second hangar for 767 for lease, and a third hangar designed to accommodate Boeing 707-300 class aircraft.[11]
