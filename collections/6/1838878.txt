Culture has an influence on our Nonverbal communication in a variety of different factors. For example, in some cultures eye contact is not essential, therefore those who do use eye contact may find it hard to talk or listen to someone who is not looking at them.[6] Another example is touching as a form of greeting may be perceived as impolite to some cultures whereas it is seen as a norm to others.[21] It is important to acknowledge these cultural differences, and be understanding of them so better non verbal communication can be established.[25]
