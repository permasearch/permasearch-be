"You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine" (written by Kenny Gamble & Leon Huff) is a song performed by R&B singer Lou Rawls on his 1976 album All Things in Time. The song proved to be Rawls' breakthrough hit, reaching number one on both the R&B[1] and Easy Listening charts as well as number four on the dance chart [2] and number two on the US Billboard Hot 100, where it was kept from the top spot for two weeks by "You Should Be Dancing" by The Bee Gees[3] and "(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty" by KC and the Sunshine Band,[4] respectively. This was the first and only time that one of Rawls' records managed to reach Billboard's pop top ten. It was the first big hit for Philadelphia International to feature the reformulated MFSB, after many of the original members left Gamble and Huff for better opportunities.[5] The song started Rawls' live shows from 1977 on.
