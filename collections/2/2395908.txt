The Detour was a choice between Make Your Move or Make Your Meal. In Make Your Move, teams had to set up a human chess board at the Temple of Literature. Using a local cờ tướng board as a reference, teams had to find four human chess pieces that had symbols matching the pieces on the board, and then set them up with four staffs in position on the human chess board. When the board was correctly matched, they receive their next clue. In Make Your Meal, teams had to prepare Vietnam's national dish phở. Teams had to pick up four baskets (two empty and two with live chickens) at the Ngoc Son Temple, then they had to navigate at the street market to pick up the rest of the ingredients on a shopping list of specific weights or amounts. After acquiring the ingredients, teams had to find a cooking station to cook two phở soups. Once the phở was made to chef's approval, he would give them their next clue.
