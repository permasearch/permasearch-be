Over the years, there have been many security vulnerabilities in Microsoft's implementation of the protocol or components on which it directly relies.[54][55] Other vendors' security vulnerabilities lie primarily in a lack of support for newer authentication protocols like NTLMv2 and Kerberos in favor of protocols like NTLMv1, LanMan, or plaintext passwords. Real-time attack tracking[56] shows that SMB is one of the primary attack vectors for intrusion attempts,[57] for example the 2014 Sony Pictures attack,[58] and the WannaCry ransomware attack of 2017.[59]
