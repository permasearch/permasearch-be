The Navy[m] (海軍, Kaigun), translated as the "Marines" in FUNimation's English dub,[n] are a maritime force under the command of the World Government. Currently the position of fleet admiral, who is the leader of the organization, is occupied by Akainu. The greatest forces are the three admirals, who are currently Kizaru, Fujitora, and Ryokugyu. The corrupted Commander Ax-Hand Morgan (father of Helmeppo) was the first high ranking commander of the Navy depicted in the series until stripped of his status when he was defeated by Luffy.
