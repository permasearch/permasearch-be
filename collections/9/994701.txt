On 19 September 1985, an earthquake (8.1 on the Richter scale) struck Michoac√°n, inflicting severe damage on Mexico City. Estimates of the number of dead range from 6,500 to 30,000.[94] Public anger at the PRI's mishandling of relief efforts combined with the ongoing economic crisis led to a substantial weakening of the PRI. As a result, for the first time since the 1930s, the PRI began to face serious electoral challenges.
