In the past, glove compartments typically contained an internal light, which automatically turned on when the box was opened, facilitating the finding of materials therein. During the 2000s, many manufacturers, started omitting the glove compartment light to cut costs, even in luxury vehicles. To date, aftermarket parts manufacturers have not provided solutions for this omission.[1]
