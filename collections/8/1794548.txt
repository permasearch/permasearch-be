The North is known for its often crumbly cheeses, of which Cheshire cheese is the earliest example. Unlike Southern cheeses like Cheddar, Northern cheeses typically use uncooked milk and a pre-salted curd pressed under enormous weights, resulting in a moist, sharp-tasting cheese.[215] Wensleydale, another crumbly cheese, is unusual in that it is often served as a side to sweet cakes,[216] which are themselves well represented in Northern England. Parkin, an oatmeal cake with black treacle and ginger, is a traditional treat across the North on Bonfire Night,[217] and the fruity scone-like singing hinny and fat rascal are popular in the North East and Yorkshire respectively.[218]
