In January 2003, Hardy briefly turned into a heel (villain) after he attacked Van Dam and Shawn Michaels.[1][54][55] It ended a month later when he saved Stacy Keibler from an attack by then-villain, Christian.[56] In February, he had a brief program with Michaels, which saw the two team up.[51][57] Then, in storyline, Hardy began dating Trish Stratus after saving her from Steven Richards and Victoria in March.[58] Hardy and Stratus had a brief on-screen relationship that saw the duo talking backstage and teaming together in matches. Hardy competed in his final match (his first departure) against The Rock and lost.[1][59] Hardy was released from WWE on April 22, 2003.[1][60] The reasons given for the release were Hardy's erratic behavior, drug use, refusal to go to rehab, deteriorating ring performance, as well as constant tardiness and no-showing events.[7][60] Hardy also cites "burn out" and the need for time off as reasons for leaving WWE.[23]
