The first season of Parks and Recreation received mixed to negative reviews, with many critics deeming it too similar to The Office, which shared the same mock documentary style as Parks and Recreation. In particular, several commentators said the naive and well-meaning Leslie Knope character too closely resembled The Office protagonist Michael Scott, a well-intentioned but dimwitted protagonist manager of a paper company sales office.[nb 1] However, most critics declared the second season a vast improvement over the first,[nb 2] with some even claiming it had surpassed The Office and 30 Rock as the best comedy of NBC's Thursday line-up.[69][93] It was declared the best comedy of the television season by Entertainment Weekly writer Henning Fog and The Star-Ledger television columnist Alan Sepinwall.[83][93] Entertainment Weekly writer Michael Ausiello, who was critical of the first season, called it the "most improved" show of the season.[88] Time magazine writer James Poniewozik included Parks and Recreation in his list of the 10 best television shows of 2009,[94] and IGN declared it the best comedy series of 2009.[95] Several reviewers called the second season one of the most impressive comebacks in television history.[96][97][98]
