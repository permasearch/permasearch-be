Identifying the song as "where the genius of music as storytelling kicks in," Simon Brew of Den of Geek felt that "Something There" is "the track with the heaviest workload." The author observed that "In two minutes and 19 seconds, [the song] gets across just how the position and feelings of the characters have changed."[22] For instance, "At the beginning of 'Something There,' Belle admits that she thought the Beast was mean, coarse, and unrefined. By the end, sheâ€™s feeling pretty smitten," according to Oh My Disney.[23] The song also depicts the film's passing of time,[24] while providing audiences with an opportunity "to appreciate Beast and first see the potential for Belle and him."[25] On the song's role in the special edition version of the film, co-director Kirk Wise explained, "There's a ... little suite of music now that starts with 'Something There' ... which segues into 'Human Again' which gives the object perspective on what they hope for when [Belle and the Beast] fall in love and that transitions into 'Beauty and the Beast' the ballad, which is the culmination of their relationship."[26] Dubbing the song "soliloquies of Belle and the Beast," TV Guide drew comparisons between "Something There" and songs from the musical South Pacific.[27]
