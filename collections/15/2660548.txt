President Lyndon B. Johnson dug the ceremonial first-shovel of earth at the groundbreaking for the Kennedy Center December 2, 1964.[15] However, debate continued for another year over the Foggy Bottom site, with some advocating for another location on Pennsylvania Avenue.[12] Excavation of the site got underway on December 11, 1965, and the site was cleared by January 1967.[16]
