While the number of centenarians per capita was much lower in ancient times than today, the data suggest that they were not unheard of. However, ancient demographics and chronicles are biased in favor of wealthy or powerful individuals rather than the ordinary person. A rare glimpse of an ordinary person is the legionary veteran Julius Valens whose tombstone states he lived 100 years - "VIXIT ANNIS C".[69] Grmek and Gourevitch speculate that during the Classical Greek period, anyone who lived past the age of five years – surviving all the common childhood illnesses of that era – had a reasonable chance of living to a relatively old age. Life expectancy in 400 BC was estimated to be around 30 years.[where?] One demographer of ancient civilizations reported that Greek men lived to 45 years on average (based on a sample size of 91), while women lived to 36.2 years (based on a sample size of 55). Notably, the gender statistics are inverted compared to today – childbirth at the time had a far higher mortality rate than in modern times, skewing female statistics downward. It was common for average citizens to take great care in their hygiene, Mediterranean diet and exercise, although there was much more male trauma per capita than today, due to military service being virtually universal for citizens of Ancient Greece. This also biased the statistics for men downward.[70]
