On 25 July 2007, the then Defence Secretary Des Browne, announced the order for two new carriers.[20] At the time of approval the first carrier was expected to enter service in July 2015 and the budget was £4,085m for two ships.[21] The financial crisis led to a political decision in December 2008 to slow production, delaying Queen Elizabeth until May 2016. This added £1,560m to the cost.[21] By March 2010 the budget was estimated at £5,900m[21] and in November 2013 the contract was renegotiated with a budget of £6,200m.[22] The in-service date was further extended to 2020 in the Strategic Defence and Security Review in October 2010.[23]
