Formal education was brought to the Philippines by the Spaniards, which was conducted mostly by religious orders.[7] Upon learning the local languages and writing systems, they began teaching Christianity, the Spanish language, and Spanish culture.[8] These religious orders opened the first schools and universities as early as the 16th century. Spanish missionaries established schools immediately after reaching the islands. The Augustinians opened a parochial school in Cebu in 1565. The Franciscans, took to the task of improving literacy in 1577, aside from the teaching of new industrial and agricultural techniques. The Jesuits followed in 1581, as well as the Dominicans in 1587, setting up a school in Bataan.[9] The church and the school cooperated to ensure that Christian villages had schools for students to attend.[10]
