The misattribution of arousal study tested Schachter and Singer's two-factor theory of emotion.  Psychologists Donald G. Dutton and Arthur P. Aron wanted to use a natural setting that would induce physiological arousal.   In this experiment, they had male participants walk across two different styles of bridges.  One bridge was a very scary (arousing) suspension bridge, which was very narrow and suspended above a deep ravine.  The second bridge was much safer and more stable than the first.
