The Warriors opened the 2015–16 season going 24–0, the most wins without a loss to start a season in NBA history and the second-longest winning streak in NBA history (28). By the All-Star break, the Warriors' record was a stellar 48–4, including a pair of regular season victories against Cleveland. This was the best record at an all-star break in league history. Curry, Thompson, and Draymond Green earned all-star selections. Golden State went on to break the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls 72–10 season record by winning 73 games. Stephen Curry became the first unanimous MVP in the history of the NBA that year.
