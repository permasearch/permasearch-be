The Constitution of India is the supreme law of India.[1] It lays down the framework defining fundamental political principles, establishes the structure, procedures, powers and duties of government institutions and sets out fundamental rights, directive principles and the duties of citizens. It is the longest written constitution of any sovereign country in the world.[Note 1][2] B. R. Ambedkar, the chairman of the Drafting Committee, is widely considered to be its chief architect.
