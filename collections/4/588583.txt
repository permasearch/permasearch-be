Sustainable development, or sustainability, has been described in terms of three spheres, dimensions, domains or pillars, i.e. the environment, the economy and society. The three-sphere framework was initially proposed by the economist RenÃ© Passet in 1979.[14] It has also been worded as "economic, environmental and social" or "ecology, economy and equity".[15] This has been expanded by some authors to include a fourth pillar of culture, institutions or governance,[15] or alternatively reconfigured as four domains of the social - ecology, economics, politics and culture,[16] thus bringing economics back inside the social, and treating ecology as the intersection of the social and the natural.[17]
