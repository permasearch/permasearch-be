There are 27 service areas along the Thruway, all on the New York–Ripley mainline. The service areas, called "travel plazas" by the New York State Thruway Authority (NYSTA), are spaced roughly 30 miles (48 km) apart and are open at all hours of the day. Two plazas—the Angola service area at milepost 447 and the New Baltimore plaza at milepost 127—are accessible from both directions of the Thruway; the remainder are accessible from only one direction. Each plaza features a gas station and a variety of restaurants, at least one of which is open 24 hours.[46] Free Wi-Fi service was added to all 27 service areas on March 1, 2007.[47]
