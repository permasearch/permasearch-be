On December 19, 1868 a large Comanche and Kiowa band faced a company of 10 Cavalry (maj. M.H. Kidd) on the way from Fort Arbuckle to Fort Cobb. On December 25, six companies of the 6 Cavalry and one company of 37 Infantry (maj. A.W. Evans), on the way from Fort Bascom (New Mexico) to the Antelope Hills, came on the Nokoni village (about 60 tipis) of Tʉhʉyakwahipʉ aka Kiyou ("Horseback") and Tahka ("Arrowpoint"), where Yamparika chief Howea ("Gap-in-the-Wood") was as a visitor; Kiyou, the peaceful civil chief, was not in the camp, and Tahka’s blood was still boiling after the Washita massacre. Seeing the soldiers arriving, Tahka, the war chief, led the Comanche warriors in a charge, but he was killed and the village and the stoks went destroyed. Kiowa warriors led by Manyi-ten came to take part in the fight; only one soldier was killed. In December 1868, exhausted after lack of food and freezing weather, the Nokoni went to Fort Cobb and there surrendered.
