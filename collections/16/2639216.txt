The first Legoland was built adjacent to the Lego factory that was founded by Ole Kirk Christiansen in 1949. His son, Godtfred, took over the family business in 1957 when his father died and just two years later he bought out his three brothers. In 1968 Godtfred decided to open a 14-acre Legoland Park to promote his toy business. The park became an instant success and has over the years added many original rides. The now 45-acre park is divided into nine themed areas, including Duplo Land, Imagination Zone, LEGOREDO Town, Adventure Land, Lego City, Knight's Kingdom, Mini Land, Pirate Land, and Polar Land.
