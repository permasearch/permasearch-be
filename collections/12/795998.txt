Merchant ships have used false flags as a tactic to evade enemy warships since antiquity, and examples can be found from as early as the Roman era through to the Middle Ages.[20] Following the American Revolutionary War, merchantmen flying the flag of the fledgling United States quickly found it offered little protection against attack by Barbary pirates - many responded by seeking to transfer their registry back to Great Britain. The use of false flags was frequently used by the British during the Napoleonic Wars and the United States during the War of 1812.[2] During the mid-19th century, slave ships flew various flags to avoid being searched by British anti-slavery fleets.[21] However, the modern practice of registering ships in foreign countries to gain economic advantage originated in the United States in the era of World War I, and the term "flag of convenience" came into use in the 1950s.[22]
