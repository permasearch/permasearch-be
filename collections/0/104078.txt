A crossover between the two series was announced in July 2014, after Barry Allen had been introduced in Arrow's second season ahead of the debut of The Flash. By the following September, the scripts for each episode had been written, with filming occurring shortly before the end of the month and into October 2014. The crossover sees every main cast member of each series who appear at least in their own series, with additional actors and characters also reprising their Arrowverse roles.
