A radiation zone, radiative zone or radiative region is a layer of a star's interior where energy is primarily transported toward the exterior by means of radiative diffusion and thermal conduction, rather than by convection.[1] Energy travels through the radiation zone in the form of electromagnetic radiation as photons.
