In Canada, PC products are generally sold only at Loblaw-owned or affiliated stores. One notable exception is President's Choice beer, which in Ontario is also sold at The Beer Store and the LCBO's retail stores (and was only available at those retailers until 2015 due to since-changed provincial laws on the sale of alcohol).
