The film's costume designer Sophie De Rakoff bonded with Witherspoon over Dolly Parton.[16] De Rakoff said that Elle's iconic pink suit in the film "was all organic and intuitive. I designed costumes for Elle Woods that moved the story forward and fitted the moment. Reese and I actually went to visit a sorority house in the early prep, and it was just obvious that pink should be her signature color."[16]
