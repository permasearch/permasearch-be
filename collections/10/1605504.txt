After defeating all the opponents, the player learns that the mysterious girl is in fact Labrys and General Teddie is Labrys' Shadow in disguise, who attempts to kill the real Labrys. In her storyline, it is revealed that she was forced to fight other models of her series at the Kirijo Ergonomics lab, but grew close to one of her sisters, only to be forced to destroy her too. As a result, she eventually escaped the lab, but was later recaptured and sealed away. After being abducted from Mitsuru's plane, she was tossed into the TV world, and subsequently brainwashed into thinking that she was human, as her dungeon in the TV World took the form of Yasogami High and she adopted a false personality based on that of an unknown girl in her memories while her Shadow, created by her desire to be understood and accepted as a normal girl and her trauma over being forced to kill her fellow Anti-Shadow Weapons, created the tournament to make others feel what she felt. Upon Shadow Labrys's defeat, Labrys accepts her Shadow, which turns into the Persona Ariadne.[46]
