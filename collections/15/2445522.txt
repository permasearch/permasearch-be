The submarine is a five-foot-long, 12-inches-wide sealed tube weighting about 90 pounds. The hull was made from an already built liquid oxygen transfer tube for the company's Falcon 9 rocket. With no propulsion of its own, it was intended to be pulled by two divers through the cave system, having 4 handles and four attachments for oxygen tanks.[156] The head of the device is a cone that protects the air lines point of attachment and might guide the hull in the narrow passages of the cave. The rear hatch is an transparent acrylic disc that would allow divers to see the occupant.
