Paterno has the most wins in FBS football and in college sports (409). As a result of the Penn State child sex abuse scandal involving longtime assistant Jerry Sandusky,[34] Paterno was fired in November 2011,[34][35] and all of the team's wins from 1998â€“2011 were forfeited. Paterno's statue outside Beaver Stadium was also taken down.[36] Defensive coordinator Tom Bradley finished out the 2011 season as interim head coach after Paterno's ouster.[37] The lost wins dropped Paterno from first to twelfth on the all-time wins list,[38] but on January 16, 2015, the NCAA restored Paterno's vacated wins, again making him the winningest FBS football coach.[39]
