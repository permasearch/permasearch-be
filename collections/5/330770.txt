Maeve McDermott and Patrick Ryan of USA Today included "Send My Love (To Your New Lover)" in their list of 2015's 50 best songs. McDermott wrote "this song is among the most interesting of her career" and likened it to the works of Elizabeth Fraser.[30] Complex's Michael Arceneaux thought that the track was the least sad song on 25, and added: "It’s a little melancholy, but it comes with some shimmy-inducing production."[31] Business Insider's Tony Manfred noted that the song strays from Adele's earlier work, writing "she wades into the waters of contemporary pop music like never before".[32] Nick Messitte of Forbes gave the song a positive review, writing: "It’s got the grace of damning individuals without sinking to their level; it boasts nostalgia—not the least of which for a sound popularized in 2013," and felt that Adele did not let Max Martin overpower her sensibilities.[33] Vanity Fair's Josh Duboff called "Send My Love (To Your New Lover)" "the poppiest song Adele has ever recorded" and named it his "pick for the breakout track on 25".[34]
