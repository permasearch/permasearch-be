Revealing news of the track's release, Rock Sound writer Andy Biddulph described "Happy Song" as "absolutely massive",[8] and in a review of That's the Spirit later dubbed it "epic, thunderous and skyscraping in equal measure".[29] Gigwise's Andrew Trendell also dubbed the song "massive", describing it as "a monolothic [sic] slab of rock â€“ and a promising sign of things to come".[30] Music Feeds writer Emmy Mack described the song as "a monstrous new rock anthem", comparing it to the music of Royal Blood by dubbing it "a throbbing, chugging rock belter".[31] AllMusic's James Christopher Monger selected "Happy Song" as the highlight from That's the Spirit, describing it as "auspicious" and "fevered".[32]
