There are zoology observations that certain animals emulate a push up action. Most notably various taxa of the fence lizard exhibit this display,[43] primarily involving the male engaging in postures to attract females. The western fence lizard is a particular species that also engages in this behavior.[44] (It may be noted that in Mexican Spanish push-ups are called "lagartijas", which means "lizards".)
