The plant fibres used for pulp are composed mostly of cellulose and hemi-cellulose, which have a tendency to form molecular linkages between fibres in the presence of water.  After the water evaporates the fibres remain bonded.  It is not necessary to add additional binders for most paper grades, although both wet and dry strength additives may be added.
