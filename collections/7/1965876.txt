In 1966, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops (NCCB) asked James T. McHugh to begin observing trends in abortion reform.[3] The National Right to Life Committee was founded in 1967, as the Right to Life League to coordinate its state campaigns under the auspices of the NCCB.[1][4] To appeal to a more broad-based, nonsectarian movement, key Minnesota leaders proposed an organizational model that would separate the NRLC from the direct oversight of the NCCB and by early 1973 NRLC Director James T. McHugh and his executive assistant, Michael Taylor, proposed a different plan, facilitating the NRLC move toward its independence from the Catholic Church.
