Between 1984 and 1995, the Roosters reached the semi-finals once,[15] and became known to critics as the "transit lounge", due to the high frequency of player purchases and releases.[7][28] The club came close to reaching the premiership in 1987 under coach and favourite son Arthur Beetson, being defeated by eventual premiers Manly in a "bruising" major semi-final, 10â€“6.[29]
