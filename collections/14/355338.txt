Women's hockey was largely unaffected by this realignment. The Big Ten still has only four members with varsity women's hockey, with six teams required under conference bylaws for official sponsorship. As a result, the only changes in women's hockey affiliations in the 2010â€“14 period occurred in College Hockey America, which saw two schools drop the sport and three new members join.
