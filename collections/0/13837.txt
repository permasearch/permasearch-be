The Governor Edmund G. Brown California Aqueduct is a system of canals, tunnels, and pipelines that conveys water collected from the Sierra Nevada Mountains and valleys of Northern and Central California to Southern California.[2] Named after California Governor Edmund Gerald "Pat" Brown Sr., the over 400-mile (640Â km) aqueduct is the principal feature of the California State Water Project.
