An evil Sirenix fairy and one of the nine nymphs of Town Hall, as Daphne. Politea and Daphne had fought against the Ancestral Witches to protect the Magic Dimension and the Infinite Ocean, but she betrayed Daphne to the Ancestral Witches and they placed a curse on Sirenix which turned Daphne into a bodiless spirit and Politea into a dragon-like monster who resided in a shark-shaped cave in the Infinite Ocean. Darcy and Stormy stole Politea's evil Sirenix abilities and she simply faded from reality.
