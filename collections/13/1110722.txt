Initially, civet coffee beans were picked from wild civet excrement found around coffee plantations. This unusual process contributed to its rarity and subsequently, its high price. More recently, growing numbers of intensive civet "farms" have been established and operated across Southeast Asia, confining tens of thousands of animals to live in battery cages and be force-fed.[29][30][31] Concerns were raised over the safety of civet coffee after evidence suggested that the SARS virus originated from palm civets.[32][33]
