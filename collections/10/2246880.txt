c  2     {\displaystyle c_{2}}   is called the director circle (related to focus      F  2     {\displaystyle F_{2}}  ) of the hyperbola. In order to get the left branch of the hyperbola, one has to use the director circle related to      F  1     {\displaystyle F_{1}}  . This property should not be confused with the definition of a hyperbola with help of a directrix (line) below.
