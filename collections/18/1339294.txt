In addition to its antibiotic function, polymyxin B has been used to clear endotoxin contamination in reagents. Polymyxin B is also used to induce envelope stress in order to study the organisms response to such stress. Polymyxin envelope stress assays such as this have been used for the study of sRNA responses in Salmonella enterica.[3]
