By default Robocopy outputs to the screen (or optionally to a log file) all the directories it encounters (in alphabetical order). Each directory is preceded by the number of files in that directory that fulfill the criteria for being copied. If the directory does not yet exist in the target, it is marked "New Dir". But if the directory is empty and the /E option is not used, or it contains no files meeting the criteria, a new directory should not actually be created.
