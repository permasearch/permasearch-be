Glyndwr Michael (4 January 1909 â€“ 24 January 1943)[1] was a homeless man whose body was used in Operation Mincemeat, the successful Second World War deception plan that lured German forces to Greece prior to the Allied invasion of Sicily. The invasion was a success, with Allied losses numbering several thousand fewer than would have been expected had the deception failed.
