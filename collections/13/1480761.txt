Inspired by the decision made concerning the Moran Market in 2016, protesters gathered at Gupo Market in Busan in February 2017 calling for the closure of the dog meat vendors.[12] The Gupo Market is of similar size to the Moran Market and has been around since the Joseon Dynasty. In the recent decades, the number of dog meat vendors in the market has decreased to only 22 vendors due to the efforts of the government trying to improve the image of the city for tourists.[12] As of now, there have been no official statements by the local government involving plans to remove the dog meat vendors.
