On March 28, 2017, a second trailer debuted after screening at CinemaCon 2017 the night before.[187] Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com, noted that the new Justice League trailer had received more Twitter mentions in that week but there was "clearer enthusiasm for Spider-Man". The Homecoming trailer was second for the week of March 20–26 in new conversations (85,859) behind Justice League (201,267), according comScore's PreAct service, which is "a tracking service utilizing social data to create context of the ever-evolving role of digital communication on feature films".[188] An exclusive clip from the film was seen during the 2017 MTV Movie & TV Awards.[189] On May 24, Sony and Marvel released a third domestic and international trailer.[190] Ethan Anderton of /Film enjoyed both trailers, stating Homecoming "has the potential to be the best Spider-Man movie yet. Having the webslinger as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe just feels right".[191] TechCrunch's Darrell Etherington agreed, saying, "You may have feelings about a tech-heavy Spider-Man suit or other aspects of this interpretation of the character, but it’s still shaping up to be better than any Spider-Man depicted in movies in recent memory."[192] Ana Dumaraog for ScreenRant said the second trailer "arguably showed too much of the movie’s overarching narrative", but the third "perfectly shows the right amount of new and old footage". She also appreciated the attention to detail that Watts and the writers put into the film, as highlighted by the trailers.[193] Siddhant Adlakha of Birth.Movies.Death also felt the trailers were giving away too many details,[194] but enjoyed them overall, especially the "vlogging" aspect.[195] Collider's Dave Trombore expressed similar sentiments to Adlakha.[196] After the trailers' release, comScore and its PreAct service noted Homecoming was the top film for new social media conversations, that week and the week of May 29.[197][198]
