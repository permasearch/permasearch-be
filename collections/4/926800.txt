Bob Blake, an actuary from Vancouver, British Columbia, appeared on Jeopardy in September 1989, won five games (which until 2003, contestants were retired after five appearances), and broke Chuck Forrest's then five day record with $82,501. Because Bob's winnings were higher than the then-limit of $75,000, $7,501 of his winnings were donated to his selected charity, Oxfam.[23] He also competed in Super Jeopardy![24] in which he was a Semi-Finalist. He was also the winner of the 1990 Tournament of Champions winning him in the process $100,000.[25] He also competed in the Ultimate Tournament of Champions in 2005. He was initially invited to compete in the Battle of the Decades tournament but declined because of conflicts with international travel.
