I added some translations using a spreadsheet. Some proberbs have a synonym, such as "even monkey drops from trees" and "even kappa (an imaginary animal living in rivers) fails to swim." There are also proverbs with opposite meanings. For example, "give things a try" and "if you don't touch god you don't get in trouble." I think it's a good idea to mention them but if we do that the current format would be too cloudy. -- Duckie
