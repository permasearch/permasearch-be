Many other sources have found to contain cobalamin but are insufficiently tested to establish whether B12 is bioavailable in humans or whether it is an inactive B12 analogue. Besides certain fermented foods,[50][51] there are few known plant, fungus or algae sources of biologically active B12, with none tested in human trials.[34][needs update] Examples include tempeh (B12 content up to 8 µg per 100 grams) and certain species of mushrooms (up to 3 µg per 100 grams).[52] Many algae are rich in vitamin B12, with some species, such as Porphyra yezoensis,[52] containing as much cobalamin as liver.[53]
