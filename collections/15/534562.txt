The Rasunda Stadium was expanded from 38,000 for the World Cup by building end stands.[9] Organising committee chairman Holger Bergérus mortgaged his house to pay for this.[9] The new Malmö Stadion was built for the World Cup, replacing the 1896 Malmö Stadion at a new site[10] The Idrottsparken had 4,709 seats added for the World Cup. The Social Democratic municipal government refused to pay for this until the organisers threatened to select Folkungavallen in Linköping instead.[11] At the Rimnersvallen, a stand from the smaller Oddevallen stadium was moved to Rimnersvallen for the World Cup. The crowd at Brazil v. Austria was estimated at 21,000, with more looking in from the adjoining hillside.[9] The most used stadium was the Rasunda Stadium in Stockholm, which hosted 8 matches including the final, followed by the Ullevi Stadium in Gothenburg (the biggest stadium used during the tournament), which hosted 7 matches.
