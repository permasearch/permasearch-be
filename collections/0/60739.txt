The word "violin" was first used in English in 1570s.[6] The word "violin" comes "from Italian violino, [a] diminutive of viola". The term "viola" comes from the expression for "tenor violin," 1797, from Italian viola, from Old ProvenÃ§al viola, [which came from] Medieval Latin vitula", a term which means "stringed instrument," perhaps [coming] from Vitula, Roman goddess of joy..., or from related Latin verb vitulari "to exult, be joyful.""[7] The related term Viola da gamba means "bass viol" (1724) is from Italian, literally "a viola for the leg" (i.e. to hold between the legs)."[7] A violin is the "modern form of the smaller, medieval viola da braccio."[6]
