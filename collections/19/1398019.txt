In San Joaquin County, Interstate 580 splits off from I-5 at a point south of Tracy, providing a spur-route connection to the San Francisco Bay Area. From here, I-5 intersects SR 132, a major route east to the mountains, as well as the northern end of SR 33. After passing Tracy, I-5 intersects I-205, a connector route to I-580, before intersecting the SR 120 freeway in the Manteca city limits. After passing through Lathrop, I-5 heads due north through Stockton, interchanging with the SR 4 freeway that provides access to downtown Stockton. I-5 passes through the western portion of the Lodi city limits before intersecting SR 12 and entering Sacramento County.[20]
