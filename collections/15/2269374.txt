With the completion of the first road into the mountains in this region, Lake City served as a supply center for the many miners and prospectors flooding into the area.  As a supply center, the town  boomed to as many as 3,000 to 5,000 settlers.  But as the first-discovered deposits were found to be only moderately productive and no new extensive or rich deposits of minerals were found, by 1879 the boom had subsided.  With the arrival of the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad in 1889,  Lake City saw a second upturn in the economy that lasted into the 1890s.  The railroad cut the cost of shipping gold and silver ores to smelters, reduced the cost of shipping supplies into Lake City, and  provided shipment of cattle and sheep into the area for summer grazing in the high Alpine meadows.
