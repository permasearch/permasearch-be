Adult body sizes vary between 50 and 85 mm in length and 29 and 42 mm in width,[6] though male Hercules beetles may reach up to 175 mm in length (including the horn),[4] making them the longest species of beetle in the world.[2] The size of this horn is naturally very variable; more so than any variation of the size of legs, wings, or overall body size in the species. This variability results from developmental mechanisms that couple genetic predisposition with nutrition, stress, exposure to parasites, and/or physiological conditions.[7]
