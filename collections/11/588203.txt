After two-and-a-half years, Anelka returned to the Premier League in December 2001 to join Liverpool on a short-term loan deal until the end of the season. He contributed to Liverpool's late push to come second in the league, scoring goals against Everton,[50] Fulham,[51] Blackburn Rovers,[52] Ipswich Town,[53] and in the FA Cup against Birmingham City,[54] but manager GÃ©rard Houllier opted not to offer him a permanent deal after the end of the season in favour of signing Senegalese forward El Hadji Diouf.[55]
