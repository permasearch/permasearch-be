Zone defenses are common in international, college, and youth competition. In the National Basketball Association, zone defenses were prohibited until the 2001â€“2002 season, and most teams do not use them as a primary defensive strategy. The NBA has a defensive three-second violation rule, which makes it more difficult for teams to play zone, since such defenses usually position a player in the middle of the key to stop penetration.[1] The Dallas Mavericks under coach Rick Carlisle are an example of an NBA team that have regularly used zone defenses.
