On 14 August 1996, Garay filed a complaint for her dismissal and on 14 September 1998, NLRC Labor Arbiter Eduardo Carpio rendered judgment. He ruled that there was no material and direct evidence to show that the employee took the collections. NLRC ordered AMA to immediately reinstate her to her former or substantially equal position and pay her backwages computed in the amount of P300,000.00 (1 July 1996 to 31 December 1998 = 30 months. P10,000.00 x 30 months = P300,000.00), moral damages of PhP 100,000.00 and exemplary damages of PhP 50,000.00.
