From 1945 to 1972, Mecklenburg County sterilized 403 people who were in the care of county facilities, far more than any other county in North Carolina. This was the result of a so-called "science" of genetic engineering called eugenics, based on mistaken ideas about the transmission of favorable characteristics through reproduction. Preventing certain populations from reproducing - those (generally poor and minority) then classified as feeble-minded, criminal, etc. was seen as beneficial for society. By this time, the eugenics movement had been discredited in most other parts of the United States.[7]
