Governance of the states is divided between the federal and the state governments, with different powers reserved for each, and the Federal government has direct administration of the federal territories.[87] Lower-level administration is carried out by local authorities, which include city councils, district councils, and municipal councils, although autonomous statutory bodies can be created by the federal and state governments to deal with certain tasks.[88] The federal constitution puts local authorities outside of the federal territories under the exclusive jurisdictions of the state government,[89] although in practice the federal government has intervened in the affairs of state local governments.[90] There are 144 local authorities, consisting of 11 city councils, 33 municipal councils, and 97 district councils.[91]
