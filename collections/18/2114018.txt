Within four years of the Battle of Hastings, England had been completely subjugated by the Normans.[2] William I of England established a series of lordships, allocated to his most powerful warriors along the Welsh border, the boundaries fixed only to the east.[59] This frontier region, and any English-held lordships in Wales, became known as Marchia Wallie, the Welsh Marches, in which the Marcher Lords were subject to neither English nor Welsh law.[60] The area of the March varied as the fortunes of the Marcher Lords and the Welsh princes ebbed and flowed.[61] The March of Wales, which existed for over 450 years, was abolished under the Acts of Union in 1536.[62]
