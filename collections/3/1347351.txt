Reconstruction of the social behaviour of extinct fossil species is difficult, but their social structure is likely to be comparable to that of modern apes, given the average difference in body size between males and females (sexual dimorphism). The degree of sexual dimorphism between males and females of A. afarensis is considerably debated. Some propose that males were substantially larger than females. If observations on the relationship between sexual dimorphism and social group structure from modern great apes are applied to A. afarensis, then these creatures most likely lived in small family groups containing a single dominant male and a number of breeding females.[31] Other studies have shown there could have been substantial overlap between males and females in size.[32] This, along with the reduction of the canine teeth, has been argued to suggest A. afarensis males and females were monogamous.[33] Males may have engaged in provisioning behavior, and the need for carrying may have led to the evolution of bipedalism.
