One of the first scientists to describe and attempt to quantify the spreading of monolayer films on the surface of a liquid was Benjamin Franklin.  Franklin described the spreading of a drop of oil onto the surface of a lake to form a surface of defined area.  In addition he did experiments dropping oil onto the surface of a bowl of water and noted that the spreading action was dependent on the surface area of the liquid, i.e. by increasing the surface of the liquid it will take more drops to create a film on the surface.  Franklin suggested that this spreading action was based on repulsive forces between oil molecules.[7] Much later this work was continued by Lord Rayleigh, who suggested that the spreading of oil on water resulted in a monolayer of oil molecules.[8]
