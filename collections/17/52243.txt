The German version, with the introduction of the badger (or other beasts) was an expansion on a more simple tradition that if the weather was sunny and clear on Candlemas Day people expected winter to continue.[43] The simpler version is summarized in the English (Scots dialect) couplet that runs "If Candlemas is fair and clear / There'll be twa winters in the year",[l][m] with equivalent phrases in French and German.[35] And the existence of a corresponding Latin couplet has been suggested as evidence of the great antiquity of this tradition.[n][35]
