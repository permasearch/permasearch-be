The concept of PII has become prevalent as information technology and the Internet have made it easier to collect PII leading to a profitable market in collecting and reselling PII. PII can also be exploited by criminals to stalk or steal the identity of a person, or to aid in the planning of criminal acts.[7] As a response to these threats, many website privacy policies specifically address the gathering of PII,[citation needed] and lawmakers[who?] have enacted a series of legislation[which?] to limit the distribution and accessibility of PII.[citation needed]
