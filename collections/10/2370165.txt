In the New Testament, the Throne of God is talked about in several forms.[2]  Including Heaven as the Throne of God, The Throne of David, The Throne of Glory, The Throne of Grace and many more.[2] The New Testament continues Jewish identification of heaven itself as the "throne of God",[3] but also locates the throne of God as "in heaven" and having a secondary seat at the Right Hand of God for the Session of Christ.[4]
