In 1999, Otto was cast as Ã‰owyn in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, after Uma Thurman turned down the role.[16] Director Peter Jackson cast her immediately after viewing the audition video she had filmed in Australia.[17] For the role, Otto spent six weeks learning stunt choreography and horseback riding.[18] Otto's character was introduced in the trilogy's second film The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers in 2002 and appeared in the third film, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, the following year. The Lord of the Rings trilogy was a critical and financial success, and the third film won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 2004.[19] Otto's performance earned her an Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films nomination for Best Supporting Actress.
