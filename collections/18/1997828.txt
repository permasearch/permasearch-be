Jerome Valeska is the son of Haly's Circus performer and snake dancer Lila Valeska, who is found brutally murdered, a case which is investigated by Detective Jim Gordon. Jerome at first appears to be an innocent, polite young man, and seems devastated by his mother's death. Gordon later brings him into interrogation, where he reveals that he knows Jerome is responsible for her death. Gordon also brings in Jerome's long-lost father, blind fortune teller Paul Cicero, who is one of many men that Lila had a fling with. Having been caught, Jerome shows his true colors when he says he killed his mother for being "a nagging, drunken whore" and starts laughing maniacally.
