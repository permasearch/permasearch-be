The effort to improve treatment of HIV/AIDS was damaged by the attitude of many figures in the government, including President Mbeki. The then health minister, Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, advocated a diet of garlic, olive oil and lemon to cure the disease.[47] Although many scientists and political figures called for her removal, she was not removed from office until Mbeki himself was removed from office.[48] These policies led to the deaths of over 300,000 South Africans.[49]
