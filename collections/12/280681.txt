The 1975 FA Cup version – which contains the original lyrics, and features vocals from the team's then-current players – is always played before home games, with the home crowd joining in and carrying the song on after the music stops at the verse line "Fortune's always hiding".[147] Bubbles was published as a waltz whereas during the game the crowd sing it in common time.[147][148]
