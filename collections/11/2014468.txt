Manoj Paramahamsa was signed in on as the film's director of photography.[57] The makers announced that Kona Venkat would pen the dialogues and co-write the film's script along with Gopimohan while Vaitla himself would pen the film's screenplay.[58] Anirudh walked out of the project in late March 2015 and was subsequently replaced by S. Thaman who collaborated with Vaitla for Dookudu (2011), Baadshah (2013) and Aagadu (2014).[59] Thaman confirmed the same through his Twitter page later.[60]
