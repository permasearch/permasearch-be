Beginning with the 2017 football season, Tiger Stadium added the "Skyline Club".  This open air seating located atop the south end zone upper deck is home to a 1,500 seat "beer garden".  Purchase of a ticket in the Skyline Club includes admission to the seating area, admission to a self-serve food buffet, and the ability to purchase beer and wine.[21]  The 2018 football season saw the appearance of an additional "beer garden" called "The Chute".  This new beer drinking area is located below the south endzone bleachers.  It is limited to 1,500 patrons at a time.  Fans entering The Chute must be at least 21 years of age, and pay a $20 admission fee that includes two complimentary beers.  Additional beers must be purchased separately.  The Chute has a large screen television set for watching the game, as well as a seating area consisting of tables and chairs[22].
