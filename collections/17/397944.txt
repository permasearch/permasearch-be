On Larry King Live, March 6, 2001, Larry King asked psychic Sylvia Browne if she would take the challenge and she agreed.[19] Randi appeared with Browne again on Larry King Live on September 3, 2001, and she again accepted the challenge.[20] However, she refused to be tested and Randi kept a clock on his website recording the number of weeks that had passed since Browne accepted the challenge without following through. Eventually the clock was replaced with text stating that "over 5 years" had passed.[21] Browne died in 2013.
