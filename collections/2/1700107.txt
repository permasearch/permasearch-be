As Cinefantastique reveals, veteran "midget actor Billy Barty plays Gwildor, an innocent locksmith/inventor thrown into the adventure when an invention he creates inadvertently gives Skeletor his power."[3] Thus, Gwildor's role in the movie is key to the central plot. He is introduced into the film when rescued by He-Man from Skeletor's soldiers. He then explains how he was tricked by Skeletor's sidekick Evil-Lyn into giving his prize creation The Cosmic Key to the forces of evil, and thus allowing them to enter Castle Grayskull and take over Eternia. As the unwitting cause of Grayskull's defeat, Gwildor endeavors to help He-Man overcome Skeletor by using a prototype Cosmic Key. When the heroes find themselves overwhelmed by Skeletor's army, Gwildor uses the Cosmic Key to help them escape, and the heroes are transported to Earth, leaving Gwildor faced with the task of finding the correct programming on the Key to transport them back before Skeletor gains the power of the universe.
