The British relief of Kimberley and Ladysmith in February 1900 marked the turning of the war against the Boers.[209] Morale plummeted among the commandos over the following months, with many burghers simply going home; Kruger toured the front in response and asserted that any man who deserted in this time of need should be shot.[210] He had hoped for large numbers of Cape Afrikaners to rally to the republican cause, but only small bands did so,[210] along with a few thousand foreign volunteers (principally Dutchmen, Germans and Scandinavians).[211] When British troops entered Bloemfontein on 13 March 1900 Reitz and others urged Kruger to destroy the gold mines, but he refused on the grounds that this would obstruct rehabilitation after the war.[212] Mafeking was relieved two months later and on 30 May Lord Roberts took Johannesburg.[213] Kruger left Pretoria on 29 May, travelling by train to Machadodorp,[214] and on 2 June the government abandoned the capital. Roberts entered three days later.[213]
