The first USB flash drive appeared on the market in late 2000, providing a storage capacity of 8 MB.[30][31] Later, the maximum available storage capacity gradually doubled (16 MB, 32 MB, etc.)[32][33] all the way up to reaching capacities of 512 GB[34] and 1 TB[35] by January 2013. As of January 2013[update], drives of up to 512 gigabytes (GB) were available.[36] A one-terabyte (TB) drive was unveiled at the 2013 Consumer Electronics Show and became available later that year.[37] As of July 2016, flash drives with anywhere from 8 to 256 GB are frequently sold, and less frequently 512 GB and 1 TB units.[1][2] At the 2017 International Consumer Electronics Show a 2 TB flash drive was announced.[38]
