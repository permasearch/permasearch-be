As they get onto the elevator, Lester stops the elevator door at the last second and enters. He demands that Malvo recognize him, saying the "new Lester" will not let things slide as easily. Malvo tells him to stop talking, and he stares Lester down and asks if this is what he wants. Lester is confused and Malvo repeats the question, asking "Yes or no?". Lester says yes, and Malvo shoots Burt, Louise, and Jemma in the head. He tells Lester that their deaths are on him. As they continue to ride the elevator, Malvo explains that he had been working Burt for six months in order to get to his brother, who apparently has a $100,000 bounty which has now gone to waste. The elevator arrives at a service floor and Malvo asks Lester to help move the bodies to the dumpster. Instead, Lester hits Malvo with his award and runs away. Malvo, smiling, watches Lester run away and says that he'll see him soon.
