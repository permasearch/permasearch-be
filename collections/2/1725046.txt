Roberts has been compared and contrasted to other court members by commentators.[61][62] Although Roberts is identified as having a conservative judicial philosophy, his vote in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius to uphold the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) caused the press to contrast him with the Rehnquist court. Roberts is seen as having a more moderate conservative orientation, particularly when Bush v. Gore is compared to Roberts' vote for the ACA.[63] Roberts' judicial philosophy is seen as more moderate and conciliatory than Antonin Scalia's and Clarence Thomas'.[61][62][63] He wishes more consensus from the Court.[61] Roberts' voting pattern is most closely aligned to Samuel Alito's.[64]
