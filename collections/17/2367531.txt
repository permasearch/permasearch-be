During the pre-show, Cesaro and Tyson Kidd faced The New Day (Big E and Kofi Kingston). Kingston and Big E were in control for most of the match until Cesaro executed a European uppercut on Kingston (from the outside) and Kidd executed a fisherman's neckbreaker on Kingston to secure a decisive victory.
