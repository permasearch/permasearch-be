AllMusic reviewer Mark Deming called the album a "polished, heartfelt set of contemporary pop" with the group's "most accessible work to date."[9] Reviewing the album for Newsday, Glenn Gamboa called it the group's "best album yet", complete with "strong pop hooks and pristine production."[12] Gamboa noted that the band was continually improving their "sound, making everything catchier and harder-hitting."[12] Marcus Clark of SoSoActive called the "over produced pop" backing tracks "decent but I just can't [enjoy] it."[10] Referring to the album as "pop garbage with no kind of appeal", he was unsure why the album was as popular as it was.[10]
