Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant.[3] Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, useful for detecting predators, while those with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate distances when hunting.[4] The American woodcock probably has the largest visual field of any bird, 360° in the horizontal plane, and 180° in the vertical plane.[5]
