The Tor network maintains a public list of approximately 3000 relays; almost all of them all blocked.[152] In addition to the public relays, Tor maintains so-called bridges which are non-public relays.[154] Their purpose is to help censored users reach the Tor network. The Great Firewall is dynamically blocking these bridges by looking for their TLS fingerprint.[152][155] According to Winter's research paper published in April 2012, this blocking technique can be circumvented by using packet fragmentation or the Tor obfsproxy bundle in combination with private obfsproxy bridges.[146][152]
