Carly, Sam, Freddie, and Gibby are invited to Nora Dershlitt's parole hearing. As victims of her crime, the iCarlys have a say in whether or not Nora should be released from prison. They decide to let them release her, and after Nora and her mother invite the iCarlys to their house for a Norwegian supper, the iCarlys become on friendly terms with Nora once again. However, when Spencer comes to pick them up, Nora's mother locks him in the basement on a spin wheel which is controlled by a special remote. Nora and her mother trap the iCarlys in their house and refuse to let them leave. Nora says that her birthday party will go on "forever, and ever, and ever..." Gibby, while trying to escape for help, gets stuck in the chimney and finds himself pelted by tennis balls from kids who do not understand his requests for help. The next morning, Nora's dad returns from his camping trip and becomes part of the scandal. Meanwhile, T-Bo is kicked out of the Benson's apartment after Mrs. Benson finds out who the real T-Bo is. When Carly and Sam use Spencer's shock pen to short-circuit Freddie's head computer chip, Mrs. Benson gets an emergency notification on Freddie's "tracking device" saying that he is in trouble. Mrs. Benson and T-Bo rush over to Nora's house on T-Bo's motorcycle and crash through the front door. Carly then tries to get Spencer's remote from Nora, but then orders Sam to retrieve the remote from Nora. Sam easily gets the remote and T-Bo kicks down the basement door to allow Carly to rescue Spencer. T-Bo fights Nora's dad, while Mrs. Benson uses her fencing talents to defeat Nora and her mother. Sam uses Spencer's shock pen to zap the Dershlits unconscious. They beat up Nora and her parents, and they wind up going to prison forever. In gratitude for his help rescuing Freddie, Mrs. Benson decides to let T-Bo stay with them permanently. At the end of the episode, Gibby is still lodged in the chimney.
