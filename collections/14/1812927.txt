The most commonly observed sundials are those in which the shadow-casting style is fixed in position and aligned with the Earth's rotational axis, being oriented with true North and South, and making an angle with the horizontal equal to the geographical latitude.  This axis is aligned with the celestial poles, which is closely, but not perfectly, aligned with the (present) pole star Polaris.  For illustration, the celestial axis points vertically at the true North Pole, where it points horizontally on the equator.  At Jaipur, home of the world's largest sundial, gnomons are raised 26Â°55" above horizontal, reflecting the local latitude.[20]
