Most of the critics had praised Leighton Meester, Ed Westwick and guest star Mädchen Amick for their performances. Kona Gallagher, from Television Blend, enjoyed the "new multidimensional Chuck", and considered the episode a "pretty strong premiere".[9] Isabelle Carreau, from TV Squad, had praised Mädchen Amick's performance in the episode, saying she "was a good choice to play Catherine", and compared Chuck Bass with Christian Troy, a plastic surgeon portrayed by Julian McMahon in Nip/Tuck stating "he is a ladies' man who likes the idea of being with someone but can't commit".[10] Jacob, from Television Without Pity, praised Nate's storyline and Mädchen Amick's performances in the episode.[11] Michelle Graham of Film School Rejects praised the Nate's storyline, calling it a "blessing for him as his character has always been one of the least interesting". Graham was surprised with the transformation of Dan Humphrey and compared his character's dating habits with Chuck Bass, further adding that the change "is a nice way to flesh out an otherwise goody goody guy. Hopefully he won’t revert to [this] type with his reunion with Serena." Graham had high hopes for the premiere and considered the episode a "good start to the season, with plenty of threads to weave into a new storyline but sadly none of them are as scandalous as last year’s… Yet." On Jenny's character, Graham considered her storyline "predictable & dull, but there’s definitely something enjoyable in seeing her boss get dissed by a famous model."[12] BuzzSugar commended how the storylines were "tidied up" so fast.[13]
