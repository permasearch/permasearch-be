The ground is used heavily throughout the summer as the base of Lancashire County Cricket Club, with other home games being played at Stanley Park, Blackpool, Birkdale in Southport and at Aigburth in Liverpool. Until 2008, Old Trafford commonly hosted a Test match each year; none were hosted in 2009, 2011 or 2012 due to sub-standard facilities,[57][58] although following redevelopment, Old Trafford hosted an Ashes Test in 2013, and further Tests in 2014 and 2016.[59] One Day Internationals and/or International Twenty20s continue to be hosted every year.[59]
