Heidegger believed the Western world to be on a trajectory headed for total war,[61] and on the brink of profound nihilism[62] (the rejection of all religious and moral principles),[63] which would be the purest and highest revelation of Being itself,[64] offering a horrifying crossroads of either salvation or the end of metaphysics and modernity;[65] rendering the West a wasteland populated by tool-using brutes, characterized by an unprecedented ignorance and barbarism[66] in which everything is permitted.[67]
