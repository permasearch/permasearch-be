The Schoolhouse at Truxton Canyon Training School in Valentine operated from 1903-1937 as a mandatory boarding school in which Hualapai were separated from their families and put to work learning various trades.[7] Long a symbol of forced assimilation, the historic building is now the property of the Hualapai Nation.
