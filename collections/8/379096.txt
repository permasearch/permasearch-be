The seaboard colonial settlements gave priority to land ownership for individual farmers, and as the population grew they pushed westward for fresh farm land.[12] Unlike Britain, where a small number of landlords owned most of the good land, ownership in America was cheap, easy and widespread. Land ownership brought a degree of independence as well as a vote for local and provincial offices. The typical New England settlements were quite compact and smallâ€”under a square mile. Conflict with the Native Americans arose out of political issues, namely who would rule.[13] Early frontier areas east of the Appalachian Mountains included the Connecticut River valley,[14] and northern New England (which was a move to the north, not the west).[15]
