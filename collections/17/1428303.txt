In the "Ends of the Earth" storyline, all of Dr. Octopus' preparations come to fruition in a plan to conquer the world.[12] Doc activates a giant antenna array called the Octahedral which, in turn activates Earth-orbiting satellites he calls the Octavian Lens. The Lens works to speed up the greenhouse effect, which in turn heats up the Earth. Upon hacking into televisions around the world, Doc describes what his satellites are doing, and shuts them down. He says he can save the world "at a price".[13] At Palazzo Senatorio, an international gathering of world leaders and the planet's greatest minds meet to discuss Doc's supposed offer to save the world. The Avengers crash the assembly and Spider-Man captures Chameleon, who is at the meeting disguised as, of all people... Al Gore. Spider-Man lets Chameleon go, but he secretly places a Spider-Tracer on him, which allows Spidey and the Avengers to follow Chameleon to the Mediterranean Coast where the rest of the Sinister Six is waiting. The Six subdue the Avengers, leaving only Spider-Man standing. Spidey is taken down when trying to gain control of Doctor Octopus' tentacles with his helmet.[14]
