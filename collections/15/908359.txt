LARPs can have any genre, although many use themes and settings derived from genre fiction.[58] Some LARPs borrow a setting from an established work in another medium (e.g., The Lord of the Rings or the World of Darkness), while others use settings based on the real world or designed specifically for the LARP.[59] Proprietary campaign settings, together with rulesets, are often the principal creative asset of LARP groups and LARP publishers.
