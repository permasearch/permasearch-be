The PUDR was initially formed as the Delhi's unit of the People's Union for Civil Liberties and Democratic Rights (PUCLDR) in 1977, but the PUCLDR discontinued its activities after the Janata Party's success in the elections, while the PUDR continued to work. The national forum (PUCLDR) was later revived in 1980, but in a "new form" and with a new name, PUCL, creating a dichotomous bisection between civil liberties and democratic rights. Later in February 1981, the PUDR opted to function as a separate organisation.[2]
