Entering production with only minor changes from the Lincoln Navigator concept vehicle shown at the 2016 New York Auto Show (removing the gullwing doors and stair-style running boards, used largely for display purposes[35]). The 2018 Lincoln Navigator adopted several design features from the 2017 Lincoln Continental, including the style of its headlights, taillights, side vents, and its front fascia, with a large rectangular grille and a centered Lincoln star emblem. While sharing its roofline and side doors with the Ford Expedition, in the style of Range Rovers, the B,C, and D-pillars are blacked out for a "floating roof" effect.
