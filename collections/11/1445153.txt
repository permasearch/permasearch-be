The series premiered on 9 March 2001, on Channel 4. The contestants were recorded 24 hours a day[2] with cameras fixed around the house, and had to wear portable microphones. Channel 4 broadcast a daily highlights show, and from the second day on there was a live eviction show hosted by Davina McCall, where the evicted housemate was interviewed. In the nightly highlight episodes, viewers are shown various highlights of a specific day in the house. Due to the length of the series, the psychologists featured in the main series did not return for Celebrity Big Brother 1, but did continue to appear in the main series. The series ended on 16 March, lasting for a total of 8 days. Initially, Celebrity Big Brother was meant to be a one-time series, but due to the success it was later brought back as an annual event, airing while the main series was completed. Celebrity Big Brother 1 was the first season in the UK edition of Big Brother to feature a live premiere, something that would be used from Big Brother 3 onward.
