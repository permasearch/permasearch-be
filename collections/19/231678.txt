Nevada's state sales tax rate is 6.85%. Counties may impose additional rates via voter approval or through approval of the Legislature; therefore, the applicable sales tax will vary by county from 6.85% to 8.15% in Clark County. Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, imposes four separate county option taxes in addition to the statewide rate â€“ 0.25% for flood control, 0.50% for mass transit, 0.25% to fund the Southern Nevada Water Authority, and 0.30% for the addition of police officers in that county. In Washoe County (which includes Reno), the sales tax rate is 7.725%, due to county option rates for flood control, the ReTRAC train trench project, mass transit, and an additional county rate approved under the Local Government Tax Act of 1991.[129]
