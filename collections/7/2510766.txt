The symptoms of amphetamine psychosis include auditory and visual hallucinations, grandiosity,delusions of persecution, and delusions of reference concurrent with both clear consciousness and prominent extreme agitation.[6][7] A Japanese study of recovery from methamphetamine psychosis reported a 64% recovery rate within 10 days rising to an 82% recovery rate at 30 days after methamphetamine cessation.[8] However it has been suggested that around 5–15% of users fail to make a complete recovery in the long term.[9] Furthermore, even at a small dose, the psychosis can be quickly reestablished.[8] Psychosocial stress has been found to be an independent risk factor for psychosis relapse even without further substituted amphetamine use in certain cases.[10]
