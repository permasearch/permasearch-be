In 2010 Männerpartei (an Austrian Men's Rights collective) inaugurated International Men's Day in Austria after the liquidation of the 'Men's World Day' event in 2004 which left the country with no men's day celebration.[109][110] Männerpartei used the occasion to hold a workshop on father friendly social policy in Austria and to summarise progress for men and boys in the last twelve months, particularly in the area of law reform. The group also celebrated the first Children's Planet Award Gala and its focus on the Convention on the Rights of the Child adopted on 20 November 1989.[111]
