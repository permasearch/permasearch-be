In 2002, Paul Johnson departed Georgia Southern and was hired as the 37th Navy head football coach.[74] Johnson's initial season saw the Midshipmen win only two of 12 games,[75] though the season ended on a high note with his first victory over Army,[76] which would not beat Navy again until 2016.[77] Subsequently, Johnson's teams enjoyed a high degree of success.
