The Schleswig-Holstein Question became virulent in the context of the German unification during the 19th century. Following the Second Schleswig War, the terms of Treaty of Vienna (1864) gave Schleswig to Prussia, after 1866 as the Province of Schleswig-Holstein. Following the German defeat in World War I, the Schleswig plebiscites of 1920 resulted in a partition of Schleswig, establishing the current German-Danish border, effective in 1921. Denmark was under German occupation from 1940 to 1943.
