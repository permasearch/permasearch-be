As with all game animals in the United States, the hunting of raccoons is regulated by wildlife conservation officials in each state and seasons and bag limits will therefore vary. In Tennessee, for example, coon hunting season begins in mid-September and ends in February, with a bag limit of one raccoon per hunter per day,[27] while in Kentucky, it begins in October and ends on the last day of February, with no bag limit.[28] Some states, including Iowa, require a valid trapping or hunting license to train a coonhound to hunt.[29]
