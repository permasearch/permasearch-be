The No. 10 was originally the No. 35, the second car of Tommy Baldwin Racing in 2011. In August 2011, it was announced that Danica Patrick would jump to NASCAR competition full-time with sponsor Go Daddy, running a limited Sprint Cup Series schedule of 8-10 races in addition to a full-time Nationwide Series ride with JR Motorsports.[27] Stewart-Haas and TBR formed a partnership, with TBR fielding the number 10 (the number Patrick had used in her karting days) as a second full-time entry.[28] Patrick drove 10 races, with a best finish of 17th at Phoenix in November.
