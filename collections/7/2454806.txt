Trump support was high among working and middle-class white male voters with annual incomes of less than $50,000 and no college degree.[606] This group, particularly those with less than a high-school education, suffered a decline in their income in recent years.[607] According to The Washington Post, support for Trump is higher in areas with a higher mortality rate for middle-age white people.[608] A sample of interviews with more than 11,000 Republican-leaning respondents from August to December 2015 found that Trump at that time found his strongest support among Republicans in West Virginia, followed by New York, and then followed by six Southern states.[609]
