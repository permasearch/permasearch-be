Unlike many other solar projects in Africa that use concentrated solar power, solar plants will use PV technology to convert sunlight directly into electricity.[31] Installation of more than 630,000 solar PV modules began by the end of 2013, with electricity being generated early in 2014.[31] It is due to reach full capacity at the end of 2015.[31]
