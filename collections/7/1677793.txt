In November 2003, Fairbanks Capital Corp. and Fairbanks Capital Holding Corp. agreed to pay $40 million to settle with the FTC and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD),[1] which charged them with engaging in a number of unfair, deceptive, and illegal practices in the servicing of subprime mortgage loans. The Commission distributed the $40 million as redress to affected consumers. The settlement also imposed a number of specific limitations on Fairbanksâ€™s ability to charge fees and engage in certain practices when servicing mortgage loans. In early 2004, Fairbanks changed its name to Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. and SPS Holding Corp.
