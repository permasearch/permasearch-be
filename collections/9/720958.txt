Upon founding the label in 2012, Drake and 40 signed frequent collaborators Boi-1da, T-Minus, and later Mike Zombie (thus far the only signee to come outside of Canada) to the label as in-house producers.[4] In April 2013, it was reported that Drake was close to signing the label's first recording artist, PARTYNEXTDOOR, which he ended up revealing shortly thereafter.[5] In August 2013, Drake announced that he signed Toronto music duo Majid Jordan to OvO Sound.[6] OB O'Brien and iLoveMakonnen would soon sign in 2014, with the latter being the first non-Canadian act and second non-Canadian signee next to Mike Zombie. Makonnen would eventually leave OVO Sound in April 2016, wishing to pursue interest in sticking solely with Warner. Canadian rap artist Roy Woods, and R&B duo dvsn soon joined the label in 2015 and 2016, releasing an EP and studio album respectively. Plaza was announced as a new signing on OVO Sound Radio in 2017, followed by Baka Not Nice.[7][8][9][10]
