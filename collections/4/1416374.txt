Beginning in the Middle Ages and through the present day, the Baltic Sea appears on the maps described in Germanic languages as German: Ostsee, Danish: Østersøen, Dutch: Oostzee, Swedish: Östersjön, etc. In English "Ost" is "East", and in fact, the Baltic Sea mostly lies to the east of Germany, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. term was historically also used to refer to Baltic Dominions of The Swedish Empire (Swedish: Östersjöprovinserna) and, after, the Baltic governorates of Russian Empire (Russian: Остзейские губернии, translit. Ostzejskie gubernii).[4] The terms related to modern name "Baltic" appear in ancient texts, but had fallen in disuse untill reapearing as adjective "Baltisch" in German from which it was adopted in other languages.[5] During 19th century "Baltic" started to surpass "Ostsee" as the name for the region. Officially its Russian equivalent "Прибалтийский" was first used in 1859.[4] This process was a result of the Baltic German elite adopting terms derived from stem "Baltic" to refer to themselves.[5][6]
