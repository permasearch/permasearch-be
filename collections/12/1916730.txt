Old maid[1] is a Victorian card game for two or more players probably deriving from an ancient gambling game in which the loser pays for the drinks. It is known in Germany as Schwarzer Peter, in Sweden as Svarte Petter, in Norway as Svarteper, in Denmark as Sorteper, in Croatia as Crni Petar, in Slovenia as Črni Peter, in Hungary as Fekete Péter, in Czech Republic as Černý Petr, in Slovakia as Čierny Peter, in Finland as Musta Pekka (all meaning "Black Peter"), in Italy as Asino, in France as le pouilleux ("the lousy/louse-ridden one") or vieux garçon (literally "old boy", but a de facto pejorative for confirmed bachelor),[2] and in Japan as ババ抜き　(Babanuki). The game spawns an element of bluffing, commonly used in poker.
