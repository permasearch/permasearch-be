During 2004 and the beginning of 2005, Pinot noir became considerably more popular among consumers in the US, Australia, New Zealand and Asia as a result of the film Sideways,[33] and its deleterious effect on Merlot sales. Throughout the film, the main character speaks fondly of  Pinot Noir while denigrating Merlot.[34][35] Following the film's U.S. release in October 2004, Merlot sales dropped 2% while Pinot Noir sales increased 16% in the Western United States. A similar trend occurred in British wine outlets.[35][36][37][38][39][40] A 2009 study by Sonoma State University found that Sideways slowed the growth in Merlot sales volume and caused its price to fall, but the film's main effect on the wine industry was a rise in the sales volume and price of Pinot Noir and in overall wine consumption.[41] A 2014 study by Vineyard Financial Associates estimated that Sideways cost Merlot farmers over US$400m in lost revenue in the decade after its release.[42]
