Perhaps, an example of slight foreshadowing of her soon to be religious life, in the western The Virginian, Hart played a Catholic missionary, who against all warnings, risks her life to honor both her vows to God and her desire to continue her dead husband's work to help a community of poor and sick embattled Indian tribes in a 1963 episode entitled "The Mountain of the Sun". Hart's last role was with Hugh O'Brian in 1963's Come Fly with Me. At this point she had made up her mind to leave the film industry. The 24-year-old actress became a Roman Catholic nun at the Benedictine Abbey of Regina Laudis in Bethlehem, Connecticut. On a 1963 New York promotional stop for Come Fly with Me, she took a one-way car ride to the abbey in 1963 (not in a limousine as reported).
