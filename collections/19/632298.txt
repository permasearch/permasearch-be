In "Christmas Wishes", Andy dresses up as Santa for the office's annual Christmas party as an effort to makes everyone's holiday wish comes true. He also introduces Jessica, his new girlfriend to the office, much to the confusement and later drunken chagrin of Erin, who resents her. Erin drunkenly tells Andy that her Christmas wish is for Jessica to die, offending and angering Andy. He tells Erin to get over the fact that he turned her down for a date and storms off. Although when he suspects Erin is getting unusually close to Robert when he drives her home, he tails them to her apartment as Meredith's designated driver. But to his relief, he sees Robert hug Erin goodbye with comforting words and instructs her to take care of her hangover.
