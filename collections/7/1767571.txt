One of the members of the Varangian Guard was the future king Harald Sigurdsson III of Norway, known as Harald Hardr√•de ("Hard-ruler").[33] Having fled his homeland, Harald went first to Gardariki and then on to Constantinople, where he arrived in 1035. He participated in eighteen battles and during his service fought against Arabs in Anatolia and Sicily under General George Maniakes, as well as in southern Italy and Bulgaria. An extensive account of Harald Sigurdsson's journeys is found in Harald Sigurdsson's Saga.
