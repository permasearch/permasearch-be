After Congressional efforts to amend the Articles failed, numerous national leaders met in Philadelphia in 1787 to establish a new constitution. The new constitution was ratified in 1788, and the new Federal government of the United States began meeting in 1789, marking the end of the Critical Period. Some historians believe that the 1780s were a bleak, terrible time for Americans, while others believe the term "Critical Period" is an exaggeration that endorses the Federalist critiques of the Articles of Confederation.
