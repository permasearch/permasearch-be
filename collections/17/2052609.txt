Andrews announced in April 2015 that $1.5 billion would be allocated in the upcoming 2015/16 State Budget for the full cost of pre-construction works, geo technical drilling, land and property acquisition and detailed route investigations.[9] This is on top of a previously announced $300 million earlier in the year. Furthermore, some 150 bore holes will be drilled along the route across Melbourne to investigate soil and ground composition, including the Yarra River.[10]
