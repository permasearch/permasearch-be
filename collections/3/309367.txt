The International Monetary Fund, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis[60] and other sources, such as the Article IV Consultation Reports,[61] state that, at the end of 2014, the "general government gross debt"-to-GDP ratio for China was 41.44 percent.[62] With China's 2014 GDP being US$ 10,356.508 trillion,[62][63] this makes the government debt of China approximately US$ 4.3 trillion.
