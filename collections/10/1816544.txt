This research clearly displayed the cause and effect relationship between intracranial pressure and cerebral compression.[23]  Cushing noted this relationship in his subsequent publications. He also noted that there must exist a specific regulatory mechanism that increased blood pressure to a high enough point such that it did not create anemic conditions.[3] Cushing's publications contain his observations and no statistical analysis. The sample size of the experiment is also not known.[23]
