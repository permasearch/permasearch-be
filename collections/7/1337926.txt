The 5.4 L (5408 cc, 330 CID)[4] V8 is a member of the Modular engine family first introduced in the 1997 F-series pick-ups, in place of the 5.8L 351W. Bore diameter is 90.2 mm (3.552 in) and stroke is 105.8 mm (4.165 in), the increased stroke necessitated a taller 256 mm (10.079 in) engine block deck height. A 169.1 mm (6.658 in) connecting rod length is used to achieve a 1.60:1 rod to stroke ratio. The 5.4 L 2V was built at the Windsor Engine Plant, while the 5.4 L 3V moved production to the Essex Engine Plant beginning in 2003, then back to Windsor Engine Plant in 2009.[38] The SVT 5.4 L 4-valve engines are built at Romeo Engine Plant, hand assembled on the niche line.[39]
