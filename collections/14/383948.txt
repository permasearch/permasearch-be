In 2006, the US Open introduced instant replay reviews of line calls, using the Hawk-Eye computer system. It was the first Grand Slam tournament to use the system. According to many experts,[who?] the system was implemented because of a controversial quarterfinal match at the 2004 US Open[citation needed] between Serena Williams and Jennifer Capriati, where important line calls went against Williams.[32] Instant replay was available only on the Arthur Ashe Stadium and Louis Armstrong Stadium courts through the 2008 tournament. In 2009, it became available on the Grandstand court.[citation needed] Starting in 2018, all competition courts are outfitted with Hawk-Eye and all matches in the main draws (Mens and Womens Singles and Doubles) follow the same procedure- each player is allowed 3 incorrect challenges per set, with one more being allowed in a tiebreak.
