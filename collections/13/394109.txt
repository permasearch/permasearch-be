The ninth regulation game of the 2011 season for LSU found the number 1 nationally ranked Tigers against the second-ranked Alabama Crimson Tide in a match called "The Game of the Century"[23] or the "Matchup of the Year".[24] Both teams were undefeated and both were also coming off a bye week; viewed as important to the BCS Championship Game as the "inside track" by many of the sportswriters, the press built up the game in a Super Bowl-style atmosphere. Ultimately, the game came down to field position and a series of field goals as the top-ranked defenses of both teams prevented any touchdowns. Alabama missed three field goals and a fourth was blocked during regulation, leading to a 6–6 tie heading into overtime. On the first possession of overtime, Alabama again missed a field goal from 52 yards out, only to watch LSU earn the win on the next possession with a chip-shot field goal. As a result, it was the second-lowest scoring match-up between number 1 and number 2 teams in the history of the NCAA, with a 9–6 decision.[25] For the first time in BCS National Championship history, two SEC teams, number 1 LSU and number 2 Alabama again faced each other in the National Championship Game. Alabama won the game, 21–0. The SEC-only title game added impetus to the push for a national playoff system and hastened the death of the BCS system as implemented up to that time.[26]
