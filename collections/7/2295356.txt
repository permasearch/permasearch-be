PSG stars from the 1990s and 2000s eras such as Raí, Ronaldinho and Pauleta are associated with the blue-white-red-white-blue shirt. It was with the « Hechter shirt » that PSG reached five European semi-finals in a row (1993–1997), claimed the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1995–96, and achieved the (first) eight consecutive wins against Olympique de Marseille (2002–2004).[17]
