Vice Presidents who are appointed under the 25th amendment are sworn in before a Joint Session of Congress. This was only tested once, on December 6, 1973, when Gerald Ford was sworn in. First, the Speaker of the House certified that both houses had confirmed his nomination, and then Chief Justice Warren Burger gave him the oath of office. He was then introduced to both houses by the Speaker and gave his inaugural address.
