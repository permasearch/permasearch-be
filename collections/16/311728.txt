In 1997, Singapore's then-telecommunications regulator, Telecommunication Authority of Singapore (now Infocomm Media Authority of Singapore) enforced a legislation where telcos (Singtel, StarHub, M1, Circles.Life, MyRepublic, TPG Telecom and Zero1) are not allowed to SIM-lock devices, such as phones, tablets and smartwatches that are imported and sold in Singapore.[54][55] In August 1997, TAS warned at least one operator, M1, for selling SIM-locked phones.[56]
