He reappears in the second film of the series where he takes Jim to the hospital after Jim decides to turn on a porn film that Stifler rented, but accidentally uses superglue instead of lubricant to masturbate, permanently gluing his entire hand to his penis and boxer shorts. He then supports Jim after he learns that he won't be able to have sex for at least a whole week, the same amount of time before the party he is attending with Nadia, who he plans on sleeping with, will be held.
