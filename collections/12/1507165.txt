In 1981, Vanessa learned she had two months to live after being diagnosed with a terminal illness and she kept quiet about it. After learning she had a short time to live, Vanessa, who had kept mum for over two years about Lance being the father of Leslie's baby, wrote in a journal that Lance has a son. When Lance returned to town with his fiancÃ©e, he later ended his engagement and resumed his romance with Lorie. Vanessa then plotted to shove Lorie down a stairway, but changed her plan and made Lance back down from Lorie after lying that Lorie was still involved with Lucas. Vanessa applauded when Lance turned to Leslie. As Vanessa's illness deteriorated, she still plotted against Lorie and then forged a venomous letter to herself signing Lorie's name to it. Vanessa later plunged to her death off a balcony after staging a fight with Lorie.
