Other potential colonisers included the Portuguese Empire, which already controlled Portuguese Angola (modern day Angola) in West Africa and Portuguese Mozambique (modern day Mozambique) in East Africa, the German Empire, which controlled the area in Southern Africa which in 1884 would become German South West Africa (modern day Namibia), and further north, the Kingdom of Belgium, which controlled an area in Central Africa which in 1885 would become the Congo Free State (modern day Democratic Republic of the Congo), and the French Third Republic, which was in the process of conquering the Merina Kingdom (modern day Madagascar) and which was pursuing the areas which in 1895 and in 1910 would become French West Africa and French Equatorial Africa respectively.
