Downstairs, the church president tries to convince Stan's parents to allow their son to participate. He tells to Stan the great secret behind the church â€” a condensed version of the story of Xenu, based directly on the Scientology Operating Thetan III document,[3] and accompanied by an onscreen caption reading "This is what Scientologists actually believe". He then begs Stan to continue writing where "L. Ron" left off. Stan, impressed by the story, does so. He shows his writings to the Scientology president, who initially approves of the work, but when Stan says "to really be a church, you can't charge money to help", the president reveals to Stan that the church is in reality a global money-making scam. He asks that Stan continue with that in mind. Stan appears to agree and keeps writing.
