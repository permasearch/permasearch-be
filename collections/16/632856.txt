Exercise can trigger bronchoconstriction both in people with or without asthma.[104] It occurs in most people with asthma and up to 20% of people without asthma.[104] Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction is common in professional athletes. The highest rates are among cyclists (up to 45%), swimmers, and cross-country skiers.[105] While it may occur with any weather conditions, it is more common when it is dry and cold.[106] Inhaled beta2-agonists do not appear to improve athletic performance among those without asthma,[107] however, oral doses may improve endurance and strength.[108][109]
