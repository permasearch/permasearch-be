Reward sensitization is a process that causes an increase in the amount of reward (specifically, incentive salience[note 4]) that is assigned by the brain to a rewarding stimulus (e.g., a drug). In simple terms, when reward sensitization to a specific stimulus (e.g., a drug) occurs, an individual's "wanting" or desire for the stimulus itself and its associated cues increases.[76][75][77] Reward sensitization normally occurs following chronically high levels of exposure to the stimulus. Î”FosB (DeltaFosB) expression in D1-type medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens has been shown to directly and positively regulate reward sensitization involving drugs and natural rewards.[1][10][12]
