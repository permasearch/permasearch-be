Pavlovian-instrumental transfer occurs when a conditioned stimulus that has been associated with a rewarding or aversive stimulus via classical conditioning alters the performance of operant behavior. In a typical experiment, a rat is presented with sound-food pairings (classical conditioning). Separately, the rat learns to press a lever to get food (operant conditioning). Test sessions now show that the rat presses the lever faster in the presence of the sound than in silence, although the sound has never been associated with lever pressing.
