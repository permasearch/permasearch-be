The Shadowpact are summoned by the Phantom Stranger when the town of Riverrock, Wyoming is entrapped in a giant bubble of blood and endangered by "The Pentacle", a team of supervillains,[32] whose goal is to sacrifice the townspeople in order to summon the Sun King, an ancient rogue god from another dimension. Thirty-seven people perish before Shadowpact manage to defeat them; the Enchantress is able to tap into the magical powers of Strega, one of The Pentacle and destroy the bubble from within. She also kills one of The Pentacle, White Bunny, on the spur of the moment after he leaves them and frees Shadowpact.[33] Due to unexpected side effects of the magic spells needed to defeat the villains, the outside world believe that Shadowpact has been dead for a year, and they are honored with a team statue set inside a park in Metropolis.[34]
