In 2012, a green light was given by the independent company Red Granite Pictures allowing no restrictions to the content development. Scorsese knew that there were no limits to the content that he would produce and therefore came back on board, resulting in an R rating.[14] Red Granite Pictures also asked Paramount Pictures to distribute the film;[15] Paramount Pictures agreed to distribute the film in North America and Japan, but passed on the rest of the international market.[16]
