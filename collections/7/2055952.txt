In classical mechanics, Newton's second law (F = ma) is used to make a mathematical prediction as to what path a given physical system will take over time following a set of known initial conditions.  Solving this equation gives the position, and the momentum of the physical system as a function of the external force F on the system. Those two parameters are sufficient to describe its state at each time instant.  In quantum mechanics, the analogue of Newton's law is Schrödinger's equation for a quantum system (usually atoms, molecules, and subatomic particles whether free, bound, or localized). The equation is mathematically described as a linear partial differential equation, which describes the time-evolution of the system's wave function (also called a "state function").[3]:1–2
