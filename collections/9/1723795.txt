Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic Christians believe that this "pure sacrifice" as Christ's self-giving in love is made present in the sacrament of the Eucharist. In this tradition, bread and wine becomes the "Real Presence" (the literal carnal Body and Blood of the Risen Christ. Receiving the Eucharist is a central part of the religious life of Catholic and Orthodox Christians.[112][113] Most Protestant traditions do not share the belief in the Real Presence but otherwise are varied, for example, they may believe that in the bread and wine, Christ is present only spiritually, not in the sense of a change in substance (Methodism)[114] or that the bread and wine of communion are a merely symbolic reminder (Baptist).[115] Although early Christians in the Roman Empire were accused of being cannibals, theophages (Greek for "god eaters")[116] practices such as human sacrifice were abhorrent to them.[117]
