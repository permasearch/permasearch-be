Rivera, Hoffman, Lee Smith, Francisco Rodríguez, John Franco, and Billy Wagner are the only pitchers to have recorded 400 or more saves. Rollie Fingers was the first player to record 300 saves, reaching the mark on April 21, 1982. Craig Kimbrel is the most recent, achieving his 300th on May 5, 2018. In total, 29 players have recorded 300 or more saves in their career. Only six relievers – Dennis Eckersley, Fingers, Goose Gossage, Hoffman, Bruce Sutter, and Wilhelm – have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame;[9] all but Wilhelm are also members of the 300 saves club.[10]  Kimbrel, Fernando Rodney, and Rodríguez are the only members of the 300 save club who are still active players.  Of them, Rodríguez is the active leader in saves with 437.[11]
