"Cut to the Feeling" was written during the creation of Jepsen's third studio album, Emotion (2015), but was not included on the album because it was too "cinematic and theatrical". It was later intended for the album's follow-up EP, Emotion: Side B, but was then slated for release with Leap! after Jepsen signed on for the film and felt the song was fitting for the story.[1] "Cut to the Feeling" was included on the re-release of Emotion: Side B+ released exclusively in Japan on September 13, 2017. The track is one of two songs, along with "Runaways", that Jepsen contributed to the film.[2]
