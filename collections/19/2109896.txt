The tank is equipped with the "Integrated Battlefield Management System" (IBMS), named "Rebar", a digital communications system developed domestically by HIT and CARE (Centre for Advanced Research in Engineering).[35] It comprises a flat-screen display mounted inside the tank which communicates with those of other vehicles, including command posts such as the HIT Sakb.  It uses a data-link to facilitate secure communication of battlefield information between units, including tank video footage and information from unmanned aerial vehicles.[32]
