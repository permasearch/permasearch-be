Climbing is popular in Glacier Park. Due to the Lewis Overthrust Fault, the rock quality in Glacier is old and loose. Despite this, Glacier Park attracts many climbers. The seminal literature on climbing in Glacier Park, A Climber's Guide to Glacier National Park, was written by J. Gordon Edwards in 1961, with the latest edition published in 1995. Climbing has increased in popularity recently with the publication of the "Climb Glacier National Park" series, which provides detailed route descriptions for many major peaks around the park. [94] The Glacier Mountaineering Society sponsors climbing in Glacier Park, and issues awards for those climbers who summit all 10,000 foot peaks in the park or all 6 "Technical" peaks. [95]
