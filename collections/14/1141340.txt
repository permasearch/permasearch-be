On 14 July 1994, a virgin forest patch of Dhubri District of Assam was declared as a wildlife sanctuary by the gazette notification of the Assam government. This sanctuary has been named as "Chakrashila Wildlife Sanctuary". It is the youngest sanctuary of North East India having an area of 11,260.00 acres (45.5676Â km2). Chakrasila is unique because of the presence of golden langur (Presbytis geei) which is found nowhere else except along the Assam and Bhutan border. Besides, the virgin forest of Chakrasila Wildlife Sanctuary is endowed with rare specimens of trees, shrubs, medicinal plants, mammals, reptiles and birds and insects.
