The Pakistan Movement was led by a large and diversified group of people whose struggle ultimately resulted in the British Empire announcing the Indian Independence Act 1947, which created the independent dominions of India and Pakistan.[11][12] The Pakistan Movement was the result of a series of social, political, and intellectual transformations in Pakistani society, government, and ways of thinking.[13] Efforts and struggles of the Founding Fathers resulted in the creation of the democratic and independent government.[14] In the following years, another nationallyâ€“minded subset went on to established a strong government, followed by the military intervention in 1958.[15] Repression and an unbalanced economy caused an upheaval which led East Pakistan to declare independence as the People's Republic of Bangladesh in 1971.[16] After many concessions an agreement was reached in 1973 in which the new Constitution established a relatively strong government, institutions, national courts, a legislature that represented both states in the Senate and population in the National Assembly.[17][18] Pakistan's phase shift to republicanism, and the gradually increasing democracy, caused an upheaval of traditional social hierarchy and gave birth to the ethic that has formed a core of political values in Pakistan.[19]
