To detect coronary artery disease, Computed Tomography (CT) Scan is better than Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The sensitivity and specificity between CT and MRI were (97.2 percent and 87.4 percent) and (87.1 percent and 70.3 percent), respectively. Therefore, CT (mainly multislice CT) is more accepted, more widely available, more favored by patients, and more economic. Moreover, CT requires shorter breath-hold time than MRI.[3]
