John Wheelwright and Owen Meany both live in the fictional town of Gravesend, New Hampshire. The boys are close friends, despite the fact that John comes from a historical and wealthy family — as the illegitimate son of Tabitha Wheelwright — and Owen is the son of a working-class granite quarryman. John's earliest memories of Owen involve lifting him up in the air, which was easy due to his permanently small stature, in order to make him speak. A damaged larynx caused Owen to speak in a high-pitched voice at all times. During the course of his life, Owen develops the conviction that he is "God's instrument".
