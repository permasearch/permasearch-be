At the suggestion of the Mayor, the survivors escaped into the Cactus amusement park nearby. The park was still under construction. There was no food available. So they decided that they had no choice but to leave the town. But the Mayor was strongly opposed to this. They discovered dynamite in the prefabricated hut for construction workers. They made a plan to blow up the cactus in the town. The Mayor was again opposed to blow up cactus in the town. So they decided to blow the cactus outside the town. They tied dynamite to a vehicle called "Cactus Car", and from the nature of cactuses reacting to sound, the strategy was to take the cactus out of the town and blow them across the bridge. When the cactus followed the vehicle, a fruit of the cactus fell down. The tempted Mayor went to pick up the fruit but fell down and by mistake changed the direction of the vehicle. As a result, the vehicle blew up on the bridge itself. Thus, the only exit of the city was collapsed.
