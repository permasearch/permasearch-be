Current source inverters convert DC current into an AC current waveform. In applications requiring sinusoidal AC waveforms, magnitude, frequency, and phase should all be controlled. CSIs have high changes in current overtime, so capacitors are commonly employed on the AC side, while inductors are commonly employed on the DC side.[4] Due to the absence of freewheeling diodes, the power circuit is reduced in size and weight, and tends to be more reliable than VSIs.[5] Although single-phase topologies are possible, three-phase CSIs are more practical.
