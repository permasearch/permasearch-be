Carl's Stone Cold Lock of the Century of the Week used to appear on the SVP & Russillo show on ESPN radio in the 2:00 to 3:00 PM EST block every Friday during football season and is simulcast on ESPNEWS. Scott Van Pelt, one of the show's hosts, is a fan of Aqua Teen Hunger Force. However, the series now airs Fridays during the midnight version of SportsCenter (also hosted by Scott Van Pelt) on ESPN.
