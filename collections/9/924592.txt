Tadeusz was baptized by the Roman Catholic church and the Orthodox Church, thereby receiving the names Andrzej, Tadeusz, and Bonawentura.[13][14][15][16] His paternal family was ethnically Lithuanian–Ruthenian[11] and traced their ancestry to Konstanty Fiodorowicz Kostiuszko, a courtier of Polish King and Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund I the Old.[17] Kościuszko's maternal family, the Ratomskis, were also Ruthenian.[18]
