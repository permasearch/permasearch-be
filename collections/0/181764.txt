In the first episode of the series, It's a Fae, Fae, Fae, Fae World, Bo saved a young human woman named Kenzi from a rapist, and despite their differences the two quickly became friends. Confronted by the local Fae leaders with having to pick a clan, either "Light" or "Dark", Bo declared herself neutral, choosing to side with humans after Kenzi risked her life to find out where Bo had been forcefully taken and then helped Bo break free from a trance by calling out to her. Throughout the first season, Bo learns more about the Fae world and her supernatural nature, while searching for information about her origins. Along the way, Bo also develops romantic relationships with both Dyson, a Light Fae wolf-shapeshifter and police detective in the human police force; and Lauren, a human doctor and scientist in servitude to the Light Fae.
