The Korean Wave (Hangul: 한류; Hanja: 韓流; RR: Hallyu; MR: Hallyu,  listen (help·info), a neologism literally meaning "flow of Korea") is the increase in global popularity of South Korean culture since the 1990s.[2][3][4] First driven by the spread of K-dramas and K-pop across East, South and Southeast Asia during its initial stages, the Korean Wave evolved from a regional development into a global phenomenon, carried by the Internet and social media and the proliferation of K-pop music videos on YouTube.[5][6][7][8][9]
