Union Army records for the Civil War indicate that its troops fired about 1,000 rifle shots for each Confederate hit, causing General Burnside to lament his recruits: "Out of ten soldiers who are perfect in drill and the manual of arms, only one knows the purpose of the sights on his gun or can hit the broad side of a barn."[17][18][19] The generals attributed this to the use of volley tactics, devised for earlier, less accurate smoothbore muskets.[20][21]
