The red plastic cups are notably used in American college and university games such as beer pong and flip cup.[18][19] This usage is referenced in Toby Keith's 2011 country music song "Red Solo Cup".[20] The red party cup outsells the blue variety by a wide margin.[19] In part because of its cultural significance, many other manufacturers now procure similar looking red cups.
