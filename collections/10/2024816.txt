Ampicillin is distributed through most tissues, though it is concentrated in the liver and kidneys. It can also be found in the cerebrospinal fluid when the meninges become inflamed (such as, for example, meningitis).[23] Some ampicillin is metabolized by hydrolyzing the beta-lactam ring to penicilloic acid,[2] though most of it is excreted unchanged.[8] In the kidneys, it is filtered out mostly by tubular secretion; some also undergoes glomerular filtration, and the rest is excreted in the feces and bile.
