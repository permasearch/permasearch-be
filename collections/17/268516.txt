The public health care system of the Republic of Ireland is governed by the Health Act 2004,[86] which established a new body to be responsible for providing health and personal social services to everyone living in Ireland â€“ the Health Service Executive. The new national health service came into being officially on January 1, 2005; however the new structures are currently in the process of being established as the reform program continues. In addition to the public-sector, there is a large private health care market.
