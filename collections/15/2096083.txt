In September, 2011, Patrick discovered that there are members of Dan Nation that are bringing signs referencing Patrick to College Gameday, ESPN's college football pregame show. Although it's not an official segment of The Dan Patrick Show, Dan and Dan Nation mention Occupy Gameday (a parody of the Occupy movement) often throughout the radio show and Dan "doesn't encourage it, but celebrates this". ESPN has strengthened security to not allow any signs on Gameday referencing Patrick or the radio show, but fans still bring signs on Gameday. There is a current Facebook page for Occupy Gameday created by members of Dan Nation and as of November 11, 2011, Occupy Gameday is still ongoing each Saturday and some signs are currently hanging in the Mancave.
