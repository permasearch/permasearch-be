In addition, following OPAC's adoption the number of states restricting enlistment to adults aged over 18 has increased substantially, according to Child Soldiers International: from 83 in 2001 to 126 in 2016, which is 71 percent of countries with armed forces.[9] These include several states where child recruitment had been routine, including Colombia and Sierra Leone.[8] Approximately 60 non-state armed groups have also entered agreements to stop or scale back their use of children.[17]
