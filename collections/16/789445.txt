In Chapter 13 of Earl Hamilton’s (a contemporary price revolution theorist), American Treasure and the Price Revolution in Spain, Hamilton writes that after meticulous research into Spanish treatises, letters, and other relevant documents of the day, he found that no Spanish writer of the sixteenth century had voiced opinions similar to Bodin’s views. Unfortunately, this was not true. Less well known is an even earlier Spanish publication in a treatise from 1556 by the cleric Azpilcueta Navarra, of the Salamanca School, which made virtually the same claim about the role of Spanish-American silver in the rise of prices.[12] Azpilcueta Navarra, Jean Cherruyt de Malestroit, Jean Bodin, and early debate about the history of the price revolution in many was the reason historians, philosopher, and economist tried to formulate their own explanations to the price revolution.
