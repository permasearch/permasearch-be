Also, not all local Quaker meetings are entirely liberal or conservative and some have members adhering to different Quaker traditions, and a Quaker meeting can be affiliated with both liberal and conservative umbrella organizations. For instance, New York Yearly Meeting, which is mostly liberal, is affiliated with both the liberal Friends General Conference as well as the conservative Friends United Meeting, even though they adhere much more to the liberal teachings of Friends General Conference than the conservative teachings of Friends United Meeting.[109][110] Thus, at any given Quaker meeting, individual Quakers may have differing views on a wide variety of theological issues including original sin, with more conservative Quaker meetings having everyone believe in original sin while at more liberal Quaker meetings there is typically a variety of beliefs and usually a majority of people would not believe in original sin but a minority would believe in original sin.
