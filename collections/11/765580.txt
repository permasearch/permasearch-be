The Office of the Mayor is located in the historic / architectural landmark with signatory dome of the Baltimore City Hall (built 1867-1875), at 100 Holliday Street (between East Fayette and East Lexington Streets) facing City Hall / War Memorial Plaza and the War Memorial building, in downtown Baltimore. Recent incumbent Stephanie Rawlings-Blake (and former President and earlier youngest member of the Baltimore City Council), decided not to run for reelection. Maryland State Senator Catherine E. Pugh beat out previous Mayor Shelia Dixon, (who had been removed from office in 2010 for corruption after being convicted of theft of donated holiday gift cards) in the Democratic Party municipal primary election. She then defeated Republican Alan Walden and Green Party candidate Joshua Harris to become the 50th Mayor of Baltimore. She was sworn in on December 6, 2016.
