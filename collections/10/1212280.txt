The first Dr. Martens boots in the United Kingdom came out on 1 April 1960 (known as style 1460 and still in production today), with an eight-eyelet oxblood coloured smooth leather design.  Dr. Martens boots were made in their Cobbs Lane factory in Wollaston, Northamptonshire (which is still operating today).[6] In addition, a number of shoe manufacturers in the Northamptonshire area produced DMs under licence, as long as they passed quality standards. The boots were popular among workers such as postmen, police officers and factory workers. By the later 1960s, skinheads started to wear them, "dms" being the usual naming, and by the late 1970s, they were popular among scooter riders, punks, some new wave musicians, and members of other youth subcultures.[1] The shoes' popularity among skinheads led to the brand gaining an association with violence.[1] Alexei Sayle sang the song "Dr. Martens' Boots" in a 1982 episode  of the British TV comedy The Young Ones.
