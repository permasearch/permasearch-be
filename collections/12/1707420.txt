There are many variants of "yes" and "no" in English. Two such spoken forms are transcribed into writing as "uh-huh" or "mm-hmm" ("yes", with a rise in pitch on the second syllable) and "uh-uh" or "mm-mm" ("no", with a fall in pitch on the second syllable). Their sounds are a nasal or non-nasal sound interrupted by a voiceless breathy interval for "yes", and by a glottal stop for "no". These forms are particularly useful for speakers who are at a given time unable to articulate the actual words "yes" and "no".[45]
