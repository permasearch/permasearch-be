They rob Weis' personal vault and obtain a one-million-years capsule. Raymond chases them back to Dayton but is too late to stop them from distributing the stolen time. After chasing them to the city's outskirts, Raymond reveals that he came from Dayton and intends to stop other Daytoners escaping. He realizes too late that he forgot to collect his daily time allotment and times out. Will and Sylvia, each with just over a minute to live, race to Raymond's patrol car. Will collects Raymond's daily share and runs back to Sylvia in a scene reminiscent of his mother's death. This time, he saves her when her clock only has seconds left.
