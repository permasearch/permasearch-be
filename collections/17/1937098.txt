Hard soda is a relatively new category in the craft beer segment of the alcoholic beverage industry that gained prominence in the United States after the prosperity of the Not Your Father's Root Beer brand manufactured by Small Town Brewery based in Wauconda, Illinois.[2] A partnership between Small Town Brewery and Pabst Brewing Company led to a significant increase in sales, whereby distribution of the product in the U.S. was expanded and then later expanded to be nationwide in June 2015.[1] Small Town Brewery first began brewing the product in 2012,[1] and it has a 5.9% alcohol by volume content.[2] The company released a Hard Ginger Ale in September 2015, and has plans to market a Vanilla Cream Ale hard soda.[1] The company also plans on marketing a separate version of the Not Your Father's Root Beer brand with a higher alcohol content.[1] In January 2016, the Not Your Father's Root Beer brand was the market leader in the hard soda category.[3]
