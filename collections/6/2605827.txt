When bright red blood is vomited, it is termed hematemesis. Hematemesis, in contrast to coffee ground vomitus, suggests that upper gastrointestinal bleeding is more acute or more severe, or originates more proximally than the stomach (for example, in the esophagus due to a Mallory-Weiss tear). This condition may be a medical emergency and urgent care may be required.[1]
