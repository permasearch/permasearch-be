SV40 utilizes two different receptors to bind onto cell surface: ganglioside GM1 located in lipid rafts and major histocompatibility (MHC) class I molecule.[37][38] Binding of SV40 with MHC class I molecules triggers receptor clustering and redistribution. SV40 may recruit more caveolae from the cytoplasm or even new caveolae formed at the site of entry.[38] A cascade of virus-induced signaling events triggered by attachment results in caveolae-mediated endocytosis in about 20 min.[38] In some cell types the virus can enter the caveosomes directly from lipid rafts in non-coated vesicles.[38][39]
