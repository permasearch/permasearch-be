Through the seclusion era, Japanese goods remained a sought after luxury by European monarchs.[10] Japanese porcelain manufacturing began in the seventeenth century after the unearthing of kaolin clay near Nagasaki.[10] Japanese manufacturers were aware of the popularity of porcelain in Europe, therefore, some products were specifically produced for the Dutch trade.[10] Porcelain and lacquerware became the main exports from Japan to Europe.[11] Porcelain was used to decorate the homes of monarchs in the Baroque and Rococo style.[11] A popular way to display porcelain in a home was to create a porcelain room. Shelves would be placed throughout the room to display the exotic decorations.[11]
