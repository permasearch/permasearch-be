By the turn of the 20th century, many of the nation's wealthiest families were summering in Newport, including the Vanderbilts, Astors, and the Widener family, who constructed the largest "cottages", such as The Breakers (1895) and Miramar.[21]  They resided for a brief summer social season in grand, gilded mansions with elaborate receiving rooms, dining rooms, music rooms, and ballroomsâ€”but with few bedrooms, since the guests were expected to have "cottages" of their own.  Many of the homes were designed by New York architect Richard Morris Hunt, who kept a house in Newport himself.
