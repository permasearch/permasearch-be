The film is divided into three parts. The first takes place prior to the war. Cocky Philadelphia steel worker and "Man's man" Al Schmid (John Garfield) despises the idea of marriage and losing his independence until he meets his match in Ruth Hartley (Eleanor Parker). Ruth takes no nonsense from Al and impresses him by enjoying a hunting trip he takes her on. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Al joins the Marines. Before he departs on a train to join the war, Al proposes marriage to Ruth on the station platform.
