Under the administration of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iranâ€™s human rights record "has deteriorated markedly," according to Human Rights Watch,[6] and following the 2009 election protests there were reports of killing of demonstrators, the torture, rape and killing of detained protesters,[7][8] and the arrest and publicized mass trials of dozens of prominent opposition figures in which defendants "read confessions that bore every sign of being coerced."[9][10][11] In October 2012 the United Nations human rights office stated Iranian authorities had engaged in a "severe clampdown" on journalists and human rights advocates.[12]
