A new Methodist church was built in the community in 1910, which was used until 1988 and is still standing.[13] Two years later, a new two-room school replaced the old one-room school, which in turn was replaced by a modern school in the mid 1900s, all on the same property.[11] In 1939, the wooden trestle part of the railroad bridge across the Willamette caught fire and burned.[8] Boones Ferry was decommissioned after the Boone Bridge opened in 1954 carrying what was then the Baldock Freeway, and is today Interstate 5.[7]
