However, it would (of course) also be false to say that there is no rivalry at all between Germany and England; for one thing, the very fact that the English perceive it to be such cannot go unnoticed, for another, there is the long-standing quarrel about the "Wembley goal" (only somewhat silenced since a clear goal was not arwarded to the English in 2010). Germany vs. English matches, even friendlies, are always considered highly important sporting events (though of course, the tradition and usually the quality of both the teams may account for most of that), going so far that a popular radioplay series mocks people in love as "looking deep into each other's eyes even if a Germany vs. England match is on TV".[52] However, it is clear that any feeling of rivalry towards England, if existent, is entirely dwarfed by the German-Dutch rivalry.
