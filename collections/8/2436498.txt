Lee's first trial began on July 23, 1875, in Beaver, before a jury of eight Mormons and four non-Mormons.[28] This trial led to a hung jury on August 5, 1875. Lee's second trial began September 13, 1876, before an all-Mormon jury. The prosecution called Daniel Wells, Laban Morrill, Joel White, Samuel Knight, Samuel McMurdy, Nephi Johnson, and Jacob Hamblin.[29] Lee also stipulated, against advice of counsel, that the prosecution be allowed to re-use the depositions of Young and Smith from the previous trial.[30] Lee called no witnesses in his defense.[31] This time, Lee was convicted.
