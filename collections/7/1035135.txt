According to Crouch, many early writers on medieval chivalry cannot be trusted as historians, because they sometimes have "polemical purpose which colours their prose".[19] As for Kenelm Henry Digby and Leon Gautier, chivalry was a means to transform their corrupt and secular worlds.[20] Gautier also emphasized that chivalry originated from the Teutonic forests and brought up into civilization by the Catholic Church.[5] Charles Mills used chivalry "to demonstrate that the Regency gentleman was the ethical heir of a great moral estate, and to provide an inventory of its treasure".[20] Mills also stated that chivalry was a social, not a military phenomenon, with its key features: generosity, fidelity, liberality, and courtesy.[21]
