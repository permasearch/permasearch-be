In 1930, the two kingdoms of the Hejaz and Najd were united as the 'Kingdom of Saudi Arabia'.[18][22] Boundaries with Transjordan, Iraq, and Kuwait were established by a series of treaties negotiated in the 1920s, with two "neutral zones" created, one with Iraq and the other with Kuwait. The country's southern boundary with Yemen was partially defined by the 1934 Treaty of Ta'if, which ended a brief border war between the two states.[27]
