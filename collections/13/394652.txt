Magnus Bane is described as being of Asian descent, due to his human parent being half-Dutch, half-Indonesian. He is an inch or two taller than Alec and is said to be lean, but not skinny, with lightly muscled arms. He has brown skin and black, nearly shoulder-length hair that is usually styled and dyed. He wears all kinds of makeup, such as glitter around his eyes and blue lipstick, and in City of Glass is also noted to own more makeup tools and accessories than even Isabelle Lightwood. He likes to flaunt his bisexuality by wearing flashy and sometimes bizarre clothing. Isabelle once described him as a "sexy, sexy warlock", whereas Simon Lewis countered that Magnus "looks like a gay Sonic the Hedgehog and dresses like the Child Catcher from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang." He also has gold-green eyes with vertical cat-like pupils and no belly button, both of which serve as his warlock marks.
