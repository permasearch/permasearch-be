Chris Williams of Billboard said "with a vocal assist from Ne-Yo and a clever guest rap by Kanye West, it appears Hilson is intent on a knockout punch of her own."[5] Dan Nishimoto of Prefix Magazine said the song was one of the better radio-friendly tracks on the album.[6] Melinda Newman of HitFix said that "the mid-tempo track is undeniably catchy and will embed itself within your brain after only a few listens."[7] Sophie Bruce of BBC Music positively received the song, calling it the album's "biggest potential hit."[8] Although Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song three out of five stars, complimenting production by Danja, and saying that the song sounded like a more obvious hit than "Return the Favor", he complained that "getting two R&B A-listers to appear on your track should be a real coup, but not when one's got a more distinctive voice than you and the other steals the show with some typically ballsy rapping."[2] Quentin B. Huff of PopMatters criticized the repetitive hook, stating "Hook-wise, itâ€™s a little like listening to an album of kids chanting while playing double-dutch."[9] He also said that Hilson's vocals "show promise but fail to distinguish the Hilson brand from the crowd."[9]
