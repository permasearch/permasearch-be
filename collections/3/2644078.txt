The leaves of the pale swallowwort are larger when they are closer to the stem and decrease in size as they move away from the stem.[5] They are in the shape of an ellipse or an oval and contain smooth margins and major veins underneath.[5] The glossy, dark green leaves grow opposite on the stem and are ovate to elliptical. The flowers appear near the top of the plant and grow on stalks that come from the leaf axils.
