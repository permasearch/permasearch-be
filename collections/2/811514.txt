Since the first version of the plans, the three corridors mostly remained the same, but minor changes were introduced. These include the lack of stop at Lalaguda, or a stop at Lakdikapul instead of Secretariat. Also, the lines have been marked with several different combination of color.[38] Hi-Tec City to Raidurg, 1.5-kilometre stretch on Corridor Three - Nagole to Shilparmamam/Raidurg, is scheduled to be completed in November 2019, as it involves construction of 49 pillars and the Raidurg terminal station. Efforts are being made to complete the 8.5-km stretch from Ameerpet to Hi-Tec City by June 2018.[39]
