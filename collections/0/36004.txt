Like Jupiter and Saturn, Neptune's atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen, but it contains a higher proportion of "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane. However, its interior, like that of Uranus, is primarily composed of ices and rock,[12] which is why Uranus and Neptune are normally considered "ice giants" to emphasise this distinction.[13] Traces of methane in the outermost regions in part account for the planet's blue appearance.[14]
