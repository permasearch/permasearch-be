Baldwin chronicled his seven-year battle to remain a part of his daughter's life in his 2008 book, co-authored with Mark Tabb, A Promise to Ourselves: A Journey Through Fatherhood and Divorce.[59][60] Baldwin contends that after their separation in December 2000, his former wife, Kim Basinger, endeavored to deny him access to his daughter by refusing to discuss parenting,[61] blocking visitation,[62] not providing telephone access,[63] not following court orders,[64] not dropping their daughter off for reasons of convenience,[65] and directly lobbying the child.[66] He contends that she spent over $1.5 million in the effort.[67] Baldwin called this parental alienation syndrome.[68]
