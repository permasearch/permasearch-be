The adaptation has some differences from the novel as written by Christie. The setting is moved from the early 1950s to the late 1930s; accordingly, James Folliat – a war deserter in the novel – is here a wayward womaniser whom Mrs Folliat sends to South Africa, where he fakes his death in an aviation accident and returns to Nasse in the identity of Sir George Stubbs. Mrs Masterton becomes Mrs Warburton, Captain Warburton's wife; Marlene's sister, Marilyn, becomes an older sister named Gertie, but serves the same function as Marilyn in the novel; the characters of George the valet, Miss Lemon, the man in the turtle-printed shirt, and Marlene's parents are deleted. The adaptation slightly changes the end of the story to reveal the fate of the Folliats which was untold in the novel: as the police are digging up the folly foundations, Poirot is laying out the truth before Mrs Folliat; it ends with Mrs Folliat admonishing her son with two gunshots heard off-screen before the police can stop them. Poirot both acknowledges and approves of this murder-suicide with the final word of the episode: "Bon".
