The sixth game, Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator, reintroduces several animatronics from previous games that have suffered extensive damage and deterioration. The player discovers one animatronic at the end of each of the first four nights and must decide whether to salvage or discard it. These four are Springtrap, Molten Freddy (a ruined animatronic with a similar appearance to Funtime Freddy), Scrap Baby (similar to Circus Baby), and Lefty (what appears to be a recolored Toy Freddy). Any animatronics that the player attempts to salvage, or that have hidden themselves within other items purchased by the player, become a threat during all subsequent nights.
