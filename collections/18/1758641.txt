Fewer critics responded negatively to the season; Seattle Post-Intelligencer critic Melanie McFarland reacted very bitterly, stating "Three years off the air has not made the 'Family Guy' team that much more creative".[56] Critics of both PopMatters and IGN criticized the first few episodes but felt the show regained its humor after "Don't Make Me Over";[57][58] IGN's Mike Drucker commented "At that point, we get some amazingly creative humor. It's almost like MacFarlane and gang decided they had thanked their fans enough and could return to what made the show successful in the first place."[57] Media watchdog group the Parents Television Council, a frequent critic of the show, branded the episodes "North by North Quahog",[59] "The Father, the Son, and the Holy Fonz",[60] "Brian Sings and Swings",[61] "Patriot Games",[62] and "The Courtship of Stewie's Father" as "worst show of the week".[63]
