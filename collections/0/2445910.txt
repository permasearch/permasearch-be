A broader, southern extension of the Grand Prairie, found only in Texas; it is underlain by limestone rather than sandstone, and serves as a physiological and vegetational transition to the Edwards Plateau, which it borders to the south. All of Hamilton and Coryell counties, large parts of Bell, Lampasas, Mills, Erath, and Bosque counties, and smaller parts of Williamson, Burnet, Brown, Comanche, Hood, Somervell, and McClennan counties, including the towns of Killeen, Copperas Cove, and Lampasas as well as the Fort Hood Army base, fall within this region.[8] Among the few major roads that cross the Limestone Cut Plains are US 281 north to south and US 84 east to west.
