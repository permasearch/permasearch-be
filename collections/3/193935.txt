Dolly Parton once commented about the making of her version of the song: "When we were doing the Trio album, I asked Linda and Emmy what it meant, and they didn't know. So we called Neil Young, and he didn't know. We asked him, flat out, what it meant, and he said, 'Hell, I don't know. I just wrote it. It just depends on what I was taking at the time. I guess every verse has something different I'd taken.'"[2] The Trio version of the song was also released as a single, and while it received modest radio airplay, a video accompanying the song was very popular on a number of cable video outlets, including CMT.In 2017 The Detroits’Seatbelts' cover was made into a video by Torontos’ Greasy King.[3] William Patrick Corgan (formerly known as Billy Corgan and front man for The Smashing Pumpkins) performed a cover version of After The Gold Rush on the October 16, 2017 episode of The Howard Stern Show.
