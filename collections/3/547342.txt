It has been claimed that "only since the George H. W. Bush administration have Hispanic candidates received serious consideration from presidents in the selection process",[29] and that Emilio M. Garza (considered for the vacancy eventually given to Clarence Thomas[30]) was the first Hispanic judge for whom such an appointment was contemplated.[31] Subsequently, Bill Clinton was reported by several sources to have considered Jos√© A. Cabranes for a Supreme Court nomination on both occasions when a Court vacancy opened during the Clinton presidency.[32][33] The possibility of a Hispanic Justice returned during the George W. Bush Presidency, with various reports suggesting that Emilio Garza,[34] Alberto Gonzales,[35] and Consuelo M. Callahan[36] were under consideration for the vacancy left by the retirement of Sandra Day O'Connor. O'Connor's seat eventually went to Samuel Alito, however. Speculation about a Hispanic nomination arose again after the election of Barack Obama.[37] In 2009, Obama appointed Sonia Sotomayor, a woman of Puerto Rican descent, to be the first unequivocally Hispanic Justice.[38] Both the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials and the Hispanic National Bar Association count Sotomayor as the first Hispanic justice.[39][40]
