The Toronto Argonauts entered a period of transition off the field, with new ownership and a new stadium. The Argonauts were sold by politician/businessman David Braley to Bell Media and MLSE chairman Larry Tanenbaum.[22] At the start of the 2016 season the Argos moved to BMO Field after more than twenty seasons at the Rogers Centre (formerly called the SkyDome from 1989â€“2005).[23] Construction on New Mosaic Stadium for the Saskatchewan Roughriders was completed in October 2016[24] and the first game was played in the 2017 CFL season.[25]
