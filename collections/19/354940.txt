Entrepreneur (/ˌɒntrəprəˈnɜːr/ ( listen)), is a loanword from French. First used in 1723, today the term implies qualities of leadership, initiative, and innovation in new venture design. Economist Robert Reich has called team-building, leadership, and management ability essential qualities for the entrepreneur.[16][17] Historically the study of entrepreneurship reaches back to the work in the late 17th and early 18th centuries of Richard Cantillon, which was foundational to classical economics.
