In many strange versions, each of the (in the example) five people sitting around the other person uses only one or two of his or her fingers on each hand to do the weight lifting.  It is particularly easy to lift a heavy weight when it is evenly distributed amongst a group of four people.  The phenomenon of the weight seeming less on the second try around or after some sort of ritual is due to increased focus and the lifters being more in sync with one another.[3]
