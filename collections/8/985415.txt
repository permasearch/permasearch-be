Today's fields of interest among quantum optics researchers include parametric down-conversion, parametric oscillation, even shorter (attosecond) light pulses, use of quantum optics for quantum information, manipulation of single atoms, Boseâ€“Einstein condensates, their application, and how to manipulate them (a sub-field often called atom optics), and much more.
