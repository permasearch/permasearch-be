In many older encyclopedic sources, the name "panda" or "common panda" originally referred to the lesser-known red panda,[24] thus necessitating the inclusion of "giant" and "lesser/red" prefixes in front of the names. Even in 2013, the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica still used "giant panda" or "panda bear" for the bear,[25] and simply "panda" for the Ailuridae,[26] despite the popular usage of the word "panda".
