Despite his camp nature, he is just as fearsome and ruthless as his movie counterpart. Zurg is frequently mentioned to be the most evil villain in the galaxy and appears to possess authority over all other villains. In fact, he would appear to be a physical manifestation of pure evil. He is particularly proud of this and frequently brags of how "evil" he is. He is a parody of Darth Vader on Star Wars, Darkseid on DC Comics,[citation needed] Ming the Merciless on Flash Gordon, Megatron on Transformers, Doctor Doom on Marvel Comics as well as The Six Million Dollar Man.[citation needed]
