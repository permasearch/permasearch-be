The average frequency of marital sex reported by women was 2.8 times a week in the late teens, 2.2 times a week by age 30, and 1.0 times a week by age 50.[31] Kinsey estimated that approximately 50% of all married males had some extramarital experience at some time during their married lives.[32] Among the sample, 26% of females had extramarital sex by their forties. Between 1 in 6 and 1 in 10 females from age 26 to 50 were engaged in extramarital sex.[33] However, Kinsey classified couples who have lived together for at least a year as "married", inflating the statistics for extra-marital sex.[34][35]
