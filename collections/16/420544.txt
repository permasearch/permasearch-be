TSI varies in phase with the solar magnetic activity cycle[51] with an amplitude of about 0.1% around an average value of about 1361.5 W/m2[52] (the "solar constant"). Variations about the average of up to âˆ’0.3% are caused by large sunspot groups and of +0.05% by large faculae and the bright network on a 7-10-day timescale[53] (see TSI variation graphics).[54] Satellite-era TSI variations show small but detectable trends.[55][56]
