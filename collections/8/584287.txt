Having survived the assault, Thrax discreetly breaks into the hypothalamus gland and steals a DNA bead from a chromosome. Frank's temperature begins to rise. Ozzy, realizing that Thrax was still a threat, stops Drix from leaving and convinces him to help him finish the case. Thrax then kidnaps Leah and flees to the mouth to escape. As Frank is taken to the hospital in a fever induced coma, Ozzy and Drix give chase and save Leah but Thrax escapes by using pollen, causing Frank to sneeze and expelling Thrax from his body. With Drix's help, Ozzy pursues Thrax to the surface of Shane's right eye and her false eyelash. Thrax pins Ozzy down and threatens to kill Shane next, but gets stuck in the eyelash; Ozzy's pliable body allows him to escape as the eyelash slides off and lands in a glass of alcohol, dissolving Thrax.
