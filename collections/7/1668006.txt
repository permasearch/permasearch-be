Brad Lidge came into the game for the ninth inning, popping out Matsui and striking out Jeter before surrendering a two-out single to Damon—after a nine-pitch at bat with two strikes and four foul balls.[96][91] Then, with Teixeira batting, Damon stole second and, on the same play, also stole third as the base was uncovered due to a defensive shift against Teixeira.[97] Several news outlets referred to this as a "mad dash",[98][99] which Mike Vaccaro of the New York Post compared to Enos Slaughter's "Mad Dash" in the 1946 World Series.[100] Some believed that Damon's play caused Lidge to avoid throwing his best pitch—a slider with sharp downward movement—for the rest of the inning, as it risked a wild pitch that would have allowed Damon to score from third base.[101][102] Teixeira was then hit by a pitch and Rodriguez put the Yankees ahead with a double, scoring Damon.[91] Posada added to that lead with a single that scored Teixeira and Rodriguez, but was thrown out at second to end the inning.[91] Mariano Rivera entered in the bottom of the ninth and saved the game for the Yankees on eight pitches for his second save of the series.[91]
