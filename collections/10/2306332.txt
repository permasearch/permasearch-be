Benjamin felt "a little apprehensive" on her first day back filming with the serial, but settled back in after 20 minutes and enjoyed working with McFadden, Letitia Dean (Sharon Mitchell), Natalie Cassidy (Sonia Fowler), and Dean Gaffney (Robbie Jackson) again, which compared to "being with old friends". She teased "great" scenes between Lisa and Sharon, Phil and Sonia, opining that it is "reminiscent of historical stuff".[35] The actress also stated that she missed the workload associated with filming the serial and commented, "It was great to get my teeth back into doing what I do, really."[35] Benjamin developed "a really lovely connection" with Tilly Keeper, who portrays Louise Mitchell, and found her "marvellous" to work with, calling her a "professional". They had never met before working together on EastEnders.[35] The actress hoped her return has "a great impact" as she felt a "sense of responsibility" with portraying the storyline. She called the storyline dramatic and explained, "you'll see a lot of old Lisa being played out".[35]
