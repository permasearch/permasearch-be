When Goodman was 16, he joined one of Chicago's top bands, the Ben Pollack Orchestra, with which he made his first recordings in 1926.[10] When he was 17, his father was killed by a passing car after stepping off a streetcar.[13] His father's death was "the saddest thing that ever happened in our family," Goodman said.[14]
