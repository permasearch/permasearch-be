The third generation Eclipse utilized two distinct Mitsubishi engines: The SOHC 4G64 2.4 L 16-valve four-cylinder and SOHC 6G72 3.0 L 24-valve V6. Both engines use cast iron blocks with aluminum cylinder heads. The four-cylinder, found in the RS, GS and GS Spyder trims, used a 9:1 compression ratio and produced an output of 154 hp and 163 ft-lbs throughout all years.[13]
