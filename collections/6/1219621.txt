Moriarty's main inspiration for the story came from a radio interview she heard in which a woman recounted her parents' abusive relationship.[3] The woman narrated how, even as an adult, she hid under her bed to escape her parents' fighting, an experience Moriarty ended up using as a scene in the book.[3] Initially, the book was a first-person narrative from each of the three main characters, but Moriarty soon decided against it, instead interjecting minor characters' statements between portions of the story.[4]
