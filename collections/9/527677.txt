In modern drives, the small size of the magnetic regions creates the danger that their magnetic state might be lost because of thermal effects, thermally induced magnetic instability which is commonly known as the "superparamagnetic limit". To counter this, the platters are coated with two parallel magnetic layers, separated by a 3-atom layer of the non-magnetic element ruthenium, and the two layers are magnetized in opposite orientation, thus reinforcing each other.[43] Another technology used to overcome thermal effects to allow greater recording densities is perpendicular recording, first shipped in 2005,[44] and as of 2007 the technology was used in many HDDs.[45][46][47]
