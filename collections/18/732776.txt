MT6630 (2014) is a five-in-one combo wireless SoC integrating dual-band 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, advanced Wi-Fi Direct and Miracast support, Bluetooth 4.1, ANT+, tri-band GPS and FM transceiver. It is intended to be paired with chips like the MT6595 octa-core smartphone processor which features an integrated 4G modem but no built-in Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/GPS/FM functionality. It could also be used in tablets in conjunction with a stand-alone application processor.[42]
