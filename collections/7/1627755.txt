There is a list of high profile cases involving police officer shootings of unarmed persons that have not resulted in convictions of those officers even with video evidence provided from body cameras. This has caused activists and even some supporters of the new technology to doubt the overall effectiveness body cameras can have in court cases involving questionable actions on behalf of police officers. In the Ray Tensing and Walter Scott trials, which took place in Cincinnati and Charleston, the results for both shootings ended in a hung jury despite video evidence and alleged mishandling on the officersâ€™ account. Part of the reason why video evidence in general can be ineffective simply lies with the poor quality or angle of the video itself, as described in the Minnesota shooting of Philando Castile. Once footage was lost after Castile entered the back of the police car, only audio recording of the incident was available from that point on since the cameras did not cover the backseat. [96]
