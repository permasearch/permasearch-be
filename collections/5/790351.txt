Handbrake turns are often intentionally used in street racing and offroad rally racing to initiate rear wheel drift. In conditions near freezing where it is both wet and icy, the parking brake mechanics may freeze and be impossible to release until thawed.[5] If only using the "park" function on a transmission to hold the car parked, there is no freezing problem. The parking brake is also used to keep a parked manual transmission car from unintentionally moving when it is parked on a hill. Even though it is possible to keep a parked manual transmission car in place by putting it in gear in the opposite direction of the slope (e.g., if parking pointing downhill, put the car in "reverse"), the parking brake is still typically used, as if the engine were to lose compression, the car could roll forward. As a further precaution, some driving instructors tell students to point the wheels of hill-parked standard transmission cars towards the curb.
