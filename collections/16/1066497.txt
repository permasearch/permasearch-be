The Dark One's Dagger is a blade belonging to the Dark One's evolving victim, whose name is inscribed. It is also later revealed to be a broken half of the sword Excalibur. Anyone who wields the Dark One's Dagger can control the Dark One. A Dark One can cleave themselves of the Dagger's control and retain their powers, so long as they have the Sorcerer's hat when it aligns with the night sky, and the heart of someone who knew them before they became the Dark One. The only other way for a Dark One to survive, but lose their powers is to be kissed by their true love; however, this doesn't work in the Land Without Magic. The more evil deeds a Dark One performs, the more their heart blackens, until eventually, their original self vanishes and the Dark One is all they are.
