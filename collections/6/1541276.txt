Theo goes to retrieve their getaway vehicle but is knocked unconscious by Argyle, who has been trapped in the garage throughout the siege. A weary McClane finds Holly with Gruber and his remaining men, and knocks Kristoff unconscious. McClane surrenders his machine gun to spare Holly, but then distracts Gruber and Eddie, allowing him to grab a concealed pistol taped to his back. McClane shoots Gruber and then kills Eddie. Gruber crashes through a window but saves himself by grabbing onto Holly's wrist. McClane unclasps Holly's wristwatch, and Gruber falls to his death.
