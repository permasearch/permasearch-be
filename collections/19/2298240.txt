The group took its new name from a then popular designer brand of blue jeans (Trim), and added the L' prefix to give it a French feel. The song "Grab It!" became a local hit and was followed by an album of the same name. Later there was some controversy when JJ Fad released its hit "Supersonic" because some[who?] said it mirrored the cadence and style of "Grab It!" too closely.[1] Shortly after, "Cars with the Boom", an ode to subwoofers, reached #54 on the Billboard Hot 100[2] and a national tour followed. Atlantic Records picked up the group's first album and signed a deal to distribute L'Trimm's second album, Drop That Bottom, which included a remix of "Grab It!". The album was a minor success.
