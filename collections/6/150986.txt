With the onset of the industrial revolution, Indiana industry began to grow at an accelerated rate across the northern part of the state. With industrialization, workers developed labor unions and suffrage movements arose in relation to the progress of women.[31] The Indiana Gas Boom led to rapid industrialization during the late 19thÂ century by providing cheap fuel to the region.[32] In the early 20th century, Indiana developed into a strong manufacturing state with ties to the new auto industry.[24] Haynes-Apperson, the nation's first commercially successful auto company, operated in Kokomo until 1925. The construction of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the start of auto-related industries were also related to the auto industry boom.[33]
