South Koreaâ€™s defense ministry announced that North and South Korea initially agreed on the plans to reduce guard posts and equipment along the DMZ  on its border with DPRK. [244] The announcement comes after that Pyongyang has begun dismantling critical facilities at a satellite launching station in the accomplishment of a pledge by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the Singapore summit with President Trump.

Korea Vincent Brooks responded "I have some concerns about what that means militarily for the ability to defend along the Military Demarcation Line," However, he also maintained that the risk is "a reasonable degree" and the move represents an outstanding opportunity to reduce tensions on Korean DMZ.
