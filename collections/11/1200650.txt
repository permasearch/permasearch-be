In the United States, the first cargo of ice was sent from New York City to Charleston, South Carolina in 1799,[64] and by the first half of the 19th century, ice harvesting had become big business. Frederic Tudor, who became known as the "Ice King", worked on developing better insulation products for the long distance shipment of ice, especially to the tropics; this became known as the ice trade.
