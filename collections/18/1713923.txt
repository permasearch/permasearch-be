As of 2017[update], WGN America's programming slate relies primarily on a variety of reruns such as How I Met Your Mother, 30 Rock, Blue Bloods, M*A*S*H, Parks and Recreation, Law & Order, Elementary, Walker, Texas Ranger, In the Heat of the Night and Rules of Engagement. As is typical for cable networks, some of the shows airing on the channel are also available on other broadcast television stations throughout the United States; for much of its post-Syndex existence as a superstation, many of these programs were cleared by television syndication distributors for "full-signal" rights â€“ therefore allowing them to air on WGN America as they do not fall under syndication exclusivity regulations (for example, although How I Met Your Mother is syndicated to other television stations nationwide, including WGN-TV/Chicago, it is allowed to air on WGN America due to its clearance by 20th Television for "full-signal" carriage). However, in 2013, WGN America began to acquire exclusive cable rights to programs eligible for syndication, such as Person of Interest, as part of its shift towards a conventional cable network.[47]
