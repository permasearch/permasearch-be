Irving Du Bois (voiced by Jack McBrayer) is Phineas' and Ferb's self-proclaimed biggest fan. He always carries a scrapbook that he filled with images and souvenirs from Phineas and Ferb's big ideas as well as a strand of Ferb's hair.[32] Irving has an older brother Albert, who is self-nicknamed 'The Truth Detector.'
