Some riders fit their bikes with aerodynamic devices called fairings. These can reduce aerodynamic drag[10] and help keep the rider warmer and drier in cold and wet weather. Fairings are also available for upright bikes, but are much less common.  Fully enclosed bikes and trikes are considered velomobiles.
