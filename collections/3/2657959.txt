In addition to hydrocarbons, the stratosphere contains carbon monoxide, as well as traces of water vapor and carbon dioxide. The mixing ratio of carbon monoxide—3 × 10−8—is very similar to that of the hydrocarbons,[36] while the mixing ratios of carbon dioxide and water are about 10−11 and 8×10−9, respectively.[34][56] These three compounds are distributed relatively homogeneously in the stratosphere and are not confined to a narrow layer like hydrocarbons.[34][36]
