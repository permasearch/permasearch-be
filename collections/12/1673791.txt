The designation of Banff as a national park marked a turning point in the public's perception of the Bow River. The river was now viewed as something that not only had had an industrial and agricultural quality but an aesthetic value as well. The Canadian Pacific Railway, the company who lead the development of Banff, recognized this particularly well. When work began on a new luxury hotel in Banff in 1886â€“87, Van Horne personally redesigned and reoriented the plans so that the guests of the hotel would also be able to see the vista of the Bow River.[3]:275 Furthermore, in many early postcards from Banff, as well as still some current ones, the Bow River featured prominently.[3]:277
