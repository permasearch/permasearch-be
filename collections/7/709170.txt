Before 2005, 1998 was the last year to see above-average precipitation. Near record-setting snowpack in the mountains during the 2004 to 2005 season, as well as heavy spring rains, ended the drought nearly statewide. Heavy winter and spring rains caused flooding throughout the state. In late January, heavy rains overflowed the Santa Clara River in Washington County in the southwest corner of the state, destroying several homes in Ivins, Santa Clara, and Saint George, and essentially cutting off the small town of Gunlock. Heavy spring rains in late April caused widespread but minor flooding in northern Utah.
