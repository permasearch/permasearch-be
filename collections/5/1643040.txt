The sword used during the coronation of the kings of France is displayed at the Louvre museum with its 13th-century scabbard,[19] apart from the crown jewels. In the first part of the celebration, the king received the insignia of knighthood, consisting of spurs and the sword. Throughout the rest of the ceremony, the sword was entrusted to the "ConnÃ©table", who held it with the blade pointing upwards. The treasury of Saint-Denis possessed several medieval swords including the one of Saint Louis.  According to legend the coronation sword is "Joyeuse", [42] Charlemagne's sword.[20]  Its unusual build and ornamentation makes it difficult to date, but the parts probably date back from the 10th to 13th centuries.  Some believe it might be much older, even manufactured before Charlemagne's reign.
