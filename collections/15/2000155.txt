The first of the new area codes, 587, entered service in 2008 as an overlay for the entire province. As a preliminary step, optional ten-digit dialling was introduced across the province on 23 June 2008 and became mandatory on 12 September 2008. On 20 September 2008, Telus Mobility began allocating numbers starting with area code 587 in the Calgary area.[2] The alternative would have been splitting either 403 or 780--a step that would have resulted in portions of Alberta having to change their numbers for the second time in a decade. A similar step had been taken a year earlier in British Columbia, when area code 778 was converted into a province-wide overlay.
